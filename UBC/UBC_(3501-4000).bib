Abstract = {{With the increase of vehicles in city, unexpected abnormal events may
   occur on roads more frequently. It is necessary to disseminate abnormal
   traffic information to other vehicles in vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs). With traditional geocasting protocols, the considered target
   region is normally single and its range is fixed. However, when an
   abnormal event occurs, its impacted area may include multiple streets or
   roads and it may last for a long time. In this paper, for multiple
   target regions we propose a SmartGeocast information dissemination
   mechanism, which contains two procedures including geocasting
   initialization and geocasting maintenance. In the first procedure, the
   abnormal traffic information can be delivered to multiple regions
   quickly and efficiently through path sharing and path splitting schemes.
   Considering that new vehicles may continuously drive into the target
   regions, the abnormal traffic information have to be ``floating or
   visible{''} to them until the event impact gradually disappears. In the
   second procedure, it divides a small area in each target region for
   information dissemination to new arrived vehicles repeatedly, so as to
   furthermore reduce the message redundancy and maintenance cost.
   Experimental results show that the proposed SmartGeocast protocol can
   decrease the probability of receiving the repeated messages while try to
   avoid missing the important information.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated photoconductive (PC) sensor is introduced as an
   optoelectronic element for visible light optical wireless communications
   (OWC) links. The sensor applies the standard PC switch, being a biased
   metal-semiconductor-metal gap, in a three-fold-symmetric corner-cube
   architecture with a summed output photocurrent at the vertex. Such a
   form facilitates bidirectional retroreflective communications to meet
   fundamental OWC requirements for broad directional and broad spectral
   capabilities. The ultimate OWC capability, for ultrafast optoelectronic
   switching times, is studied here for material response and transit time
   response, and it is shown that ultrafast (picosecond) optoelectronic
   switching times can be achieved and the general device design
   consideration is discussed for emerging visible light OWC systems.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is a chronic disease, from which millions of people suffer. To
   effectively treat diabetes, daily cares such as diet control, physical
   activities, and glucose measurement should be taken as part of diabetes
   patients' daily routine. To alleviate patients from such tedious but
   crucial daily cares, we propose a machine-to-machine based diabetes
   lifestyle management system. Our system can permeate patients' daily
   life and provide contextual advices based on their current health
   conditions and the surrounding environments. The essence of the proposed
   system is an event-triggered rule evaluation mechanism, which provides a
   flexible and scalable framework for caring diabetes patients in various
   aspects of daily life. Moreover, the adoption of the sensor-based
   technologies makes our system require minimal user intervention. With
   the proposed system, patients can be alerted before doing something
   harmful for their treatment, even if they are unaware of it.
   Furthermore, constructive advices can be pushed to patients at the right
   time, helping them manage lifestyle in a healthy way.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the efficacy of a robust probing motion planning

   partially-closed loop strategy from stochastic MPC to incorporate the
   future measurement and increase the cautiousness of the control systems.
   More precisely, the proposed solution is composed of two controllers:
   one nominal MPC controller that guarantees the trajectory to be globally
   convergent and probing, and one ancillary MPC controller that stabilizes
   the robot around the nominal optimal trajectory. The feasibility and
   performance of the proposed algorithm have been demonstrated through
   extensive numerical simulation for a two-wheeled mobile robot.}},

   nanoinjection, with high refractive index spheres, to create
   high-intensity pump-probe beam interaction at a GaAs surface. This

   relaxation of hot electrons into and within the lower-mobility
   sidevalleys leaves the material in a relaxed low-conduction state. The
   experimental and theoretical study shows that ultrafast transient

   applications such as high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. Dynamic
   average-value modeling (AVMs) of power-electronic-based systems has
   evolved greatly during the past decades and is now commonly used for
   small-signal analysis and system-level transient simulation studies. In
   this paper, the AVM of the inverter side of an HVDC system is developed
   using the parametric average modeling methodology previously established
   for the diode bridge rectifiers. Contrary to the previous models from
   the same family, the proposed model is developed using a current-source
   AVM formulation which is better suited for modeling inverter. Accuracy
   of the new AVM is demonstrated by comparing with a detailed switch-level
   simulation of the system for two large-signal transient studies.}},

   detection and optimization circuits. The detection circuit utilizes an
   integrated dead-time detection diode which accurately detects body diode
   conduction of the synchronous MOSFET. The dead-time optimization circuit
   is an analog circuit which eliminates the major shortcoming of digital
   methods, specifically dead-time dithering in the steady state. Operation
   of the circuit is verified using PSIM. The results of the simulation
   show that the circuit reduces the body diode conduction time of the
   synchronous MOSFET to less than 4ns at 20A load, 12V input, 1.2V output
   and 500kHz switching frequency. As a result, the buck converter
   conduction losses can be reduced by 16.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) the acquired K-space data is
   corrupted by white Gaussian noise or by motion artifacts. In order to
   reduce the effects of these factors, it is a common practice to take
   multiple scans of the K-space. Noise/motion artifacts are reduced by
   averaging the K-space scans. For fully scanned K-space data, the image
   is obtained from this averaged K-space by applying the inverse Fourier
   transform. However, sampling the full K-space is time consuming. To
   reduce the scan-time smart reconstruction algorithms are employed obtain
   the MR image partial K-space scans. Generally Compressed Sensing (CS)
   based techniques are used to this end. In this work, we will show how
   the image can be reconstructed from multiple partial K-space scans by
   nuclear norm minimization. The reconstruction accuracy from our proposed
   method is the same as CS based techniques but is about ten times faster.}},

Abstract = {{Recently there has been an interest in a new classification model, where
   it is assumed that the training samples for a particular class form a
   linear basis for any new test sample belonging to that class. This
   assumption led to two successful classification methods called the
   Sparse Classifier (SC) and the Group Sparse Classifier (GSC). This work
   generalizes the previous linearity assumption and accounts for
   non-linear functional relationship between the training samples of a
   class and a new test sample belonging to that class. Such a
   generalization requires solving sparse/group-sparse optimization
   problems with non-linear constraints. We develop exact optimization
   based algorithms as well as approximate (fast) algorithms to solve such
   hitherto un-addressed optimization problem. Results show that
   significant improvement can be achieved by the proposed Non-Linear
   Sparse Classifiers compared to previous Sparse/Group Sparse Classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{We consider target localization in randomly deployed multi-hop wireless
   sensor networks, where messages originating from a source node are
   broadcast by flooding and the node-tonode message delays are
   characterized by random variables with a known probability distribution.
   Using asymptotic results from first-passage percolation theory and a
   maximum entropy argument, we formulate a stochastic jump process to
   approximate the hop count distribution of a message at a distance r from
   a source node. The resulting marginal distribution of the process has
   the form of a translated Poisson distribution which characterizes
   observations well and whose parameters can be learned, for example by
   maximum likelihood estimation. This result is important in Bayesian
   target localization, where mobile or stationary sinks of known positions
   use the hop count distribution conditioned on the Euclidean distance, to
   estimate the position of a sensor node within the network, based solely
   on observations of the hop count.}},

   examine the implementation of an FPGA platform for the processing of

   design changes that must be made to achieve a successful implementation.
   In doing so, we demonstrate that conventional accelerator architecture
   design choices that focus on throughput speedup, in isolation of system
   level IO bandwidth feasibility, cannot sustain their throughput levels
   as the input data set scales. This is shown to be primarily due to
   currently unavailable high-bandwidth large-scale data storage and
   retrieval for FPGAs. As a solution to this problem, we propose a general
   FPGA based IO infrastructure to utilize high bandwidth hard-drive
   storage options, as means to achieving sustained throughput in the face

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that cloud computing technologies will soon have
   substantial impact on a broad range of industrial sectors. For example,
   media content providers can use the advances in cloud computing
   technologies to exploit the excessive bandwidth and computing resources
   available at their data-centres. In cloud computing, resources can be
   seen as a utility or commodity. Thus, cloud computing creates the
   possibility for a media content provider to increase its monetary profit
   by offering (renting out) the idle resources at its data-center to users
   of other communities. Our contributions in this paper are two fold.
   Firstly, we introduce our innovative system design that enables the
   media content provider to exploit the excessive resources available at
   its data-centre using cloud computing. Secondly, we design admission
   control algorithm that selects the set of tasks to admit at the
   data-center such that the monetary profit is maximized; while ensuring
   that the demand for media streaming capacity by clients of the media
   content provider can be sustained at any instant of time with some level
   of confidence in probabilistic sense.}},

Abstract = {{Planet scale growth in deployment of mobile and interconnected devices
   interacting in a participatory sensing, collection and dissemination of
   information, have motivated interest in the Internet of Things.
   Therefore, the problem of information overload and big data becomes
   inherent. In this paper we intend to propose a methodology aiming at a
   lower processing overhead towards an energy efficient method for
   networking of information in larger systems. We consider a
   content-centric networking paradigm that is aimed at enhancing the
   dissemination of information and eliminating many problems of host based
   communication. The proposed method is based on a network coding approach
   which leverages the spectral characteristics of network topology. We
   argue that topology of interacting nodes within a cluster can influence
   the performance of network coding from a computational complexity
   perspective and therefore the overall energy consumption in a system. We
   propose an algorithm that takes an opportunistic strategy to utilize the
   social structure and spectral characteristics of the network topology
   based on our design of a multicast coding network that reduces the
   number of encoding nodes.}},

   microbiologist overcame their positivist training and deeply held
   disciplinary attitudes to engage with non-positivist qualitative
   methodology. Through a series of facilitated reflections they explored
   what helped and hindered their transition from positivist to
   non-positivist inquiry. To move forward they needed to acknowledge the
   extent and nature of the transition they were making, find metaphors to
   dissolve troubling dualisms, and balance a desire to reach out to others
   with the need to manage the very real sense of vulnerability that came
   with embracing subjectivity. Their experiences suggest that pragmatism
   may be a useful bridging framework for the growing number of academics
   from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines
   turning to qualitative methodologists for help to move beyond positivist
   research.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent successful standardization of broadband power line
   communication (PLC) (IEEE 1901, ITU-T G.9960/61) and visible light
   communication (VLC) (IEEE 802.15.7), there is an excellent opportunity
   to consider their integration. In particular, there is inherent benefit
   to leveraging existing power line infrastructure to provide connectivity
   while exploiting energy-efficient LED illumination systems for wireless
   downlink. The ubiquity of LED lighting together with power line networks
   leads us to conclude that VLC will be a strong complementary wireless
   technology to indoor PLC much in the way that Wi-Fi currently supports
   broadband Ethernet connections. This paper will survey some aspects of
   both PLC and VLC and present new proposals for their integration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new, open-source method for FPGA CAD researchers
   to realize their techniques on real Xilinx devices. Specifically, we
   extend the Verilog-To-Routing (VTR) suite, which includes the VPR
   place-and-route CAD tool on which many FPGA innovations have been based,
   to generate working Xilinx bitstreams via the Xilinx Design Language
   (XDL). Currently, we can faithfully translate VPR's heterogeneous
   packing and placement results into an exact Xilinx `map' netlist, which
   is then routed by its `par' tool. We showcase the utility of this new
   method with two compelling applications targeting a 40nm Virtex-6
   device: a fair comparison of the area, delay, and CAD runtime of
   academia's state-of-the-art VTR flow with a commercial, closed-source
   equivalent, along with a CAD experiment evaluated using physical
   measurements of on-chip power consumption and die temperature, over

Abstract = {{The theory of compressive sensing has shown that with a small number of
   samples from random projections of a sparse signal, one can recover the
   original signal under certain conditions. In this paper, we use
   compressive sensing to design a random access protocol for requesting
   uplink data channels. A wireless node transmits a pseudo-random sequence
   to an access point (AP) when it requires an uplink channel. The AP
   receives multiple sequences in a random access shared channel. Due to
   different propagation delays, the received signals from different
   wireless nodes are not synchronized at the receiver. Assume that the
   number of sequence transmissions is substantially less than the number
   of wireless nodes in the system. Under such circumstances, we design an
   asynchronous compressive sensing based decoder to recover the original
   signals in a random access setting. The key difference between our
   proposed decoder and those presented in the literature is that we do not
   require any synchronization before sequence transmission which makes our
   approach practical. Simulation results show the throughput improvement
   of our proposed scheme compared to two other random access protocols.}},

   is particularly suitable for turbulence channels. Novel closed-form

Abstract = {{Current material supply-demand imbalances are driven by situational
   rather than physical scarcities, resulting in a growing interest among
   government, civil society, and industry groups to consider not only the

   pressure on mining companies to broaden their concerns when planning new
   mining projects, covering its ``social license to operate{''} by
   incorporating strategies for limiting negative socioenvironmental
   impacts alongside calculations of the project's economic viability as
   well as balancing a large number of potential stakeholders. Accordingly,
   understanding also the sociopolitical context of mineral development is
   crucial for the creation of sustainable practices within the mining
   industry. By applying a sustainable development framework, this article
   outlines the complex web of challenges associated with sustainable

Abstract = {{A dielectrophoresis (DEP) microjet is introduced in this work.
   Fundamental material and topology characteristics are investigated for
   on-chip microdroplet actuation, and the DEP microjet is designed
   according to these characteristics. The material characteristics suggest
   that negative DEP (nDEP) can provide the required strength of axial and
   transverse forces for on-chip microdroplet actuation. The topology
   characteristics are then considered for nDEP operation in terms of
   on-chip electrostatic energy distributions. The operation of a
   double-micropin (DEP microjet) topology is compared to that of a
   single-micropin (nominal) topology. Theoretical and experimental results
   show that the double-micropin topology of the on-chip DEP microjet is
   well-suited for controlled microdroplet actuation. A series of
   experimental characterizations confirm these findings, with experimental
   microdroplet velocities of approximately 25 cm s(-1). The DEP microjet
   is ultimately successful in establishing controlled and rapid
   microdroplet actuation for emerging on-chip microfluidic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Lignin, the second most abundant biopolymer on earth, has the potential
   as a low cost and renewable precursor for carbon fibers. By creating
   lignin carbon nanofibers for lightweight structural composites for
   automobiles and functional applications such as electrodes and
   electromagnetic shields, the value of lignin will be enhanced. Under the
   Lignoworks Biomaterials and Chemicals Network program, we successfully
   demonstrated the feasibility of producing carbon nanofibers from
   softwood Kraft lignin by electrospinning and heat treatment. The
   morphological, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of the lignin
   carbon nanofiber were characterized. Results showed 10X increase in
   strength for the lignin random nanofiber mats after carbonization.
   Alignment of fibers further improved the mechanical strength. By doping
   the lignin polymer with carbon nanotubes and functional nanoparticles
   such as magnetite we demonstrated the feasibility of translating the
   strength and electromagnetic function respectively to the lignin
   nanofiber assemblies. The encouraging results demonstrated the potential
   of lignin as an engineering material thus establishing a pathway for
   adding values to the abundantly available lignin.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2353}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Abstract = {{In 2009, London Overground management implemented a new tactical plan
   for a.m. and p.m. peak service on the North London Line (NLL). This
   paper documents that tactical planning intervention and evaluates its
   outcomes in terms of certain aspects of service delivery (the operator's
   perspective on system performance) and service quality (the passenger's
   perspective). Analyses of service delivery and quality and of passenger
   demand contributed to the development, proposal, and implementation of
   the new tactical plan. NLL trains were delayed routinely en route, with
   excessive dwell time a major cause. Near-random passenger incidence
   behavior suggested that an even headway service for NLL might have been
   more appropriate. The confluence of these analyses was confirmed by the
   corresponding excess journey time results. On the basis of longitudinal
   analysis, an evaluation showed that on-time performance increased
   substantially and observed journey time decreased with the introduction
   of the new plan. Overall, the effects of this implementation appeared to
   have been positive on balance. This case study thus demonstrated the
   applicability of automatic data generally, and certain measures and
   techniques in the London Overground specifically, to support the
   tactical planning of an urban railway.}},

Abstract = {{Size reduction is an essential and often first operation in preparing
   biomass for subsequent operations. Size reduction is energy intensive
   especially for cases where the target particle is small and precise in
   dimension. Mineral and food industries have developed empirical and
   semi-empirical equations to calculate energy input for grinding. It is
   uncertain if these equations can be applied to fibrous biomass. This
   research presents laboratory grinding data to evaluate the applicability
   of a set of generalized industrial-size reduction equations to the
   grinding of lignocellulose biomass. Batches of Douglas-fir (a soft wood)
   and hybrid willow (a hard wood) particles conditioned to 11.5\% moisture
   content were ground in a rotary knife mill. Input and output particle
   sizes and the level of energy used to grind the material were acquired
   electronically and recorded. Specific grinding energy (Jig) was
   correlated with size parameters of three popular industrial equations:
   Kick, Rittinger, and Bond. All three equations fitted to the
   experimental data linearly but the best fitted lines did not go through
   the origin, i.e. the fitted lines had a slope and intercept. Rittinger
   equation had the best fit, followed by Bond equation and Kick equation.}},

Abstract = {{One important challenge in power electronics design is removing the heat
   cost effectively from the power devices. A thermal via is a small
   diameter hole plated with copper and is used to transfer the heat from
   one side of the printed circuit board (PCB) to the other side. In this
   paper, a thorough literature review of the design and analysis of
   thermal vias in PCBs for thermal management of devices in power
   electronics converters are presented. Key advantages of using PCB's for
   thermal management are also presented. Based on the conclusions drawn
   from the available literature and practical manufacturing guidelines,
   four different via patterns for a single power device are selected and
   their thermal performances are studied. Each of the four via patterns is
   laid out multiple times on the same PCB. A power component in a D2PAK is
   soldered to each of the patterns. The PCB is attached to a liquid cooled
   cold plate. The devices are powered up and a thermal imaging camera is
   used to record the temperature of the device. The experimental results
   presented closely matches with the theoretical prediction and helps in
   identifying the most efficient thermal via pattern.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a control strategy is presented for a high performance
   LLC multi-resonant dc-dc converter in a two stage smart charger for
   neighborhood electric vehicle applications. It addresses several aspects
   and limitations of LLC resonant dc-dc converters in battery charging
   applications, such as very wide output voltage range while keeping the
   efficiency maximized, implementation of the current mode control at the
   secondary side and optimization of burst mode operation for current
   regulation at very low output voltage. The proposed control scheme
   minimize both low and high frequency current ripple on the battery while
   maintaining stability of the dc-dc converter, thus maximizing battery
   life without penalizing the volume of the charger. Experimental results
   are presented for a prototype unit converting 390 V from the input dc
   link to an output voltage range of 48 V to 72 V dc at 650 W. The
   prototype achieves a peak efficiency of 96 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic architectures with distributed power electronics provide
   many advantages in terms of energy yield as well as system level
   optimization. As the power level of the solar farm increases it becomes
   more beneficial to increase the dc collection network voltage, which
   requires the use of power devices with higher voltage ratings, and thus
   making the design of efficient, low cost, distributed power converters
   more challenging. In this paper a simple partial power converter
   topology is proposed. The topology is implemented using a three-level
   switching cell, which allows the use of semi-conductor devices with
   lower voltage rating; thus improving design and performance and reducing
   converter cost. This makes the converters suitable for use for medium to
   high power applications where dc-link voltages of 600V similar to 1kV
   may be needed without the need for high voltage devices. Converter
   operation and experimental results are presented for two partial power
   circuit variants using three-level switching cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an isolated interleaved zero voltage switching
   full-bridge converter with trailing edge pulse width modulation and

   for this work is the second stage dc-dc converter in a two stage 3.3 kW
   on-board charger for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). A
   detailed converter operation analysis is presented along with a design
   procedure. The interleaved dc-dc converter operates efficiently, shares
   equal output power and uniformly distributes thermal losses among the
   individual cells. The proposed converter significantly reduces the
   number of output rectifier diodes, reduces input filtering requirements
   and also reduces the reverse recovery losses in the secondary rectifier
   diodes. Simulation and experimental results are presented for a
   prototype unit converting 400 V from the input dc link to an output
   voltage range of 150 V to 400 V dc at 3300 W with a peak efficiency of

Abstract = {{The ability to perform a sit-to-stand (STS) motion is important for
   ambulatory adults to function independently and maintain daily
   activities. Roughly 6\% of community-dwelling older adults experience
   significant difficulties with STS, a major risk factor for
   institutionalization. While mechanical STS assistance can help address
   this problem, full dependence on STS assistance provided by devices such
   as lift chairs can lead to atrophy of the leg muscles. We investigated
   the mechanics of assisted STS motion in order to better understand how
   load-sharing STS mechanisms may facilitate STS motions while still
   requiring activation of the leg muscles. Experiments were conducted with
   17 nondisabled older adults performing unassisted and assisted STS rises
   with grab bar, arm, seat, and waist assistance. Each mode of rise was
   evaluated based on a subject questionnaire and key biomechanical metrics
   relating to stability, knee effort reduction, and rise trajectory.
   Results show that the seat- and waist-assist modes provide statistically
   significant improvements in stability metrics and reductions in required
   knee torques over unassisted rises and bar assistance. The assists most
   preferred by the subjects were the seat and bar assists. Overall, our
   results favor a seat-assisted STS modality for non-clinical applications
   and indicate further testing of this modality with a clinical
   population.}},

   of the nanofluid magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flow through a channel
   formed by two parallel isothermal plates considering thermal radiation
   effect. Air is the main fluid and three types of nanoparticles such as
   Al2O3, Ti and Cu are examined. The velocity and temperature fields are
   obtained from solution of the momentum and energy equations
   analytically. The local and total entropy generation rates are
   calculated and then the total entropy generation rate is presented
   graphically versus governing dimensionless parameters. Electrical
   efficiency, radiation parameter, nanoparticles volume fraction, Hartman
   and Peclet numbers are considered in this work. The results show that
   there are conditions in which the total entropy generation rate could be
   optimized.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and tracking of surface targets using airborne radars has
   been extensively investigated in the literature. However, the
   state-of-the-art techniques in multi-target tracking do not
   automatically provide information that is potentially of tactical
   significance, such as anomalous trajectory patterns. In this paper,
   recent work that attempts to address this problem that is based on
   stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) is reviewed. It is shown that
   the production rule probabilities in SCFGs can be used to constrain
   sizes and orientation of target trajectories and hence lead to
   development of more refined syntactic trackers.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy for treating prostate
   cancer where the radiation sources are seeds inserted into the prostate.
   Accurate localization of seeds during prostate brachytherapy is
   essential to the success of intraoperative treatment planning. The
   current standard modality used in intraoperative seeds localization is
   transrectal ultrasound. Transrectal ultrasound, however, suffers in
   image quality due to several factors such speckle, shadowing, and
   off-axis seed orientation. Photoacoustic imaging, based on the
   photoacoustic phenomenon, is an emerging imaging modality. The contrast
   generating mechanism in photoacoustic imaging is optical absorption that
   is fundamentally different from conventional B-mode ultrasound which
   depicts changes in acoustic impedance. A photoacoustic imaging system is
   developed using a commercial ultrasound system. To improve imaging
   contrast and depth penetration, absorption enhancing coating is applied
   to the seeds. In comparison to bare seeds, approximately 18.5 dB
   increase in signal-to-noise ratio as well as a doubling of imaging depth
   are achieved. Our results demonstrate that the coating of the seeds can
   further improve the discernibility of the seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of histological slices to volumetric imaging of the
   prostate is an important task that can be used to optimize imaging for
   cancer detection. Such registration is challenging due to change in
   volume of the specimen during fixation, and misalignment of the
   histological slices during preparation and digital scanning. In this
   work we propose a multiple-slice to volume registration method in which
   a stack of equispaced, uniaxial but unaligned 2D contours, extracted
   from digitally scanned whole-mount histological slices, is registered to
   a 3D surface, extracted from a volumetric image of the prostate.
   Initially, the stack of unaligned contours is coarsely aligned to the
   surface as a whole. Then, each contour is finely registered to the
   surface while being confined to its plane along the sectioning axis. We
   incorporate the method in a particle filtering framework to compensate
   for the high dimensionality of the search space and multi-modal nature
   of the problem. Moreover, such framework allows modeling the uncertainty
   in the segmentation of the contours and surface, in order to derive
   optimal registration parameters in a Bayesian approach. The proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated and evaluated on both synthetic and clinical
   data. The mean area overlap of the registered gland and the segmented
   histology was found to be 90.2\%, with a mean registration error of
   1.8mm between visible landmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Shape deformations and volumetric changes in the hippocampus and
   amygdala have previously been noted in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
   Unfortunately, these analyses are limited because relative shape and
   pose (rigid+scale transformation) information of multiple objects in
   brain are generally disregarded. We hypothesize that this information
   might complement studies of limbic structural deformation in MDD. We
   focus on changes in temporal (e.g., superior, middle and inferior
   temporal gyms) and limbic (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala) lobes. Here,
   we use a multi-object statistical pose and shape model to analyze
   imaging data from young people with and without a depressive disorder.
   Nineteen individuals with a depressive disorder (mean age: 17.85) and
   twenty six healthy controls (age: 18) were enrolled in the study. A
   segmented atlas in MNI space has been used to segment hippocampus,
   amygdala, parahippocampal gyri, putamen, and the superior, inferior and
   middle temporal gyri in both hemispheres of the brain. Points on the
   surface of each structure were extracted and warped to each subjects'
   structural MRI. These corresponding surface points were used within the
   analysis, to extract the pose and shape features. Pose and shape
   differences were detected between the two groups, such that second
   principal mode of pose variation (p = 0.022), and first principal mode
   of shape variation (p = 0.049) were found to differ significantly
   between the two groups.}},

Abstract = {{The low diagnostic value of ultrasound in prostate cancer imaging has
   resulted in an effort to enhance the tumor contrast using
   ultrasound-based technologies that go beyond traditional B-mode imaging.
   Ultrasound RF time series, formed by echo samples originating from the
   same location over a few seconds of imaging, has been proposed and
   experimentally used for tissue typing with the goal of cancer detection.
   In this work, for the first time we report the preliminary results of in
   vivo clinical use of spectral parameters extracted from RF time series
   in prostate cancer detection. An image processing pipeline is designed
   to register the ultrasound data to wholemount histopathology references
   acquired from prostate specimens that are removed in radical
   prostatectomy after imaging. Support vector machine classification is
   used to detect cancer in 524 regions of interest of size 5x5 mm, each
   forming a feature vector of spectral RF time series parameters.
   Preliminary ROC curves acquired based on RF time series analysis for
   individual cases, with leave-one-patient-out cross validation, are
   presented and compared with B-mode texture analysis.}},

Abstract = {{One of the commonly used treatment methods for early-stage prostate
   cancer is brachytherapy. The standard of care for planning this
   procedure is segmentation of contours from transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
   images, which closely follow the prostate boundary. This process is
   currently performed either manually or using semi-automatic techniques.
   This paper introduces a fully automatic segmentation algorithm which
   uses a priori knowledge of contours in a reference data set of TRUS
   volumes. A non-parametric deformable registration method is employed to
   transform the atlas prostate contours to a target image coordinates. All
   atlas images are sorted based on their registration results and the
   highest ranked registration results are selected for decision fusion. A
   Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation algorithm is
   utilized to fuse labels from registered atlases and produce a segmented
   target volume. In this experiment, 50 patient TRUS volumes are obtained
   and a leave-one-out study on TRUS volumes is reported. We also compare
   our results with a state-of-the-art semi-automatic prostate segmentation
   method that has been clinically used for planning prostate brachytherapy
   procedures and we show comparable accuracy and precision within
   clinically acceptable runtime.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of the spinal column from CT images is a pre-processing
   step for a range of image guided interventions. Current techniques focus
   on identification and separate segmentation of each vertebra. Recently,
   statistical multi-object shape models have been introduced to extract
   common statistical characteristics between several anatomies. These
   models are also used for segmentation purposes and are shown to be
   robust, accurate, and computationally tractable. In this paper, we
   reconstruct a statistical multi-vertebrae shape+pose model and propose a
   novel technique to register such a model to CT images. We validate our
   technique in terms of accuracy of the multi-vertebrae segmentation of CT
   images acquired from 16 subjects. The mean distance error achieved for
   all vertebrae is 1.17 mm with standard deviation of 0.38 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Refractive index (RI) is the optical property of a medium that describes
   its ability to bend incident light. The corneal refractive index is an
   especially important measurement in corneal and intraocular refractive
   surgery where its precise estimation is necessary to obtain accurate
   surgical outcomes. In this study, we calculated the corneal RI using a
   combined multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) system. MPM excites and detects nonlinear signals including two
   photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation
   (SHG). TPEF signals are observed from NADH in the cytoplasm, allowing
   MPM to image the cellular structures in the corneal epithelium and
   endothelium. SHG signals are observed from collagen, an abundant
   connective tissue found in the stroma. Optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) produces cross-sectional, structural images based on the
   interference fringes created by the reflected light from the sample and
   reference arms. Our system uses a single sub-10 fs Ti: sapphire laser
   source which is good for both MPM excitation and OCT resolution. The MPM
   and OCT images are co-registered when they are taken successively
   because their axial resolutions are similar and the system shares the
   laser source and the scanning unit. We can calculate the RI by measuring
   the optical thickness and the optical path length of the cornea from the
   MPM and OCT images respectively. We have imaged and calculated the RI of
   murine and piscine corneas. We were able to see the epithelial, stromal,
   and endothelial layers and compare their relative thicknesses and the
   organization of the stromal collagen lamellae. Our results showed that
   our system can provide both functional and structural information about
   the cornea and measure the RI of multi-layered tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Public m-health is a new medical service under intensive development,
   which provides unobtrusive monitoring of people's health conditions from
   anywhere at any time to enable detection of deteriorating health
   conditions before severe discomfort or disability occur. A key challenge
   in practical implementation of public m-health is the use of shared
   license-free spectrum by body area networks (BANs) to report sampled
   vital signs continuously and in real time. A cognitive medium access
   control method called centralized body area network access scheme (CBAS)
   is proposed in this paper to reduce access delay in a BAN in the
   presence of coexistent systems. By opportunistic extraction of idle
   spaces from a pool of orthogonal channels, CBAS dynamically adjusts a
   BAN's channel access pattern according to the current interference
   environment, and improves the BAN's visibility among coexistent
   networks. Performance of a BAN under CBAS is analyzed by modeling the
   system as a preemptive-resume priority queue. Numerical and simulation
   results show that the queuing delay and throughput of a BAN employing
   CBAS outperforms those of a BAN that utilizes a single channel
   statically, as channel access opportunities suffer less fragmentations
   and interruptions.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an implantable MEMS drug delivery device to conduct
   controlled and on-demand, ex vivo drug transport to human eye tissue.
   Remotely operated drug delivery to human post-mortem eyes was performed
   via a MEMS device. The developed curved packaging cover conforms to the
   eyeball thereby preventing the eye tissue from contacting the actuating
   membrane. By pulsed operation of the device, using an externally applied
   magnetic field, the drug released from the device accumulates in a
   cavity adjacent to the tissue. As such, docetaxel (DTX), an
   antiangiogenic drug, diffuses through the eye tissue, from sclera and
   choroid to retina. DTX uptake by sclera and choroid were measured to be
   1.93 +/- 0.66 and 7.24 +/- 0.37 mu g/g tissue, respectively, after two
   hours in pulsed operation mode (10 s on/off cycles) at 23 degrees C.
   During this period, a total amount of 192 ng DTX diffused into the
   exposed tissue. This MEMS device shows great potential for the treatment
   of ocular posterior segment diseases such as diabetic retinopathy by
   introducing a novel way of drug administration to the eye.}},

Title = {{Wavelet-Based Artifact Identification and Separation Technique for EEG
   Signals during Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{We present a new method for removing artifacts in electroencephalography
   (EEG) records during Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS). The main
   challenge in exploiting GVS is to understand how the stimulus acts as an
   input to brain. We used EEG to monitor the brain and elicit the GVS
   reflexes. However, GVS current distribution throughout the scalp
   generates an artifact on EEG signals. We need to eliminate this artifact
   to be able to analyze the EEG signals during GVS. We propose a novel
   method to estimate the contribution of the GVS current in the EEG
   signals at each electrode by combining time-series regression methods
   with wavelet decomposition methods. We use wavelet transform to project
   the recorded EEG signal into various frequency bands and then estimate
   the GVS current distribution in each frequency band. The proposed method
   was optimized using simulated signals, and its performance was compared
   to well-accepted artifact removal methods such as ICA-based methods and
   adaptive filters. The results show that the proposed method has better
   performance in removing GVS artifacts, compared to the others. Using the
   proposed method, a higher signal to artifact ratio of -1.625 dB was
   achieved, which outperformed other methods such as ICA-based methods,
   regression methods, and adaptive filters.}},

Abstract = {{Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is a powerful technique for high resolution
   imaging of biological tissues. A specially-designed chirped photonic
   crystal fiber (CPCF) is introduced for MPM applications. The CPCF
   eliminates most pulse broadening effects in a broad transmission window
   because its cell-size radial chirp in the cladding structure localizes
   the reflection of different wavelengths in different resonant layers of
   the cladding, similar to chirped mirrors. In contrast, traditional
   hollow core fiber (HCF) consists of several identical reflective layers
   that produce substantial higher-order dispersion. The feasibility of
   applying the CPCF for MPM imaging is studied. The propagation properties
   of the CPCF are characterized by autocorrelation traces measured with
   and without the CPCF, which confirms an extremely low dispersion of the
   CPCF. The dispersion from other optics in the MPM imaging system is
   further compensated by a double-folded prism pair. In the
   autocorrelation trace measurement, satellite peaks are observed when the
   length of the CPCF is short (similar to 40 cm), which disappear when the
   fiber length is chosen sufficiently long. The satellite peaks appear to
   originate from modal dispersion. With propagation lengths above 1 m,
   single mode propagation can be achieved in the CPCF. The extremely low
   dispersion of CPCF over a wide transmission window is promising in MPM
   applications for the fiber delivery of femtosecond pulses, especially in
   sub-20fs or tunable laser illumination.}},

Abstract = {{Laser ultrasonics for metallurgy (LUMet) is an innovative sensor
   technology for in-situ measurement of microstructure evolution during
   thermomechanical processing. This unique sensor has been attached to a
   Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator for dedicated laboratory studies
   during processing of steel, aluminum, magnesium and titanium samples.
   Advanced processing software has been developed for the measurement of
   grain size and texture evolution from laser ultrasonic signals. Results
   of austenite grain growth measurements in low carbon steels will be
   described to demonstrate the capabilities of the LUMet technique.
   Further, applications of the system to measure recrystallization of
   ferrite and austenite formation during intercritical annealing
   simulations of dual phase steels will be presented. The ability to
   rapidly acquire data both during a single test and for multiple
   conditions over a range of conditions from different samples has
   important implications on expediting process modelling and alloy design.
   Although certain limitations exist, the LUMet technique offers a very
   reliable characterization platform with a number of potential
   applications in metallurgical process engineering.}},

   All Ni2P catalysts deactivated following the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of
   4-methylphenol (4-MP) at 623 K and 4.4 MPa. The deactivation was due to
   coking and was modeled by an exponential decay law. All Ni2P catalysts
   had similar deactivation parameters, indicating the loss in activity was
   due to C deposition on similar sites. The Ni2P-CA catalysts, with
   crystallite size in the range of 34-50 nm, had comparable initial TOFs,

   providing potential real-world applicability to our results. Actions
   required for industrial assembly tasks are abstracted into three
   classes: part acquisition, part manipulation, and part operations. We
   analyzed the communication between human pairs performing these subtasks
   and derived a set of communication terms and gestures. We found that
   participant-provided gestures are intuitive and well suited to robotic
   implementation, but that interpretation is highly dependent on task
   context. We then implemented these gestures on a robot arm in a
   human-robot interaction context, and found the gestures to be easily
   interpreted by observers. We found that observation of human-human
   interaction can be effective in determining what should be communicated
   in a given human-robot task, how communication gestures should be
   executed, and priorities for robotic system implementation based on

   laminates. In this paper, a 3D microtomographic technique has been
   employed to visualize and compare impact damage modes in a set of
   thermoplastic laminates. The test samples were made of commingled
   polypropylene (PP) and glass fibers with two different architectures,
   including the plain woven and unidirectional. Impact testing using a
   drop-weight tower, followed by postimpact four-point flexural testing
   and nondestructive tomographic analysis demonstrated a close
   relationship between the type of fibre architecture and the induced
   impact damage mechanisms and their extensions.}},

   Solar-Activated Photocatalyst for Water Splitting}},

Abstract = {{Converting a practically limitless energy source, such as sunlight, into
   chemical energy with very little or no carbon footprint will pose a
   major challenge in the coming decades. The technology exists to convert
   solar energy into chemical fuels, such as hydrogen, through overall
   water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen. However, the
   photocatalytic efficiency is still below the feasibility limit. Many
   photocatalyst materials have been developed for solar hydrogen
   generation through water splitting in the last four decades.
   Gallium-zinc oxynitride (GaN:ZnO) solid solution is reported to be a
   suitable photocatalyst for overall water splitting and to have the
   highest photocatalytic activity. The traditional synthesis method
   contains difficulties and inefficiencies, such as long nitridation of
   starting materials at high temperatures and low Zn content of the
   synthesized photocatalyst. A number of experiments have been conducted
   in recent years to develop new synthesis approaches. In this article, a
   comprehensive review of various synthesis techniques of GaN: ZnO solid
   solution, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are presented.
   This information is essential for improving the efficiency of the
   synthesis techniques of GaN: ZnO solid solution and its photocatalytic
   activity for overall water splitting. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical

Title = {{Corticomuscular Activity Modeling by Combining Partial Least Squares and
   Canonical Correlation Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Corticomuscular activity modeling based on multiple data sets such as
   electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides
   a useful tool for understanding human motor control systems. In this
   paper, we propose modeling corticomuscular activity by combining partial
   least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The
   proposed method takes advantage of both PLS and CCA to ensure that the
   extracted components are maximally correlated across two data sets and
   meanwhile can well explain the information within each data set. This
   complementary combination generalizes the statistical assumptions beyond
   both PLS and CCA methods. Simulations were performed to illustrate the
   performance of the proposed method. We also applied the proposed method
   to concurrent EEG and EMG data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD)
   study. The results reveal several highly correlated temporal patterns
   between EEG and EMG signals and indicate meaningful corresponding
   spatial activation patterns. In PD subjects, enhanced connections
   between occipital region and other regions are noted, which is
   consistent with previous medical knowledge. The proposed framework is a
   promising technique for performing multisubject and bimodal data
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis is one of the popular methods in making carbon
   nanotube (CNT) devices using CNT solutions on pre-patterned electrodes.
   The interaction between the deposited and suspended nanotubes during
   deposition, together with the type of solution (containing surfactants
   or not) and electrode geometries have a significant effect in the
   dynamics and the results of the deposition. Here, we report the results
   of experiments and simulations investigating these effects. The
   formation of semi-periodic patterns made of stripes of nanotubes
   bridging the electrodes is related to the mutual effects of CNTs on each
   other during deposition. The periodicity of these structures depends on
   the geometry of the electrodes. Simulations show that the reason is
   changes in the electric field as a result of deposition of CNTs. These
   changes affect the DEP force and, therefore, the CNTs are guided toward
   certain spots based on their initial location,}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the hydraulics of sloped compost beds having
   active free and non-flowing zones, and used for runoff erosion and
   volume control, and heavy metal removal. Water sorption tests on yard
   waste compost indicated that water transfer between the two zones would
   be slow (6 hr for a 0.04 m rise). The free flowing zone in approximate
   to 1 m long sloped (15 degrees) beds increased in depth (0.01-0.08 m)
   with decreasing particle size and increasing flow. Particle size and
   flow (0.08-0.3 L/s/m) affected bed stability. Drainage volume increased
   with flow while drainage time remained fairly constant. Saturated flow
   occurred depending on the particle size above 0.02-0.165 L/s/m. Data
   indicate that sheet runoff from low intensity storms would most likely
   create unsaturated but stable bed conditions. Concentrated flows as from
   downspouts would likely create saturated conditions and have to be
   managed to prevent washout. A model based on porous media theory
   indicated that flow regime under saturated flow is turbulent. Results
   can be used to design compost beds for various runoff rates and to
   develop a heavy metal sorption model.}},

   adsorbed hydrogen on Ti-6Al-4 V alloy by the external donation of
   hydrogen atoms. These results implied the formation of an adsorbed layer
   of protein on the oxide layer which was confirmed by the result of the
   EIS experiments. Furthermore, the increase of HSA concentration
   increased the surface coverage of HSA. The comparison of the BSA (bovine

Abstract = {{In this study, integrity and corrosion properties of the Pb-MnO2
   composite anodes fabricated through single-action powder pressing were
   investigated. The effects of the MnO2 content on the properties of the
   composite anodes were studied and compared with those of the Pb and
   Pb-Sn-Ca anodes. Galvanostatic experiments (50 mA/cm(2)) were performed
   in stagnant sulphuric acid solution at 37 degrees C for the durations of
   24 and 72 hours. The results indicated that the Pb-MnO2 anodes operated
   at lower potentials than the Pb-Sn-Ca anode. The electrocatalytic
   activity of the composite anodes was improved as their MnO2 content
   increased, however, high MnO2 contents resulted in electrochemically
   unstable anodes. The composite anodes showed a lower degradation rate
   and better corrosion resistance compared to the Pb-Sn-Ca anode. Surface
   morphology and structure of the anodic layer on the anodes were examined
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
   Barrier properties of the anodic layer on the electrodes were
   investigated through cyclic voltammetric measurements. Results revealed
   that formation of the surface anodic layer was enhanced on the Pb-MnO2
   anodes. The anodic layers formed on the composite anodes in 72-hour
   polarization were more compact than that of the Pb-Sn-Ca anode and
   provided higher levels of protection. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{The slip behavior of several high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs) is
   studied as a function of molecular weight (M-w) and its distribution for
   moderate to broad molecular weight distribution resins. It is found that
   slip depends strongly on M-w and its distribution. The slip velocity
   increases with decrease of molecular weight, which is expected to decay
   to zero as the M-w approaches a value with characteristic molecular
   dimension similar to surface asperities. For HDPEs that exhibit
   stick-slip transition, the slip velocity (before the stick-slip) has
   been found to increase with increase of polydispersity. The strong slip
   observed above the stick-slip flow regime is found to be independent of
   the molecular weight characteristics. A criterion is also discussed as
   to the occurrence or not of the stick-slip transition which is found to
   depend strongly on M-w and its distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, highly sensitive sensor for detection of persulfate (S2O82-) is
   demonstrated by modification of carbon paste electrode (CPE) with nickel
   oxide nanowires (NiOx NWs) and neutral red (NR). Ni NWs are prepared by
   DC electrodeposition of Ni in the cylindrical pores of anodized aluminum
   oxide (AAO) templates. NWs are released, oxidized and immobilized with
   NR on the surface of CPE. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrate a pair
   of well-defined nearly reversible redox couples (E degrees' = -0.2 V in
   a buffer solution pH 2.0) at a wide pH range of 1-12. The surface
   coverage and heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant of the
   adsorbed redox couple are 7.368 x 10(-12) mol cm(-2) and 7.9 s(-1),
   respectively, indicating a high NR loading efficiency for NiOx NWs and
   efficient electron transfer between redox couple and the electrode. The
   modified CPE exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity for a
   S2O82- reduction, with a measured k(cat) of similar to 7.14 x 10(3) M-1
   s(-1). This catalytic reduction allows an amperometric detection of
   S2O82- at a potential of -0.2 V with detection limit of 30 nM,
   concentration calibration range of 0.1 mu M to 12 mM and a linear
   sensitivity of 647.33 nA mu M-1, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The nucleolus is a prominent subnuclear structure whose major function
   is the transcription and assembly of ribosome subunits. The size of the
   nucleolus varies with the cell cycle, proliferation rate and stress.
   Changes in nucleolar size, number, chemical composition, and shape can
   be used to characterize malignant cells. We used spontaneous Raman
   microscopy as a label-free technique to examine nucleolar spatial and
   chemical features. Raman images of the 1003 cm(-1) phenylalanine band
   revealed large, well-defined subnuclear protein structures in MFC-7
   breast cancer cells. The 783 cm(-1) images showed that nucleic acids
   were similarly distributed, but varied more in intensity, forming
   observable high-intensity regions. High subnuclear RNA concentrations
   were observed within some of these regions as shown by 809 cm(-1) Raman
   band images. Principal component analyses of sub-images and library
   spectra validated the subnuclear presence of RNA. They also revealed
   that an actin-like protein covaried with DNA within the nucleolus, a
   combination that accounted for 64\% or more of the spectral variance.
   Embryonic stem cells are another rapidly proliferating cell type, but
   their nucleoli were not as large or well defined. Estimating the size of
   the larger MCF-7 nucleolus was used to show the utility of Raman
   microscopy for morphometric analyses. It was concluded that imaging
   based on Raman microscopy provides a promising new method for the study
   of nucleolar function and organization, in the evaluation of drug and
   experimental effects on the nucleolus, and in clinical diagnostics and
   prognostics.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power systems have become
   increasingly important with wide acceptance and integration of solar
   energy in modern electric grids. The transcendental nonlinear equations
   describing the PV generator, which are coupled with the detailed
   switching models of the power electronic converters, generally result in
   slow and inefficient simulations, especially when long-term analyses are
   required. This paper focuses on simple and efficient modeling approaches
   that are suitable for long-term and large PV system analyses. This study
   provides a simplified PV-cell model and its parameterization,
   guaranteeing that the I-V characteristic curves pass through the typical
   points given in manufacturers' datasheets. Furthermore, several power
   interface models are provided for fast simulation purpose. A classical
   two-stage power processing system with intermediate dc link used as a
   string inverter, as well as a single-stage conversion unit used in
   distributed module-dedicated PV applications, are taken as application
   examples. The generalized modeling approach is thoroughly evaluated by
   comparing the simulation results with the experimental data of a
   practical 2.4-kW grid-tied PV solar unit. The proposed methodology is
   shown to have advantages over conventional modeling approaches to
   simulate long-term grid-tied operation.}},

Abstract = {{A library of probabilistic models for prediction of seismic risk is
   presented. The models are specifically intended for use with reliability
   methods to compute event probabilities, such as seismic loss
   probabilities. Several models are presented here for the first time. In
   particular, new and generic models are proposed for earthquake location,
   regional loss, building response, building damage, and building loss.
   Each model is presented with an explanation of its development and a
   discussion of its predictions. In addition, models from the literature
   are ``smoothed{''} to make them amenable to reliability analysis. The
   models are implemented in a new computer program that is tailored for
   reliability and optimization analysis with many probabilistic models.
   The models and the computer program are employed in the companion paper

Pages = {{63-74}},
Abstract = {{Reliability methods are employed in this paper to analyze the seismic
   risk to the Vancouver metropolitan region in Canada. The use of
   reliability methods contrasts with several contemporary approaches for
   risk analysis. In this paper, two analysis approaches are presented and
   implemented in a new computer program. One utilizes the first-order and
   second-order reliability methods together with a hazard combination
   technique. The other is a sampling-based method that repeatedly
   generates damage scenarios in the time period of interest. Both
   strategies employ the same collection of probabilistic models for
   seismic risk analysis. While the models are presented in the companion
   paper, this paper presents the analysis options and a comprehensive
   application that comprises 559 random variables and 3227 model objects.
   The primary result is the loss curve, which exposes seismic loss
   probabilities and serves as a basis for risk mitigation decisions. It is
   found that the probability of loss in excess of \$100 billion in the
   next 50 years is 5.6\%. By-products of the analysis provide further
   insight; the most vulnerable municipalities and the most influential
   hazard sources are identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Observations of a cyclonic gyre in an ice-covered, midsize (< 5 km(2)),
   temperate lake are presented. Horizontal and vertical measurements of
   temperature and electrical conductivity measurements were collected
   using a conductivity-temperature-depth logger mounted on an autonomous
   underwater vehicle and additional instrumentation. These measurements
   revealed a cylindrical density anomaly with a radius of similar to 110 m
   extending from the surface to similar to 14 m depth. The observed radius
   is smaller than the internal Rossby radius of deformation (similar to
   200 m), which suggests a cyclogeostrophic balance between centripetal,
   Coriolis, and pressure forces. The maximum azimuthal velocity,
   calculated assuming this balance, was similar to 2.1 cm s(-1) at 6-8 m
   depth. The Rossby number associated with this velocity was 1.7; this is
   consistent with the cyclogeostrophic assumption (i.e., Rossby number >
   1) and nearly twice that of similar under-ice eddies in the Arctic
   Ocean. The estimated Ekman spin-down timescale is 1.5-15 d, but despite
   this, the gyre appeared to be relatively unchanged over 6 d of field
   observations. This persistence implies the gyre was forced over the
   course of the field study; however, the source of the forcing is
   unknown. Horizontal temperature transects at and below the bottom of the
   gyre revealed coherent temperature fluctuations suggestive of vertical
   transport associated with the gyre.}},

Abstract = {{The application of a granular activated carbon-sequencing batch biofilm
   reactor (GAC-SBBR) for treatment of wastewater containing 1,000 mg/L
   Acid Red 18 (AR18) was investigated in this research. The treatment
   system consisted of a sequencing batch reactor equipped with moving GAC
   as biofilm support. Each treatment cycle consisted of two successive
   anaerobic (14 h) and aerobic (8 h) reaction phases. Removal of more than
   91\% chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 97\% AR18 was achieved in this
   study. Investigation of dye decolorization kinetics showed that the dye
   removal was stimulated by the adsorption capacity of the GAC at the
   beginning of the anaerobic phase and then progressed following a
   first-order reaction. Based on COD analysis results, at least 77.8\% of
   the dye total metabolites were mineralized during the applied treatment
   system. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that
   more than 97\% of 1-naphthyalamine-4-sulfonate as one of the main
   sulfonated aromatic constituents of AR18 was removed during the aerobic
   reaction phase. According to the scanning electron microscopic analysis,
   the microbial biofilms grew in most cavities and pores of the GAC, but
   not on the external surfaces of the GAC.}},

Abstract = {{Co-gasification of biomass, namely, switchgrass, with coal and fluid
   coke was performed to investigate the availability of the gasification
   catalysts to the mixed feedstock, especially alkali and alkaline earth
   elements, naturally present on switchgrass. Rates of CO2 gasification of
   the single and mixed materials were measured at temperatures between 750
   and 950 degrees C and atmospheric pressure by thermogravimetry. High
   interparticle mobility of the catalysts is indicated by a prompt and
   lasting effect on the mixed feed gasification rate when compared with
   the separate rates. The switchgrass coal mixtures show a deactivation
   (antagonism), attributed to sequestration of the mobile alkali elements
   by reaction with aluminosilicate minerals in coal to form inactive
   alkali aluminosilicates, such as KAlSi3O8 and KAlSiO4. Remaining
   catalytic activity is evident when excess alkali is present in the feed
   mixture to satisfy the stoichiometric requirements of these deactivation
   reactions. In co-gasification of switchgrass with fluid coke, which has
   little interfering inorganic matter, a synergism is noted in the
   gasification of the mixed feed. The results document the effects of fuel
   mixture, composition of the coal or coke ash, and the gasification
   temperature on this behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This review focuses on the modeling of articular cartilage (at the
   tissue level), chondrocyte mechanobiology (at the cell level) and a
   combination of both in a multiscale computation scheme. The primary
   objective is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of
   conventional models implemented to study the mechanics of the articular
   cartilage tissue and chondrocytes. From monophasic material models as
   the simplest form to more complicated multiscale theories, these
   approaches have been frequently used to model articular cartilage and
   have contributed significantly to modeling joint mechanics, addressing
   and resolving numerous issues regarding cartilage mechanics and
   function. It should be noted that attentiveness is important when using
   different modeling approaches, as the choice of the model limits the
   applications available. In this review, we discuss the conventional
   models applicable to some of the mechanical aspects of articular
   cartilage such as lubrication, swelling pressure and chondrocyte
   mechanics and address some of the issues associated with the current
   modeling approaches. We then suggest future pathways for a more
   realistic modeling strategy as applied for the simulation of the
   mechanics of the cartilage tissue using multiscale and parallelized
   finite element method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effect of dielectrophoresis on particle

   The dimensions of negative dielectrophoresis (nDEP) traps in the form of
   circular and square shapes are characterized using numerical and
   experimental approaches. These efforts will result in defining lifting
   and trapping zones, the ratio of which is shown to remain constant for
   trap sizes larger than 40 mm. As a result, a limiting constant K based
   on the ratio of the particle diameter to the trap size is introduced to
   identify the status of particle trapping prior to running numerical
   models or experiments. The results show that K must be less than 0.63
   for trapping the particles on the nDEP traps. This study will also
   result in optimizing the trap size for single particle immobilization

   extends the well-established approach of Kocks and Mecking to include

   proposed model is compared with experimental data for the system FeAl by
   reference both to the observed work hardening in monotonic loading and
   the Bauschinger effect measured in reverse shear tests. The agreement
   between the model and the experimental data is satisfactory and suggests
   a new description of work hardening which includes a prediction of the

Abstract = {{Industrial therapeutic protein production has been greatly improved
   through fed-batch development. In this study, improvement to the
   productivity of a tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expressing Chinese
   hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was investigated in shake flask culture
   through the optimization of the fed-batch feed and the reduction of
   ammonia generation by glutamine replacement. The t-PA titer was
   increased from 33 mg/L under batch conditions to 250 mg/L with daily
   feeding starting after three days of culture. A commercially available
   fed-batch feed was supplemented with cotton seed hydrolysate and the
   four depleted amino acids, aspartic acid, asparagine, cysteine, and
   tyrosine. The fed-batch operation increased the generation of
   by-products such as lactate and ammonia that can adversely affect the
   fed-batch performance. To reduce the ammonia production, a
   glutamine-containing dipeptide, pyruvate, glutamate, and wheat gluten
   hydrolysate, were investigated as glutamine substitutes. To minimize the
   lag phase as the cells adjusted to the new energy source, a feed
   glutamine replacement process was developed where the cells were
   initially cultured with a glutamine containing basal medium to establish
   cell growth followed by feeding with a feed containing the glutamine
   substitutes. This two-step feed glutamine replacement process not only
   reduced the ammonia levels by over 45\% but, in the case of using wheat
   gluten hydrolysate, almost doubled the t-PA titer to over 420 mg/L
   without compromising the t-PA product quality or glycosylation pattern.
   The feed glutamine replacement process combined with optimizing other
   feed medium components provided a simple, practical, and effective
   fed-batch strategy that could be applied to the production of other
   recombinant therapeutic proteins. (c) 2012 American Institute of

   data from Vancouver, Ottawa, and Victoria. The research used standard
   experimental design methods, including: control-trigger variables,
   sensitivity analysis, and cross-sectional analysis. Statistically
   significant results were obtained, and suggested that neighbourhoods
   built following CMHC's Fused Grid road network pattern would realize a
   30 to 60\% higher level of road safety than the commonly-used grid and
   culs-de-sac patterns, and a level of safety comparable to the 3-way

Abstract = {{Camera calibration is a necessary step in all video analysis
   applications to recover the real-world positions of concerned road

   little attention to these practical challenges that arise when studying

   study presents the development details of a robust camera calibration
   approach based on integrating a collection of geometric information
   found in urban traffic scenes in a consistent optimization framework.
   The developed approach was tested on six datasets obtained from urban

Abstract = {{Gas dispersion in horizontal developing pipe flow downstream of a 90
   degrees-tee mixer and an in-line mechanical mixer was investigated by
   means of electrical resistance tomography (ERT) for both water and
   softwood kraft pulp suspensions over a range of fibre mass
   concentrations (0-3.0\%), superficial liquid/pulp velocities (0.5-5.0
   m/s) and superficial gas velocities (0.11-0.44 m/s). A gas mixing index,
   derived from the standard deviation of local gas holdup in each image
   pixel, quantified the uniformity of gas in cross-sectional planes along
   the pipe for various flow patterns. The distribution of the gas phase in
   a cross-section was determined from the vertical gas holdup profiles,
   and the relative size of gaseous entities for different flow conditions
   was evaluated based on the scale of segregation. For air-water flow, the
   gas uniformity and size of gaseous entities depended strongly on the
   flow pattern. For pulp fibre suspensions, the gas flow varied
   significantly depending on the flow regime. Mixing was similar to that
   in water when the flow was turbulent for dilute suspensions, but
   differed greatly for higher mass concentrations, likely due to robust
   fibre networks of a plug in the core of the pipe causing bubbles to
   concentrate near the wall and accelerating coalescence. The impeller
   disrupted the plug and distributed gas throughout the cross-section,
   leading to significantly improved gas uniformity in the high-shear zone
   around the impeller, but decaying turbulence and re-establishment of
   fibre networks caused bubbles to coalesce at the top of the pipe and
   worse mixing downstream. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{The influence of potential on the species and surface films formed
   during electrodissolution of chalcopyrite were investigated in 0.5 M
   sulfuric acid solution at 25 degrees C. Cyclic voltammetry,
   chronoamperometry, potentiostatic and potentiodynamic polarization
   methods were applied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) were used to analyze the minerals and product layers
   on the surface before and after electrodissolution. The chalcopyrite
   electrode was shown to be passive for potentials up to 0.90 V-SHE. Above
   this potential, transpassive dissolution occurs. Results of XPS studies
   have suggested that a metal-deficient sulfide film (Cu1-xFe1-yS2-z)
   consisting of cuprous sulfide (Cu-S) and iron sulfide (Fe-S) bonds, is
   the most plausible copper and iron containing sulfide phase which
   passivates the surface of chalcopyrite. It is demonstrated that the
   transpassive dissolution of chalcopyrite is significantly linked to
   oxidation of sulfur (from sulfide in the passive film to elemental
   sulfur and maybe sulfur species with higher oxidation states, e.g.
   thiosulfate). No elemental sulfur or polysulfide species were detected
   on the surface for potentials below 0.90 V-SHE. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The human immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and other organs
   that defend the body against foreign invaders called antigens. Jerne's
   idiotypic network theory concerns how an antibody in the immune system
   stimulates or suppresses another antibody and recognizes an antigen.
   Based on the principles of human immune system and Jerne's idiotypic
   network theory this paper presents a method for cooperation among robots
   in a multi-robot system. The developed cooperative multi-robot system is
   fully autonomous and distributed. The system autonomously chooses the
   appropriate number of suitable and most capable robots in the fleet to
   cooperate with each other in carrying out a global task, while
   accommodating partial or full failure of robots during the task
   execution. In the present system, the strategies of communication,
   coordination, and cooperation use a modified model of Jerne's idiotypic
   network theory and the structure of a human immune system. The developed
   methodology is demonstrated by implementing in a team of simulated
   heterogeneous mobile robots that cooperatively transport multiple
   objects to a goal location.}},

Abstract = {{In 2006, an unprecedented atmospheric confined space accident took place
   in a sampling shed at the Sullivan Mine in Kimberley, British Columbia.
   This accident suggests that a risk assessment should be carried out on a
   regular basis at mine reclamation sites for many years after closure. in
   this paper, an Atmospheric Fuzzy Risk Assessment (AFRA) tool is
   described that can assess atmospheric risk given heuristic and measured
   data at such sites. It can also serve to transfer knowledge about
   atmospheric hazards in an enclosed structure. The system uses fuzzy
   logic to input and output information and to perform weighted
   inferencing. The paper describes the developmental process as well as
   system verification and validation based on a number of known test and
   reference waste dumps. AFRA is a heuristic expert system based on fuzzy
   logic and the first tool that was developed to assess the atmospheric
   risk of mine waste dumps. The atmospheric risk is estimated by fuzzy
   Mamdani system given the values of four major elements of risk
   comprising of: gas generation, gas emission, gas confinement, and human
   exposure. The ability of AFRA to adapt its risk assessment to different
   climate conditions is explained. There are many physical, chemical, and
   environmental factors which fluctuate over time affecting
   oxygen-depletion in waste dumps. AFRA can help mining engineers and mine
   managers recognize this type of danger when conducting a confined space
   inventory at a reclamation site. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Integrity of lead anodes has always been a major concern for the
   electrowinning industry. This work investigates the effect of solution
   hydrodynamics on the degradation of Pb-Sn-Ca and Pb-Ca anodes.
   Galvanostatic experiments (50 mA/cm(2)) were performed at 37 +/- 0.5
   degrees C using 0, 600, and 1000 rpm stirring rates for the durations of
   24 and 72 hours. The PbO2 layer was reduced to PbSO4 (discharged) and
   the discharge duration was used in corrosion rate calculations. Weight
   loss measurements along with the discharge calculations revealed that
   the degradation rate of lead anodes increased with the solution stirring
   rate. In addition, the amount of PbO2 remaining on the surfaces was
   decreased as a function of solution velocity. Therefore, it was
   concluded that detachment of the corrosion products from the surface
   (flaking) affects the degradation rate of lead anodes significantly.
   Moreover, it was determined that the Pb-Sn-Ca anode performed better
   than the Pb-Ca anode in terms of both integrity and electrocatalytic
   properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface morphologies of
   the Pb-Sn-Ca anodes indicated that the roughness decreased as the
   solution stirring rate increased. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{41-52}},
Abstract = {{Adaptation is an important precondition for validity of experiments
   carried out using a driving simulator. Learning how to control a
   simulated vehicle imposes mental load on participants, which can
   potentially distract them from performing the main task and bias the
   results of experiments. Most researchers have a practice session before
   the main scenario to ensure participants have adapted. However, the
   practice scenarios vary greatly both in duration and form. Moreover, in
   almost all cases, it is difficult to verify that a participant is
   adapted at the end of the practice session. It was previously shown that
   using a power curve can mathematically model the learning pattern of
   subjects to steering and pedal control and can also help identify
   adapted and non-adapted subjects at the end of practice scenarios. The
   same concept is implemented in the current study to evaluate the
   appropriateness of such a methodology for a different practice scenario.
   The results showed that adaptation time and learning rate did not differ
   significantly between male and female participants. More importantly,
   statistical evidence verified that adaptation to a driving simulator is
   task-independent. The impact of the practice scenario on the main task
   was also analyzed, leading to the observation that during the experiment
   scenario participants tend to continue to improve the sub-skills they
   focused on during the practice scenario. Based on the results of these
   adaptation sessions, recommendations are provided to improve the quality
   of design for the practice scenario and to minimize its impact on the
   experiment scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, formation of stable coalitions of users, each exploiting
   resources in a femto-cell, and the resource allocation in each
   femto-cell is investigated in a UMTS long term evolution (LTE) network.
   We study a downlink scenario where users collaborate to increase network
   throughput and, simultaneously, attempt to increase their own payoffs.
   Payoffs to the users are defined as the monetary equivalent of the
   individual users' achievable throughput in the specified coalition
   structure. A distributed game-theoretic resource allocation mechanism is
   developed whereby users autonomously decide which sub-channel in which
   coalition to join. If each user operates according to the proposed
   algorithm, the sum throughput of all links converges with probability
   one to its maximum feasible value.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is a considerable need for tools to enable the evaluation of the
   safety of transit networks at the planning stage. One interesting
   approach for the planning of public transportation systems is the study
   of networks. Network techniques involve the analysis of systems by
   viewing them as a graph composed of a set of vertices (nodes) and edges
   (links). Once the transport system is visualized as a graph, various
   network properties can be evaluated based on the relationships between
   the network elements. Several indicators can be calculated including
   connectivity, coverage, directness and complexity, among others. The
   main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between
   network-based transit indicators and safety. The study develops
   macro-level collision prediction models that explicitly incorporate
   transit physical and operational elements and transit network indicators
   as explanatory variables. Several macro-level (zonal) collision
   prediction models were developed using a generalized linear regression
   technique, assuming a negative binomial error structure. The models were
   grouped into four main themes: transit infrastructure, transit network
   topology, transit route design, and transit performance and operations.
   The safety models showed that collisions were significantly associated
   with transit network properties such as: connectivity, coverage,
   overlapping degree and the Local Index of Transit Availability. As well,
   the models showed a significant relationship between collisions and some
   transit physical and operational attributes such as the number of
   routes, frequency of routes, bus density, length of bus and 3+ priority
   lanes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the multivariate structure of traffic accidents has been
   recognized in the safety literature for over a decade now, univariate
   identification and ranking of hotspots is still dominant. The present
   paper advocates the use of multivariate identification and ranking of
   hotspots based on statistical depth functions, which are useful tools
   for non-parametric multivariate analysis as they provide center-out
   ordering of multivariate data. Thus, a depth-based multivariate method
   is proposed for the identification and ranking of hotspots using the
   full Bayes (FB) approach. The proposed method is applied to a sample of
   236 signalized intersections in the Greater Vancouver Area. Various
   multivariate Poisson log-normal (MVPLN) models were used for data
   analysis. For each model, the FB posterior estimates were obtained using
   the Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and several
   goodness-of-fit measures were used for model selection. Using a depth
   threshold of 0.025, the proposed method identified 26 intersections
   (11\%) as potential hotspots. The choice of a depth threshold is a
   delicate decision and it is suggested to determine the threshold
   according to the amount of funding available for safety improvement,
   which is the usual practice in univariate hotspot identification (HSID).
   Also, the results show that the performance of the proposed multivariate
   depth-based FB HSID method is superior to that of an analogous method
   based on the depths of accident frequency (AF) in terms of sensitivity,
   specificity and the sum of norms (lengths) of Poisson mean vectors. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the application of full Bayes multivariate
   linear intervention models to evaluate the impact of the Signal Head
   Upgrade Program in the City of Surrey, British Columbia. The program was
   implemented by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) and
   is aimed at reducing the number of collisions by improving signal
   visibility. Specific improvements include: upgrading signal lens size,
   installing new backplates, adding reflective tapes to existing
   backplates, and installing additional signal heads. The evaluation
   utilizes full Bayes multivariate linear intervention models with a
   multiple regression links representing time, treatment, and interaction
   effects as well as the traffic volumes effects. The models were utilized
   to determine the safety impacts of the program on each combination of
   collision severity and collision time of occurrence (i.e.
   severe/day-time, severe/night-time, PDO/day-time, PDO/night-time) in the
   City of Surrey. The results indicated the effectiveness of the program
   in improving the safety of the treated intersections as there were
   reductions in all types of collisions at the treated sites after the
   improvement. However, such reductions were statistically significant
   only for night-time severe collisions and day-time PDO collisions. (C)

Abstract = {{We consider a multihop full duplex relaying (FDR) system, where multiple
   full duplex decode-and-forward relays are connected in cascade so as to
   forward the information from a source terminal to a destination

   relay, we introduce a parameter that captures the ability of the relays
   to isolate transmission from reception. This parameter is defined as the
   ratio of the received desired signal power to the received interference
   power, when the transmit power is the same for the useful and the
   interfering signals, and dubbed as ``path-loss-to-interference ratio{''}
   (PLIR). For given values of the PLIR, we investigate the number of full
   duplex relays that lead to the minimum outage probability. The
   performance of multihop half duplex relaying (HDR) is also studied as a

   probability, for sufficiently large values of PLIR.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate transmission protocols for relay-assisted free-space
   optical (FSO) systems, when multiple parallel relays are employed and
   there is no direct link between the source and the destination. As
   alternatives to all-active FSO relaying, where all the available relays
   transmit concurrently, we propose schemes that select only a single
   relay to participate in the communication between the source and the
   destination in each transmission slot. The selection is based on the
   channel state information obtained either from all or from the last used
   FSO links. Thus, the need for synchronization of the relays'
   transmissions is avoided, while the slowly varying nature of the
   atmospheric channel is exploited. For the considered relay selection and
   all-active relaying schemes, novel closed-form expressions for the
   outage performance are derived, assuming the versatile Gamma-Gamma
   channel model. In addition, based on the derived analytical results, the
   problem of optimizing the optical power resources of the FSO links is
   addressed. Optimal and more computationally attractive suboptimal
   solutions are proposed that lead to a power efficient system design.
   Numerical results for equal and non-equal length FSO links illustrate
   the merits of the proposed relay selection protocols compared to the
   all-active scheme and demonstrate the significant power savings offered
   by the proposed power allocation schemes.}},

Title = {{A comparative life cycle assessment of diesel and compressed natural gas

Abstract = {{Consumers and organizations worldwide are searching for low-carbon
   alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles to reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their impact on the environment. A
   comprehensive technique used to estimate overall cost and environmental
   impact of vehicles is known as life cycle assessment (LCA). In this
   article, a comparative LCA of diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG)
   powered heavy duty refuse collection vehicles (RCVs) is conducted. The
   analysis utilizes real-time operational data obtained from the City of
   Surrey in British Columbia, Canada. The impact of the two alternative
   vehicles is assessed from various points in their life. No net gain in
   energy use is found when a diesel powered RCV is replaced by a CNG
   powered RCV. However, significant reductions (approximately 24\%
   CO2-equivalent) in GHG and criteria air contaminant (CAC) emissions are
   obtained. Moreover, fuel cost estimations based on 2011 price levels and
   a 5-year lifetime for both RCVs reveal that considerable cost savings
   may be achieved by switching to CNG vehicles. Thus, CNG RCVs are not
   only favorable in terms of reduced climate change impact but also cost
   effective compared to conventional diesel RCVs, and provide a viable and
   realistic near-term strategy for cities and municipalities to reduce GHG
   emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{A bow-tie diagram combines a fault tree and an event tree to represent
   the risk control parameters on a common platform for mitigating an
   accident. Quantitative analysis of a bow-tie is still a major challenge
   since it follows the traditional assumptions of fault and event tree
   analyses. The assumptions consider the crisp probabilities and
   ``independent{''} relationships for the input events. The crisp
   probabilities for the input events are often missing or hard to come by,
   which introduces data uncertainty. The assumption of ``independence{''}
   introduces model uncertainty. Elicitation of expert's knowledge for the
   missing data may provide an alternative; however, such knowledge
   incorporates uncertainties and may undermine the credibility of risk
   analysis.
   This paper attempts to accommodate the expert's knowledge to overcome
   missing data and incorporate fuzzy set and evidence theory to assess the
   uncertainties. Further, dependency coefficient-based fuzzy and evidence
   theory approaches have been developed to address the model uncertainty
   for bow-tie analysis. In addition, a method of sensitivity analysis is
   proposed to predict the most contributing input events in the bow-tie
   analysis. To demonstrate the utility of the approaches in industrial
   application, a bow-tie diagram of the BP Texas City accident is
   developed and analyzed. (c) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{We examine the efficiency of emissions trading in bilateral and

   making decisions under imperfect and asymmetric information, and
   transaction costs. Results are derived using a stochastic agent-based
   simulation model of agents' decision-making and interactions. Trading
   rules, market structures, and agent information structures are selected
   to represent emerging water quality trading programs. The analysis is
   designed to provide a strong test of the efficiency of trading occurring
   through the two market structures. The Differential Evolution algorithm
   is used to search for market trade strategies that perform well under
   multiple states of the world. Our findings suggest that trading under
   both bilateral and clearinghouse markets yields cost savings relatively
   to no trading. The clearinghouse is found to be more efficient than
   bilateral negotiations in coordinating point-nonpoint trading under
   uncertainty and transaction costs. However, the market under both
   structures is unlikely to achieve or even approximate
   least-cost-pollution control allocations. Expectations of gains from
   water quality trading should, therefore, be tempered. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To demonstrate that manual prostate segmentation in transrectal
   ultrasound images can be replaced with semiautomatic segmentation.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Semiautomatic segmentation using a tapered
   ellipsoid model was applied to transrectal ultrasound images.
   Region-based volumetric evaluation was performed between original and
   physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours. For dosimetric assessment,
   treatment plans generated on semiautomatic contours were overlaid on
   physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours and dose parameters were
   computed. To establish a threshold for the acceptable amount of
   dosimetric degradation below which the adoption of semiautomatic
   planning is unacceptable, the range of variability in dosimetric quality
   attributed to manual variability was obtained and compared with that of
   semiautomatic contours.
   RESULTS: An average volume error (1 Dice similarity coefficient) of less
   than 7\% between semiautomatic and manual volumes (140 cases) was
   obtained. The difference between the mean V-100 of plans created for
   semiautomatic contours then overlaid on physician-reviewed semiautomatic
   contours and the original V100 values, that is, before overlaying on the
   physician-reviewed contours (41 cases) was lower than 5\%. An average
   total duration of 2-4 min, which includes algorithm initialization,
   11.67 +/- 3.57 s algorithm time, and contour modification is required
   per case. This algorithm is being used at the British Columbia Cancer
   Agency and to this date has been applied for the treatment of more than
   600 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: In terms of volumetric and dosimetric accuracy, the
   proposed algorithm is a suitable replacement for manual segmentation in
   the context of our planning technique. The benefits are shorter
   segmentation times; greater consistency; less reliance on user
   experience; and smooth, symmetric contours. (C) 2013 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{160}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{C1-C11}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the corrosion behavior of Nb with different
   microstructures, cold-rolled and annealed, was studied in phosphate
   buffered saline (PBS) solutions in the temperature range of 37 to 67
   degrees C. The chemical composition and electronic properties of the
   passive film were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and Mott-Schottky analysis. The results show that the annealed
   sample exhibits better corrosion resistance. Mott-Schottky analysis
   revealed that the passive films formed on niobium surfaces show n-type
   semiconductor behavior. The measured donor density is dependent on the
   frequency of the Mott-Schottky analysis, which can be eliminated by
   fitting the impedance data at different frequencies. The microstructure
   of the metal substrate affects the donor density of the passive film but
   not the flatband potential. No pitting or trans-passive behavior was
   observed for any samples up to 0.9 V and 67 degrees C. No significant
   difference of the chemical composition was observed among the passive
   films formed at 0.35 V on different treated samples. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{The quartz crystal microbalance technique coupled with cyclic
   voltammetry (referred to as electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
   (EQCM)) was employed to study the oxidation of BH4- on Au in alkaline
   media (0.1 M and 2 M NaOH, respectively) using a newly designed vertical
   cell to minimize the interference by evolved H-2. The electrode
   potential was scanned between -0.7 and 0.7 V vs. SHE with scan rates in
   the range of 0.01 V s(-1) and 1 V s(-1). The relative mass changes of
   the Au resonator-electrode were interpreted in combination with density
   functional theory (DFT) modeling and pertinent experimental results from
   the literature. The potential scan rate dependent mass change profiles
   revealed: i) weak adsorption of BH4- below -0.2 V leading to high anodic
   overpotential, ii) accumulation of reaction intermediates on the surface
   between approximately -0.2 V to 0.3 V (scan rate dependent), and iii) Au
   surface hydroxide and oxide assisted oxidation of BH4- and possibly of
   other active species present such as BH3OH- formed by hydrolysis. (C)

Abstract = {{HOX genes have been implicated as regulators of normal and leukemic stem
   cell functionality, but the extent to which these activities are linked
   is poorly understood. Previous studies revealed that transduction of
   primitive mouse hematopoietic cells with a NUP98HOXA10homeodomain
   (NA10HD) fusion gene enables a subsequent rapid and marked expansion in
   vitro of hematopoietic stem cell numbers without causing their
   transformation or deregulated expansion in vivo. To determine whether
   forced expression of NA10HD in primitive human cells would have a
   similar effect, we compared the number of long-term culture-initiating
   cells (LTC-ICs) present in cultures of lenti-NA10HD versus control
   virus-transduced CD34(+) cells originally isolated from human cord blood
   and chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. We found
   that NA10HD greatly increases outputs of both normal and Ph+/BCR-ABL(+)
   LTC-ICs, and this effect is particularly pronounced in cultures
   containing growth factor-producing feeders. Interestingly, NA10HD did
   not affect the initial cell cycle kinetics of the transduced cells nor
   their subsequent differentiation. Moreover, immunodeficient mice
   repopulated with NA10HD-transduced CP-CML cells for more than 8 months
   showed no evidence of altered behavior. Thus, NA10HD provides a novel
   tool to enhance both normal and CP-CML stem cell expansion in vitro,
   without apparently altering other properties. Leukemia (2013) 27,

Title = {{Safety performance functions using traffic conflicts}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{160-164}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that traffic conflicts provide useful insight
   into the failure mechanism that leads to road collisions while being
   more frequent and of minor social cost. However, the relationship
   between collisions and conflicts must first be established in order to
   use traffic conflicts as surrogates to collisions for safety analysis.
   To investigate the relationship between conflicts and collisions, a
   two-phase model is proposed where a lognormal model is employed in the
   first phase to predict conflicts using traffic volume, area type
   (urban/suburban) and some geometric-related variables as covariates. In
   the second phase, a conflicts-based negative binomial (NB) safety
   performance function (SPF) is then employed to predict collisions. The
   proposed model was applied to a dataset corresponding to 51 signalized
   intersections in British Columbia. The results show that a significant
   proportional relationship exists between conflicts and collisions where
   the moderating effects of conflicts on collisions are non-linear with
   decreasing rates. The scaled deviance and Pearson chi(2) goodness of fit
   measures indicated that the proposed NB model has adequately fitted the
   data. The finding that conflicts can be used to represent collisions
   calls for further research on the countermeasures needed to reduce
   conflicts as effective means for decreasing collision frequency. Apart
   from the traffic- and geometric-based traditional countermeasures, new
   driving-behavior-based measures should be devised that would hopefully
   have a downward influence on collisions. Crown Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In a water distribution system, low or negative pressure may occur under
   normal operation and may lead to contaminant intrusion. To assess the
   risk associated with contaminant intrusion, exposure assessment is
   required. To obtain a more accurate intrusion exposure assessment, the
   effects of the surrounding soil on the intrusion rate must be
   considered. This article proposes a model that would provide a more
   realistic estimation of intrusion rate. A two-level factorial design was
   used to screen the effect of contributing factors in contaminant
   intrusion. The Buckingham pi theorem was applied to group the
   influential factors into a set of dimensionless pi parameters. The
   relationship among the pi parameters was obtained by using the numerical
   data generated by a two-dimensional finite element model for flow in a
   saturated zone surrounding a pipe. A regression analysis was then
   applied to find the best fit for the data.}},

Abstract = {{We present a noninvasive method for characterizing the refractive index
   (RI) and thickness distribution in biological tissues using a combined
   multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   system. Tissue layers are distinguished by the MPM and OCT images, and
   the RI and thickness of each layer are determined by analyzing the
   co-registered MPM and OCT images. The precision of this method is
   evaluated on four standard samples which are water, air, immersion oil
   and cover glass. Precision of within similar to 1\% error compared to
   reference values is obtained. Biological tissue measurement is
   demonstrated on fish cornea. Three layers are detected, which are
   identified as the epithelium and stroma I and II of the cornea. The
   corresponding RI of each layer is measured to be similar to 1.446-1.448,
   1.345-1.372, and 1.392-1.436, respectively. The difference of RI in the
   three layers correlates with the tissue compositions including cells in
   epithelium, large collagen fiber bundles in stroma I, and small collagen
   fibers in stroma II. The combined MPM/OCT technique is shown to be able
   to distinguish tissue layers through biochemically specific contrasts
   and measure RI and thickness of tissue layers at different depths. (C)

Abstract = {{Oxidative torrefaction of sawdust with a carrier gas containing 3-6\%
   O-2 was investigated in a TG and a fluidized bed reactor, with the
   properties of the torrefied sawdust and pellets compared with
   traditional torrefaction without any O-2, as well as the dry raw
   material. It is found that the oxidative torrefaction process produced
   torrefied sawdust and pellets of similar properties as normally
   torrefied sawdust and corresponding pellets, especially on the density,
   energy consumption for pelletization, higher heating value and energy
   yield. For moisture absorption and hardness of the torrefied pellets,
   the oxidative torrefaction process showed slightly poor but negligible
   performance. Therefore, it is feasible to use oxygen laden combustion
   flue gases as the carrier gas for torrefaction of biomass. Besides,
   torrefied sawdust can be made into dense and strong pellets of high
   hydrophobicity at a higher die temperature than normally used in the
   production of traditional control pellets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A field investigation was carried out to determine PBDE concentrations
   over a one-year period in agricultural soils onto which 80 tonnes
   biosolids/hectare had been applied. The PBDE concentrations increased
   from 80 to 300 pg/g dry weight basis to 300 x 10(3)-600 x 10(3) pg/g dw
   due to biosolids application, and PBDEs migrated downwards to depths of
   at least 0.85 m. Concentrations decreased non-uniformly with depth. PBDE
   levels decreased exponentially in the topmost biosolids-amended soils
   layer, while increasing in the next underlying soil layer over the
   one-year period. The rate of decrease of total PBDE mass in the top
   0.00-0.05 m layer was almost two orders of magnitude greater than the
   rates of increase in total PBDE mass in the lower layers, indicating
   that effects such as photodegradation and/or volatilization likely were
   to have been significant in the surface layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Using temperature measurements from inside a solid to determine boundary
   conditions is a common inverse heat conduction problem. These problems
   are ill-posed and a robust mathematical solution is not available.
   Stochastical search algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) have been found to be effective in dealing with
   these problems. However, they require large population size and do not
   use the gradient information and, therefore, their computational costs
   are higher than their gradient based alternatives. This is especially
   true when using a computationally expensive method like finite element
   analysis as the direct solver. A computationally cheaper substitute is
   using surrogate models. They construct an approximation to the direct
   problem using a set of available data and the underlying physics of the
   problem. This idea has been employed in this research. The result is a
   method that has the stability and effectiveness of evolutionary
   algorithms with a much lower computational cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ferric reduction on the surface of pyrite, a major factor governing the
   overall kinetics of pyrite-assisted leaching of chalcopyrite in sulfate
   solutions, is investigated. In order to study the effect of pyrite on
   chalcopyrite leaching, four different pyrite samples were used in the
   leaching process. A single-particle microelectrode technique was
   employed to investigate the electrochemical and semiconducting
   properties of different pyrite samples by means of cyclic voltammetry
   (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Mott-Schottky methods
   in a solution containing 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid, 0.005 mol/L ferric
   sulfate, and 0.005 mol/L ferrous sulfate. During leaching, differences
   were observed in the behavior of different pyrite samples. CV showed a
   difference in the magnitude of the ferric reduction reaction peaks. An
   equivalent analog circuit was used to model the impedance spectra, which
   led to the conclusion that pyrite samples with lower charge transfer
   resistance are better catalysts for ferric reduction. Mott-Schottky
   analysis was used to quantify variations in some semiconductive and
   electrical properties of pyrite samples from different geographical
   locations.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{205-226}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a robust outdoor stereo vision simultaneous
   localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. It estimates camera pose
   reliably in outdoor environments with directional sunlight illumination
   causing shadows and non-uniform scene lighting. The algorithm has been
   developed to measure a mining rope shovel's rotation angle about its
   vertical axis ({''}swing{''} axis). A stereo camera is mounted
   externally to the shovel house (upper revolvable portion of the shovel),
   with a clear view of the shovel's lower carbody. As the shovel house
   swings, the camera revolves with the shovel house in a planar circular
   orbit, seeing differing views of the carbody top. During the swing, the
   SLAM algorithm builds a map of observed 3D features on the carbody and
   simultaneously using these landmarks to estimate the camera position.
   This estimated camera position is then used to compute the shovel swing
   angle. Two novel techniques are employed to improve the SLAM algorithm's
   robustness in outdoor environments. First, a ``Locally Maximal{''}
   feature selection technique for Harris corners is used to select
   features more consistently in non-uniformly illuminated scenes. Another
   novel technique is the use of 3D ``Feature Clusters{''} as SLAM
   landmarks rather than individual single features. The Feature Cluster
   landmarks improve the robustness of the landmark matching and allow
   significant reduction of the SLAM filter computational cost. This
   approach of estimating the shovel swing angle has a maximum error of +/-
   1A degrees upon SLAM map convergence. Results demonstrate the
   improvements of using the novel techniques compared to previous methods.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{1203-1211}},
Abstract = {{The performance of the modified laminar flamelet probability density
   function (MLF-PDF) is studied as a presumed PDF for the PCM-FPI
   combustion model in LES. PCM-FPI is a low-cost flamelet model for
   turbulence-chemistry interactions in premixed and partially-premixed
   flames. The MLF-PDF couples the FPI tabulated detailed chemistry model
   with large eddy simulation. The performance of this PDF was examined
   before in an a priori analysis with DNS data {[}13] and in RANS
   simulations of laboratory-scale burners {[}14]. In this work, this PDF
   is first compared to the actual experimental PDF. Then it is
   demonstrated that the MLF-PDF recovers the filtered laminar flame speed
   which is an important factor when turbulence scales are larger than the
   flame thickness and are mostly resolved in the grid scale. Finally, this
   PDF is used in LES of a turbulent premixed bunsen flame. The mean radial
   distributions of temperature, a few major species and two radical
   species mass fractions are compared with experimental data. The results
   show that this new PDF is a viable option for the statistics of sub-grid
   scale progress variable fluctuations. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Egypt is located in the Northeast of Africa where oil and gas (O\&G) are
   produced offshore from the Gulf of Suez and the Southeast part of the
   Mediterranean. The O\&G production in Egypt is distributed as follows:
   70\% from Gulf of Suez, 16\% from Western desert, 8\% from the Sinai
   Peninsula and 6\% from Eastern desert. Past O\&G activities, refining
   and transport have resulted in chronic pollution in Egyptian offshore
   and numerous environmental programs have been initiated to protect new
   development areas from the environmental impacts. The offshore drilling
   process uses drilling fluids (mud) and generates waste fluids and
   cuttings, which could be the largest discharges going into the receiving
   water bodies. There are several options to manage offshore drilling
   wastes: offshore discharge, offshore down-hole injection and onshore
   disposal. Water-based drilling fluids (WBF) are commonly employed for
   drilling in Egyptian offshore because of their expected environmental
   benign behavior. The main objective of this paper is to develop a
   methodology to determine the fate of heavy metals associated with WBF
   drilling waste in the marine environment and estimate the associated
   ecological risks. Proposed contaminant fate model is based on an
   aquivalence approach, which has been integrated with fuzzy-based
   analysis to study the uncertainties. This research concluded that the
   impacts of heavy metals associated with the drilling waste discharges in
   the receiving waters are minimal.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{68-82}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Managing change in project schedules is a complex problem in
   construction management. To effectively manage, analyze, and revise
   schedules, planners need to identify when and how activities and
   constraints can be changed, develop various schedule alternatives, and
   determine the effect of changes on related activities. Existing software
   tools enable users to generate and visualize a schedule from a list of
   activities and time-based constraints, and to show multiple bars for an
   activity to reflect different versions of a schedule. However, there is
   little visual support for interacting with schedules, and for exploring
   and comparing alternative versions of a schedule. We present a schedule
   visualization tool called TASM (Tool for Advanced Schedule Management)
   that addresses these limitations. TASM augments traditional Gantt charts
   and network diagrams by directly representing constraint types, network
   chains, and flexibility of activity timing. We also implemented new
   techniques to visualize schedule differences when comparing multiple
   schedules. Our tests demonstrate that these techniques enhance
   traditional schedule visualization methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We study the adsorption of borohydride on Au and Au-based alloys (Au3M
   with M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) using first-principles calculations
   based on spin-polarized density functional theory. Favorable molecular
   adsorption and greater adsorption stability compared to pure Au are
   achieved on Au3M alloys. For these alloys, there is an emergence of
   unoccupied states in the surface d band around the Fermi level with
   respect to the fully occupied d band of pure Au. Thus, the derived
   antibonding state of the sp-d interaction is upshifted and becomes
   unoccupied compared to pure Au. The B-H bond elongation of the adsorbed
   borohydride on these alloy surfaces points to the role of
   surface-parallel (d(xy) and d(x2-y2) states) components of the d-band of
   the alloying metal M, most pronouncedly in the cases of M = Co or Ni. On
   the alloy surfaces, B binds directly with the alloying metal, unlike in
   the case of pure Au where the surface bonding is through the H atoms.
   These results pose relevant insights into the design of Au-based anode
   catalysts for the direct borohydride fuel cell.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates yielding and flow of nanocrystalline cellulose
   (NCC) suspensions by combining rheological measurements with light
   scattering echo (LS-echo). The NCC samples are characterized using
   static and dynamic light scattering as well as polarized optical
   microscopy coupled with a rotational rheometer. The storage modulus of
   the NCC suspensions is found to increase with waiting time after shear
   rejuvenation. The microscopic particle rearrangements of the NCC
   spindles are followed by LS-echo at both short and long waiting times
   under oscillatory shear flow. We find that the onset of shear-induced
   irreversible microscopic particle rearrangements, coincide with the
   strain at which storage and loss moduli cross over in the nonlinear
   viscoelastic regime identified by the macroscopic yield point of the
   sample. The yielding transition is found to occur at a higher strain as
   the frequency of oscillation increases. (C) 2013 The Society of

Abstract = {{In this article, the anti-plane deformation of a typical dissimilar
   sector consists of two sub-sectors attached to each other on one
   circular edge is studied. The solution of a Volterra type screw
   dislocation problem in the sector is obtained through finite Fourier
   cosine transform. Exact closed-form solutions for the displacement and
   stress fields are also presented. Next, using a distributed dislocation
   method, integral equations of the sectors weakened by cracks and
   cavities under an anti-plane traction are obtained. The defects are
   assumed to be located only in one of the sub-sector regions. The
   obtained equations for the latter problem are of the Cauchy singular
   type and have been solved numerically. Several examples are presented to
   demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed solution
   procedure. The geometric and force singularities of the stress field are
   studied and compared to those reported in the literature. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Effective thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are important
   properties for studying the self-heating during wood pellets storage. A
   modified line heat source within a wood pellets container was used to
   determine the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of wood
   pellets with moisture content ranging from 1.4\% to 9\% w.b. A second
   order partial differential equation describing transient temperature
   distribution within the test container was numerically solved for
   temporal and spatial temperatures. The difference between experimental
   and numerical temperatures was minimized to estimate an effective
   thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity for the bulk pellets.
   The estimated thermal conductivity ranged from 0.146 to 0.192 W/(m K)
   increasing with moisture content. An empirical relationship among
   effective thermal conductivity, moisture content and porosity was
   developed. The dependence of effective thermal conductivity on pellets
   size was negligible. The estimated specific heat capacity of pellets
   ranged from 1.074 to 1.253 kJ/(kg K) in the tested range. A relation
   between specific heat capacity and moisture content was developed for
   general wood pellets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an occlusion handling system, applied to
   articulated telepresence platforms, that simultaneously reduces the
   control burden on the operator and ensures the continuity of the visual
   interaction. Articulated telepresence systems improve the sense of
   presence of the operator by allowing the operator to maintain facial
   contact even during a walking conversation. However, the additional
   control of the articulated system, along with controlling navigation and
   carrying on a conversation can distract the operator and degrade the
   telepresence experience for both parties. Thus, we propose a
   semi-autonomous system that, along with visual tracking, can help
   relieve the burden of managing the articulated platform by clearing
   occlusions that might arise between the telepresense platform and the
   second party (the interlocuter). In particular, we demonstrate the
   application of a lost target recovery algorithm (LTRA) in a telepresence
   system.
   As the nature of a telepresence system requires fast recovery from
   occlusions through smooth motions, we improve the applied LTRA
   performance by adopting a numerical Inverse Kinematics solver and
   introducing a Cartesian space sampling method to generate optimal
   clearing motions. Finally, to validate different occlusion clearing
   methods, we implement them on an articulated telepresense platform.
   Experimental results for various scenarios support the feasibility of
   our approach to quickly recover visual contact in telepresence systems
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{Throughput processing involves using many different contexts or threads
   to solve multiple problems or subproblems in parallel, where the size of
   the problem is large enough that latency can be tolerated. Bandwidth is
   required to support multiple concurrent executions, however, and
   utilizing multiple external memory channels is costly. For small working
   sets, FPGA designers can use on-chip BRAMs achieve the necessary
   bandwidth without increasing the sytem cost. Designing algorithms around
   fixed-size local memories is difficult, however, as there is no graceful
   fallback if the problem size exceeds the amount of local memory. This
   paper introduces TputCache, a cache designed to meet the needs of
   throughput processing on FPGAs, giving the throughput performance of
   on-chip BRAMs when the problem size fits in local memory. The design
   utilizes a replay based architecture to achive high frequency with very
   low resource overheads.}},

Abstract = {{In crowdsourcing systems, worker selection is a challenging issue.
   Researchers have advocated the incorporation of reputation management
   into crowdsourcing systems to address this issue. However, current
   reputation-based decisions often result in concentrating the delegation
   of human intelligence tasks (HITs) to a small number of highly reputable
   workers to reduce risk. It conflicts with the main objective of
   crowdsourcing systems which is to promote mass collaboration. In this
   paper, we propose a situation-aware approach - SWORD - to enable
   existing reputation models to work in crowdsourcing systems. We
   holistically consider the objectives of all stake-holders in a
   crowdsourcing system (including requesters, workers, and system
   operators) to formulate the HIT allocation problem as a trade-off
   between quality and timeliness, and propose an efficient approach via
   constraint optimization to produce solutions to this problem with low
   computational complexity. Extensive simulations designed based on the
   actual conditions from Amazon's Mechanical Turk system demonstrates
   significant advantage of SWORD compared to existing approaches in
   improving social welfare.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to
   estimate both respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) from the
   photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal obtained from pulse oximetry. The
   spectral analysis of the EMD applied to the PPG signal was used to
   extract two signals, the respiratory and cardiac modulations
   respectively. On these modulated signals, an additional spectral
   analysis was applied to calculate their frequency peaks. To improve
   spectral resolution a parametric power spectral analysis based on
   autoregressive modelling was selected. The frequency peak found in the
   respiratory and cardiac signals reflects RR and HR, respectively. The
   PPG signals were analysed using a 1-min sliding window with 50\%
   overlap. The RR and HR estimation accuracy was assessed using the
   unnormalized root mean square (RMS) error. Median errors (quartiles)
   were calculated to account for the non-normal RMS distribution. The test
   dataset consisted of 8-min PPG and capnometric signals from 29
   paediatric and 13 adults cases (42 subjects in total) containing
   reliable recordings of either spontaneous or controlled breathing. A
   research assistant manually labelled the signals. The reference RR (from
   capnogram) and HR (from PPG) were manually extracted. The median RMS
   error (quartiles) obtained for RR was 3.5 (1.1, 11) breaths/min and for
   HR was 0.35 (0.2, 0.59) beats/min. Therefore, the spectral analysis of
   the respiratory and cardiac signals extracted through EMD, introduces a
   useful method to estimate and monitor RR and HR simultaneously from the
   PPG signal obtained from pulse oximetry.}},

Abstract = {{Heart Rate Variability (HRV), the variation of time intervals between
   heartbeats, is an indirect and noninvasive method for monitoring the
   autonomic activities that control heart rate. Traditionally, HRV is
   measured from the electrocardiogram. In this study, we estimated HRV
   from the photoplethysmogram (PPG), called pulse rate variability (PRV)
   and investigated the effects of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and
   different sleep stages on it. We recorded the overnight PPG signals from
   160 children using the Phone Oximeter, an oximeter connected to a mobile
   phone, simultaneously with the other signals within standard
   polysomnography. We analysed the mean pulse-to-pulse intervals, the
   power of low (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands of PRV and also the
   ratio of LF power to HF power (LF/HF) in the children with SDB during
   non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The
   results showed that the normalized LF increased in children with SDB
   (from 0.26 +/- 0.12 to 0.29 +/- 0.13 during non-REM sleep and from 0.37
   +/- 0.12 to 0.40 +/- 0.15 during REM sleep), the LF/HF ratio increased
   in children with SDB (from 0.67 +/- 0.55 to 1.05 +/- 1.00 in non-REM
   sleep and from 1.46 +/- 2.20 to 1.74 +/- 1.38 in REM) and the HF
   components decreased in children with SDB (from 0.61 +/- 0.16 to 0.55
   +/- 0.17 in non-REM sleep and from 0.47 +/- 0.14 to 0.43 +/- 0.16 in REM
   sleep). The results may confirm the pronounced sympathetic and the
   diminished parasympathetic activity in children with SDB. This study
   indicates that PRV obtained from the PPG reflects the autonomic
   regulation of heart rate in disordered breathing during different sleep
   stages.}},

Abstract = {{Although robot-assisted rehabilitation regimens are as effective,
   functionally, as conventional therapies, they still lack features to
   increase patients' engagement in the regimen. Providing rehabilitation
   tasks at a ``desirable difficulty{''} is one of the ways to address this
   issue and increase the motivation of a patient to continue with the
   therapy program. Then the problem is to design a system that is capable
   of estimating the user's desirable difficulty, and ultimately, modifying
   the task based on this prediction. In this paper we compared the
   performance of three machine learning algorithms in predicting a user's
   desirable difficulty during a typical reaching motion rehabilitation
   task. Different levels of error amplification were used as different
   levels of task difficulty. We explored the usefulness of using
   participants' motor performance and physiological signals during the
   reaching task in prediction of their desirable difficulties. Results
   showed that a Neural Network approach gives higher prediction accuracy
   in comparison with models based on k-Nearest Neighbor and Discriminant
   Analysis methods.}},

   equally spaced 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
   constellation where the code rate matches with the modulation order as
   required in TCM transmission. In this paper, we consider and analyze a
   new BICM-T design that uses a non equally spaced signal constellation in
   conjunction with a bit level multiplexer. With this design and analysis,
   one can not only exploit the full benefit of BICM-T design by jointly
   optimizing different transceiver's modules but also enjoys the same
   design flexibility as the traditional BICM to independently choose the
   code rate and the modulation order. The presented numerical results for
   64-ary QAM with rate 1/3 code shows that the considered design can offer
   gains up to 2.5 dB over the traditional optimal BICM design for a target
   bit error rate (BER) of 10(-6).}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust spectrum sensing strategy to identify
   white-spaces in the unlicensed 2.4GHz ISM band where radio transmission
   technologies coexist. Implicitly, collocated networks have different
   levels of spectrum access priority due to their design parameters (e.g.,
   transmission power, modulation and coding), such that a WLAN tends to
   achieve a higher access priority compared to a coexisting WPAN. Instead
   of using a predetermined radio channel in the ISM band, a device can
   perform dynamic spectrum access using a frequency agile radio to take
   advantage of spectrum holes that are found between transmissions of
   collocated networks, thus improving its opportunities to access the ISM
   band for interference-free transmissions. This paper proposes the dual
   spectrum sensing strategy for capturing spectrum holes that are wide
   enough to accommodate the transmissions of a device. Our method makes no
   assumption about the technologies (e.g., modulation schemes or power
   spectral density) of detected radio transmissions, and properly handles
   power variations in the form of gradually changing power values as well
   as sharp rise/fall edges in the detection of occupied parts of the
   spectrum. Field test results show that ample white-spaces exist to
   enable frequency-agile IEEE 802.15.4-based devices to access the ISM
   band opportunistically.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) receive a lot of attention because of
   their great potential in monitoring the physical or environmental
   conditions of military, industry, and civilian. Moreover, mobile cloud
   computing (MCC) is widely focused, as they can greatly alleviate the
   hardware limit of mobile devices as well as enable a lot of new mobile
   applications. All these make the integration of WSNs and MCC a very hot
   research topic. In this paper, we first observe a context non-awareness
   issue between mobile user and WSNs, which affects the mobile user
   obtaining the desirable data when integrating WSNs and MCC. Then
   focusing on solving the context nonawareness issue to provide desirable
   data to mobile users, we propose a novel framework for integrating WSNs
   and MCC. The proposed framework performs data recommendation, data
   prediction as well as data traffic monitoring in the cloud to obtain the
   data feature information required by the mobile users and potential
   status of WSNs. Then these user data feature information and potential
   WSNs status information are utilized to optimize the deployment of WSNs
   and check the status of WSNs. This could in turn offer the desirable
   data to the mobile users. Extensive evaluations also validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{In a sensor network, each sensor has a limited energy supply. Therefore,
   it is critical to minimize the power consumed by each sensor to maximize
   its lifetime. Video sensor networks differ from conventional sensor
   networks in the fact that video compression at the sensor node consumes
   a significant amount of power comparable to that used for communication.
   This poses new challenges, and renders power efficient algorithms
   developed for sensor networks not suitable for video sensor networks. In
   this paper, we develop an algorithm for the minimization of the total
   consumed power by jointly optimizing the encoding power, the
   transmission power, and the source rate at each sensor node.
   Furthermore, MAC layer resource allocation is incorporated into the
   minimization problem. Video signal distortion due to compression, and
   packet losses in the wireless channel are studied as well. An efficient
   solution algorithm is developed using Lagrange duality to solve the
   minimization problem. Through numerical results, the trade-off between
   allocating power to the encoding process or the transmission process is
   characterized. Moreover, the interaction between the nodes competing for
   channel resources, and how this affects their power consumption and
   distortion levels is studied.}},

   solution to enable high data rate services for indoor environments. In
   this work, we consider an indoor PLC network where several devices (or

   the use of a relay at a central location to assist the users in their
   data communication. For this scenario, we suggest the application of
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-way relaying (MWR) based on
   physical-layer network coding at the relay. To evaluate the performance
   of this scheme, its achievable data rate is studied with practical
   assumptions applicable to PLC systems. Our study shows that the employed
   AF MWR improves the system performance and increases the achievable

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study rate allocation mechanisms that allocate
   available transmission rate of a particular cognitive radio (CR) user
   among its different class of services. In particular, we formulate the
   rate allocation mechanism of a CR user between its two different class
   of services namely, delay sensitive (DS) and best effort (BE) services
   as a Markov decision process. Then the optimal rate allocation mechanism
   that minimizes the average queuing delay of DS service while
   guaranteeing the packet loss probabilities of both class of services is
   obtained using a linear programming technique. Since the optimal rate
   allocation mechanism can be complex to implement in practice, we study a
   low-complexity suboptimal rate allocation mechanism. For this suboptimal
   scheme, we develop a queuing analytic model in order to measure
   different quality parameters. Selected numerical results show that the
   performance of suboptimal rate allocation mechanism is quite similar to
   the optimal rate allocation mechanism for the considered system
   parameters. The developed queuing analytic model is also useful for call
   admission controller design when the suboptimal scheme is employed.}},

Abstract = {{The answer is (in general) affirmative: For a given target bit error
   rate (BER), cooperation reduces the average transmitted power per user
   when partners are appropriately selected. The more cooperating users are
   available and the larger the propagation exponent, the larger the
   reduction on transmitted power per user. This conclusion is drawn from a
   preliminary study which considers a community of users located randomly
   along a straight line. The users communicate with a Base Station (BS)
   located at the end of this line, and the transmission is subject to path
   loss. The communication is established either directly (Direct Mode), or
   via another member of the community (Relaying Mode). We show that the
   total power needed to achieve a certain BER at the BS is on average
   lower for the Relaying Mode than for the Direct Mode, even without
   exploiting any receive diversity benefit. There exist cases, however,
   where the Relaying Mode is not beneficial. This is true for environments
   with a propagation exponent smaller than two (delta < 2). For delta = 2,
   the Relaying Mode performs identical to the Direct Mode.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless systems that carry delay-sensitive information (such as speech
   and/or video signals) typically transmit with fixed data rates, but may
   occasionally suffer from transmission outages caused by the random
   nature of the fading channels. If the transmitter has instantaneous
   channel state information (CSI) available, it can compensate for a
   significant portion of these outages by utilizing power allocation. In a
   conventional dual-hop bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
   system, the relay already has instantaneous CSI of both links available,
   as this is required for relay gain adjustment. We therefore develop an
   optimal power allocation strategy for the relay, which adjusts its
   instantaneous output power to the minimum level required to avoid
   outages, but only if the required output power is below some cutoff
   level; otherwise, the relay is silent in order to conserve power and
   prolong its lifetime. The proposed scheme is proven to minimize the
   system outage probability, subject to an average power constraint at the
   relay and fixed output powers at the end nodes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study uplink resource management in a two-tier
   macro-femto heterogeneous system with hybrid access control. We consider
   a system where a macro base station (MBS) and a femto base station (FBS)
   together serve a number of mobile users. In this system, base stations
   and users make decisions in various resource management processes with
   different optimization objectives. Such decision making processes are
   usually correlated and an efficient mechanism is needed to coordinate
   the decision makers. We propose a four-stage resource management
   mechanism where access control, resource allocation (in both frequency
   and time domain) and power control are performed sequentially at the
   base stations and users, respectively. We formulate a resource
   management problem and find the optimal decisions for base stations and
   users. We show that this mechanism provides incentive for the FBS to
   operate in hybrid access mode. Simulation results show that the proposed
   resource management mechanism achieves a better performance than the
   mechanism with closed access.}},

Abstract = {{When incorporating machine-to-machine (M2M) communications into Long
   Term Evolution (LTE) networks, one of the challenges is the traffic
   overload due to a large number of machine type communications (MTC)
   devices with bursty traffic. One approach to tackle this problem is to
   use the access class barring (ACB) mechanism to regulate the opportunity
   of MTC devices to transmit request packets. In this paper, we first
   present an analytical model to determine the expected total access delay
   of all the MTC devices. For the ideal case that the LTE base station
   (eNodeB) knows the number of backlogged users, we determine the optimal
   value of the ACB factor, which can best reduce the congestion and access
   delay. For the practical scenario, we propose a heuristic algorithm to
   adaptively change the ACB factor without the knowledge of the number of
   backlogged users. Results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm
   achieves near optimal performance in reducing access delay.}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in parallel cooperative transmissions between
   multiple source-destination pairs, interference cancellation (IC) can be
   achieved to improve sum data rate for one group of cooperating users.
   However, from the perspective of network capacity, user cooperation may
   not be always appealing, since the increased sum data rate of
   cooperating users comes at the price of blocking more neighboring users.
   In this paper, we study the potential benefits/drawbacks of cooperative
   communications on network capacity. We show that, in terms of network
   capacity, cooperative communications do not always outperform
   traditional non-cooperative communications, and cooperative
   communications should be dynamically applied in topology control to
   optimize the overall network capacity. Specifically, we propose a
   distributed Cooperative topology control scheme with Opportunistic IC
   (COIC) to improve network capacity. Simulation results are presented to
   show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

   of traffic patterns of primary users, in the form of random signal

   Some of the existing works, however, resort to certain approximation
   techniques to characterize the detection performance. In this paper,
   given a pair of arrival and departure time instants, we first derive an
   exact expression for the conditional detection probability. The exact
   mean detection probability is then obtained via an average operation
   over the random arrival and departure times. To improve the robustness
   of the detection performance against random signal arrival and
   departure, we further propose a Bayesian-based ED scheme. We present
   simulation results to validate our analytic study, and show the

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a very hot research focus of both
   academia and industries, since it can greatly relieve the hardware
   limitation of mobile devices as well as create new fascinating mobile
   services with its tremendous storage and processing ability. Moreover,
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been attracting attention for about
   two decades, because of its powerful capability to detect physical or
   environmental conditions. Motivated by incorporating the advantages of
   both MCC and WSNs, a lot of schemes which integrate MCC with WSNs have
   been proposed for exploiting the cloud to share the data gathered by
   WSNs to mobile users. Particularly, all current integration frameworks
   utilize the always-on WSNs to collect sensory data for cloud clients,
   since the data requests of mobile users generally require being
   responded in real-time. However, these MCC and WSNs integration schemes
   ignore the following two observations: 1) the specific data cloud
   clients request usually depends on the current location of cloud clients
   2) most sensors are usually equipped with non-rechargeable batteries
   with limited energy. In this paper, motivated by the above two issues,
   we present two novel collaborative location-based sleep scheduling
   (CLSS) schemes for WSNs to integrate with MCC. Based on the location of
   mobile user, CLSS dynamically determines the awake or asleep status of
   each sensor node to save energy consumption of WSNs. Theoretical and
   simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a prolonged
   network lifetime of WSNs while still satisfy the data requests of mobile
   users.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based building management system
   (BMS) architecture for a short-term cooling load forecasting mechanism
   to manage the building cooling system (BCS) and reduce the cost of BCS
   construction and maintenance. The BCS is very important to economize on
   air conditioning since a huge amount of energy is consumed by the
   cooling system of buildings in summer time and some recent work has
   attempted to manage the BCS using short-term cooling load forecasting.
   In order to have accurate forecasts, however, excellent computing
   systems are necessary to predict and control the BCS based on a huge
   amount of past energy consumption data with rapid processing speed.
   Hence, in the proposed architecture, we use centralized computing
   resources and storages to predict and control the BCS. Furthermore, we
   propose a model with short-term cooling load forecasting and semantic
   analysis system that uses data mining techniques to improve the
   forecasting accuracy. Through our performance results, the proposed
   forecasting model outperforms another scheme in terms of the forecasting
   accuracy to control the BCS and it is expected that the cost of the BCS
   maintenance will be greatly reduced with the cloud-based BMS
   architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Bit-error rate (BER) performance of subcarrier M-ary phase-shift keying
   (MPSK) and M-ary differential PSK (MDPSK) is analyzed for optical
   wireless communications in Gamma-Gamma turbulence. We study the relation
   between the exact BER and the approximate BER, which is obtained by
   dividing the symbol error rate by the number of bits per symbol, for
   subcarrier MPSK and MDPSK modulations. The asymptotic performance gap
   between the exact and the approximate BERs is quantified analytically
   through our asymptotic analyses. The accuracy of the approximate BER of
   both MPSK and MDPSK depends on the channel conditions. Under weak
   turbulence conditions, the approximate BER expression can be used to
   predict the system performance with high accuracy, while under strong
   turbulence conditions the approximate BER becomes inaccurate and can
   only serve as a loose lower bound of the exact BER. The asymptotic BER
   performance loss of MDPSK with respect to MPSK is also quantified
   analytically.}},

   we derive the optimal linear precoding transmitter according to the
   minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion. Different from similar
   problems in RF wireless communication, we need to take constraints
   resulting from the LED linearity region and its use as an illumination
   device into account. Since the precoder design requires channel
   knowledge at the transmitter, usually provided through a low-rate RF or

   practically relevant case of imperfect channel estimation. Numerical
   results for VLC with different system parameters are presented to

Abstract = {{Exact error rate analysis for pre-detection equal gain combining over
   arbitrarily correlated fading branches has proven elusive. Even
   specialized correlation models result in complex error rate expressions
   with multiple nested infinite series or integrals. For this reason,
   asymptotic analysis is a useful tool due to the simplicity of the error
   rate expressions it produces. However, one major shortcoming of this
   approach is that the asymptotic technique can not predict at what
   signal-to-noise ratio the asymptotic approximation is accurate. In this
   paper, we derive asymptotically tight single-integral lower and upper
   bounds on the error probability for a correlated generalized Rician
   fading model. These lower and upper bounds help determine when the
   asymptotic solutions approach the exact results.}},

   derived using a series expansion of the modified Bessel function. In

Abstract = {{Free-space optical links are vulnerable to atmospheric fading and
   pointing errors. When a laser beam wanders, most previous works model
   the random radial displacement distance of the pointing error as a
   Rayleigh distributed random variable. However, for a non-ideally
   fast-tracked laser beam, the radial displacement distance at the
   receiver aperture may not obey the Rayleigh distribution, since the
   displacements in vertical and horizontal directions may not always
   follow a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we generalize a
   widely used pointing error model by assuming that the radial
   displacement distance follows a Rician distribution and derive a
   closed-form probability density function (PDF) of the generalized
   pointing error model. Furthermore, we derive closed-form PDFs for the
   composite lognormal and Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels using this
   generalized pointing error model. Error rate performance is also studied
   for an on-off keying signaling system with intensity modulation and
   direct detection in the presence of this generalized pointing error.}},

Abstract = {{In a cooperative cognitive radio (CR) network when a group of CR users
   acts as relays for a given CR user, a cooperative beamforming can be
   used to improve the quality of communications. However, this cooperative
   beamforming can introduce asynchronous interference at the primary
   receiver due to different propagation delays between different CR relays
   and the primary receiver. In this paper, we propose an innovative
   cooperative beamforming method that maximizes the received signal power
   at the secondary destination while keeping the asynchronous interference
   at the primary receiver below a target threshold. The presented
   numerical results show that the proposed beamforming method can
   significantly reduce the interference at the primary receiver and
   thereby decreases the outage probability up to 75\% compared to the zero
   forcing beamforming method, for a primary user's busy probability of
   0.75. This beamforming method is further extended for the case when the
   channels between the primary receiver and the CR relays are not known

   femtocell network. We consider the network setting where the players
   (i.e., the FAPs) can coordinate their transmissions to reduce the level
   of interference within a coalition. We first formulate the interference
   management problem as a coalition formation game in partition form with
   negative externalities, where the payoff of a player depends on actions
   of other players in the same coalition and in different coalitions.
   Based on the solution concept of recursive core in coalitional games, we
   propose an efficient coalition formation algorithm, RECORD, to achieve a
   final stable coalition structure. Simulation results show that the
   RECORD algorithm results in a substantially higher flow throughput and
   aggregate utility than some previously proposed scheduling algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Grid (SG) uses communication technology to gather information
   about the actual and planned power usage in order to enable efficient
   power provisioning and consumption. Wireless multi-hop communications
   are used for exchanging data and control messages between smart meters
   and the utility. With the advent of cybercrimes, there is a growing
   concern on privacy of the clients. We argue that any communication
   paradigm used in the SG should support privacy, anonymity,
   unlinkability, unobservablity, and undetectablity. Due to the broadcast
   nature of wireless transmissions, many cyber-attacks such as traffic
   analysis and flow tracing compromise privacy of the clients. We propose
   an innovative scheme for traffic routing that benefits from the enhanced
   network coding technology. Our analysis shows that our scheme maintains
   privacy of the users despite the possibility of detecting transmitted
   traffic by an adversary. Moreover, our scheme has extra favourable
   features such as less computation complexity and robustness of
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{This work details a distributed control system for triangular formation
   control where the control actions applied by the agents can be chosen
   from a set of values during run-time (as opposed to a single value
   defined in a standard feedback controller). Such a control law is
   advantageous as it allows the individual agents freedom in choosing
   their individual headings and motion speeds (from the specified set)
   during execution. This offers greater flexibility and robustness than
   traditional distributed feedback formation control laws. An alternative
   interpretation of the results presented is that the control law
   presented is capable of handling measurements that may be corrupted by
   an unknown finite state Markov chain (which can model noisy sensors
   and/or communication channels). A strong convergence result is
   established which permits global exponential convergence of the
   formation to the desired shape.}},

   purpose is to explore the genre of the statistical consulting report and
   use a genre approach for the writing pedagogy targeting graduate
   students in statistics. Through observation, interviews, and discourse
   analysis of texts and contexts we attempt to locate the consulting
   report within the organized activities of statistics, create new writing
   strategies for student-consultants, and change the way statistical
   consulting is taught. This project allows us to reflect on the evolution
   of our own position from an outsider to an insider and to assess the
   impact of collaboration on our professional identity. It also enables us
   to better collaborate with colleagues from other faculties and across
   the disciplines in the future.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, the topics of intellectual property, copyright, and

   the purpose to raise students' awareness of the copyright discourse and
   develop their research and critical thinking skills through the
   exploration of related ethical issues. The paper tracks the evolution of
   the module in response to recent changes in copyright legislation. The
   theoretical framework employs composition theory, activity theory and
   critical pedagogy, whereas the methodology involves emancipatory action
   research and critical discourse analysis of data drawn from observation,
   interviewing, pedagogical reflection, and a study of a broad range of
   multimodal texts and contexts. Learning to engage in a meaningful
   dialogue about copyright has a positive impact on students'
   understanding of their future professional identity. Students are
   empowered to move from course-related issues to the exploration of
   ethical implications of professional communication.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel, ultra-broadband and
   continuously tunable integrated microwave photonic processor that can
   operate both as a RF phase shifter (PS) and a true-time-delay (TTD)
   line. The device is implemented with a silicon phase-shifted waveguide
   Bragg grating (PS-WBG) realized with a CMOS compatible process. The
   grating features a sharp phase shift localized within the reflection
   band that can be exploited in conjunction with optical single sideband
   modulation with full carrier (OSSB+C) to generate either PS or TTD on
   the modulated RF signal, depending on the relative frequency position of
   the carrier and the sideband with respect to the phase shift.
   Proof-of-concept experiments show the generation of a delay up to 25.7
   ps over an 8 GHz bandwidth, and a phase shift of approx. 90 degrees over
   the bandwidth 16-20 GHz is also demonstrated. The phase shifter
   demonstration is ultimately limited by the available measurement setup,
   as the device is capable of providing up to 300 degrees phase shift for
   RF frequencies above 16 GHz over a record bandwidth approaching 1 THz.}},

   enforces a maximum sensitivity position of the proof mass in a normally

   controller action. Experimental results show a stabilization of the
   proof mass at the pull-in position and a measurement of small

Abstract = {{In this paper slope-shaped comb are designed, modeled and experimentally
   verified for electrostatic parametric amplification of
   micro-displacements. Parametric resonance techniques applied to inertial
   sensors requires a periodic stiffness modulation, as expressed by the
   Mathieu equation, and is generally implemented using gap-varying and
   non-overlapping combs. MEMS vibratory gyroscopes provide the opportunity
   for applying parametric amplification for both the sensing and driving
   modes. While gap-varying combs are efficiently used for small
   displacements (e.g. the sensing mode), larger displacements require a
   different approach, where slope-shaped combs are a good alternative.
   Analytical model of slope shaped combs is carried out and compared with
   experimental characterization of fabricated devices. The analytical
   model predicts a spring modulation of 0.1\%-0.65\% spring modulation for
   10 V to 40V applied common mode DC bias, and it can be increased for
   steeper slopes. The parametric amplification operation was
   experimentally tested using linear differential voltage actuation on the
   area-varying combs and a phase-synchronised common mode voltage (using a
   PXIe 1062Q DAQ controller) applied to the left and right shaped combs.}},

Abstract = {{A novel micromachined capacitive pressure sensor that is fabricated
   using a liquid-phase sacrificial layer is reported. Ferrofluid serves as
   the sacrificial layer in the microfabrication process, enabling
   extremely simple, fast, and low-cost production of the sensor, while
   eliminating the need for photolithographic, bonding, and/or chemical
   processes. The entire sensor fabrication is performed at/near room
   temperature. The sensor is based on the 1.5x1.5-mm(2) stainless-steel
   chip with a 10-mu m-deep capacitive cavity. A Parylene-C membrane with a
   Ti electrode is formed to seal the cavity by depositing it directly on
   top of the ferrofluid filled in the cavity. The ferrofluid is
   magnetically extracted from the cavity, suspending the membrane to form
   the sensing capacitor. A highly linear response with a sensitivity of
   12.4 fF/KPa is obtained with the fabricated device. The temperature
   dependence of the sensor capacitance is experimentally characterized and
   reported as well.}},

Abstract = {{A considerate amount of literature has been published on small and low
   altitude aerial mobile robot navigation. The autonomous tasks include
   trajectory tracking, hovering, goal seeking, object approach, formation
   keeping and landing etc. Many algorithms have been proposed to navigate
   the aerial robot in the uncertain, unstructured and dynamic environment.
   However, how to emulate the actual aerodynamic environment to evaluate
   those algorithms has not received much attention. The direct test of the
   navigation system in low altitude easily leads the small aerial mobile
   robot to stall, flip over and crash upon unexpected disturbances. This
   paper proposed a novel aerodynamic emulation system for the small and
   low altitude rotorcraft vehicles. A 6 DOF mechanical manipulator is
   designed to withhold 3 types of rotorcraft aerial locomotion. The stress
   analysis of the CAD/CAM model is conducted to obtain the optimal design
   parameters prior to the fabrication. The D-H matrix transformation is
   applied to derive the analytical trajectory model of the end effector
   motion and then further simulated through ADAMS software. The proposed
   aluminum manipulator is tested in an emulated subsonic wind tunnel to
   investigate the actual flight scenario and analyze the aerodynamic
   effect (e.g. forces and moments) over the aerial robot. Data analysis
   results show the proposed aerodynamic emulation system can successfully
   validate the trajectory error compensation algorithm developed under a
   turbulence of varies winds levels up to 13.8m/s (Level 6). The 6 degrees
   of freedom in the manipulator, translation and rotation in xyz axis,
   constrain the aerial mobile robot to fly in a safe altitude of 0.2 m
   within a radius of 1.9 m. The manipulator is robust and stable in the
   flight test with the payload up to 20N, the maximum velocity as 30 km/h,
   and the maximum tolerable stress as 68.9 GPa}},

Abstract = {{As Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices become ever more
   ubiquitous it is very likely that demands on them to provide certain
   types of security such as authentication, confidentiality, and privacy
   and encryption for security, depending on the application, will
   increase. This chapter gives a brief overview of cryptographic
   techniques and protocols. Given the often limited complexity and power
   of RFID devices, much effort has been devoted to devising so-called
   ``lightweight{''} cryptographic techniques for such devices, and a few
   of these are considered in this chapter. Even public key techniques to
   provide services such as identification and digital signatures have been
   proposed for some scenarios involving RFID devices, although such
   devices will obviously require significant computing power. While such
   applications are seemingly beyond currently available technology, given
   the speed at which technology is able to yield computational increases
   at reasonable cost and device size, it seems prudent to consider such
   protocols at this point.}},

   Planning an effective disaster response to minimize associated losses is

   describes a disaster response planning simulation platform that supports
   decision making based on the interdependencies existing between a power

   considering the physical constraints on the power grid and SCADA

Abstract = {{Sustainability issues are slowly being integrated into the design
   process. What is frequently overlooked is that the pre-existing value
   system of engineering may be hostile to sustainability principles. To
   explore this value system, the engineer is presented as a wearer of many
   hats (e.g., that of a soldier or depanneur) who hypothetically develops
   a sustainable solution involving the installation of latrines in
   Rajasthan in India. The question is then whether this engineer is able
   to foresee the social issue where the latrines lead to the
   disempowerment of women. As a soldier, the engineer models the world
   after hierarchies; Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that one can
   deal with the physiological and worry about the social later. As
   depanneur (owner of a corner store), the engineer values convenience;
   the latrine, though convenient, led to increased seclusion of women at
   home as they had lost their reason to leave the house. These engineering
   values are offered as possible ``constraints{''} on the road to
   re-creating engineering design more in the image of sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Electrodes that selectively exchange charge with only certain redox
   couples in a mixture could improve the performance of photogalvanic and
   bio-photovoltaic cells described in the literature. One avenue to
   achieve selectivity is through the use of semiconducting rather than
   metallic electrodes to exploit the presence of the bandgap to control
   reaction rates. In this paper, Fluorine doped Tin oxide (F:SnO2),
   Copper(II) oxide (CuO) and Nickel oxide (NiO) electrodes are
   investigated as a means to achieving selective redox reactions. The
   reactions of methyl viologen, ferricyanide/ferrocyanide and
   ferric/ferrous couples on the three semiconducting electrodes were
   studied using cyclic voltammetry and sampled current voltammetry. The
   rate of electron transfer between the electrodes and the redox couples
   depended on the difference between the semiconductor majority carrier
   band edge and the standard redox potential of the redox couple. Most
   noticeably, the rate constant of methyl viologen on F:SnO2 was two
   orders of magnitude higher than that for the ferric/ferrous ion. Similar
   results were obtained with the NiO electrode while electrochemical
   instability hampered the tests of the CuO electrode.}},

Title = {{Parkinson's disease rigidity: relation to brain connectivity and motor
   performance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Objective: (1) To determine the brain connectivity pattern associated
   with clinical rigidity scores in Parkinson's disease (PD) and (2) to
   determine the relation between clinically assessed rigidity and
   quantitative metrics of motor performance.
   Background: Rigidity, the resistance to passive movement, is exacerbated
   in PD by asking the subject to move the contralateral limb, implying
   that rigidity involves a distributed brain network. Rigidity mainly
   affects subjects when they attempt to move; yet the relation between
   clinical rigidity scores and quantitative aspects of motor performance
   are unknown.
   Methods: Ten clinically diagnosed PD patients (off-medication) and 10
   controls were recruited to perform an fMRI squeeze-bulb tracking task
   that included both visually guided and internally guided features. The
   direct functional connectivity between anatomically defined regions of
   interest was assessed with Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Tracking
   performance was assessed by fitting Linear Dynamical System (LDS) models
   to the motor performance, and was compared to the clinical rigidity
   scores. A cross-validated Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
   Operator (LASSO) regression method was used to determine the brain
   connectivity network that best predicted clinical rigidity scores.
   Results:The damping ratio of the LDS models significantly correlated
   with clinical rigidity scores (p = 0.014). An fMRI connectivity network
   in subcortical and primary and premotor cortical regions accurately
   predicted clinical rigidity scores (p < 10(-5)).
   Conclusion: A widely distributed cortical/subcortical network is
   associated with rigidity observed in PD patients, which reinforces the
   importance of altered functional connectivity in the pathophysiology of
   PD. PD subjects with higher rigidity scores tend to have less overshoot
   in their tracking performance, and damping ratio may represent a robust,
   quantitative marker of the motoric effects of increasing rigidity.}},

Title = {{A Survey of Multi-Agent Trust Management Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-50}},
Abstract = {{In open and dynamic multiagent systems (MASs), agents often need to rely
   on resources or services provided by other agents to accomplish their
   goals. During this process, agents are exposed to the risk of being
   exploited by others. These risks, if not mitigated, can cause serious
   breakdowns in the operation of MASs and threaten their long-term
   wellbeing. To protect agents from the uncertainty in the behavior of
   their interaction partners, the age-old mechanism of trust between human
   beings is re-contexted into MASs. The basic idea is to let agents
   self-police the MAS by rating each other on the basis of their observed
   behavior and basing future interaction decisions on such information.
   Over the past decade, a large number of trust management models were
   proposed. However, there is a lack of research effort in several key
   areas, which are critical to the success of trust management in MASs
   where human beings and agents coexist. The purpose of this paper is to
   give an overview of existing research in trust management in MASs. We
   analyze existing trust models from a game theoretic perspective to
   highlight the special implications of including human beings in an MAS,
   and propose a possible research agenda to advance the state of the art
   in this field.}},

Abstract = {{Rail transit plays an increasingly important role in the public
   transportation system, and effectively reducing its huge energy
   consumption is of great practical significance. An optimization method
   is proposed to minimizes energy consumption by comprehensively
   considering speed limit, track alignment and running time. The objective
   function is total energy consumption. The decision variables are the
   location where train enters the state of coasting. A simulated annealing
   algorithm(SA) is developed to search for optimized coasting point. The
   developed model is applied to a particular segment of route in Shanghai.
   Experiment results demonstrate that, although there was a mite increase
   of running time, the method could effectively reduce energy consumption.}},

Pages = {{167-188}},
Abstract = {{Chemo-resistive sensors utilizing meal oxides form a very important type
   of sensors for gas detection. They are based on the interaction between
   gas molecules and surface ionosorbed oxygen species accompanied by
   electron transfer, which eventually leads to the change of material
   resistance. This process is controlled by a few external parameters
   (working temperature) and internal parameters (microstructure, chemical
   composition and crystal structure). While most parameters have been paid
   sufficient attention to, the influence of crystal structures is still
   largely unexplored. On the other hand, metal oxides exist in more than
   one crystalline form. The structural and property difference between
   different structures is expected to affect the sensing behavior of the
   material. Taking TiO2 and WO3 as examples, this chapter reviews how to
   selectively synthesize desired crystal structures and how they are
   related to the performance as a gas sensor. TiO2 exists in two major
   polymorphs, with rutile being the thermodynamically stable phase and
   anatase being the metastable one. Compared to rutile, anatase is more
   open-structured and more chemically active and has lower surface energy.
   The hydrothermal method has been proved to be very effective in anatase
   synthesis as long as particle size is well controlled (normally under 20
   nm) and dopants could stabilize this phase. Studies have found that
   anatase shows higher sensitivity as a gas sensor which is believed to be
   attributed to its higher chemical activity. WO3 undergoes a series of
   phase transition when it is cooled down and gamma-WO3 is usually the
   room-temperature (RT) stable phase. The low-temperature stable phase,
   epsilon-WO3, is the least symmetric among all the phases and is the only
   one with a ferroelectric feature. By a rapid solidification method
   called flame spray pyrolysis, epsilon-WO3 is able to be synthesized in
   high purity at RT. Doping with silicon and chromium could effectively
   stabilize this phase up to 500 degrees C by forming boundary domains or
   surface layers. The dopant-stabilized epsilon-WO3 shows high sensitivity
   and unique selectivity to polar gas molecules, esp. acetone, which may
   be due to the strong interaction between the epsilon-WO3 surface dipole
   and polar molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Designed experiments using statistical methods enable an efficient and
   economic experimental approach that can account for factor interaction.
   This work employs a two-level split-plot design to study the influence
   of material characteristics of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). The factors used in this design
   included six operating parameters (anode stoichiometry, cathode
   stoichiometry, temperature, anode inlet relative humidity and cathode
   inlet relative humidity and gas pressure) and a categoric factor
   ({''}Type of GDL{''}). At each test point, a voltage response was
   measured under galvanostatic conditions at 1.0 A/cm(2). The results show
   a good fit of the model based on predicted results and residuals. The
   analysis demonstrates design of experiment methods to be an adequate
   tool for evaluating the influence of the tested GDL materials.}},

   function approach along with a series expansion of the modified Bessel
   function, we obtain a unified highly accurate series bit-error rate
   expression for a family of noncoherent and differentially coherent
   modulations. We also analyze the symbol-error rate performance of
   subcarrier M-ary differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and M-ary
   noncoherent frequency-shift keying (NCFSK) modulated systems using the
   same frequency domain approach. We compare the error rate performance of
   subcarrier DPSK and adaptive on-off keying (OOK) using direct detection.
   It is shown that subcarrier DPSK is only 0.91 dB worse than OOK in
   strong turbulence.}},

   signal for the conventional multiplicative Spread Spectrum (MSS)
   embedding scheme, this paper proposes a novel correlation-and-bit-aware
   multiplicative Spread Spectrum (CMSS) embedding scheme. This scheme
   exploits the correlation between the host signal and the watermark as
   well as the bit message to be embedded to improve the decoding
   performance. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme maintains the simplicity of
   the decoder. The theoretical and experimental results show the
   superiority of the CMSS scheme over the MSS scheme. Compared with the
   traditional MSS scheme, the proposed CMSS scheme could significantly
   reduce the host effect in data hiding and improve the watermark decoding

Abstract = {{Various new polymer additives were blended into ultra-high molecular

   proven to improve the surface and sliding characteristics of UHMWPE on

   (about 2.5 wt\%) reduces the ice friction coefficient significantly at
   temperatures greater than -7 degrees C. Moreover, plasma chemical vapour
   deposition of UHMWPE under a fluorinated gas was also utilized to
   examine its effect on its surface and sliding characteristics. This
   treatment increased the static water contact angle, from 85 degrees to
   138 degrees and decreased the friction coefficient to about 25\% at the

Abstract = {{Several Pd-composite Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 materials are synthesized by a
   two-step procedure, and employed as the Pt-Pd alloy catalyst support for
   the PEM fuel cell oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These supports and
   their supported catalysts are characterized using analytical and
   electrochemical methods with respect to their material morphology,
   chemical/electrochemical stability, electronic conductivity as well as
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activity/stability. For the
   supported Pt-Pd catalysts, the Pt-Pd nanoparticles adhered to both the
   Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 and composited Pd surfaces to form PtmPdn clusters. A
   possible synergetic interaction between the Pt-Pd alloy catalyst and its
   Pd-Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 composite support is believed to exist which enhances
   the ORR activity of these catalysts. The electronic conductivity of
   Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 can be greatly improved after forming composites with Pd
   to the desired levels required for electrocatalyst applications. Three
   supported Pt-Pd catalysts, 20 wt\%
   Pt0.62Pd0.38/Pd-10wt\%-(Nb0.06Ti0.94O2)(90wt\%), 20 wt\%
   Pt0.62Pd0.38/Pd-30wt\%-(Nb0.06Ti0.94O2)(70wt\%), and 20 wt\%
   Pt0.62Pd0.38/Pd-50wt\%-(Nb0.06Ti0.94O2)(50wt\%), are synthesized and
   tested using both cyclic voltammetric and rotating disk electrode
   techniques with respect to their surface electrochemistry, ORR mass
   activity, and electrochemical stability. All three catalysts show higher
   Pt mass activity (>130 mA mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9 V vs. RHE) than that of the
   baseline 47 wt\% Pt C-1 carbon supported catalyst (110 mA mg(Pt)(-1)).
   However, the durability of these catalysts needs to be further improved.

Abstract = {{The primary factors controlling defect stability in phase-field crystal
   (PFC) models are examined, with illustrative examples involving several
   existing variations of the model. Guidelines are presented for
   constructing models with stable defect structures that maintain high
   numerical efficiency. The general framework combines both long-range
   elastic fields and basic features of atomic-level core structures, with
   defect dynamics operable over diffusive time scales. Fundamental
   elements of the resulting defect physics are characterized for the case
   of fcc crystals. Stacking faults and split Shockley partial dislocations
   are stabilized for the first time within the PFC formalism, and various
   properties of associated defect structures are characterized. These
   include the dissociation width of perfect edge and screw dislocations,
   the effect of applied stresses on dissociation, Peierls strains for
   glide, and dynamic contraction of gliding pairs of partials. Our results
   in general are shown to compare favorably with continuum elastic
   theories and experimental findings. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.224112}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxides such as niobium oxides have been demonstrated as
   alternative support materials for Pt and non-precious metal catalysts in
   fuel cells. High surface area and columnar niobium oxide catalyst
   support structures were produced by the glancing angle deposition (GLAD)
   technique on 5 mm diameter glassy carbon disks. The columnar structures
   have lengths of about 500 nm, diameters of 50 nm and an areal density of
   about 10(9) cm(-2). Annealing under different gas mixtures (Ar/H-2) led
   to the formation of various oxides (Nb2O5, NbO2, or NbO + NbO2). Pt
   catalyst, with a loading of 0.1 mg(pt) cm(-2), was deposited onto these
   structures by magnetron sputter deposition. Rotating disk electrode
   characterization of the samples, performed in 0.1M HClO4 electrolyte at
   room temperature, revealed surface enhancement factors of up to 11 and
   oxygen reduction specific activities of >= 1 mA cm(pt)(-2) at 0.9 V (vs.
   RHE). The impact of annealing on Nb-O phase formation, conductivity,
   oxygen reduction activity and stability are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{A detailed characterization of the transient electron transport within

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{A three-valley Monte Carlo simulation approach is used in order to probe
   the transient electron transport that occurs within bulk wurtzite zinc
   oxide, bulk wurtzite gallium nitride, and bulk zinc-blende gallium
   arsenide. For the purposes of this analysis, we follow the approach of
   O'Leary et al. {[}O'Leary et al., Solid State Commun. 150, 2182 (2010)],
   and study how electrons, initially in thermal equilibrium, respond to
   the sudden application of a constant applied electric field. Through a
   determination of the dependence of the transient electron drift velocity
   on both the time elapsed since the onset of the applied electric field
   and the applied electric field strength, a complete characterization of
   the transient electron transport response of these materials is
   obtained. We then apply these results in order to estimate how the
   optimal cut-off frequency and the corresponding operating device voltage
   vary with the device length. We find that while the cut-off frequency
   found for the case of zinc-blende gallium arsenide, 637 GHz for a device
   length of 100 nm, is marginally less than that found for the cases of
   wurtzite zinc oxide and wurtzite gallium nitride, 1.05 and 1.32 THz,
   respectively, the corresponding operating voltage found for the case of
   zinc-blende GaAs, 0.08 V, precludes the use of this material for the
   operation of devices in the terahertz frequency range if higher powers
   are required; the corresponding operating voltages for the cases of
   wurtzite ZnO and wurtzite GaN are found to be 8 and 4 V, respectively.
   These results clearly demonstrate the compelling advantage offered by
   wurtzite zinc oxide and wurtzite gallium nitride, as opposed to
   zinc-blende gallium arsenide, for electron devices operating in the
   terahertz frequency range if higher powers are required. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this article, the anti-plane deformation of a transversely isotropic
   sector with multiple defects is studied analytically. The solution of a
   Volterra-type screw dislocation problem in a sector is first obtained by
   means of a finite Fourier cosine transform. The closed form solution is
   then derived for displacement and stress fields over the sector domain.
   Next, the distributed dislocation method is employed to obtain integral
   equations of the sector with cracks and cavities under an anti-plane
   traction. The ensuing integral equations are of the Cauchy type singular
   and have been solved numerically. A set of examples are presented to
   demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution procedure. The
   geometric and force singularities of stress fields in the sector are
   also studied and compared to the earlier reports in the literature. (c)

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{49}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a popular technique for fabricating carbon
   nanotube (CNT) devices. The electric current passing through the
   solution during DEP creates a temperature gradient, which results in
   electrothermal fluid flow because of the presence of the electric field.
   CNT solutions prepared with various methods can have different
   conductivities and the motion of the solution because of the
   electrothermal phenomenon can affect the DEP deposition differently in
   each case. We investigated the effect of this movement in solutions with
   various levels of conductivity through experiments as well as numerical
   modeling. Our results show that electrothermal motion in the solution
   can alter the deposition pattern of the nanotubes drastically for high
   conductivity solutions, while DEP remains the dominant force when a low
   conductivity (surfactant-free) solution is used. The extent of
   effectiveness of each force is discussed in the various cases and the
   fluid movement model is investigated using two-and three-dimensional
   finite element simulations.}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2265-2274}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{We report a model describing the various stages of dorsal closure of
   Drosophila. Inspired by experimental observations, we represent the
   amnioserosa by 81 hexagonal cells that are coupled mechanically through
   the position of the nodes and the elastic forces on the edges. In
   addition, each cell has radial spokes representing actin filaments on
   which myosin motors can attach and exert contractile forces on the
   nodes, the attachment being controlled by a signaling molecule. Thus,
   the model couples dissipative cell and tissue motion with kinetic
   equations describing the myosin and signal dynamics. In the early phase,
   amnioserosa cells oscillate as a result of coupling among the chemical
   signaling, myosin attachment/detachment, and mechanical deformation of
   neighboring cells. In the slow phase, we test two ratcheting mechanisms
   suggested by experiments: an internal ratchet by the apical and
   junctional myosin condensates, and an external one by the supracellular
   actin cables encircling the amnioserosa. Within the range of parameters
   tested, the model predictions suggest the former as the main contributor
   to cell and tissue area reduction in this stage. In the fast phase of
   dorsal closure, cell pulsation is arrested, and the cell and tissue
   areas contract consistently. This is realized in the model by gradually
   shrinking the resting length of the spokes. Overall, the model captures
   the key features of dorsal closure through the three distinct phases,
   and its predictions are in good agreement with observations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a discrete-time modeling of dynamic milling systems.
   End mills with arbitrary geometry are divided into differential elements
   along the cutter axis. Variable pitch and helix angles, as well as
   run-outs can be assigned to cutting edges. The structural dynamics of
   the slender end mills and thin-walled parts are also considered at each
   differential element at the tool-part contact zone. The cutting forces
   include static chip removal, ploughing, regenerative vibrations, and
   process damping components. The dynamic milling system is modeled by a
   matrix of delay differential equations with periodic coefficients, and
   solved with an improved semidiscrete-time domain method in modal space.
   The chatter stability of the system is predicted by checking the
   eigenvalues of the time-dependent transition matrix which covers the
   tooth period for regular or spindle periods for variable pitch cutters,
   respectively. The same equation is also used to predict the process
   states such as cutting forces, vibrations, and dimensional surface

Abstract = {{Studying the vibrational characteristics of guided circular saws is of
   particular interest in the current study. Guided circular saws are free
   in both the inner and outer rim. They are restrained from having axial
   motion by using two space-fixed guide pads in either side of the blade.
   Because of the small clearance between the guide pads and the saw blade,
   the blade is capable of having rigid body tilting and a translational
   degree of freedom. At first, we attempted to develop an understanding
   regarding the vibrational characteristics of such disks through
   experimental investigations. An electromagnet was used to generate
   random white noise for the purpose of exciting the bending waves. Using
   inductance displacement probes, the frequencies and amplitudes of the
   disk vibrations were measured and the mean deflections were plotted. In
   the next step, a space-fixed external force (air jet) was used to excite
   the disks in the lateral direction. The experimental results indicate
   that the blade frequencies show a significant change as a result of the
   initial lateral displacement imposed by the external force. It was also
   seen that due to the presence of the external force, a stationary wave
   develops and collapses at a higher speed. For the numerical simulations,
   the nonlinear governing equations based on Von Karman plate theory were
   used. The effect of rigid body degrees of freedom was taken into
   account. As an approximation, the guide pads were modeled with four
   space-fixed springs. Using Galerkin's method, the governing equations
   were discretized and their equilibrium solutions were found. After
   linearizing the governing equations around the equilibrium solution, the
   effect of nonlinearity on the amplitude and frequency response of the
   guided blade was investigated. It was seen that the numerical results
   were in close agreement with the experimental results. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of real-time online reconstruction of
   dynamic magnetic resonance imaging sequences. The proposed method
   reconstructs the difference between the previous and the current image

   algorithm for real-time reconstruction, we derive a novel algorithm for
   this purpose. Our proposed method has been compared against
   state-of-the-art offline and online reconstruction methods. The accuracy
   of the proposed method is less than offline methods but noticeably
   higher than the online techniques. For real-time reconstruction we are
   also concerned about the reconstruction speed. Our method is capable of
   reconstructing 128 x 128 images at the rate of 6 frames/s, 180 x 180

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Common solar technologies are either photovoltaic/thermophotovoltaic, or
   use indirect methods of electricity generation such as boiling water for
   a steam turbine. Thermionic energy conversion based on the emission of
   electrons from a hot cathode into vacuum and their collection by an
   anode is also a promising route. However, thermionic solar conversion is
   extremely challenging as the sunlight intensity is too low for heating a
   conventional cathode to thermionic emission temperatures in a practical
   manner. Therefore, compared to other technologies, little has been done
   in this area, and the devices have been mainly limited to large
   experimental apparatus investigated for space power applications. Based
   on a recently observed ``Heat Trap{''} effect in carbon nanotube arrays,
   allowing their efficient heating with low-power light, we report the
   first compact thermionic solar cell. Even using a simple off-the-shelf
   focusing lens, the device delivered over 1 V across a load. The device
   also shows intrinsic storage capacity. Copyright 2012 Author(s). This

Abstract = {{Superposition modulation makes it possible for transmitting a node's own
   data along with its neighbors' relay data in a single time-slot and
   frequency, which can improve spectral efficiency of cooperative wireless
   communication system. First, we consider a two-user scenario and propose
   a design criterion for two-dimensional superposition modulation based
   cooperative transmission where the users cooperate to transmit their
   data to a base station. We investigate M-PSK superposition modulation
   based cooperative scenario for Rayleigh fading channels and thoroughly
   derive the average symbol error rate (SER) of such system with
   decode-and-forward relaying. Furthermore, we introduce a design
   parameter called power allocation ratio (PAR) which can be adaptively
   changed within the derived limits. We derive SER expressions in terms of
   the PAR and demonstrate its effect on average SER. Based on analytical
   and simulation results, we show that the proposed scheme provides
   reduced SER and increased spectral efficiency per link compared to
   existing schemes in practical scenarios. Finally, we investigate
   multi-user scenario, propose an adaptive power allocation scheme for
   superposition modulation, and confirm that SER is decreased with our
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Free-space optical (FSO) communication has recently gained a lot of
   interest for last-mile terrestrial applications. Some of its advantages
   include high data rates, ease of deployment, license-free operation, and
   high security. However, the weather-dependent optical wireless channel
   introduces attenuation and intensity variations known as scintillation
   which impose severe challenges for reliable data transmission. The
   distance dependence of both attenuation and scintillation motivates the
   use of relays as a means of improving the system performance and
   extending the range of communication. In this paper, we advocate the use
   of all-optical relays equipped with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers
   (EDFAs), which, in contrast to conventional FSO relays with electrical
   amplification, avoid optical-to-electrical and electrical-to-optical
   conversions. We develop accurate signal and noise models for fixed and
   variable gain all-optical and electrical relaying which include the
   effects of all relevant system parameters and types of noise. For
   performance evaluation, we analyze the outage probability of all-optical
   relaying in lognormal fading for dual-hop and multi-hop transmission.
   Our results show that all-optical relays, while simpler from an
   implementation point of view, outperform electrical relays unless the
   number of relays is very large. Moreover, for a fixed source-destination
   distance, performance improves as the number of hops (relays) increases
   up to a certain point beyond which adding more hops deteriorates
   performance.}},

   density stable configuration has been found to produce highly efficient

   stretch length L, is measured over a wide range of parameters. The
   stretch length increases with the mean flow velocity, increases with
   inclination beta from vertical, decreases with density difference, and
   increases with viscosity. Our data are well represented by the scaled

Abstract = {{The potential for hydrate inhibition in a stirred autoclave at a
   subcooling of 2.3 K has been tested on two bacterial isolates.
   Chryseobacterium sp. C14 survives multiple freeze thaw events and
   inhibits ice recrystallization, and Escherichia coli has neither of
   these properties but is a biofilm producer. Both strains showed methane
   hydrate inhibition, with a significant reduction in total hydrate
   formed. Chryseobacterium delayed hydrate nucleating time, to a similar
   level found for the commercial kinetic inhibitor, polyvinylpyrrolidone
   (PVP; 0.2 wt \%). However, in the presence of E. coli, in comparison to
   PVP, the time to nucleation was almost tripled and the hydrate growth
   rate was reduced by half. Because of the variation inherent with the
   microbial samples, likely a result of the complexities associated with
   varying cell numbers and metabolic activity, numerous experiments were
   required. Analysis of the distinct hydrate growth profiles shown by the
   two bacterial strains indicated that different molecular sources were
   likely responsible for the observed inhibition. As a working hypothesis,
   it is suggested that the inhibition observed by Chryseobacterium
   cultures was partially due to ice recrystallization inhibition
   properties, while that of E. coli may be due to secreted macromolecules
   and the effect of biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{With an ever-increasing demand for phosphate-based fertilizer, new
   sustainable sources of phosphorus are warranted. Recent technologies
   have successfully demonstrated the possibility of recovering phosphorus
   from wastewater-treatment plants as struvite, which is also a
   ready-made, slow-release fertilizer. However, process parameters that
   influence the operation of crystallizers and production of good-quality
   struvite pellets have yet to be fully understood. This paper discusses
   the influence of process parameters on the characteristics of struvite
   pellets. Among the various process parameters, upflow velocity and flow
   patterns in the crystallizer were found to influence the size and shape
   of the pellets. In the range (1.5-7.1) tested, supersaturation ratio did
   not appear to influence the crushing strength of the pellets formed.
   Midsized pellets, in the 2.0-2.5-mm range, exhibited the highest
   crushing strengths. Higher magnesium concentration in the crystallizer
   was able to increase the crushing strength of struvite pellets by as
   much as 15-27\%. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000576. (C) 2012

Title = {{Phase-field simulations of dynamic wetting of viscoelastic fluids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{8-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We use a phase-field model to simulate displacement flow between a
   Newtonian and a viscoelastic fluid in a two-dimensional channel. The
   viscoelastic fluid is described by the Oldroyd-B model and the stress
   singularity at the contact line is regularized by the Cahn-Hilliard
   diffusion. In a small region near the contact line, the flow field
   features a large shear rate that produces a high polymer stress even at
   relatively low wetting speed. This polymer stress pulls the interface
   toward the viscoelastic fluid. As a result, the viscous bending at the
   contact line is enhanced when the advancing fluid is viscoelastic and
   weakened when the receding fluid is viscoelastic. However, the overall
   effect is limited by the small size of this strong shear region. These
   results are consistent with experimental observations. By examining the
   flow and stress field in the neighborhood of the contact line, we find
   that viscoelastic stress growth within a finite residence time provides
   a plausible explanation of the curious experimental observation that the
   contact line is affected by the viscoelasticity of the oligomeric
   solvent rather than the high molecular-weight polymer solute. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The heat transfer that occurs during bottom water jet impingement on a
   hot steel plate has been investigated in terms of the effect inclination
   angle and flow rate. This research was carried out to develop
   quantitative knowledge of the heat transfer, which occurs on the runout
   table, a crucial component in the hot rolling production of advanced
   high strength steels. Industrially produced hot-rolled steel samples
   were instrumented with numerous subsurface thermocouples installed close
   to the quench surface. The experimental measurements were used in
   conjunction with an inverse heat conduction (IHC) model to quantify
   boiling characteristics as well as heat extraction histories for the
   different nozzle inclination angles and flow rates. It was found that,
   as nozzle inclination angle increased, the degree of asymmetry of the
   cooled region on the surface of the sample was increased and the overall
   rate of heat extraction decreased. The angle of inclination had a
   significant effect on overall heat extraction; a vertical nozzle was the
   most efficient from a perspective of heat transfer under the nozzle. As
   expected, as flow rates increased, the amount of heat energy extracted
   increased for all the conditions studied, regardless of the nozzle
   inclination. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007127]}},

Title = {{Economic feasibility and sensitivity analysis of integrating
   industrial-scale mineral carbonation into mining operations}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Proposed carbon reduction measures such as cap-and-trade appear poised
   to have a significant impact on the financial feasibility of mining
   operations as point-source emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is
   therefore necessary to proactively assess the ways in which these
   effects may be mitigated. Carbon sequestration through mineral
   carbonation is well suited for integration into mining operations. Its
   ability to make use of waste rock to trap and store CO2, given suitable
   geological conditions, can help to significantly reduce carbon
   emissions. This paper presents the first attempt at conceptually
   integrating a high temperature and pressure industrial mineral
   carbonation facility into a developing minesite. The Turnagain nickel
   site, a low-grade, high-tonnage Ni-sulphide deposit, located in Northern
   BC, contains an abundant amount of Mg-silicate minerals in its waste
   rock. These minerals have significant potential for use in mineral
   carbonation. In the presence of a mandatory cap-and-trade scheme in
   North America, there is the potential to produce an additional revenue
   stream through the generation and sale of carbon credits. Results of
   financial modeling have yielded a net present value (NPV) at an 8\%
   discount rate of \$131.5 million for the integration of mineral
   carbonation into proposed mining operations at Turnagain, suggesting
   that the project may be viable from a financial standpoint. Sensitivity
   analysis has also demonstrated that the parameter with the greatest
   influence on project NPV is the CO2 avoidance ratio. This ratio, which
   takes into consideration the amount of CO2 released in the mineral
   carbonation process to determine the net amount of CO2 avoided, is
   critical to maximizing the amount of carbon credits available for sale
   in a cap-and-trade environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater resources are under increasing threat of contamination and
   wasteful use in many parts of the world. Groundwater flow and integrated
   contaminant transport models are commonly used to predict the fate of
   contaminants in the subsurface environment. However, the lack of
   reliable data and complexity of the natural environmental systems, the
   predictions are subjected to large uncertainties. For reliable
   decision-making, these contaminant transport models are required to
   explicitly consider associated uncertainties in their parameters. This
   paper aims to compare the results of four common uncertainty models
   using an example of contaminant transport in groundwater. The research
   employed an advection-dispersion-equation (ADE) to describe the
   transport of a contaminant in groundwater. For simplicity, two
   parameters - dispersion coefficient and velocity - were considered in
   the uncertainty analysis. Fuzzy set theory, one- and two-dimensional
   (1-D and 2-D) Monte Carlo simulations, and Probability Box (P-Box)
   methods were investigated. The cumulative distribution functions
   generated from these analyses were compared to evaluate the capabilities
   of these methods. The comparison showed that P-Box method provides a
   more comprehensive analysis with lesser assumptions as compared to other
   methods, and also found to be more pragmatic way to describe and
   propagate uncertainties in complex environmental systems. Furthermore,
   execution time required to perform uncertainty analysis using P-Box
   method is comparatively much less than 2-D Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract = {{Background Low-grade inflammation has been increasingly implicated in
   the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Imbalances of
   pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and polymorphisms in cytokine genes
   have been reported in IBS; however, these findings have not been
   consistently observed. This may be due to small sample sizes and
   differences in ethnicities. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis on
   the studies that investigated cytokine gene polymorphisms in IBS
   patients compared to healthy controls. Methods A PubMed and EMBASE
   search was performed, and cytokine gene polymorphisms, which had been
   investigated in at least two case-control studies, were evaluated.
   Pooled odds ratios (OR) for the genotypes were calculated using random-
   or fixed-effects models. Key Results Five studies that investigated
   interleukin-10 (IL-10; -1082 G/A), transforming growth factor-beta 1
   (TGF-beta 1; +869 T/C and +915 G/C) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF; -308
   G/A) polymorphisms in IBS patients and controls were included. High
   producer IL-10 (-1082 G/G; OR: 0.64 {[}95\% CI: 0.480.87]) was
   significantly associated with a decreased risk of IBS. The intermediate
   producer TGF-beta 1 (+915 G/C) genotype showed a tendency toward
   decreasing the risk of IBS. No associations were found between TNF (-308
   G/A) genotypes and IBS in the whole meta-analysis although an analysis
   of Asian studies revealed an association between TNF (-308 G/A and G/G)
   genotypes and IBS (OR: 0.50 {[}95\% CI: 0.290.85]), and 1.82 {[}95\% CI:
   1.083.07], respectively). Conclusions \& Inferences This meta-analysis
   indicates a role for IL-10 polymorphisms in IBS in general and TNF in
   Asian populations. Whether or not gene polymorphisms are associated with
   alterations in cytokine levels leading to functional effects at the
   level of the gut needs further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We compared cycling injury risks of 14 route types and other
   route infrastructure features.
   Methods. We recruited 690 city residents injured while cycling in
   Toronto or Vancouver, Canada. A case-crossover design compared route
   infrastructure at each injury site to that of a randomly selected
   control site from the same trip.
   Results. Of 14 route types, cycle tracks had the lowest risk (adjusted
   odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.11; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.02, 0.54),
   about one ninth the risk of the reference: major streets with parked
   cars and no bike infrastructure. Risks on major streets were lower
   without parked cars (adjusted OR = 0.63; 95\% CI = 0.41, 0.96) and with
   bike lanes (adjusted OR = 0.54; 95\% CI = 0.29, 1.01). Local streets
   also had lower risks (adjusted OR = 0.51; 95\% CI = 0.31, 0.84). Other
   infrastructure characteristics were associated with increased risks:
   streetcar or train tracks (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95\% CI = 1.8, 5.1),
   downhill grades (adjusted OR = 2.3; 95\% CI = 1.7, 3.1), and
   construction (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95\% CI = 1.3, 2.9).
   Conclusions. The lower risks on quiet streets and with bike-specific
   infrastructure along busy streets support the route-design approach used
   in many northern European countries. Transportation infrastructure with
   lower bicycling injury risks merits public health support to reduce
   injuries and promote cycling. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:2336-2343.

Abstract = {{Aluminum alloy A356-T6 was subjected to fully reversed cyclic loading
   under tension, torsion and combined loading. Results indicate that
   endurance limits are governed by maximum principal stress. Fractography
   demonstrates long shear mode III propagation with multiple initiation
   sites under torsion. Under other loadings, fracture surfaces show unique
   initiation sites coincidental to defects and mode I crack propagation.
   Using the replica technique, it has been shown that the initiation life
   is negligible for fatigue lives close to 106 cycles for combined
   loading. The natural crack growth rate has also been shown to be
   comparable to long cracks in similar materials.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of online reconstruction of dynamic
   magnetic resonance images (MRI). The proposed method reconstructs the
   difference between the images of previous and current time frames. This
   difference image is modeled as a rank deficient matrix and is solved
   from the partially sampled k-space data via nuclear norm minimization.
   Our proposed method has been compared against state-of-the-art offline
   and online reconstruction methods. Our method has similar reconstruction
   accuracy as the offline method and significantly higher accuracy
   compared to the online technique. It is about an order of magnitude
   faster than the online technique compared against. Our experimental data
   consisted of dynamic MRI data that were collected at 6 to 7 frames per
   second and having resolutions of 128x128 and 256x256 pixels per frame.
   Experimental evaluation indicates that our proposed method is capable of
   reconstructing 128x128 images at the rate of 4 frames per second and
   256x256 images at the rate of 2 frames per second. The previous online
   method requires about 3.75 s for reconstructing each image. The
   improvement in reconstruction speed is clearly discernible. Moreover,
   our method has a reconstruction error that is about half that of the
   previous online method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled forging of microalloyed steels is a viable economical process
   for the manufacture of automotive parts. Ferrite grain refinement and
   precipitation hardening are the major microstructural parameters to
   enhance the mechanical properties of the forged components. In the
   current study, a modified thermomechanical treatment for additional
   ferrite grain refinement is developed by exploiting the effect of Nb in
   increasing the T (NR) (no recrystallization temperature) and via phase
   transformation from a pancaked austenite. This is accomplished by
   performing the final passes of forging below the T (NR) temperature
   followed by a controlled cooling stage to produce a mixture of fine
   grained ferrite, small scaled acicular ferrite as well as a limited
   amount of martensite. The effect of processing parameters in terms of
   forging strain, cooling rate and aging condition on the microstructure
   and mechanical properties of a medium carbon, Nb containing microalloyed
   steel is investigated. An attempt is made to identify a suitable
   microstructure that provides a proper combination of high strength and
   good impact toughness. The processing-microstructure relationships for
   the proposed novel forging procedure are discussed, and directions for
   further improvements are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Intercritical annealing is a critical processing step to manufacture
   dual-phase (DP) steels. As part of modelling the microstructure
   evolution in an intercritical-annealing cycle, a 3D multi-phase field
   model has been employed to simulate recrystallization during heating of
   a low-carbon steel that is used to produce commercial DP600 grade. The
   cold-rolled microstructure obtained from metallographic observations is
   used as the initial structure in the model. The nucleation conditions
   and the effective interface mobility are employed as adjustable
   parameters to fit the experimentally measured kinetics of isothermal
   recrystallization and then applied to non-isothermal recrystallization.
   The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental data for
   recrystallization during continuous heating. The model provides
   realistic recrystallized microstructures as initial conditions for
   modelling the subsequent formation and decomposition of austenite.}},

Abstract = {{In this survey, we present a comprehensive list of major known security
   threats within a cognitive radio network (CRN) framework. We classify
   attack techniques based on the type of attacker, namely exogenous
   (external) attackers, intruding malicious nodes and greedy cognitive
   radios (CRs). We further discuss threats related to infrastructure-based
   CRNs as well as infrastructure-less networks. Besides the short-term
   effects of attacks over CRN performance, we also discuss the often
   ignored longer term behavioral changes that are enforced by such attacks
   via the learning capability of CRN. After elaborating on various attack
   strategies, we discuss potential solutions to combat those attacks. An
   overview of robust CR communications is also presented. We finally
   elaborate on future research directions pertinent to CRN security. We
   hope this survey paper can provide the insight and the roadmap for
   future research efforts in the emerging field of CRN security.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to extract a computational
   three-dimensional (3D) soft palate model from a set of magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) data and to identify an approach that generates
   a patient-specific model in a computerized visual platform.
   Multiple MRI slices of the head and neck region of a young,
   non-overweight Caucasian male volunteer were taken in the supine
   position with a passive oral appliance in place. The DICOM (Digital
   Imaging and Communications) MRI slices were registered into a
   high-resolution volumetric data set for manually segmentation to
   generate a surface mesh and, with additional editing, a volume mesh. For
   biomechanical dynamic simulation and for physical simulation of the
   anatomical structures, the volume mesh format and multiple landmarks of
   each muscle were imported into ArtiSynth, a 3D biomechanical modeling
   toolkit.
   The segmented soft palate complex consisted of five groups of muscles:
   levator veli palatini, tensor veli palatini, palatoglossus,
   palatopharyngeous and musculus uvulae. The palatine tonsil between the
   pharyngopalatine and glossopalatine arches was included in the
   segmentation.
   The same procedure was used to build up a generic reference model of the
   dentition, tongue, mandible and airway from a mixture of medical records
   (CT and dental casts) of the same subject. This manual segmentation
   method eliminated the common errors that occur from an automatic
   segmentation although it was more time-consuming. It remains a
   fundamental process for analyzing the dynamic interaction between
   anatomical components in the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal areas.}},

Abstract = {{This study analytically determines the seismic fragility of a three-span
   continuous highway bridge fitted with laminated rubber bearings and
   shape memory alloy (SMA) restrainers. Fragility function, which
   expresses the likelihood of exceeding a damage state conditioned at a
   given earthquake intensity, has been derived based on SeismoStruct's
   nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis results of the bridge subjected
   to medium to strong earthquake excitation records. A total of 20
   excitation records with peak ground acceleration values ranging from
   0.45 to 1.07 g, are used in the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the
   bridge. A 2-D finite element model scheme is used in this study
   considering nonlinearity in the bridge piers and the isolation bearings.
   Two types of laminated rubber bearings are used in the bridge system in
   addition to the SMA restrainers: high damping rubber bearings and lead
   rubber bearings. The fragility curves are constructed for two bridge
   components (i.e. piers and isolation bearings), and the system as well.
   The component fragility curves are combined to evaluate the fragility
   curves for the entire bridge system at different damage states. The
   bridge system, for simplicity, considers the bridge deck, isolation
   bearings with SMA restrainer and bridge piers but excluding the bridge
   foundations and the abutments. The numerical results show that the
   failure probability of the bridge system is dominated by the bridge
   piers over the isolation bearings. Moreover, the inclusion of SMA
   restrainers in the bridge system exhibits high probability of failure,
   especially, when the system is isolated with lead rubber bearings.}},

   the most prominent elemental machining feature in a 2 1/2D pocket.
   Traditionally, the process planning of 2 1/2D pocket machining is posed
   as stand-alone problem involving either tool selection, tool path
   generation or machining parameter selection, resulting in sub-optimal
   plans. For this reason, the tool path generation and feed selection is
   proposed to be integrated with an objective of minimizing machining time
   under realistic cutting force constraints for given pocket geometry and
   cutting tool. A morphed spiral tool path consisting of G(1) continuous
   biarc and arc spline is proposed as a possible tool path generation
   strategy with the capability of handling islands in pocket geometry.
   Proposed tool path enables a constant feed rate and consistent cutting
   force during machining in typical commercial CNC machine tool. The
   constant feed selection is based on the tool path and cutting tool
   geometries as well as dynamic characteristics of mechanical structure of
   the machine tool to ensure optimal machining performance. The proposed
   tool path strategy is compared with those generated by commercial CAM
   software. The calculated tool path length and measured dry machining
   time show considerable advantage of the proposed tool path. For optimal
   machining parameter selection, the feed per tooth is iteratively
   optimized with a pre-calibrated cutting force model, under a cutting
   force constraint to avoid tool rupture. The optimization result shows
   around 32\% and 40\% potential improvement in productivity with one and
   two feed rate strategies respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the past two far-view displays, which showed vital signs, trends,
   alarms, infusion pump status, and therapy support indicators, were
   developed and assessed by critical care nurses (Gorges et al. in Dimens
   Crit Care Nurs. 30(4):206-17, 2011). The aim of the current study is to
   assess the generalizability of these findings to physicians. The first
   aim is to test whether an integrated far-view display, designed to be
   readable from 3 to 5 m, enables critical care physicians to more rapidly
   and accurately (1) recognize a change in patient condition; (2) identify
   alarms; and (3) identify near-empty infusion pumps, than a traditional
   patient monitor and infusion pump. A second aim is to test if the new
   displays reduce the mental workload required for this decision making.
   Fifteen critical care fellow physicians (median age of 34 years, with
   2-8 years of ICU experience) were asked to use the three displays to
   compare the data from two patients and decide which patient required
   their attention first. Each physician made 60 decisions: 20 with each of
   the two far-view displays and 20 decisions with a standard patient
   monitor next to an infusion pump. A 41 and 26 \% improvement in decision
   accuracy was observed with the bar and clock far-view displays,
   respectively. Specifically, the identification of near empty infusion
   pumps, a task normally performed by nurses, and patients with a single
   alarm were better with the new displays. Using the bar display
   physicians made their decision 12 \% faster than when using the control
   display, a median improvement of 2.1 s. No significant differences were
   observed in measured workload. Displays that present patient data in a
   redesigned format enables critical care clinicians to more rapidly
   identify changes in patient conditions and to more accurately decide
   which patient needs their attention. In a clinical setting, this could
   improve patient safety. In future work, an evaluation of the display
   using live patient data from an ICU should be performed.}},

Abstract = {{A 4-stage 60-GHz low-noise amplifier is designed and laid out in a 65 nm
   CMOS technology. Transmission lines are used to realize the power
   matching networks at the input, output, and between the stages. Based on
   foundry-provided models, extensive electromagnetic simulations with
   Momentum((R)) (a 2.5D simulator by Agilent) are performed on
   transmission lines, capacitors and I/O pads to model the behavior of the
   circuit at mm-wave frequencies. Furthermore, body biasing is used as a
   technique to control gain variability, linearity performance, and input
   matching of the designed LNA. Post-layout simulation results show that
   the LNA achieves a maximum gain of 21.3 dB at 60 GHz while consuming 20
   mW from a 1.2 V supply. By changing the body bias voltage of the
   transistors in the two intermediate stages, the overall gain varies from
   14 to 21.3 dB providing more than 7 dB of gain range. Adjusting the body
   biasing of the transistors in the last stage, results in a maximum IIP3
   of more than 2 dBm for the overall amplifier. Also, the input return
   loss of the LNA is controlled by changing the bulk voltage of the input
   transistor in the first stage.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a methodology to characterise the axial
   dispersion of a solute during steady-flow through a compressible bed of
   wood chips under mechanical load. We use a non-invasive imaging
   technique, namely electrical resistance tomography (ERT), to visualise
   the uniaxial displacement of a salt solution. Here we demonstrate that
   under two limiting cases the porosity of the porous bed varies slowly in
   the flow-direction and to the lowest order can be considered a constant.
   This simplified the optimisation routine we used to match the
   experimental data to the numerical results of the advectiondiffusion
   equation. Using this, a methodology to estimate the axial dispersion is
   given by a minimisation scheme. In the experimental portion of the work
   we measure the axial dispersion of a bed of hemlock wood chips at three
   different kappa numbers kappa, and compacted to three different
   compaction pressures p(c). We find that the dispersion D-e in the axial
   direction varies as a function of the porosity epsilon, according to D-e
   = a epsilon(b), where a = 7.2 x 10(-4) m(2)/s and b = -3.8 for hemlock

   to the phase analysis results, the higher dissolution rate of Cr2O3 in
   MgO in the MgO Cr2O3 system was responsible for the faster densification

Abstract = {{Probabilistic methods provide a powerful paradigm for modeling of robot
   motion and its environment; a precursor for autonomous navigation of
   mobile robots. As a graduate-level engineering course, probabilistic
   robotics encompasses the techniques used in robot localization and
   mapping in unstructured environments. This article presents a simulation
   and animation software program developed mainly as a teaching tool that
   can help the students visualize different robot localization solutions
   through both parametric filters (viz., the Extended Kalman Filter,
   Unscented Kalman Filter) and nonparametric filters (viz., the histogram
   filter, Rao-Blackwell particle filter). The program is also a powerful
   tool for performance analysis and tuning of such filters commonly used
   for robot localization, mapping, and autonomous navigation. The
   simulation features dead reckoning (e.g., INS), range-only sensing
   (e.g., rangefinder), bearing-only sensing (e.g., digital camera), or a
   combination of them. The program includes a simple graphical user
   interface that allows for changing both filtering and sensing
   parameters, and monitoring the effects of those changes on the animation
   of a unicycle in a 2D environment. The program animates the unicycle
   motion and shows the kinematic results in several graphs simultaneously
   to evaluate the performance of different methods in finding the robot
   pose. The program is available as an open-source Matlab script to
   facilitate future modifications and improvements of the code by the
   students interested in robotics, mechatronics, and control engineering.
   This article presents the features of the program and briefly discusses
   the algorithms implemented in the software. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{179-184}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An illustrative example of street theatre used in international
   development as an awareness-building tool is Nakai, a drama produced by
   the United Nation's Industrial Development Organization's Global Mercury
   Project (GMP) in Zimbabwe to increase knowledge of the hazards of
   mercury use amongst artisanal gold miners in the Kadoma-Chakari region,
   Zimbabwe. Nakai performed to almost 9000 people, but its influence on
   behavioral change in the GMP project area could not be studied due to
   the extremely unstable political situation at the time in Zimbabwe.
   Nakai evolved as a non-participatory didactic drama with the belief that
   a transportable equipment-demonstration school would serve as a more
   effective platform for participation and empowerment. About 700 miners
   were trained in these demonstration units and learned how to process
   gold more efficiently and reduce mercury losses when the whole ore is
   amalgamated and when the amalgams are burned in open air. Indicators of
   success were not very evident since the repression of the police on
   miners and theatre players limited sound assessment of the awareness
   initiatives. The system of mineral processing centers in the region
   inhibits behavioral change because the centers' owners reap benefits
   from recovering gold from tailings using sophisticated techniques such
   as cyanidation, while rudimentary mercury amalgamation techniques are
   reserved for the artisanal miners. In practice, national and local
   elites can easily consolidate power and direct project benefits to
   themselves, reducing the possibilities empowering the miners. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In order to construct physically based models of the mechanical response
   of metastable austenitic steels, one must know the load partitioning
   between the austenite and the strain-induced martensitic phases. While
   diffraction-based techniques have become common for such measurements,
   they often require access to large facilities. In this work, we have
   explored a simple magnetic technique capable of providing a measure of
   the stresses in an embedded ferromagnetic phase. This technique makes
   use of the coupling between the elastic strain and the magnetic response
   of the -martensite in an austenitic stainless steel undergoing
   straining. The magnetic technique proposed here is compared to neutron
   diffraction measurements made on the same material and is shown to give
   nearly identical results. The resulting predictions of the load
   partitioning to the -martensite phase suggest that deforms in a complex
   fashion, reflecting the fact that the microstructure is progressively
   transformed from austenite to martensite with straining. In particular,
   it is shown that the apparent hardening of the -martensite suggests
   elastic deformation as an important source of high macroscopic
   work-hardening rate in this material.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic social cost-benefit analysis for green roofs: A lifecycle
   approach}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{152-162}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Green roofs have been used as an environmentally friendly product for
   many centuries and considered as a sustainable construction practice.
   Economic and environmental benefits of green roofs are already proven by
   many researchers. However, a lifecycle net benefit-cost analysis, with
   the social dimension, is still missing. Sustainable development requires
   quantitative estimates of the costs and benefits of current green
   technologies to encourage their use. This paper is based on an extensive
   literature review in multiple fields and reasonable assumptions for
   unavailable data. The Net Present Value (NPV) per unit of area of a
   green roof was assessed by considering the social-cost benefits that
   green roofs generate over their lifecycle. Two main types of green roofs
   - i.e. extensive and intensive - were analyzed. Additionally, an
   experimental extensive green roof, which replaced roof layers with
   construction and demolition waste (C\&D), was assessed. A probabilistic
   analysis was performed to estimate the personal and social NPV and
   payback period of green roofs. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was
   also conducted. The analysis demonstrated that green roofs are
   short-term investments in terms of net returns. In general, installing
   green roofs is a low risk investment. Furthermore, the probability of
   profits out of this technology is much higher than the potential
   financial losses. It is evident that the inclusion of social costs and
   benefits of green roofs improves their value. Crown Copyright (c) 2012

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{85-93}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We report finite-element simulations of gas-liquid two-phase flows
   through a model porous medium made of corrugated tubes. By resolving the
   pore-scale fluid dynamics and interfacial morphology, we compute the
   relative permeability of the porous medium by averaging over a
   pore-size-distribution of a real porous medium. A constant pressure
   gradient is applied on both fluids to simulate a pressure-driven
   creeping flow, and a diffuse-interface model is used to compute the
   interfacial evolution and the contact line motion. We observe a number
   of flow regimes in the micro-pores, depending on the pore size, imposed
   pressure gradient, and other geometric and physical parameters. The flow
   rates vary nonlinearly with the pressure gradient, and the extended
   Darcy's law does not hold in general. The interaction between the two
   phases, known as viscous coupling, is a prominent feature of the
   process. As a result, the relative permeability depends not only on
   saturation, but also on the capillary number, viscosity ratio,
   wettability of the solid wall, pore geometry, and the initial
   configuration. The effects of these factors are explored systematically
   and compared with previous studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{115-132}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Using direct numerical simulations, the fragmentation of falling liquid
   droplets in a quiescent media is studied. Three simulations with
   different Eotvos numbers were performed. An adaptive, volume of fluid
   (VOF) method based on octree meshing is used, providing a notable
   reduction of computational cost. Results are presented in three main
   parts; droplet deformation and bag formation, bag breakup mechanism, and
   variations in the number and size of fragments. It is clearly shown that
   the droplet initially deforms into a thin hollow bag. After that, due to
   growth of instabilities over the thin liquid sheet, several punctures
   are formed. The holes further grow, generating a web of ligaments. In
   this stage, the fragmentation domain consists of a liquid torus left
   above the bag, a number of ligaments and droplets, and the parent
   droplet core. The liquid torus, the core, and the unstable ligaments
   disintegrate further. The breakup processes continue until the
   hydro-dynamic and the surface tension forces reach an equilibrium
   condition for each fragment. The growth of fragment numbers during the
   atomization stage is described and the size distributions between the
   simulations are compared. The analysis performed here precisely
   demonstrates the mechanism of the bag breakup and depicts an accurate
   history for the small fragments generated in the secondary atomization
   process. The outcomes can be used for development of the secondary
   atomization models. Moreover, the results can be directly used for
   better understanding of rain drop atomization during precipitation, as
   well as water droplet atomization in cooling towers. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Pages = {{4494-4509}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a robust and efficient visual tracking method through the
   fusion of several distributed adaptive templates is proposed. It is
   assumed that the target object is initially localized either manually or
   by an object detector at the first frame. The object region is then
   partitioned into several non-overlapping subregions. The new location of
   each subregion is found by an EM1-like gradient-based optimization
   algorithm. The proposed localization algorithm is capable of
   simultaneously optimizing several possible solutions in a probabilistic
   framework. Each possible solution is an initializing point for the
   optimization algorithm which improves the accuracy and reliability of
   the proposed gradient-based localization method to the local extrema.
   Moreover, each subregion is defined by two adaptive templates named
   immediate and delayed templates to solve the ``drift{''} problem.(2) The
   immediate template is updated by short-term appearance changes whereas
   the delayed template models the long-term appearance variations.
   Therefore, the combination of short-term and long-term appearance
   modeling can solve the template tracking drift problem. At each tracking
   step, the new location of an object is estimated by fusing the tracking
   result of each subregion. This fusion method is based on the local and
   global properties of the object motion to increase the robustness of the
   proposed tracking method against outliers, shape variations, and scale
   changes. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed tracking method is
   verified by several experimental results. The results also show the
   superior efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it to several
   state-of-the-art trackers as well as the manually labeled ``ground
   truth{''} data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) are promising materials
   for solar energy harvesting, due to their high quantum efficiency. A
   simple approach for making a photovoltaic device is to apply solubilized
   RCs and charge carrier mediators to the electrolyte of an
   electrochemical cell. However, the adsorption of analytes on the
   electrodes can affect the charge transfer from RCs to the electrodes. In
   this work, photovoltaic devices were fabricated incorporating RCs from
   purple bacteria, ubiquinone-10 (Q2), and cytochrome c (Cyt c) (the
   latter two species acting as redox mediators). The adsorption of each of
   these three species on the gold working electrode was investigated, and
   the roles of adsorbed species in the photocurrent generation and the
   cycle of charge transfer were studied by a series of
   photochronoamperometric, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. It was shown
   that both redox mediators were required for photocurrent generation;
   hence, the RC itself is likely unable to inject electrons into the gold
   electrode directly. The reverse redox reactions of mediators at the
   electrodes generates electrical current. Cyclic voltammograms for the
   RC-exposed gold electrode revealed a redox couple due to the adsorbed RC
   at similar to+0.5 V (vs NHE), which confirmed that the RC was still
   redox active, upon adsorption to the gold. Photochronoamperometric
   studies also indicated that RCs adsorb, and are strongly bound to the
   surface of the gold, retaining functionality and contributing
   significantly to the process of photocurrent generation Similar
   experiments showed the adsorption of Q2 and Cyt c on unmodified gold
   surfaces. It was indicated by the photochronoamperometric tests that the
   photocurrent derives from Q2-mediated charge transfer between the RCs
   and the gold electrode, while solubilized Cyt c mediates charge transfer
   between the P-side of adsorbed RC and the Pt counter electrode. Also,
   the stability of the adsorbed RCs and mediators was evaluated by
   measuring the photocurrent response over a period of 1 week It is found
   that similar to 46\% of the adsorbed RCs remain active after a week
   under aerobic conditions. A significantly extended lifetime is expected
   by removing oxygen from the electrolyte and sealing the device.}},

Abstract = {{We study the hydrated silica-water interface in the presence of methane
   or carbon dioxide gas with molecular dynamics simulations. The
   simulations are performed with a limited amount of Water, which forms a
   meniscus between two hydroxylated silica surfaces separated by 40 to 60
   angstrom. Simulations were performed With the remaining space of the
   simulation cell left empty or filled with different numbers of Methane
   or carbon:, dioxide gas molecules. The meniscus. is used to determine
   the contact angle between water and silica in the absence and presence
   of the gases. The distribution profiles of the Water:and gas phases are
   determined over the duration. of the simulation. The water number
   density in the layers adjacent to the silica is higher, and these layers
   are more structured and less mobile compared with water layers far from
   the surface. Additionally, the concentrations of the gases are
   significantly higher at the liquid and silica interfaces than in other
   locations in the gas phase. We speculate that the enhanced concentration
   of gases at the interface along with the extended contact area (curved
   meniscus compared with flat interface in the absence of silica surfaces)
   between water and guest molecules at the meniscus is well as lesser
   mobility of water molecules near the silica surface may provide a
   mechanism for the heterogeneous nucleation of the clathiate hydrate in
   water-wetting porous medium.}},

   employing a response surface methodology involving the central composite
   statistical design and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The evolution of
   floc size and structure was observed and it was found that larger and
   more compact flocs were produced by the high charge density starch S880.
   The floc's mass fractal dimension indicates the floc's compactness and
   it was found that the compactness increases as the flocculation
   proceeds. The ionic strength plays a significant role on the floc size
   with S880. Finally, the negative effect of shear rate on floc size was
   more pronounced for the low charge density starch S858. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A population balance model to describe the flocculation of PCC by two
   cationic tapioca starches is presented. The model takes into account
   aggregation, floc breakage and floc restructure. Floc strength as

   that the high charge density starch relates to lower collision
   efficiency, lower restructure rate and higher floc strength (higher
   energy dissipation rate) compared to the case with the low charge
   density starch. Lower energy dissipation rate was needed to break the
   flocs at higher temperature for both starches. On the other hand, the
   high charge starch was more likely to be negatively affected by the
   background electrolyte NaCl. The collision efficiency decreased with the
   increase of the shear rate for both starches. The difference of charge,
   starch morphology on PCC surface and the charge suppression effect were

Abstract = {{Artificial muscles are of practical interest, but few types have been
   commercially exploited. Typical problems include slow response, low
   strain and force generation, short cycle life, use of electrolytes, and
   low energy efficiency. We have designed guest-filled, twist-spun carbon
   nanotube yarns as electrolyte-free muscles that provide fast,
   high-force, large-stroke torsional and tensile actuation. More than a
   million torsional and tensile actuation cycles are demonstrated, wherein
   a muscle spins a rotor at an average 11,500 revolutions/minute or
   delivers 3\% tensile contraction at 1200 cycles/minute. Electrical,
   chemical, or photonic excitation of hybrid yarns changes guest
   dimensions and generates torsional rotation and contraction of the yarn
   host. Demonstrations include torsional motors, contractile muscles, and
   sensors that capture the energy of the sensing process to mechanically
   actuate.}},

Abstract = {{Computational modeling has improved our understanding of how muscle
   forces are coordinated to generate movement in musculoskeletal systems.
   Muscular-hydrostat systems, such as the human tongue, involve very
   different biomechanics than musculoskeletal systems, and modeling
   efforts to date have been limited by the high computational complexity
   of representing continuum-mechanics. In this study, we developed a
   computationally efficient tracking-based algorithm for prediction of
   muscle activations during dynamic 3D finite element simulations. The
   formulation uses a local quadratic-programming problem at each
   simulation time-step to find a set of muscle activations that generated
   target deformations and movements in finite element muscular-hydrostat
   models. We applied the technique to a 3D finite element tongue model for
   protrusive and bending movements. Predicted muscle activations were
   consistent with experimental recordings of tongue strain and
   electromyography. Upward tongue bending was achieved by recruitment of
   the superior longitudinal sheath muscle, which is consistent with
   muscular-hydrostat theory. Lateral tongue bending, however, required
   recruitment of contralateral transverse and vertical muscles in addition
   to the ipsilateral margins of the superior longitudinal muscle, which is
   a new proposition for tongue muscle coordination. Our simulation
   framework provides a new computational tool for systematic analysis of
   muscle forces in continuum-mechanics models that is complementary to
   experimental data and shows promise for eliciting a deeper understanding
   of human tongue function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Estrogenic hormones (estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3),
   17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)) are the major contributor to the total
   estrogenicity in waterways. Presence of these compounds in biosolids is
   also causing concern in terms of their use as soil amendment. In
   comparison with wastewater treatment, removal of estrogenic compounds in
   sewage sludge has received less attention. This paper presents a
   literature review regarding the source and occurrence of these
   pollutants in our environment. The removal pathways of estrogenic
   compounds in engineered systems, such as full-scale wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs), are also discussed. Review of the fate studies revealed
   that activated sludge system with nutrient removal shows very high
   (>90\%) removal of estrogenic hormones in most of the cases. Although,
   aerobic digestion showed better attenuation of estrogenic compounds,
   anaerobic digestion increased the overall estrogenicity of biosolids.
   Finally, this paper highlights the challenges involved in analytical
   determination of these compounds in sewage sludge matrix. (C) 2012

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A new class of supported photocatalysts is introduced recently with high
   activity under visible light for water splitting purposes. The
   composition comprises silicoaluminates (zeolite) as the support,
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the semiconductor, cobalt ions (Co2+) as the
   hydrogen evolution sites and heteropolyacid (HPA) as the multifunctional
   solid acid with visible light activity. From photocatalyst preparation
   point of view, the synthesis consists of three impregnation steps of
   TiO2. Co2+, and HPA, respectively, followed by a specific thermal
   treatment for each stage. The focus of this study is on the cobalt
   impregnation step. The objective is to investigate the impact of
   employing two commercially available cobalt precursors on the
   photocatalytic activity of the synthesized photocatalysts, especially
   hydrogen production rates. Nitrate and chloride compounds of cobalt were
   examined on two classes of the zeolites namely Na-Y and Na-Mordenite
   which have emerged as suitable supports for hydrogen evolution
   application. Although nitrate-based photocatalysts exhibited an
   improvement in the UV-VIS absorbance spectra toward visible light, they
   caused an almost 30\% lower H-2 production rate in comparison to the
   chloride salts. The favorable shift toward visible light is possibly due
   to the incorporation of nitrogen (N) anions in the photocatalyst
   structure. However, their lower hydrogen production rate is mainly
   attributed to the competitive photo-reduction reactions of remnant
   nitrate anions, suggesting chloride (Cl-) species as a remedy of this
   so-called parasitic phenomenon. In addition, overshadowing the poisoning
   and parasitic effects of Cl- ions on the photo-oxidation sites of the
   zeolite-supported composition was another notable outcome of this study.
   This emulates core-shell photocatalysis concept insofar with providing a
   reasonable distance between redox sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) and simultaneously-recorded
   electromyography (EMG) data are a means to assess integrity of the
   functional connection between the cortex and the muscle during movement.
   EEG-EMG coupling is typically assessed with pair-wise squared coherence,
   resulting in a small, but statistically-significant coherence between a
   single EEG and a single EMG channel. However, a means to combine results
   across subjects is not straightforward with this approach because the
   exact frequency of maximal EEG-EMG coupling may vary between
   individuals, and it emphasizes the role of an individual locus in the
   brain in driving the muscle activity, when interactions between head
   regions may in fact be more influential on ongoing EMG activity. To deal
   with these issues, we implemented a multiblock Partial Least Squares
   (mbPLS) procedure, previously proposed in chemical applications, which
   incorporates a hierarchical structure into the ordinary two-block PLS
   often used in neuroimaging studies. In the current implementation, each
   subject's data features are collected in individual data blocks on a
   sub-level, while simultaneously aggregating the sub-level information to
   obtain a super-level group ``consensus{''}. We further extended the
   mbPLS model to include 3-dimensional matrices: time-frequency-EEG
   channel and a time-frequency-connection utilizing Partial Directed
   Coherence (PDC). We applied the proposed method to concurrent EEG and
   EMG data collected from ten normal subjects and nine patients with
   mild-moderate Parkinson's disease (PD) performing a dynamic motor task
   that of sinusoidal squeezing. The results demonstrate that connections
   between EEG electrodes, rather than activity at individual electrodes,
   correspond more closely to ongoing EMG activity. In PD subjects, there
   was enhanced connectivity to and from occipital regions, likely related
   to the previously-described enhanced use of visual information during
   motor performance in this group. The proposed mbPLS framework is a
   promising technique for performing multi-subject, multi-modal data
   analysis and it allows for robust group inferences even in the face of
   large inter-subject variability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This theoretical study was motivated by recent experiments and
   theoretical work that had suggested the dependence of the static contact
   angle on the local wetting at the triple-phase contact line. We revisit
   this topic because the static contact angle as a local wetting parameter
   is still not widely understood and clearly known. To further clarify the
   relationship of the static contact angle with wetting, two approaches
   are applied to derive a general equation for the static contact angle of
   a droplet on a composite surface composed of heterogeneous components. A
   global approach based on the free surface energy of a thermodynamic
   system containing the droplet and solid surface shows the static contact
   angle as a function of local surface chemistry and local wetting state
   at the contact line. A local approach, in which only local forces acting
   on the contact line are considered, results in the same equation. The
   fact that the local approach agrees with the global approach further
   demonstrates the static contact angle as a local wetting parameter.
   Additionally, the study also suggests that the wetting described by the
   Wenzel and Cassie equations is also the local wetting of the contact
   line rather than the global wetting of the droplet.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations and isomer profiles for 24 per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs) were monitored over 5 months (February June, 2010) in
   municipal landfill leachate. These data were used to assess the role of
   perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursor degradation on changes in PFAA
   concentrations over time. The influence of total organic carbon, total
   suspended solids, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), leachate flow rates,
   and meteorological data (precipitation, air temperature) on leachate
   PFAS concentrations was also investigated. Perfluoropentanoate and
   perfluorohexanoate were typically the dominant PFASs in leachate, except
   for March April, when concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate,
   perfluorooctanoate, and numerous PFAA-precursors (i.e., (N-alkyl)
   perfluorooctane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids)
   increased by a factor of 2-10 (similar to 4 mu g/L to similar to 36 mu
   g/L Sigma PFASs). During this time, isomer profiles of PFOA became
   increasingly dominated by the linear isomer, likely from transformation
   of linear, telomer-manufactured precursors. While Sigma PFAA-precursors
   accounted for up to 71\% of Sigma PFASs (molar basis) in leachate from
   this site, leachate from a second landfill displayed only low
   concentrations of precursors (<1\% of Sigma PFASs). Overall, degradation
   of PFAA-precursors and changes in leachate pH, EC, and 24-h
   precipitation were important factors controlling PFAS occurrence in
   leachate. Finally, 8.5-25 kg/yr (mean 16 kg/yr) of Sigma PFASs was
   estimated to leave the landfill via leachate for subsequent treatment at
   a wastewater treatment plant.}},

Abstract = {{Roadside safety has been a concern for highway engineers and designers
   for many decades. A significant part of this concern is related to
   collisions with utility poles. Current practices and standards for
   placing utility poles are based on a combination of qualitative
   guidelines/heuristics and relatively outdated findings. Accordingly,
   there is a need to study the safety level associated with placing
   utility poles at different lateral offsets from the edge of the
   travel-way. In this paper a Safety Performance Function (SPF) is
   developed to relate roadway and roadside variables to utility pole
   collision frequency. It was found that increasing the poles offset has a
   more significant effect on reducing the frequency of utility pole
   collisions compared to increasing poles spacing. Based on the developed
   utility pole-SPF, design charts were provided to facilitate calculations
   and decision-making process. The developed utility pole-SPF was compared
   to a widely-used utility pole collisions model and the differences in
   the type of data and the development methodology were highlighted. (C)

Abstract = {{Several earlier studies have noted the shortcomings with existing
   geometric design guides which provide deterministic standards. In these
   standards the safety margin of the design output is generally unknown
   and there is little knowledge of the safety implications of deviating
   from the standards. To mitigate these shortcomings, probabilistic
   geometric design has been advocated where reliability analysis can be
   used to account for the uncertainty in the design parameters and to
   provide a mechanism for risk measurement to evaluate the safety impact
   of deviations from design standards. This paper applies reliability
   analysis for optimizing the safety of highway cross-sections. The paper
   presents an original methodology to select a suitable combination of
   cross-section elements with restricted sight distance to result in
   reduced collisions and consistent risk levels. The purpose of this
   optimization method is to provide designers with a proactive approach to
   the design of cross-section elements in order to (i) minimize the risk
   associated with restricted sight distance, (ii) balance the risk across
   the two carriageways of the highway, and (iii) reduce the expected
   collision frequency. A case study involving nine cross-sections that are
   parts of two major highway developments in British Columbia, Canada, was
   presented. The results showed that an additional reduction in collisions
   can be realized by incorporating the reliability component, P-nc
   (denoting the probability of non-compliance), in the optimization
   process. The proposed approach results in reduced and consistent risk
   levels for both travel directions in addition to further collision
   reductions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three whitewood species (spruce, Douglas fir, and pine) and one sample
   of bark (Douglas fir) were treated with high-pressure steam at 220
   degrees C for 5 min. The steam treatment resulted in a reduction in
   average particle size by as much as 25\%. Pine particles showed the
   largest reduction in size, while bark showed the least. Despite a
   slightly lower density, pellets made from treated particles had a higher
   mechanical strength (hardness) than untreated pellets. The mechanical
   energy required to compact steam-treated material was higher than the
   energy required to make pellets from untreated wood. Douglas fir
   required the least energy input among debarked samples. Spruce was the
   stickiest pellet to be pushed out of the cylindrical die. Bark pellets
   required the lowest energy to be compacted and pushed out of the
   cylindrical die. The overall conclusion is that steam treatment reduces
   particle size, reduces pellet density slightly, but increases the
   mechanical strength of the produced pellets. Steam treatment increases
   the energy input required to make pellets, and more energy is required
   to push pellets out of the die compared to pellets made from untreated
   biomass.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel, fast, group-wise registration technique
   based on establishing soft correspondences between groups of point sets.
   The registration approach is used to create a statistical shape model,
   capable of learning the shape variations within a training set. The
   shape model consists of a mean shape and its transformations to all
   training shapes. We decouple the procedure into two steps: updating the
   mean shape and registering it to the training shapes. The algorithm
   alternates between these two steps until convergence. Following the
   generation of the statistical shape model, we use the soft
   correspondence approach to register the model to a new observation. We
   perform extensive experiments on two data sets: lumbar spine and
   hippocampi. We compare our algorithm to available state-of-the-art
   group-wise registration algorithms including feature-based and
   volume-based approaches. We demonstrate improved generalization,
   specificity and compactness compared to these algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate segmentation in B-mode images is a challenging task even when
   done manually by experts. In this paper, we propose a 3-D automatic
   prostate segmentation algorithm which makes use of information from both
   ultrasound B-mode and vibro-elastography data. We exploit the high
   contrast-to-noise ratio of vibro-elastography images of the prostate, in
   addition to the commonly used B-mode images, to implement a 2-D active
   shape model (ASM)-based segmentation algorithm on the mid-gland image.
   The prostate model is deformed by a combination of two measures: the
   gray level similarity and the continuity of the prostate edge in both
   image types. The automatically obtained mid-gland contour is then used
   to initialize a 3-D segmentation algorithm which models the prostate as
   a tapered and warped ellipsoid. Vibro-elastography images are used in
   addition to ultrasound images to improve boundary detection. We report a
   Dice similarity coefficient of 0.87 +/- 0.07 and 0.87 +/- 0.08 comparing
   the 2-D automatic contours with manual contours of two observers on 61
   images. For 11 cases, a whole gland volume error of 10.2 +/- 2.2\% and
   13.5 +/- 4.1\% and whole gland volume difference of -7.2 +/- 9.1\% and
   -13.3 +/- 12.6\% between 3-D automatic and manual surfaces of two
   observers is obtained. This is the first validated work showing the
   fusion of B-mode and vibro-elastography data for automatic 3-D
   segmentation of the prostate.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluated a new method for registering
   three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) data to external coordinate systems.
   First, 3DUS was registered to the stereo endoscope of a da Vinci
   Surgical System by placing a registration tool against an air-tissue
   boundary so that the 3DUS could image ultrasound fiducials while the
   stereo endoscope could image camera markers on the same tool. The common
   points were used to solve the registration between the 3DUS and camera
   coordinate systems. The target registration error (TRE) when imaging
   through a polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) tissue phantom ranged from 3.85 +/-
   1.76 mm to 1.82 +/- 1.03 mm using one to four registration tool
   positions. TRE when imaging through an ex vivo liver tissue sample
   ranged from 2.36 +/- 1.01 mm to 1.51 +/- 0.70 mm using one to four
   registration tool positions. Second, using a similar method, 3DUS was
   registered to the kinematic coordinate system of a da Vinci Surgical
   System by using the da Vinci surgical manipulators to identify common
   points on an air-tissue boundary. TRE when imaging through a PVC tissue
   phantom was 0.95 +/- 0.38 mm. This registration method is simpler and
   potentially more accurate than methods using commercial motion tracking
   systems. This method may be useful in the future in augmented reality
   systems for laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Vision-based tracking of tissue is a key component to enable augmented
   reality during a surgical operation. Conventional tracking techniques in
   computer vision rely on identifying strong edge features or distinctive
   textures in a well-lit environment; however endoscopic tissue images do
   not have strong edge features, are poorly lit and exhibit a high degree
   of specular reflection. Therefore, prior work in achieving densely
   populated 3-D features for describing tissue surface profiles require
   complex image processing techniques and have been limited in providing
   stable, long-term tracking or real-time processing. In this paper, we
   present an integrated framework for accurately tracking tissue in
   surgical stereo-cameras at real-time speeds. We use a combination of the
   STAR feature detector and binary robust independent elementary features
   to acquire salient features that can be persistently tracked at high
   frame rates. The features are then used to acquire a densely-populated
   map of the deformations of tissue surface in 3-D. We evaluate the method
   against popular feature algorithms in in vivo animal study video
   sequences, and we also apply the proposed method to human partial
   nephrectomy video sequences. We extend the salient feature framework to
   support region tracking in order to maintain the spatial correspondence
   of a tracked region of tissue or a medical image registration to the
   surrounding tissue. In vitro tissue studies show registration accuracies
   of 1.3-3.3 mm using a rigid-body transformation method.}},

Abstract = {{The design of critical components for aerospace applications involves a
   number of conflicting functional requirements: reducing fuel
   consumption, cost, and weight, while enhancing performance, operability
   and robustness. As several materials systems and concepts remain
   competitive, a new approach that couples finite element analysis (FEA)
   and established multicriteria optimization protocols is developed in
   this paper. To demonstrate the approach, a prototypical materials
   selection problem for gas turbine combustor liners is chosen. A set of
   high temperature materials systems consisting of superalloys and thermal
   barrier coatings is considered as candidates. A thermomechanical FEA
   model of the combustor liner is used to numerically predict the response
   of each material system candidate. The performance of each case is then
   characterized by considering the material cost, manufacturability,
   oxidation resistance, damping behavior, thermomechanical properties, and
   the FEA postprocessed parameters relating to fatigue and creep. Using
   the obtained performance values as design criteria, an ELECTRE multiple
   attribute decision-making (MADM) model is employed to rank and classify
   the alternatives. The optimization model is enhanced by incorporating
   the relative importance (weighting factors) of the selection criteria,
   which is determined by multiple designers via a group decision-making
   process. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006461]}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in wireless communications and sensor technologies have
   enabled the development of low-cost wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for
   a wide range of applications. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play

   bandwidth efficiently and fairly. This article provides a survey of the
   literature on MAC protocols for WSNs. We first briefly describe the
   unique features of WSNs. We then review representative MAC protocols
   from the following four categories: contention-based protocols,
   contention-free (scheduled-based) protocols, hybrid protocols, and
   preamble sampling protocols. Our discussions focus on the background,
   main features, operation procedures, major design issues, and the
   advantages and disadvantages of these protocols. We also present an
   analysis of the inherent and desirable features of the protocols, and
   the key challenges of MAC technology for WSNs. Finally, we present our
   view on future research directions for WSN MAC protocols in a
   reader-friendly way using illustrative diagrams.}},

Abstract = {{Anode water removal (AWR) is studied as a diagnostic tool to assess
   cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) flooding in PEM fuel cells. This
   method uses a dry hydrogen stream to remove product water from the
   cathode, showing ideal fuel cell performance in the absence of GDL mass
   transfer limitations related to water. When cathode GDL flooding is
   limiting, the cell voltage increases as the hydrogen stoichiometry is
   increased. Several cathode GDLs were studied to determine the effect of
   microporous layer (MPL) and PTFE coating. The largest voltage gains
   occur with the use of cathode GDLs without an MPL since these GDLs are
   prone to higher liquid water saturation. Multiple GDLs are studied on
   the cathode side to exacerbate GDL flooding conditions to further
   confirm the mechanism of the AWR process. Increased temperature and
   lower cathode RH allow for greater overall water removal so the voltage
   improvement occurs faster, though this leads to quicker membrane
   dehydration. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

   memory alloy (SMA) bars and isolated with laminated rubber bearings. The

   used in evaluating the seismic fragility functions of the bridge
   components (pier and isolation bearing) and the system. A
   two-dimensional finite element model scheme with nonlinear
   force-displacement relationships is used for the bridge piers and
   bearings. This study shows that the bridge piers with SMA bars have led
   to relatively higher seismic vulnerability over the bridge piers without
   SMA bars, which is also reflected in the bridge system. The isolation
   bearings with SMA bars have revealed comparatively less seismic
   vulnerability than those without SMA bars. From the numerical results,
   it is recognized that the failure probability of the bridge system is
   dictated by the bridge pier over the isolation bearing. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach to system identification and
   closed-loop control of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure
   (PETCO2) in mechanically ventilated patients. An empirical model
   consisting of a linear dynamic system followed by an affine transform is
   proposed to derive a low-order and high-fidelity representation that can
   reproduce the positive and inversely proportional dynamic input-output
   relationship between PETCO2 and minute ventilation in mechanically
   ventilated patients. The predictive capability of the empirical model
   was evaluated using experimental respiratory data collected from 18
   mechanically ventilated human subjects. The model predicted PETCO2
   response accurately with a root-mean-squared error of 0.22 +/- 0.16 mmHg
   and a coefficient of determination r(2) of 0.81 +/- 0.18 (mean +/- SD)
   when a second-order rational transfer function was used as its linear
   dynamic component. Using the proposed model, a closed-loop control
   method for PETCO2 based on a proportional-integral (PI) compensator was
   proposed by systematic analysis of the system root locus. For the 18
   mechanically ventilated patient models identified, the PI compensator
   exhibited acceptable closed-loop response with a settling time of 1.27
   +/- 0.20 min and a negligible overshoot (0.51 +/- 1.17\%), in addition
   to zero steady-state PETCO2 set point tracking. The physiologic
   implication of the proposed empirical model was analyzed by comparing it
   with the traditional multicompartmental model widely used in
   pharmacological modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Sensorless position signal can be obtained from the charge inflow to the
   piezoelectric actuator or effective capacitance variation due to stroke.
   However, the first technique imposes sophisticated hardware requirement
   and it is prone to drift due to current offset. The latter is limited to
   slow operations. In this note, a hybrid position observer is used to
   fuse these two self-sensing signals to obtain a high quality position
   signal which compensates for both creep (slow operations) and
   rate-dependent hysteresis (fast operations). Experimental results are
   presented to demonstrate the performance of the observer. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Curvature method was used to measure the residual stress and substrate

   films without annealing, with 250 degrees C annealing and with 400
   degrees C annealing are 2.6\%, 5.1\% and 8.6\%, respectively, and the
   average radii of the debonding patches with debonding initiation are

   multiple dielectric cylinders near a dielectric half-space is considered

   the multiple scattering between the cylinders and the planar interface
   are compared: the plane-wave integral method and the Fourier series
   method. The plane-wave integral method involves numerically integrating
   a plane-wave spectrum for the reflection from the planar interface. The

   for evanescent fields. By introducing evanescent field correction terms
   we are able to show the equivalence of the two methods.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{19}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3-D) coupled hydromechanical granular model has
   been developed and validated to directly predict, for the first time,
   hot tear formation and stress strain behavior in metallic alloys during
   solidification. This granular model consists of four separate 3-D
   modules: (i) the solidification module is used to generate the solid
   liquid geometry at a given solid fraction; (ii) the fluid flow module
   (FFM) is used to calculate the solidification shrinkage and
   deformation-induced pressure drop within the intergranular liquid; (iii)
   the semi-solid deformation module (SDM) simulates the rheological
   behavior of the granular structure; and (iv) the failure module (FM)
   simulates crack initiation and propagation. Since solid deformation,
   intergranular flow and crack initiation are deeply linked together, the
   FFM, SDM and FM are coupled processes. This has been achieved through
   the development of a new three-phase interactive technique that couples
   the interaction between intergranular liquid, solid grains and growing
   voids. The results show that the pressure drop, and consequently hot
   tear formation, depends also on the compressibility of the mushy zone
   skeleton, in addition to the well-known contributors (lack of liquid
   feeding and semi-solid deformation). (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Cooperative spectrum sensing is an effective technique to improve the
   sensing performance and increase the spectrum efficiency in cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs). In this paper, we consider a CRN with multiple
   primary users (PUs) and multiple secondary users (SUs). We first propose
   a cooperative spectrum sensing and access (CSSA) scheme for all the SUs,
   where the SUs cooperatively sense the licensed channels of the PUs in
   the sensing subframe. If a channel is determined to be idle, the SUs
   which have sensed that channel will have a chance to transmit packets in
   the data transmission subframe. We then formulate this multi-channel
   spectrum sensing and channel access problem as a hedonic coalition
   formation game, where a coalition corresponds to the SUs that have
   chosen to sense and access a particular channel. The value function of
   each coalition and the utility function of each SU take into account
   both the sensing accuracy and the energy consumption. We propose an
   algorithm for decision node selection in a coalition. Moreover, we
   propose an algorithm based on the switch rule to allow the SUs to make
   decisions on whether to join or leave a coalition. We prove analytically
   that the set with all the SUs converges to a final network partition,
   which is both Nash-stable and individually stable. Besides, the proposed
   algorithms are adaptive to changes in network conditions. Simulation
   results show that our proposed CSSA scheme achieves a better performance
   than the closest PU (CPU) scheme and the noncooperative spectrum sensing
   and access (NSSA) scheme in terms of the average utility of the SUs.}},

Abstract = {{SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) is a parallel MR image reconstruction
   technique that yields optimal results when the sensitivity maps are
   accurately known. Unfortunately, in practical scenarios, obtaining
   accurate estimates of the sensitivity maps is not possible. In this
   work, we propose a technique that iteratively reconstructs the image and
   refines the sensitivity maps (from initial estimates). Our technique is
   named iSENSE (iterative SENSE). Our proposed technique exploits the
   sparsity of the MR image in some transform domains or the rank
   deficiency characteristic of the matrix representing the MRI image; the
   former leads to a compressed sensing-based reconstruction method,
   whereas the latter leads to an image reconstruction method that
   minimizes the nuclear norm (NN) of the image matrix. The sensitivity
   maps are assumed to be rank-deficient matrices, and thus the refinement
   of the sensitivity maps is achieved via the NN minimization. To evaluate
   the performance of the proposed method, we have carried out the
   experiments on real and one simulated datasets. We have compared our
   method with three state-of-the-art image domain methodsSparSENSE (Sparse
   SENSE), NNSENSE (NN Regularized SENSE), and JSENSE (Joint SENSE
   reconstruction)and one widely used frequency domain methodGRAPPA
   (Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition). Our method
   yields the best reconstruction results both in quantitative (normalized
   mean-squared error) and qualitative (visual inspection of reconstructed
   and difference images) evaluation. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   residue oil, under high hydroconversion conditions, is reported.
   Different concentrations of MoS2 (100, 300, 600, and 1800 ppm derived
   from Mo-micelle and Mo-octoate precursors) were investigated in a
   semibatch stirred reactor. Catalyst. recycle was simulated by reusing
   the solid coke-catalyst recovered from the reactor in subsequent
   experiments. The process was repeated several times until the catalyst
   deactivated. The recycled catalyst had a very similar activity to the
   fresh catalyst in the early stages of recycling. Experimental results
   showed that with increased catalyst concentration, an increased number
   of catalyst recycles with acceptable coke yield (<3 wt \%) and toluene
   insoluble organic residue (TIOR) conversion (>80 wt \%) were possible
   before deactivation was observed. At an initial concentration of 600 ppm
   Mo (using both Mo-micelle and Mo-octoate precursors), the catalysts were
   recycled 3 times without any significant loss in catalyst activity.
   Characterization of the recycled coke-catalyst mixture recovered after
   each recycle showed that coke aging resulted in significant changes to
   the properties of the recycled coke. While the MoS2 catalyst was
   well-dispersed within the coke matrix, the coke's initial, amorphous
   structure transformed to a more graphitic structure as the number of
   recycles increased. These change's resulted in catalyst deactivation
   during hydroconversion.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate whether the muscle response evoked by an electrically
   induced vestibular perturbation during standing is related to congruent
   sensory and motor signals. A robotic platform that simulated the
   mechanics of a standing person was used to manipulate the relationship
   between the action of the calf muscles and the movement of the body.
   Subjects braced on top of the platform with the ankles sway referenced
   to its motion were required to balance its simulated body-like load by
   modulating ankle plantar-flexor torque. Here, afferent signals of body
   motion were congruent with the motor command to the calf muscles to
   balance the body. Stochastic vestibular stimulation (+/- 4 mA, 025 Hz)
   applied during this task evoked a biphasic response in both soleus
   muscles that was similar to the response observed during standing for
   all subjects. When the body was rotated through the same motion
   experienced during the balancing task, a small muscle response was
   observed in only the right soleus and in only half of the subjects.
   However, the timing and shape of this response did not resemble the
   vestibular-evoked response obtained during standing. When the balancing
   task was interspersed with periods of computer-controlled platform
   rotations that emulated the balancing motion so that subjects thought
   that they were constantly balancing the platform, coherence between the
   input vestibular stimulus and soleus electromyogram activity decreased
   significantly (P < 0.05) during the period when plantar-flexor activity
   did not affect the motion of the body. The decrease in coherence
   occurred at 175 ms after the transition to computer-controlled motion,
   which subjects did not detect until after 2247 ms (Confidence Interval
   1801, 2693), and then only half of the time. Our results indicate that
   the response to an electrically induced vestibular perturbation is
   organised in the absence of conscious perception when sensory feedback
   is congruent with the underlying motor behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-rate prediction of oil production wells is of prime importance to
   effectively confront high-water-cut and separator problems. (Semi-)
   empirical multiphase-flow correlations are proved quite useful for this
   purpose. This work presents new generalized multiphase flow choke
   correlation, derived on the basis of actual production data from
   horizontal and vertical wells from an oil field in Iran. The newly
   established correlation predicts liquid flow rates as a function of
   flowing wellhead pressure, gas/liquid ratio, surface wellhead choke
   size, and the newly incorporated parameters: basic sediment and water
   (BS\&W) and temperature. To evaluate the influence of these two new
   parameters, a parameter-sensitivity analysis was performed and the
   results are shown. This proposed correlation exhibited an average error
   of roughly 2.89\%, which is superior to those previous correlations in
   the literature that did not use these two newly incorporated parameters
   (BS\&W and temperature). These new parameters can be added to the
   previous correlations when the water cut and temperature become
   important in the production history of the wells.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion and densification of urbanized areas can lead to increased

   presents an optimization model using geographic information systems to
   locate potential sources and sinks of reclaimed water within an

   using a set of constraints on mass balance, water quality, and
   electricity used for pumping. Three variations of the model are applied
   to Vancouver, British Columbia. The first scenario identifies a number
   of potential industrial sources and sinks for direct cascading with a
   total potential water savings of 133 400 m(3)/year. With the
   implementation of a satellite water reclamation facility in scenario 2,
   water recycling potential is increased to a maximum of 613 800
   m(3)/year. Scenario 3 expands to include the non-industrial water users
   and the potential for water reuse is increased to a maximum of 969 200

Abstract = {{Annular extrudate swell is studied for a fluoropolymer (FEP) melt using

   (i) a viscous model (Cross) and (ii) a viscoelastic one (the Kaye -
   Bernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou, Scriven, Macosko or K-BKZ/PSM
   model). Numerical simulations have been undertaken to study the
   extrudate swell of the FEP melt in an annular die. Compressibility.
   thermal and pressure effects on viscosity, and slip at the wall were
   taken into account. In all cases, slip at the wall is the dominant
   contribution reducing the swelling when compared with corresponding
   no-slip simulations. The viscous (Cross) simulations show that the swell
   decreases with increasing apparent shear rate, which is opposite to what
   happens in the extrusion of viscoelastic melts. On the other hand, the
   viscoelastic (K-BKZ) simulations correctly obtain increasing swelling
   with increasing shear (flow) rates. It was found that due to the mild
   visco-elasticity of FEP and its severe slip at the wall the swelling of
   this melt is relatively small, reaching values of about 20\% for a wide
   range of apparent shear rates, exceeding 5 000 s(-1). This is
   corroborated by experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a shrinkage-to-tapering approach for
   estimating large covariance matrices when the number of samples is
   substantially fewer than the number of variables (i.e., n, p -> infinity
   and p/n -> infinity). The proposed estimator improves upon both
   shrinkage and tapering estimators by shrinking the sample covariance
   matrix to its tapered version. We first show that, under both normalized
   Frobenius and spectral risks, the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)
   shrinkage-to-identity estimator is inconsistent and outperformed by a
   minimax tapering estimator for a class of high-dimensional and
   diagonally dominant covariance matrices. Motivated by this observation,
   we propose a shrinkage-to-tapering oracle (STO) estimator for efficient
   estimation of general, large covariance matrices. A closed-form formula
   of the optimal coefficient rho of the proposed STO estimator is derived
   under the minimum Frobenius risk. Since the true covariance matrix is to
   be estimated, we further propose a STO approximating (STOA) algorithm
   with a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure to iteratively estimate
   the coefficient rho and the covariance matrix. We study the finite
   sample performances of different estimators and our simulation results
   clearly show the improved performances of the proposed STO estimators.
   Finally, the proposed STOA method is applied to a real breast cancer
   gene expression data set.}},

Title = {{The Pressure Distribution of Cerebrospinal Fluid Responds to Residual

   Injury}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. In vivo large animal (pig) model study of cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) pressures after acute experimental spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Objective. To determine how the CSF pressure (CSFP) and CSF pulse
   pressure amplitude (CSFPPA) cranial and caudal to the injury site change
   after an acute SCI with subsequent thecal occlusion and decompression.
   Summary of Background Data. Lowering intrathecal pressure via CSF
   drainage is currently instituted to prevent ischemia-induced SCI during
   thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery and was recently investigated
   as a potential intervention for acute traumatic SCI. However, in SCI
   patients, persistent extradural compression commonly occludes the
   subarachnoid space. This may generate a CSFP differential across the
   injury site, which cannot be appreciated with lumbar catheter pressure
   measurements.
   Methods. Anesthetized pigs were subjected to an acute contusive SCI at
   T11 and 8 hours of sustained compression (n = 12), or sham surgery (n =
   2). CSFP was measured cranial and caudal to the injury site, using
   miniature pressure transducers, during compression and for 6 hours after
   decompression.
   Results. The cranial-caudal CSFP differential increased (mean, 0.39 mm
   Hg/h), predominantly due to increased cranial pressure. On
   decompression, cranial CSFP decreased (mean, -1.16 mm Hg) and caudal
   CSFP increased (mean, 0.65 mm Hg). The CSFP differential did not change
   significantly after decompression. Cranial CSFPPA was greater than
   caudal CSFPPA, but this differential did not change during compression.
   On decompression, the caudal CSFPPA increased in some but not all
   animals.
   Conclusion. Although extradural compression exists at the site of
   injury, lumbar CSFP may not accurately indicate CSFP cranial to the
   injury. Decompression may provide immediate, though perhaps partial,
   resolution of the pressure differential. CSFPPA was not a consistent
   indicator of decompression in this animal model. These findings may have
   implications for the design of future clinical protocols in which CSFP
   is monitored after acute SCI.}},

Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Several online and offline techniques for characterizing the deposition
   and transport of magnetite particles in supercritical water were
   investigated using a once-through flow apparatus. Ferrous chloride and
   ferrous sulfate precursor solutions were injected into a 1.8m heated
   test section at temperatures ranging from 200 degrees C to 400 degrees
   C. Silver membrane filters of 0.2 mu m pore size were used to collect
   particles under supercritical conditions. Thermal resistance monitoring
   on the test section showed asymptotic, linear fouling and
   deposition-removal cycles. A novel method for qualitatively determining
   the strength of the oxide to the tube surface using a combination of
   ultrasonic and acid wash procedures demonstrated that at supercritical
   conditions, a stronger bond is formed which is speculated to be caused
   by the precipitation of dissolved ferrous species. A comparison between
   different conditions of pH, heat flux, and precursor were examined using
   the experimental techniques which are presented in this study. It was
   found that multiple techniques are needed to characterize the fouling
   process if the underlying rate-limiting steps are not known a priori.

Abstract = {{Current design guidelines and codes use modified shear equations for
   calculating the shear strength contribution of fiber reinforced polymer
   (FRP) transverse reinforcement (stirrup) in concrete beams reinforced
   with longitudinal steel or FRP rebar. These equations, originally
   developed for steel as longitudinal and transverse reinforcement, are
   semi-empirical in nature and were developed with a core analytical
   equation where the coefficients were determined from regression
   analysis. Here, a comparative study among various code equations was
   conducted to predict the shear strength of FRP reinforced concrete
   beams. To facilitate this comparison a database was established from the
   published literature, which was composed of slender concrete beams
   (shear span to depth ratio, a/d > 2.5) with FRP longitudinal and
   transverse reinforcement. The database contained 114 beams without
   transverse reinforcement and 46 beams with transverse reinforcement. The
   guidelines, codes and models that were implemented and compared in this
   study consisted of ACI 440.1R-06, JSCE 1997, CNR-DT 203, CSA S806-02,
   CSA S6-06, unpublished CSA S6-06 Addendum, ISIS-M03-01, simplified
   Modified Compression Field Theory, cracked section analysis model and
   modified Zsutty equations. It was observed from the statistical analysis
   that the CSA S806-02 produced greater coefficients of variation than the
   CSA S6-09. The ACI 440.1R-06 and JSCE 1997 produced more conservative
   results in calculating the transverse shear strength. The CSA S6-09
   Addendum exhibited the best all-around performance in predicting the
   shear contribution of FRP reinforced beams compared to that of other
   design codes and guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Low-stiffness posterior fusion devices for the lumbar spine have been
   developed to treat degenerative spinal conditions. However, the demands
   on an implant vary between a stable motion segment and one which
   exhibits a significant degree of sagittal plane instability. Shear
   motion in the antero-posterior direction is a relevant mode of
   instability for clinical conditions such as degenerative lumbar
   spondylolisthesis. Shear load-sharing between the implant and spine in
   conditions of antero-posterior instability has not been studied, nor
   have there been comparisons between traditional rigid implants and novel
   low-stiffness implants. The objective of this study was to develop a
   method to measure in vitro shear forces on three clinically relevant
   fusion implants when they are applied to an unstable model of
   degenerative spondylolisthesis in a human cadaver spine. Uniaxial strain
   gauges were affixed to the surface of the implants and a
   spine-segment-specific calibration method was used to calibrate the
   strain output to an applied shear force. The accuracy of the force
   measurements was within 3.4 N for all implant types and the
   repeatability was within 5.4 N. The force measurement technique was
   sufficiently accurate and reliable to conclude that it is suitable for
   use in in vitro experiments to measure implant shear force. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In the railroad industry a friction-modifying non-Newtonian liquid,
   showing elastic behavior, may be applied to the rail in the form of a

   surfacespecifically whether it splashes or adheres without splashis
   important in this industrial application. Twelve different elastic
   liquids with widely varying relaxation times were tested to isolate the
   effect of elasticity from other fluid properties. Using high-speed
   imaging, the interaction between the impinging jet and the moving
   surface could be captured and analyzed. Although similar to Newtonian
   jets, for which the Reynolds number plays a major role, the Deborah
   number was also salient to the splash of elastic liquids. At the
   elevated Weber numbers of the testing, the Weber number had a much
   smaller impact on splash than did the Reynolds or Deborah numbers. The
   ratio of the surface velocity to the jet velocity has only a small
   effect on the splash. (c) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{Metal-containing conducting polymers are a new and interesting class of
   materials that combine some of the redox properties of conducting
   polymers and some of those of the metal ions. In metal-containing
   conjugated polymers, there are several possible arrangements of metal
   group relative to the backbone. In this study, new conducting
   metallo-polymers were designed with the incorporation of valeric
   bimetallic carboxylic acid complex and 4-hydroxy benzoic acid based on
   eta(6)-aryl-eta(5)-cyclopentadienyliron and ferrocene-3-carboxylic acid
   to hydroxymethyl EDOT (thieno{[}3,4-b]-1,4-dioxin-2-methanol) and
   2-(3-thienyl)ethanol. The resulting monomers were then polymerized
   electrochemically by having the conjugated system as a backbone and the
   metallic moiety pendant to the backbone. On the other hand, the monomers
   were chemically polymerized with Bisphenol-A to retain the metal moiety
   in the backbone of the polymer, affording the possibility of strong
   electronic interactions between the organic bridge and metal group in
   this arrangement. Spectroscopic, thermal, and electrochemical
   characterizations were performed to highlight the structural attributes
   of the polymers. Morphological characterization revealed that the
   electrochemically modified electrode surfaces have a very porous surface

Abstract = {{Blends of poly (e-caprolactone) (PCL)/polylactide (PLA) were prepared by
   solution-casting method to study their thermal and rheological
   properties. Differential scanning calorimetry thermographs have shown
   two separate melting peaks in the blends, which are indicative of
   immiscible structure at all compositions. Scanning electron microscopy
   images show droplet morphology of PCL into PLA matrix up to 40 wt\% of
   PCL. Above this concentration, the co-continuous morphology starts to
   appear, which becomes again droplet morphology for blends with
   concentration of PCL higher than about 60 wt\%. The viscoelastic
   properties of the various blends were investigated using rotational
   rheometry. The enhancement of the elastic modulus of blends at small
   frequencies at which terminal zone behavior is expected, is a signature
   behavior of immiscible systems due to the presence of interface and
   contribution to the stress from interfacial tension. Two emulsion models
   were used to predict the viscoelastic properties of the blends from the
   corresponding properties of their pure components that led to the
   determination of the interfacial tension of PCL/PLA in agreement with
   experimental findings. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (C) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency has been an important concern in wireless sensor
   networks where Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol plays an important
   role. However, current MAC protocols designed for energy saving have
   seldom considered multiple applications coexisting in WSN with variation
   of traffic load dynamics. In this paper, we propose an adaptive control
   algorithm at MAC layer to promote energy efficiency. We focus on the
   tradeoff relation between collisions and control overhead as a
   reflection of traffic load and propose to balance the tradeoff under the
   constraints of QoS options. We integrate the algorithm into S-MAC and
   verify it through NS-2 platform. The simulation results demonstrate that
   our algorithm achieves observable improvement in energy performance
   while meeting QoS requirement for different coexisting applications in
   comparison with S-MAC.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Safety concerns deter cycling. The Bicyclists' Injuries and
   the Cycling Environment (BICE) study quantified the injury risk
   associated with 14 route types, from off-road paths to major streets.
   However, when it comes to injury risk, there may be discordance between
   empirical evidence and perceptions. If so, even if protective
   infrastructure is built people may not feel safe enough to cycle. This
   paper reports on the relationship between perceived and observed injury
   risk.
   Methods: The BICE study is a case-crossover study that recruited 690
   injured adult cyclists who visited emergency departments in Toronto and
   Vancouver. Observed risk was calculated by comparing route types at the
   injury sites with those at randomly selected control sites along the
   same route. The perceived risk was the mean response of study
   participants to the question ``How safe do you think this site was for
   cyclists on that trip?{''}, with responses scored from +1 (very safe) to
   -1 (very dangerous). Perceived risk scores were only calculated for
   non-injury control sites, to reduce bias by the injury event.
   Results: The route type with the greatest perceived risk was major
   streets with shared lanes and no parked cars (mean score = -0.21, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: -0.54-0.11), followed by major streets
   without bicycle infrastructure (-0.07, CI -0.14-0.00). The safest
   perceived routes were paved multi-use paths (0.66, CI 0.43-0.89),
   residential streets (0.44, CI 0.37-0.51), bike paths (0.42, CI
   0.25-0.60) and residential streets marked as bike routes with traffic
   calming (0.41, CI 0.32-0.51). Most route types that were perceived as
   higher risk were found to be so in our injury study; similarly, most
   route types perceived as safer were also found to be so. Discrepancies
   were observed for cycle tracks (perceived as less safe than observed)
   and for multi-use paths (perceived as safer than observed).
   Conclusions: Route choices and decisions to cycle are affected by
   perceptions of safety, and we found that perceptions usually
   corresponded with observed safety. However, perceptions about certain
   separated route types did not align well. Education programs and social
   media may be ways to ensure that public perceptions of route safety
   reflect the evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: As applications of robotics extend to areas that directly
   impact human life, such as the military and eldercare, the deployment of
   autonomous and semi-autonomous robots increasingly requires the input of
   stakeholder opinions. Up to now, technological deployment has been
   relying on the guidance of government/military policy and the healthcare
   system without specific incorporation of professional and lay opinion.
   Methods: This paper presents results from a roboethics study that uses
   the unique N-Reasons scenario-based survey instrument. The instrument
   collected Yes, No, Neutral responses from more than 250 expert and lay
   responders via the Internet along with their ethics-content reasons for
   the answers, allowing the respondents to agree to previously-provided
   reasons or to write their own. Data from three questions relating to
   military and eldercare robots are analyzed qualitatively and
   quantitatively. Results: The survey reveals that respondents weigh the
   appropriateness of robotics technology deployment in concert with the
   level of autonomy conferred upon it. The accepted level of robot
   autonomy does not appear to be solely dependent on the perceived
   efficiency and effectiveness of the technology, but is subject to the
   robot's relationship with the public's principle-based reasons and the
   application field in focus. Conclusion: The N-Reasons instrument was
   effective in eliciting ethical commentary in a simple, on-line survey
   format and provides insights into the interactions between the issues
   that respondents consider across application and technology boundaries.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{66-76}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a discrete fibre model for soft biological tissues,
   which is based on a generalised strain invariant. Non-linear strain
   energy functions of this generalised invariant model the non-linear
   response of the soft tissue. Six fibre bundles are orientated such that
   they pass through opposing vertices of a regular icosahedron. The fibre
   bundles are weighted in order to characterise the anisotropic nature
   inherent in most soft tissues. A significant advantage of the
   generalised strain approach is that the fibre bundle weights are pure
   measures of the anisotropy of the simulated soft tissue. It is shown
   that the weights can be used to define an approximate continuous
   orientation distribution function of the fibres within the tissue. The
   proposed model accurately simulated uniaxial tensile loading of pig skin
   (Error 16.6\%), biaxial stretching of rabbit skin (Error 12.0\%), simple
   shear of septal myocardium (Error 13.4\%), and the equibiaxial loading
   of fresh and fixed aortic valve cusps (Error 1.9\% and 0.9\%,
   respectively). The predicted fibre orientations are in general agreement
   with measurements in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   often fraught with technical challenges, there is considerable interest
   in and need associated with the development of techniques for
   size-dependent fractionation of MMS. In this study we demonstrated
   continuous size-dependent fractionation of sub-micron scale particles
   driven by secondary (Dean effect) flows in curved microfluidic channels.
   Our goal was to demonstrate that such techniques can be applied to MMS
   containing superparamagnetic nanoparticles. To achieve this goal, we
   developed and tested a microfluidic chip for continuous MMS
   fractionation. Our data address two key areas. First, the densities of
   MMS are typically in the range 1.5-2.5 g/cm(3), and thus they tend be
   non-neutrally buoyant. Our data demonstrate that efficient
   size-dependent fractionation of MMS entrained in water (density 1 g/cm3)
   is possible and is not significantly influenced by the density mismatch.
   In this context we show that a mixture comprising two different
   monodisperse MMS components can be separated into its constituent parts
   with 100\% and 88\% success for the larger and smaller particles,
   respectively. Similarly, we show that a suspension of polydisperse MMS
   can be separated into streams containing particles with different mean
   diameters. Second, our data demonstrate that efficient size-dependent
   fractionation of MMS is not impeded by magnetic interactions between
   particles, even under application of homogeneous magnetic fields as
   large as 35 kA/m. The chip is thus suitable for the separation of
   different particle fractions in a continuous process and the size
   fractions can be chosen simply by adjusting the flow velocity of the
   carrier fluid. These facts open the door to size dependent fractionation
   of MMS. (C) 2012 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fixture has been designed and utilized in conjunction with a
   conventional rotational rheometer to measure and study the mechanisms of
   friction of polymeric surfaces (ultra-high molecular weight
   polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and polymethylmethacrylate) on
   ice. Ice friction experiments were performed at various sliding
   velocities (from 0.0079 to 1.96 m/s), temperatures (from -25 degrees C
   to -1.5 degrees C), and various degrees of surface roughness. It was
   found that the magnitude of the sliding velocity and temperature play
   important roles in ice friction. Friction coefficient decreases with
   increasing temperature at high sliding velocities (from 0.79 to 1.96
   m/s) due to surface lubrication. However, at lower sliding velocities
   (from 0.0079 to 0.079 m/s) the friction coefficient initially decreases
   and then increases due to the modification of the real contact area on
   the ice surface. The ice friction coefficient was found to be nearly
   independent of relatively small differences in surface roughness.
   Finally, the ice friction coefficient of three polymer substrates
   exhibiting very different static contact angles, from hydrophilic to
   hydrophobic, was found to scale inversely with their water static
   contact angle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of sludge type, microwave temperature, sonication time, and
   anaerobic digester temperature were investigated on solubilization and
   methane production from pulp mill secondary and primary sludges by
   multi-level factorial designs. Analysis of variance showed that all main
   effects (microwave temperature, sludge type and digestion temperature)
   and two-way interactions have significant (P-value < 0.05) effects on
   cumulative methane production relative to control (not pretreated)
   digesters (CMPr) at elevated microwave temperatures (150-175 degrees C).
   On the other hand, at lower microwave temperatures (50, 75, and 100
   degrees C), pretreatments did not significantly improve the CMPr. During
   the sonication, sonication time and digestion temperature significantly
   affected the CMPr with a P-value < 0.05. The variance analysis also
   determined that, for both pretreatment methods, the most important
   factor affecting the sludge solubilizat ion. indicated by the relative
   to control soluble to total chemical oxygen demand ratio (SCOD/TCODr),
   was the sludge type. To select a pretreatment/digestion that maximizes
   both the rate as well as the extent of anaerobic biodegradation, the
   technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)
   was applied and it was concluded that mesophilic anaerobic digestion of
   pulp mill secondary sludge irradiated at 125 degrees C can result in an
   optimal pretreatment scenario with SCOD/TCODr and CMPr of 6.1, and 1.7,

Abstract = {{The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) poses several challenges to
   the commercial practice of UV/H2O2 process for micropollutant removal.
   During the commercial application of UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation
   treatment, NOM is broken down into smaller species potentially affecting
   biostability by increasing Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC) and
   Biodegradable Organic Carbon (BDOC) of water. This work investigated the
   potential impact of UV/H2O2 treatment on the molecular weight
   distribution of NOM and biostability of different water sources. A
   recently developed flow cytometric method for enumeration of bacteria
   was utilized to assess biological stability of the treated water at
   various stages through measurement of AOC. BDOC was also assessed for
   comparison and to better study the biostability of water. Both AOC and
   BDOC increased by about 3-4 times over the course of treatment,
   indicating the reduction of biological stability. Initial TOC and the
   source of NOM were found to be influencing the biostability profile of
   the treated water. Using high performance size exclusion chromatography,
   a wide range of organic molecule weights were found responsible for AOC
   increase; however, low molecular weight organics seemed to contribute
   more. Positive and meaningful correlations were observed between BDOC
   and AOC of different waters that underwent different treatments. (C)

Abstract = {{We consider the inverse problem of continuum mechanics with the tissue
   deformation described by a mixed displacement-pressure finite element
   formulation. The mixed formulation is used to model nearly
   incompressible materials by simultaneously solving for both elasticity
   and pressure distributions. To improve numerical conditioning, a common
   solution to this problem is to use regularization to constrain the
   solutions of the inverse problem. We present a sparsity regularization
   technique that uses the discrete cosine transform to transform the
   elasticity and pressure fields to a sparse domain in which a smaller
   number of unknowns is required to represent the original field. We
   evaluate the approach by solving the dynamic elastography problem for
   synthetic data using such a mixed finite element technique, assuming
   time harmonic motion, and linear, isotropic and elastic behavior for the
   tissue. We compare our simulation results to those obtained using the
   more common Tikhonov regularization. We show that the sparsity
   regularization is less dependent on boundary conditions, less influenced
   by noise, requires no parameter tuning and is computationally faster.
   The algorithm has been tested on magnetic resonance elastography data
   captured from a CIRS elastography phantom with similar results as the
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Tests are carried out with suspensions of fibrous chrysotile particles

   concentration of 15-20\% (w/w), the concentrate yield increases and the
   concentrate grade dramatically declines. This deterioration is observed
   when the Casson yield stress exceeds 1.5-2 Pa. The tests imply that the
   rheological properties of the investigated system are mainly determined

   mineral particles, the effect of particle-particle interactions cannot

Abstract = {{This paper presents an exact analytical solution for unsteady conductive
   heat transfer in a cylindrical multilayer composite laminate. Here, it
   is supposed that fibers have been wound around the cylinder in each
   lamina. In order to find the exact solution, the Laplace transformation
   is applied on anisotropic heat conduction equation to convert the time
   scale of problem to frequency scale and the separation of variable
   method is used to solve the resulted partial differential equations. The
   effect of fibers arrangements of multilayer cylindrical laminates and
   thermal boundary conditions on unsteady conductive heat transfer of
   these orthotropic materials is studied based on the exact solution that
   is presented in the current investigation. The analytical results
   illustrated that the unsteady temperature distribution in any multilayer
   composite laminates is in a state between the temperature distribution
   in single layer laminates with fibers' angle equal to 0 deg and 90 deg.

Abstract = {{The design and construction community has shown increasing interest in
   adopting building information models (BIMs). The richness of information
   provided by BlMs has the potential to streamline the design and
   construction processes by enabling enhanced communication, coordination,
   automation and analysis. However, there are many challenges in
   extracting construction-specific information out of BlMs. In most cases,
   construction practitioners have to manually identify the required
   information, which is inefficient and prone to error, particularly for
   complex, large-scale projects. This paper describes the process and
   methods we have formalized to partially automate the extraction and
   querying of construction-specific information from a BIM. We describe
   methods for analyzing a BIM to query for spatial information that is
   relevant for construction practitioners, and that is typically
   represented implicitly in a BIM. Our approach integrates ifcXML data and
   other spatial data to develop a richer model for construction users. We
   employ custom 2D topological XQuery predicates to answer a variety of
   spatial queries. The validation results demonstrate that this approach
   provides a richer representation of construction-specific information
   compared to existing BIM tools. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Frothers are surface-active agents widely used in flotation to
   facilitate the generation of small bubbles by preventing coalescence and
   increasing the surface area flux, which is the driving factor in
   flotation. Hotation collectors also exhibit frothing capabilities but
   these have never been adequately quantified. In this paper the effect of
   two typical fatty acids, sodium oleate and tall oil, on the coalescence
   of air bubbles was determined by measuring the critical coalescence
   concentration (CCC), gas holdup, and foamability. The results revealed
   that the frothing behavior of fatty acids is qualitatively similar to
   the behavior of other frothers (e.g. MIBC), but the CCC value was
   considerably higher, e.g., for sodium oleate at natural pH the CCC was
   70 mg/L compared to about 10 mg/L for MIBC. Alkaline pH conditions
   produced lower CCC and higher foamability. Since fatty acids are weak
   electrolytes, the effect of pH on the frothing behavior was discussed in
   terms of speciation. Alkaline solutions of fatty acids produced
   considerable foam compared to typical frothers. However, lower pH values
   (7-7.5) completely prevented any foam growth. (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{We propose a novel adaptive technique based on pseudo-random (PN)
   sequences for self-calibration and self-testing of MEMS-based inertial
   sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). The method relies on using a
   parameterized behavioral model implemented on FPGA, whose parameters
   values are adaptively tuned, based on the response to test pseudo-random
   actuation of the physical structure. Dedicated comb drives actuate the
   movable mass with binary maximum length pseudo-random sequences of small
   amplitude, to keep the device within the linear operating regime. The
   frequency of the stimulus is chosen within the mechanical spectral
   operating range of the micro-device, such that the induced response
   leads to the identification of the mechanical transfer function, and to
   the tuning of the associated digital behavioral model. In case of a
   micro-gyroscope, experimental results demonstrate the adaptive tracking
   of the damping coefficient from 5.57 x 10(-5) Kg/s to 7.12 x 10(-5) Kg/s
   and of the stiffness coefficient from 132 N/m to 137.7 N/m. In the case
   of a MEMS accelerometer, the damping and stiffness coefficients are
   correctly tracked from 3.4 x 10(-3) Kg/s and 49.56 N/m to 4.57 x 10(-3)
   Kg/s and 51.48 N/m, respectively-the former values are
   designer-specified target values, while the latter are experimentally
   measured parameters for fabricated devices operating in a real
   environment. Hardware resources estimation confirms the small area the
   proposed algorithm occupies on the targeted FPGA device.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of variable fluid properties on mixed electroosmotic and
   pressure driven flow of non-Newtonian fluids is investigated in this
   paper. The non-linear coupled energy and momentum equations are solved
   by means of an iterative numerical approach. The results reveal that the
   temperature dependent effects only become significant at very high
   values of the Debye-Hiickel parameter in case of combined electroosmotic
   and pressure driven flow and could safely be neglected in other cases.
   It is observed that the physical properties variation lead to a higher
   mean velocity in case of pressure assisted flow and a lower mean
   velocity in case of pressure opposed flow. Furthermore, the temperature
   dependent effects result in reduction of viscosity and the electrical
   resistivity over the majority of the channel cross section. It is also
   found that the shear-thinning fluids are more sensitive to fluid
   properties variation with temperature compared with Newtonian and
   shear-thickening fluids. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we propose a novel enhanced maximal-ratio combining

   variations in the source-relay and relay-destination channel gains. For
   the proposed E-MRC scheme, we analyze the asymptotic error rate
   performance for high signal-to-noise ratios and Rayleigh fading. Based
   on the obtained analytical expressions, we find the optimal parameters
   that lead to minimization of the asymptotic error rate. Furthermore, we
   compare the error rate performance as well as the feedback overhead of
   E-MRC with those of important DF schemes, namely, cooperative MRC
   (C-MRC) and two DF schemes based on the link adaptive regeneration (LAR)
   concept, namely, LAR-alpha(inst) and LAR-alpha. We show that although

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose joint relay selection and power allocation
   algorithms that can work robustly under imperfect channel knowledge for
   a decode-and-forward (DF) cellular relay network. The objective is to
   minimize the uplink transmit power of the network taking each user's
   target data rate as the quality of service (QoS) constraint in the
   presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We consider the
   worst-case optimization approach, in which QoS constraint is satisfied
   for all users assuming both probabilistic and deterministic channel
   estimation error models. In this optimization framework, equivalent
   convex formulations are derived for the nonlinear optimization problems
   that are often combinatorially hard to solve in their original forms.
   After relay selection, efficient centralized as well as distributed
   power allocation algorithms scalable with respect to the size of the
   networks are developed. We also consider the case of power constrained
   networks where the objective is to provide QoS in the presence of
   limited power budgets on source and relays. The robust optimization
   problem is reformulated accordingly and efficient solution is provided.
   Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and
   demonstrate the implications of ignoring channel estimation errors while
   developing relay selection and power allocation algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of a novel band-pass sliding mode
   control (SMC) to the driving mode of MEMS-based resonators and resonant
   sensors (e.g. vibrating gyroscopes). The proposed technique relies on
   binary electrostatic actuation of the movable mass, dependent on the
   dynamics of the sliding/switching surface, in such a way that the
   generated actuation tracks possible changes in the mechanical resonant
   frequency induced by external factors (humidity, temperature, pressure,
   etc.). The core of the proposed adaptive method is the implementation in
   hardware of an adaptive behavioral reference model used by the
   controller, able to track the sensed changes in dynamics. The
   architecture has a low hardware complexity and is suitable for VLSI
   implementation, in addition to a robust tracking behavior for large
   variations in the parameters of the resonator (e.g. temperature-induced
   changes in the stiffness coefficient). Simulation results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed technique by maintaining the actuation
   of the system at its resonance frequency even in the presence of
   variations of the stiffness coefficient (step, linear)or of applied
   external forces (external acceleration and noise). Simulations results
   suggest that the novel SMC-based oscillator offers an advantageous
   alternative to more complex phase-locked loop (PLL) architectures,
   traditionally used for the driving of MEMS resonator structures. (C)

Title = {{On the choice of Compressed Sensing priors and sparsifying transforms
   for MR image reconstruction: An experimental study}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recently Compressed Sensing (CS) based techniques are being used for
   reconstructing magnetic resonance (MR) images from partially sampled
   k-space data. CS based reconstruction techniques can be categorized into
   three categories based on the objective function: (i) synthesis prior,
   (ii) analysis prior and (iii) mixed (analysis+synthesis) prior. Each of
   these can be further subdivided into convex and non-convex forms. There
   is also a wide choice available for the sparsifying transforms, viz.
   Daubechies wavelets (orthogonal and redundant), fractional spline
   wavelet (orthogonal), complex dualtree wavelet (redundant), contourlet
   (redundant) and finite difference (redundant). Previous studies in MR
   image reconstruction have used a various combinations of objective
   functions (priors) and sparsifying transforms: and each of these studies
   claimed the superiority of their method over others. In this work, we
   will review and evaluate the popular MR image reconstruction techniques
   and show that analysis prior with complex dualtree wavelets yields the
   best reconstruction results. We have evaluated our experimental results
   on real data. The metric for quantitative evaluation is the Normalized
   Mean Squared Error. Our qualitative evaluation is based both on the
   reconstructed and the difference images.
   The other significant contribution of this paper is the development of
   convex and non-convex versions of synthesis, analysis and mixed prior
   algorithms from a uniform majorization-minimization framework. The
   algorithms are compared with a state-of-the-art CS based techniques; the
   proposed ones have better reconstruction accuracy and are only
   fractionally slow. The algorithms that are derived in this paper are all
   efficient first order algorithms that are easy to implement. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Seismic resiliency of new buildings has improved over the years due to
   better seismic codes and design practices. However, there is still large
   number of vulnerable and seismically deficient buildings. It is not
   economically feasible to retrofit and upgrade all vulnerable buildings,
   thus there is a need for rapid screening tool. Many factors contribute
   to the damageability of buildings; this makes seismic evaluation a
   complex multi-criteria decision making problem. Many of these factors
   are non-commensurable and involve subjectivity in evaluation that
   highlights the use of fuzzy-based method. In this paper, a risk-based
   framework earlier proposed by Tesfamariam and Saatcioglu (2008a) is
   extended using Fuzzy-TOPSIS method and applied to develop an evaluation
   and ranking scheme for steel buildings. The ranking is based on
   damageability that can help decision makers interpret the results and
   take appropriate decision actions. Finally, the application of
   conceptual model is demonstrated through a case study of 1994 Northridge
   earthquake data on seismic damage of steel buildings.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the multiphase fluid dynamics for fouling mitigation
   in MBR systems has been widely acknowledged with air sparging having
   been applied commercially for about 20 years. However, the effects of
   air scouring are still not fully understood since the transient
   orthogonal and parallel flows as well as turbulent eddies created by
   bubbling generate complex hydrodynamic flow fields in the vicinity of a
   membrane. There is no generally valid model that describes the
   relationship between fouling rate and fluid dynamics. So, a reliable and
   universally applicable model to optimize membrane module and tank
   geometries, air scouring and filtration cycles is still pending.
   In addition to providing a discussion on the importance of multiphase
   fluid dynamics for fouling control, this review aims at developing
   guidelines to choose appropriate experimental and numerical methods for

Abstract = {{Previously, we used computer-controlled fermentation technology to
   improve the yield of filamentous phage produced in Escherichia coli by
   10-fold (Grieco et al., Bioprocess Biosyst Eng 32:773-779, 2009). In the
   current study, three major fermentation parameters (temperature,
   dissolved oxygen {[}DO], and pH) were investigated using design of
   experiments (DOE) methodology. Response surface methodology (RSM) was
   employed to create a process model and determine the optimal conditions
   for maximal phage production. The experimental data fitted best to a
   quadratic model (p < 0.0001). Temperature and pH, but not DO, proved to
   be significant variables. The model predicted a theoretical optimal
   condition for maximal bacteriophage production at temperature of 28.1 A
   degrees C and pH 6.9. A validation run resulted in phage production
   {[}3.49 x 10(11) transducing units (TU)/mL] comparable to the predicted
   value (2.86 x 10(11) TU/mL). This represented a 7-fold increase in phage
   production above that obtained without optimization, resulting in a
   70-fold increase above that achieved by shake flask culture alone.}},

Abstract = {{We formulated the energy consumption of previously proposed broadband
   wireless access with fibre-connected massively distributed antennas
   (BWA-FMDA) architecture under a generalized framework and developed an
   optimization tool in a femtocell cluster based on coordinated multipoint
   transmission (femto-CoMP) to maximize energy efficiency by adjusting the
   number of transmission antennas and controlling transmission power in
   zero-forcing beamforming. Based on the analysis results, we group every
   two neighboring antennas in multiple femto-CoMP configurations and
   proposed a new network configuration scheme that uses antenna scheduling
   to simultaneously improve spectral and energy efficiency. Compared with
   standalone femtocells, the proposed scheme is shown in a typical office
   building to increase energy efficiency by 64 \% similar to 160 \% and
   spectral efficiency by 2 \% similar to 36 \%. Compared with our previous
   BWA-FMDA configurations, the new scheme is able to improve energy
   efficiency by 6 \% similar to 68 \% and spectral efficiency by 15 \%
   similar to 55 \%. The exact gain depends on network configurations and
   transmission power levels.}},

Abstract = {{Pulse oximeters are monitors that noninvasively measure heart rate and
   blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Unfortunately, pulse oximetry is prone
   to artifacts which negatively impact the accuracy of the measurement and
   can cause a significant number of false alarms. We have developed an
   algorithm to segment pulse oximetry signals into pulses and estimate the
   signal quality in real time. The algorithm iteratively calculates a
   signal quality index (SQI) ranging from 0 to 100. In the presence of
   artifacts and irregular signal morphology, the algorithm outputs a low
   SQI number. The pulse segmentation algorithm uses the derivative of the
   signal to find pulse slopes and an adaptive set of repeated Gaussian
   filters to select the correct slopes. Cross-correlation of consecutive
   pulse segments is used to estimate signal quality. Experimental results
   using two different benchmark data sets showed a good pulse detection
   rate with a sensitivity of 96.21\% and a positive predictive value of
   99.22\%, which was equivalent to the available reference algorithm. The
   novel SQI algorithm was effective and produced significantly lower SQI
   values in the presence of artifacts compared to SQI values during clean
   signals. The SQI algorithm may help to guide untrained pulse oximeter
   users and also help in the design of advanced algorithms for generating
   smart alarms.}},

Abstract = {{Online estimation of the internal states is a perquisite for monitoring,
   control, and fault diagnosis of many engineering processes. A cost
   effective approach to monitor these variables in real time is to employ
   model-based state estimation techniques. Dynamic model-based state
   estimation is a rich and highly active area of research and many novel
   approaches have emerged over the last few years. In this paper, we
   review various recent developments in the area of nonlinear state
   estimators from a Bayesian perspective. In particular, we focus on the
   constrained state estimation (including systems modeled using
   differential-algebraic equations), the handling of multi-rate and
   delayed measurements and recent advances in model parameter estimation.
   Recent advances on the stability analysis of the estimation error
   dynamics are also briefly discussed. The review aims to provide an
   integrated view of important ideas, from the authors' perspective that
   have driven the research in this area in recent years. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   filters are used to generate a sequence of hidden states which are then
   used in a log-likelihood ratio to detect and isolate the faults. The
   approach is demonstrated through an implementation on two highly
   nonlinear case studies-a multi-unit chemical reactor system and a

Abstract = {{Identification of constituent components of each sign gesture can be
   beneficial to the improved performance of sign language recognition
   (SLR), especially for large-vocabulary SLR systems. Aiming at developing
   such a system using portable accelerometer (ACC) and surface
   electromyographic (sEMG) sensors, we propose a framework for automatic
   Chinese SLR at the component level. In the proposed framework, data
   segmentation, as an important preprocessing operation, is performed to
   divide a continuous sign language sentence into subword segments. Based
   on the features extracted from ACC and sEMG data, three basic components
   of sign subwords, namely the hand shape, orientation, and movement, are
   further modeled and the corresponding component classifiers are learned.
   At the decision level, a sequence of subwords can be recognized by
   fusing the likelihoods at the component level. The overall
   classification accuracy of 96.5\% for a vocabulary of 120 signs and
   86.7\% for 200 sentences demonstrate the feasibility of interpreting
   sign components from ACC and sEMG data and clearly show the superior
   recognition performance of the proposed method when compared with the
   previous SLR method at the subword level. The proposed method seems
   promising for implementing large-vocabulary portable SLR systems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Ultrasound (US) guidance in facet joint injections has been
   reported previously as an alternative to imaging modalities with
   ionizing radiation. However, this technique has not been adopted in the
   clinical routine, due to difficulties in the visualization of the target
   joint in US and simultaneous manipulation of the needle. Methods: We
   propose a technique to increase targeting accuracy and efficiency in
   facet joint injections. This is achieved by electromagnetically tracking
   the positions of the US transducer and the needle, and recording tracked
   US snapshots (TUSS). The needle is navigated using the acquired US
   snapshots. Results: In cadaveric lambmodel, the success rate of facet
   joint injections by five orthopedic surgery residents significantly
   increased from 44.4\% (p < 0.05) with freehand US guidance to 93.3\%
   with TUSS guidance. Needle insertion time significantly decreased from
   47.9 +/- 34.2 s to 36.1 +/- 28.7 s (mean +/- SD). In a synthetic human
   spine model, a success rate of 96.7\% was achieved with TUSS. The
   targeting accuracy of the presented system in a gel phantom was 1.03 +/-
   0.48 mm (mean +/- SD). Conclusion: Needle guidance with TUSS improves
   the success rate and time efficiency in spinal facet joint injections.
   This technique readily translates also to other spinal needle placement
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Unsupported, high surface area MoP and Ni2P catalysts were synthesized
   by adding citric acid (CA) to solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate and
   diammonium hydrogen phosphate or nickel nitrate and diammonium hydrogen
   phosphate, respectively, followed by drying (397 K), calcination (773
   K), and reduction in H-2 (923 K). The addition of CA increased the
   surface area, decreased the particle size, and increased the CO uptake
   of the MoP and Ni2P catalysts. At 623 K and 4.4 MPa, the Ni2P was 2.3
   times more active than the MoP on a mass basis and 6 times more active
   on a site basis for the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol. However,
   the Ni2P catalysts deactivated due to non-selective carbon deposition on
   the catalyst surface. Oxidation was excluded as a potential cause of
   deactivation over the Ni2P catalysts. The rate of deactivation was well
   described by an exponential decay law. Deactivation was eliminated by
   operation at higher H-2 pressures (5.3 and 6.1 MPa) but the
   hydrogenation selectivity of the Ni2P increased at these conditions. No
   deactivation was observed over the MoP catalysts at the conditions of

Abstract = {{A bed containing equal volumes of 1.85 mm glass beads (rho(p)=2500
   kg/m(3)) and 0.550 mm ceramic spheres (rho(p)=3800 kg/m(3)), was
   fluidized by water in a 191 mm i.d. cylindrical column. The water
   velocity was varied from 16.5 to 52.5 mm/s to investigate the phenomenon
   of layer inversion at three temperatures (5, 10 and 20 degrees C). The
   inversion velocity was found to decrease by 7\% on reducing the
   temperature from 20 to 10 degrees C, with no further decrease at 5
   degrees C. The operating temperature had an important effect on the
   degree of separation between the two solids. In contrast to what has
   been reported for columns of smaller diameter, gross circulation was
   found to play an important role in enhancing particle mixing.
   Quantitative and qualitative predictions of layer inversion and binary
   component segregation at different liquid velocities and of chaotic
   circulation patterns were carried out by Eulerian-Lagrangian
   Computational Particle-Fluid Dynamics (CPFD) modelling, using Barracuda
   software. The predictions are in reasonable agreement with the
   experimental observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in biomass fuels is increasing worldwide to produce heat,
   power, liquid fuels and hydrogen with reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
   Thermochemical biomass processes are relatively well developed, e.g. for
   direct combustion, gasification and pyrolysis. However, critical
   problems often arise when attempting to feed biomass into reactors,
   preventing continuous operation of the entire system. Although biomass
   feeding has received some attention in the past and several novel
   feeders have been patented, most feeders are fuel-specific and unable to
   provide reliable, efficient and economical feeding, especially for
   herbaceous fuels and reactors operating at elevated pressure. The most
   common feeding problems are bridging, rathole formation, blockage, seal
   failure and reactions in the feed line.
   The present study identifies the biomass properties which influence
   feeding and reactor performance. Design principles and selection of
   feeders are also covered. We summarize experiences and failure
   potentials of biomass feeding for combustors and gasifiers, as well as
   providing an overview based on reported feeder experiments, useful for
   later study of biomass utilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a methodology to characterise the permeability
   of a compressible bed of wood chips under mechanical load. We show that
   under the limiting condition of when the mechanical compression is large
   in comparison to hydraulic pressure the equations of motion can be
   linearised and solved to produce an expression approximating the
   variation in porosity along the length of the bed. We show how this may
   be used, in conjunction with multiple linear regression to estimate
   permeability of the bed. In the experimental portion of the work we
   measure the permeability of a bed of hemlock wood chips at three
   different kappa numbers ?, and compacted to three different mechanical
   loads, i.e. compaction pressures pc. The usefulness of these estimates
   was then tested by predicting the pressure drop versus flow relationship
   for conditions outside the range of the linearised solution; the
   equations of motion were solved numerically with knowledge of the
   measured permeability. Good agreement was obtained. After accounting for
   compressibility effects, we find that our correlation has lower flow
   resistances than the literature correlations. (c) 2011 Canadian Society

Abstract = {{Inspired by the green communication trend of next-generation wireless
   networks, we present an opportunistic energy-efficient cooperative
   communication method. Different from classical relaying selection
   schemes, which adopt either end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio or capacity
   as selection metrics, our opportunistic relaying scheme uses an energy
   efficiency metric for selecting the best relay or resorting to direct
   transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the significant energy
   savings achieved by our scheme when compared with opportunistic
   decode-and-forward based on capacity. In addition to that, dynamic time
   allocation and increasing the number of participating relays are shown
   to have a notable effect on energy efficiency.}},

Journal = {{IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a decremental user selection algorithm based on
   zero-forcing beamforming when the number of users K in the network is
   smaller than the number of antennas M at a base station. The algorithm
   is specifically designed for large-scale multi-user multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) downlink channels. While previous user selection
   algorithms are based on incremental search that starts from an empty
   user set, our proposed delete the minimum lambda (DML) algorithm starts
   by selecting all users and then deleting one user per iteration. DML
   substantially reduces the computational complexity as the cardinality of
   the final user set is close to K. Simulation results indicate that on
   average DML achieves an equal or higher sum rate performance than
   previous algorithms with greatly reduced complexity of O(MK2).}},

Abstract = {{While the conventional Fe-C phase diagram predicts negligible solubility
   of carbon in alpha-Fe at room temperature, there are many examples where
   substantial carbon supersaturations have been reported. Non-equilibrium
   processing routes, such as physical vapour deposition (PVD), appear to
   be particularly well suited to generating very high levels of
   supersaturation. Few descriptions of the stability and microstructure of
   the supersaturated state exist, however. In this study, experiments have
   been performed using two PVD techniques allowing for the production of
   nanocrystalline films containing between 11 and 16 at\% C. Transmission
   electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy reveal no
   phase other than a nearly body-centred cubic iron in the as-deposited
   films. This result is discussed with respect to the kinetics of carbon
   rearrangement and the possibility of the stabilization of the
   supersaturated state via defects.}},

Title = {{Personal and trip characteristics associated with safety equipment use
   by injured adult bicyclists: a cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to estimate use of helmets,
   lights, and visible clothing among cyclists and to examine trip and
   personal characteristics associated with their use.
   Methods: Using data from a study of transportation infrastructure and
   injuries to 690 adult cyclists in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, we
   examined the proportion who used bike lights, conspicuous clothing on
   the torso, and helmets on their injury trip. Multiple logistic
   regression was used to examine associations between personal and trip
   characteristics and each type of safety equipment.
   Results: Bike lights were the least frequently used (20\% of all trips)
   although they were used on 77\% of trips at night. Conspicuous clothing
   (white, yellow, orange, red) was worn on 33\% of trips. Helmets were
   used on 69\% of trips, 76\% in Vancouver where adult helmet use is
   required by law and 59\% in Toronto where it is not. Factors positively
   associated with bike light use included night, dawn and dusk trips, poor
   weather conditions, weekday trips, male sex, and helmet use. Factors
   positively associated with conspicuous clothing use included good
   weather conditions, older age, and more frequent cycling. Factors
   positively associated with helmet use included bike light use, longer
   trip distances, hybrid bike type, not using alcohol in the 6 hours prior
   to the trip, female sex, older age, higher income, and higher education.
   Conclusions: In two of Canada's largest cities, helmets were the most
   widely used safety equipment. Measures to increase use of visibility
   aids on both daytime and night-time cycling trips may help prevent
   crashes.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel fiducial-free approach for the registration of C-arm
   fluoroscopy to 3-D ultrasound images of prostate brachytherapy implants
   to enable dosimetry. The approach involves the reliable detection of a
   subset of radioactive seeds from 3-D ultrasound, and the use of needle
   tracks in both ultrasound and fluoroscopy for registration. Seed
   detection in ultrasound is achieved through template matching in 3-D
   radio frequency ultrasound signals, followed by thresholding and spatial
   filtering. The resulting subset of seeds is registered to the complete
   reconstruction of the brachytherapy implant from multiple C-arm
   fluoroscopy views. To compensate for the deformation caused by the
   ultrasound probe, simulated warping is applied to the seed cloud from
   fluoroscopy. The magnitude of the applied warping is optimized within
   the registration process. The registration is performed in two stages.
   First, the needle track projections from fluoroscopy and ultrasound are
   matched. Only the seeds in the matched needles are then used as
   fiducials for point-based registration. We report results from a
   physical phantom with a realistic implant (average postregistration seed
   distance of 1.6 +/- 1.2 mm) and from five clinical patient datasets
   (average error: 2.8 +/- 1.5 mm over 128 detected seeds). We conclude
   that it is feasible to use RF ultrasound data, template matching, and
   spatial filtering to detect a reliable subset of brachytherapy seeds
   from ultrasound to enable registration to fluoroscopy for dosimetry.}},

   that significant gains are obtained compared to the case of using a
   fixed guard interval and roll-off factor. To simplify the implementation

Abstract = {{Substrate straining test was carried out to study the buckling pattern

   and 7.8\%, respectively, which indicates the modifying effects of
   temperature annealing. Through the SEM observation, the critical
   buckling stresses of TiO2 nanotube films without annealing, with 250
   degrees C annealing and with 400 degrees C annealing can be estimated as
   180.4, 410.2 and 619.5 MPa, respectively. The critical buckling stress
   of TiO2 nanotube films with 250 degrees C annealing from AFM observation
   is estimated as 470.2 MPa, which indicates good agreement with the

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new architecture that explores time-based
   signal-processing concepts for testing LC-tank radio-frequency (RF)
   oscillator circuits, and in particular, quadrature oscillators, while
   relying on low-frequency digital test equipment. The proposed system has
   two inputs that are two step-like signals with a time separation that is
   externally controlled. The output of the system is an amplified and
   digitized time separation that is a function of the time separation
   between the applied input steps and the oscillator output frequency
   characteristics. Coarse time digitization circuits are used to read the
   output, from which the frequency of oscillation of the oscillator is
   deduced. A proof-of-concept circuit is designed and fabricated in a
   standard 0.18-mu m CMOS process. Experimental results confirm the
   feasibility of the proposed approach, which is demonstrated in this work
   with the successful on-chip measurement of 1.5 and 1.7 GHz oscillation

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In image-guided therapy, real-time visualization of the anatomy
   and adjustments in the therapy plan due to anatomical motions during the
   procedure is of outmost importance. 3D ultrasound has the potential to
   enable this real-time monitoring; however, nonrigid registration of a
   sequence of 3D ultrasound volumes remains to be a challenging problem.
   The authors present our recent results on the development of a
   computationally inexpensive feature-based registration algorithm for
   elastic alignment of dynamic-3D ultrasound images.
   Methods: Our algorithm uses attribute vectors, based on the image
   intensity and gradient information, to perform feature-based matching in
   a sequence of 3D ultrasound images. Prior information from both the
   fixed and previous moving images is utilized to track features
   throughout the 3D image series. The algorithm has been compared to
   various publicly available registration techniques, i.e., the B-splines
   deformable registration, the symmetric forces Demons, and the fast
   free-form deformable registration method.
   Results: Using a series of validation experiments on datasets collected
   from carotid artery, liver, and kidney of 20 subjects, the authors
   demonstrate that the feature-based, B-splines, Demons, and fast
   free-form deformable registration techniques can all recover volume
   deformations in a 3D ultrasound image series with reasonable accuracy;
   however, the proposed feature-based registration technique has
   substantial computational advantage over the other approaches.
   Conclusions: The proposed feature-based registration technique has the
   potential for real-time implementation on a computationally inexpensive
   platform and has the capability of recovering nonrigid deformations in
   tissue with reasonable accuracy. (c) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{The atomic scale interaction of solute with a migrating grain boundary
   has been studied using a binary phase field crystal (PFC) model. This
   model bridges between atomistic and continuum simulation techniques as
   it operates on diffusive timescales but at atomistic length scales. For
   this study, a two-dimensional channel containing two grains separated by
   a flat grain boundary has been constructed that allows for a channel
   length on the order of one micrometer. A new formalism has been
   developed to allow for the application of an external driving pressure
   for the growth of one grain. These simulations account for solute/grain
   boundary interactions, resulting in a solute drag effect on the grain
   boundary motion. The PFC simulations show good agreement with classical
   solute drag theory, though deviations due to the atomic scale nature of
   the interface exist. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a portable multi-channel, multi-sample UV/vis absorption and
   fluorescence detection device, which has no moving parts, can operate

   order of magnitude more. We use UV absorption to measure the
   concentration of ethylene glycol in water solutions at all levels above
   those deemed unsafe by the United States Food and Drug Administration;
   in addition we use fluorescence to measure the concentration of
   d-glucose. Both wavelengths can be used concurrently to increase
   measurement robustness and increase detection sensitivity. Our small
   robust economical device can be deployed in the absence of laboratory
   infrastructure, and therefore may find applications immediately
   following natural disasters, and in more general deployment for much
   broader-based testing of food, agricultural and household products to
   prevent outbreaks of poisoning and disease. Copyright 2012 Author(s).

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a cooperative diversity scheme for wireless
   systems employing network coding and the combination of bit-interleaved
   coded modulation (BICM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
   (OFDM). The considered system comprises multiple sources, one relay, and
   one destination. The relay decodes the signal received from all sources
   and performs network coding before forwarding the signal to the
   destination. We propose a simple cooperative maximum-ratio combining
   scheme for the destination which can successfully exploit the full
   spatial and frequency diversity offered by the channel for arbitrary
   numbers of sources and arbitrary linear modulation schemes. Furthermore,
   we propose techniques to reduce the signaling overhead and the decoding
   complexity at the destination. To gain insight for system design, we
   derive a closed-form upper bound for the asymptotic worst-case pairwise
   error probability and the diversity gain of the considered network coded
   cooperative BICM-OFDM system. These analytical results reveal the
   influence of various system parameters, including the number of sources,
   the free distance of the code, and the frequency diversity of the
   involved links, on performance. Based on the derived analytical results,
   we develop schemes for optimal relay placement and power allocation.
   Simulation results corroborate the derived analytical results and
   confirm the effectiveness of the developed optimization framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, resource allocation for energy-efficient communication in
   an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) downlink
   network with a large number of transmit antennas is studied. The
   considered problem is modeled as a non-convex optimization problem which
   takes into account the circuit power consumption, imperfect channel
   state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and different quality of
   service (QoS) requirements including a minimum required data rate and a
   maximum tolerable channel outage probability. The power allocation, data
   rate adaptation, antenna allocation, and subcarrier allocation policies
   are optimized for maximization of the energy efficiency of data
   transmission (bit/Joule delivered to the users). By exploiting the
   properties of fractional programming, the resulting non-convex
   optimization problem in fractional form is transformed into an
   equivalent optimization problem in subtractive form, which leads to an
   efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration,
   the objective function is lower bounded by a concave function which can
   be maximized by using dual decomposition. Simulation results illustrate
   that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithm converges in a
   small number of iterations and demonstrate the trade-off between energy
   efficiency and the number of transmit antennas.}},

Abstract = {{The generalized method of moments (GMM) is introduced in the framework
   of estimating the Nakagami-m fading parameter. This GMM approach
   provides a systematic procedure for finding the moment-based m parameter

   for the asymptotic variance of the GMM Nakagami m parameter estimators.
   Monte Carlo simulation results show that the GMM approach can lead to
   estimators outperforming existing moment-based m parameter estimators
   over a wide range of channel conditions. It is shown that the asymptotic
   performance of these GMM estimators are close to that of the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the sensing-throughput tradeoff in
   multi-antenna cognitive radio (CR) systems. Specifically, we optimize
   the sensing threshold, sensing time, and transmit power of a
   multi-inputmulti-output (MIMO) CR system for maximization of the
   opportunistic system throughput under transmit power, probability of
   false alarm, and probability of missed detection constraints. To this
   end, we propose a new transmission protocol which allows the CR user to
   simultaneously perform data transmission and spectrum sensing on
   different spatial subchannels. We formulate non-convex optimization
   problems for the optimal choice of the sensing threshold, sensing times,
   and transmit powers in each spatial subchannel for both single-band and
   multi-band MIMO CR systems. Since finding the global optimal solution of
   these problems entails a very high complexity, we develop two iterative
   algorithms that are based on the concept of alternating optimization and
   solve only convex subproblems in each iteration. Thus, the complexity of
   these algorithms is low, and we prove their convergence to a fixed point
   analytically. Simulation results show that the developed algorithms
   closely approach the global optimal performance and achieve significant
   performance gains compared to baseline schemes employing equal powers or
   equal sensing times in all subchannels.}},

Abstract = {{Current problems associated with bone allografts include risk of disease
   transmission, limited availability, and cost. Synthetic scaffolds have
   been proposed as substitute graft materials to address these issues.
   Calcium polyphosphate is a novel synthetic scaffold material that has
   shown good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Here, we
   evaluated calcium polyphosphate in terms of its ability to support cell
   proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Calcium polyphosphate,
   morsellized cancellous bone, and hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate
   particles were seeded with marrow stromal cells and implanted
   subcutaneously in the back of NOD/Scid mice. At 7, 14, and 28 days the
   samples were harvested and the proliferation characteristics and gene
   expression were analyzed. All tested graft materials had similar
   proliferation characteristics and gene expression. The subcutaneous
   environment had a stronger impact on the proliferation and
   differentiation of the cells than the scaffold material itself. However,
   it was shown that calcium polyphosphate is superior to
   hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate and bone in its ability to support
   cell survival in vivo. The study confirmed that calcium polyphosphate
   has potential for replacing morsellized cancellous bone as a graft

Abstract = {{Field data obtained in 2003-2004 are used to describe the influence of
   atmospheric and riverine forcing on the thermal history of fjord-type
   lakes using Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, Canada as an example.
   Typical of fjord-type lakes, Quesnel Lake is narrow, long (>100km total
   thalweg), multi-armed (three arms of comparable size), deep (maximum
   depth>500m), and has multiple basins separated by sills. The lake's
   annual thermal history responds to the joint forcing of surface heat
   exchange, river inputs, and wind stress. The lake's annual heat budget
   is dominated by surface radiative fluxes, and riverine input of heat is
   insignificant in this medium residence time lake (10years). Despite
   being insignificant to the annual heat budget, the three major rivers
   that feed the three arms of the lake contribute to the overall lake
   circulation pattern. Since these rivers have differing salinities, it is
   possible to identify, using temperature/salinity correlation diagrams,
   patterns of riverine circulation interflowing in the lake. Data from a
   1-year thermistor-chain record suggests exchange between surface and
   intermediate waters occurs twice annually, but deep-waters below
   150-250m are mainly renewed during autumn, by strong and episodic
   atmospheric forcing. This is because wind-forced turbulent diffusion and
   gravitational convection triggered by wind forced displacement of
   isotherms (initiating thermobaric instability) are required for full
   overturn and deep-water renewal. (C) 2012 International Association for

Abstract = {{Following several damaging earthquakes in China, research has been
   devoted to find the causes of the collapse of reinforced concrete (RC)
   building sand studying the vulnerability of existing buildings. The
   Chinese Code for Seismic Design of Buildings (CCSDB) has evolved over
   time, however, there is still reported earthquake induced damage of
   newly designed RC buildings. Thus, to investigate modern Chinese seismic
   design code, three low-, mid- and high-rise RC frames were designed
   according to the 2010 CCSDB and the corresponding vulnerability curves
   were derived by computing a probabilistic seismic demand model
   (PSDM).The PSDM was computed by carrying out nonlinear time history
   analysis using thirty ground motions obtained from the Pacific
   Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Finally, the PSDM was used to
   generate fragility curves for immediate occupancy, significant damage,
   and collapse prevention damage levels. Results of the vulnerability
   assessment indicate that the seismic demands on the three different
   frames designed according to the 2010 CCSDB meet the seismic
   requirements and are almost in the same safety level.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new relaying scheme referred to as space full-duplex
   max-max relay selection (SFD-MMRS), which uses relay selection and
   half-duplex (HD) relays with buffers to mimic full-duplex (FD) relaying.
   SFD-MMRS allows the selection of different relays for reception and
   transmission, which, in turn, enables the relays selected for reception
   and transmission to simultaneously receive and transmit. With SFD-MMRS,
   the prelog factor 1/2 is removed from the capacity expression, and
   better performance in terms of both throughput and outage probability is
   achieved. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the capacity and outage
   probability of the proposed scheme for a decode-and-forward (DF)
   protocol in Rayleigh fading. This analysis reveals that the proposed
   scheme provides better performance, compared with HD MMRS and HD best
   relay selection (BRS). Moreover, our simulation results show that the
   capacity of the proposed scheme with HD relays exceeds twice the
   capacity of BRS with HD relays for any number of relays. Furthermore,
   the proposed scheme provides full diversity and large signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) gains, compared with competing schemes in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{High-density cobalt (Co) nanowires (NWs) were fabricated using porous
   anodized aluminum oxide as a template. Measurement results show a high
   magnetic performance for NWs with a coercivity of about 1750 Oe and
   strong magnetic anisotropy with an easy axis parallel to the NW
   direction. We have investigated the effect of alternating current (AC)
   electrodeposition frequency on the magnetic properties of NW samples. We
   show that understanding the effect of barrier layer is critical for
   controlling the rate of NW electrodeposition. A circuit model is
   proposed that accurately describes the role of the barrier and
   interfacial layers during deposition. Results obtained by simulation of
   the circuit show an excellent agreement with experimental results for
   different frequencies and voltages. It is shown that the amount of
   electrodeposited material can be estimated based on the difference
   between the anodic and cathodic half cycles in the electrodeposited
   current. Use of higher frequency leads to more symmetrical half cycles
   and smaller electrodeposited material.}},

Title = {{Friction pressure method for simulating solute drag and particle pinning
   in a multiphase-field model}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In many polycrystalline materials, second phase particles and solute
   atoms impose a drag pressure on the motion of grain boundaries. The drag
   effect occurs on a scale comparable to the particle diameter and
   interface thickness. However, to simulate grain growth with numerical
   efficiency one requires a model that captures the drag pressure on the
   interfaces but does not resolve the fine particles or solute segregation
   spike. In this paper, a multiphase-field model is proposed to simulate
   the evolution of microstructure under constant and velocity dependent
   drag pressures. The accuracy of the model is confirmed in comparison
   with analytical expressions for a shrinking circular grain. Application
   of the model is presented for grain growth in two dimensions under
   particle pinning. Measuring curvature of grain-boundary segments reveals
   that in the completely pinned structure, the average driving pressure is
   not equal to but lower than the pinning pressure. Considering this
   effect, the predicted limiting grain size is about three times larger
   than that assumed in conventional mean-field theories. Based on this
   observation, a correction factor is introduced for these mean-field
   models. The proposed phase-field formulation is also applied to simulate
   grain growth in the presence of solute drag. The grain growth kinetics
   follows a phenomenological relationship that can be described with a
   power law with a time exponent in the range 0.35-0.50. The deviation of
   the time exponent from 0.5, associated with ideal grain growth, and its
   correlation with the solute drag parameters is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete core-wall structural systems are prevalent for high-rise
   residential buildings in the West Coast of the United States. To assess
   the seismic performance characteristics of this system, a 42-story

   CA. The building was designed using two different design approaches. The
   first design followed prescriptive requirements of US building codes,
   except height limits were disregarded. The second design followed a
   performance-based procedure. Analytical models of each design were
   subjected to a series of earthquake ground motions representative of
   very frequent to very rare shaking intensities. Effectiveness of the
   various design methods is assessed considering structural performance
   indices, initial costs, and repair costs associated with anticipated
   earthquake ground shaking. The results illustrate the seismic
   performance potential of this structural system and demonstrate the
   application of a practical seismic performance assessment approach for

Abstract = {{High dynamic range (HDR) images provide superior picture quality by
   allowing a larger range of brightness levels to be captured and
   reproduced than traditional 8-bit low dynamic range (LDR) images. Even
   with existing 8-bit displays, picture quality can be significantly
   improved if content is first captured in HDR format, and then is
   tone-mapped to convert it from HDR to the LDR format. Tone mapping
   methods have been extensively studied for 2-D images. This paper
   addresses the problem of presenting stereoscopic tone-mapped HDR images
   on 3-D LDR displays and how it is different from the 2-D scenario. We
   first present a subjective psychophysical experiment that evaluates
   existing tone-mapping operators on 3-D HDR images. The results show that
   3-D content derived using tone-mapping is much preferred to that
   captured directly with a pair of LDR cameras. Global (spatially
   invariant) and local (spatially variant) tone-mapping methods have
   similar 3-D effects. The second part of our study focuses on how the
   preferred level of brightness and the preferred amount of details differ
   between 3-D and 2-D images by conducting another set of subjective
   experiments. Our results show that while people selected slightly
   brighter images in 3-D viewing compared to 2-D, the difference is not
   statistically significant. However, compared to 2-D images, the subjects
   consistently preferred having a greater amount of details when watching
   3-D. These results suggest that 3-D content should be prepared
   differently (sharper and possibly slightly brighter) from the same
   content intended for 2-D displaying, to achieve optimal appearance in
   each format. The complete database of the original HDR image pairs and
   their LDR counterparts are available online.}},

Abstract = {{To increase the use of pulse oximetry by capitalise on the wide
   availability of mobile phones, we have designed, developed and evaluated
   a prototype pulse oximeter interfaced to a mobile phone. Usability of
   this Phone Oximeter was tested as part of a rapid prototyping process.
   Phase 1 of the study (20 subjects) was performed in Canada. Users
   performed 23 tasks, while thinking aloud. Time for completion of tasks
   and analysis of user response to a mobile phone usability questionnaire
   were used to evaluate usability. Five interface improvements were made
   to the prototype before evaluation in Phase 2 (15 subjects) in Uganda.
   The lack of previous pulse oximetry experience and mobile phone use
   increased median (IQR {[}range]) time taken to perform tasks from 219
   (160247 {[}118274]) s in Phase 1 to 228 (151501 {[}1112661]) s in Phase

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Vibro-tactile displays use human skin to convey information
   from physiological monitors to anesthesiologists, providing cues about
   changes in the status of the patient. In this investigation, we
   evaluated, in a real-time clinical environment, the usability and
   wearability of a novel vibro-tactile display belt recently developed by
   our group, and determined its accuracy in identifying events when used
   by anesthesiologists.
   METHODS: A prospective observational study design was used. During
   routine anesthesia, a standard physiological monitor was connected to a
   software tool that used algorithms to automatically identify changing
   trends in mean noninvasive arterial blood pressure, expired minute
   ventilation, peak airway pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial
   pressure. The software was wirelessly interfaced to a vibro-tactile belt
   worn by the anesthesiologist. Each physiological variable was mapped to
   1 of 4 tactor locations within the belt. The direction
   (increase/decrease) and 2 levels of change (small/large) were encoded in
   the stimulation patterns. A training session was completed by each
   anesthesiologist. The system was activated in real-time during
   anesthesia alongside routine physiological monitors. When the algorithms
   detected changes in the patient, the belt vibrated at the appropriate
   location with the pattern corresponding to the level and direction of
   change. Using a touch screen monitor the anesthesiologist was to enter
   the vibro-tactile message by first identifying the variable, then
   identifying the level and direction of change. Usability and wearability
   questionnaires were to be completed. The percentage of correct
   identification of the physiological trend, the direction of change, and
   the level of change were primary outcome variables. The mean usability
   score and wearability results were secondary outcome variables. We
   hypothesized that anesthesiologists would correctly identify the events
   communicated to them through the vibro-tactile belt 90\% of the time,
   and that anesthesiologists would find the vibro-tactile belt usable and
   wearable.
   RESULTS: Seventeen anesthesiologists evaluated the display during 57
   cases. The belt was operational for a mean (SD) duration of 75 (41)
   minutes per case. Seven cases were excluded from analysis because of
   technical failures. Eighty-one percent (confidence interval {[}CI], 77\%
   to 84\%) of all stimuli were decoded. The physiological trend, the
   direction of change, and the level of change were correctly identified
   for 97.7\% (CI 96\%-99\%), 94.9\% (CI 92\%-97\%), and 93.5\% of these
   stimuli (CI, 91\%-96\%), respectively. Fourteen anesthesiologists
   completed the usability and wearability questionnaires. The mean
   usability score was 4.8 of a maximum usability score of 7.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesiologists found a vibro-tactile belt to be wearable
   and usable and could accurately decode vibro-tactile messages in a
   real-time clinical environment. (Anesth Analg 2012;115:588-94)}},

Abstract = {{In parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the problem is to
   reconstruct an image given the partial K-space scans from all the
   receiver coils. Depending on its position within the scanner, each coil
   has a different sensitivity profile. All existing parallel MRI
   techniques require estimation of certain parameters pertaining to the
   sensitivity profile, e.g., the sensitivity map needs to be estimated for
   the SENSE and SMASH and the interpolation weights need to be calibrated
   for GRAPPA and SPIRiT. The assumption is that the estimated parameters
   are applicable at the operational stage. This assumption does not always
   hold, consequently the reconstruction accuracies of existing parallel
   MRI methods may suffer.
   We propose a reconstruction method called Calibration-Less Multi-coil
   (CaLM) MRI. As the name suggests, our method does not require estimation
   of any parameters related to the sensitivity maps and hence does not
   require a calibration stage. CaLM MRI is an image domain method that
   produces a sensitivity encoded image for each coil. These images are
   finally combined by the sum-of-squares method to yield the final image.
   It is based on the theory of Compressed Sensing (CS). During
   reconstruction, the constraint that ``all the coil images should appear
   similar{''} is introduced within the CS framework. This leads to a CS
   optimization problem that promotes group-sparsity. The results from our
   proposed method are comparable (at least for the data used in this work)
   with the best results that can be obtained from state-of-the-art
   methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is nearly unanimous consensus amongst scientists that increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2 generated by human activity, are
   effecting the Earth's climate. Increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions will
   likely increase the rates of carbonation in reinforced concrete
   structures. However, there is a lack of reliable models to predict the
   depth of carbonation as a function of time.
   To address this deficiency, a numerical model involving simultaneous
   solution of the transient diffusion and reaction equations of CO2 and
   Ca(OH)(2) was developed. The model successfully includes the effects of
   variations in various properties such as porosity, humidity,
   temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentrations and chemical reaction rates.
   The applicability of the model was confirmed after calibration using
   data from accelerated carbonation experiments, and the model is used to
   evaluate the possible effects of climate change by inputting various
   future climate scenarios in Part 2. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In Part 1 of this paper, a carbonation model was developed and
   experimentally verified which was able to forecast carbonation depth of
   a concrete specimen considering varying ambient temperature, humidity
   and CO2 concentrations.
   Part 2 of the paper applies the carbonation diffusion/reaction model
   developed in Part 1 to predict the effects of global climate change on
   the carbonation of concrete. Climate scenarios were formulated and
   combined with the model for two major Canadian cities, Toronto and
   Vancouver. Results show that for undamaged and unstressed concrete,
   climate change will significantly affect carbonation progress. The model
   showed that for unloaded, non-pozzolanic concrete, ultimate carbonation
   depths in Toronto and Vancouver could be up to 45\% higher. For
   in-service structures under load, the rates of deterioration are likely
   to be even faster. This is a cause for concern, and much further effort
   must be devoted to fully understand these phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust closed-loop strategy for control of depth
   of hypnosis. The proposed method regulates the electroencephalogram
   (EEG)-derived WAV(CNS) index as measure of hypnosis by manipulating
   intravenous propofol administration. In contrast to many existing
   closed-loop control methods for hypnosis drug delivery, the control
   design presented in this paper produces stability and robustness against
   uncertainty by explicitly accounting for the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
   pharmacodynamic (PD) variability between individuals, as well as the
   unexpected surgical stimulation and anesthetic-analgesic interaction
   that the closed-loop control is required to tolerate. This robust
   closed-loop controller was evaluated in comparison with a heuristically
   tuned proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller using a
   simulated surgical procedure on 44 patients whose PK and PD models were
   identified using real clinical data. The results demonstrate that the
   robust control strategy can deliver propofol to yield consistent and
   acceptable closed-loop induction and maintenance phase responses over
   wide-ranging PK and PD differences (mean rise and settling times of 4
   min and 7 min and mean overshoot of less than 8\%, which meets
   anesthesiologists' response specifications), whereas its PID control
   counterpart exhibits limitations in performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In-situ straining experiments and residual stress evaluations by
   micromachining require accurate measurement of surface displacements.
   Such measurements can be conveniently done using Digital Image
   Correlation (DIC). Three surface decoration techniques are presented to
   enhance surface deformation and residual stress measurement capabilities
   on micron-scale samples within a Scanning Electron Microscope-Focused
   Ion Beam (SEM-FIB) instrument. They involve the use of
   Yttria-stabilized-zirconia nano particles applied chemically, nano
   platinum dots applied using FIB, and Focused Electron Beam (FEB)
   assisted deposition. The three decoration techniques create distinctive,
   random surface features that can be used with Digital Image Correlation
   to provide full field maps of surface displacements at high
   magnifications. A series of experiments using a FEGSEM-FIB demonstrated
   the effectiveness of the three surface decoration techniques for FEGSEM
   imaging at magnifications from 2,000x to 60,000x. The precision of the
   image correlation is substantially enhanced by the surface decoration,
   with displacement standard deviations reduced to the 0.005-0.03 pixel
   range, depending on the patch size used. By means of an example
   application, the use of surface decoration for microscopic hole-drilling
   residual stress measurements within a FIB-SEM is presented. The same
   trends in DIC uncertainty observed in the analysis of the surface
   decoration patterns carried through to the example application.
   Guidelines are given for appropriate choice of decoration method to suit
   various practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Transient simulation programs, either nodal analysis-based
   electromagnetic transient program (EMTP-like) or state-variable-based,
   are used very extensively for modeling and simulation of various power
   and energy systems with electrical machines. It has been shown in the
   literature that the method of interfacing machine models with the
   external electrical network plays an important role in numerical
   accuracy and computational performance of the overall simulation. This
   paper considers the state-variable-based simulation packages, and
   provides a constant-parameter decoupled RL-branch equivalent circuit for
   interfacing the ac induction and synchronous machine models with the
   external electrical network. The proposed interfacing circuit is based
   on the voltage-behind-reactance formulation which has been shown to have
   advantageous properties. For the synchronous machines, this paper
   describes both implicit and explicit (approximate) interfacing methods.
   The presented case studies demonstrate the advantages of using the
   proposed interfacing method over the traditional qd-models that are
   conventionally used in many simulation packages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the row-sparse multiple measurement vector (MMV)
   recovery problem. This requires solving a nondeterministic polynomial
   (NP) hard optimization. Instead of approximating the NP hard problem by
   its convex/ nonconvex surrogates as is done in other studies, we propose
   techniques to directly solve the NP hard problem approximately with
   tractable algorithms. The algorithms derived in here yields better
   recovery rates than the state-of-the-art convex (spectral projected
   gradient) algorithm we compared against. We show that the compressive
   color image reconstruction can be formulated as anMMVrecovery problem
   with sparse rows and therefore can be solved by our proposed method. The
   reconstructed images are more accurate (improvement about 2 dB in peak
   signal-to-noise ratio) than the previous technique compared against.}},

Abstract = {{In the future smart grid, both users and power companies can potentially
   benefit from the economical and environmental advantages of smart
   pricing methods to more effectively reflect the fluctuations of the
   wholesale price into the customer side. In addition, smart pricing can
   be used to seek social benefits and to implement social objectives. To
   achieve social objectives, the utility company may need to collect
   various information about users and their energy consumption behavior,
   which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing
   method to tackle this problem. We assume that each user is equipped with
   an energy consumption controller (ECC) as part of its smart meter. All
   smart meters are connected to not only the power grid but also a
   communication infrastructure. This allows two-way communication among
   smart meters and the utility company. We analytically model each user's
   preferences and energy consumption patterns in form of a utility
   function. Based on this model, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
   mechanism which aims to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate
   utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design
   requires that each user provides some information about its energy
   demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's
   electricity bill payment. Finally, we verify some important properties
   of our proposed VCG mechanism for demand side management such as
   efficiency, user truthfulness, and nonnegative transfer. Simulation
   results confirm that the proposed pricing method can benefit both users
   and utility companies.}},

Abstract = {{The three way catalytic converter (TWC) is a critical component for the
   mitigation of tailpipe emissions of modern spark ignition internal
   combustion (IC) engines. Because the TWC operates effectively only when
   the air-fuel ratio is very close to stoichiometric, accurate control of
   the air-fuel ratio is required. This paper uses a switching linear
   parameter varying (LPV) controller to regulate the air-fuel ratio. For
   controller design purposes, the dynamics of the fuel path is modeled as
   a time-varying first-order plus dead time (FOPDT) model, varying with
   the engine operating point, i.e., engine speed and air flow. Large
   variation of the FOPDT model across the engine operating range leads to
   a conservative LPV controller. Therefore, the operating range is divided
   into smaller subregions, an individual LPV controller is designed for
   each, and the LPV controllers are then switched based on the operating
   point. The LPV controllers are found by solving a convex optimization
   problem with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be efficiently
   solved using available LMI techniques. The resulting closed-loop system
   has guaranteed performance over the operating range of the engine.
   Simulations show the improved air-fuel ratio regulation of the switching
   LPV controller over the engine's operating range compared to that of an
   controller which is scheduled based on air flow only as well as a
   non-switching LPV controller.}},

Abstract = {{. Seismic fragilities of buildings are often developed without
   consideration of soil-structure interaction (SSI), where base of the
   building is assumed to be fixed. This study highlights effect of SSI and
   uncertainty in soil properties such as friction angle, cohesion,
   density, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio and foundation parameters on
   seismic fragilities of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames resting in
   dense silty sand. Three-, five-, and nine-storey three-bay moment
   resisting reinforced concrete frames resting on isolated shallow
   foundation are studied and the numerical models for SSI are developed in
   OpenSees. Three sets of 10 ground motions, with mean spectrum of 100,
   500, and 1000 yr return period hazard level (matching EC-8 design
   spectrum), are used for the nonlinear time history analyses. An
   optimized Latin Hyper Cube sampling technique is used to draw the sample
   of soil properties and foundation parameters. The fragilities are
   developed for the fixed base model and SSI models. However, the
   fragilities that incorporate the soil parameter and foundation
   uncertainties are only slightly different from those based solely on the
   uncertainty in seismic demand from earthquake ground motion, suggesting
   that fragilities that are developed under the assumption that all soil
   and foundation parameters at their median (or mean) values are
   sufficient for the purpose of earthquake damage or loose estimation of
   structures resting on dense silty sand. But the consideration of the SSI
   effect has the significant influence on the fragilities compare to the
   fixed base model. The structural parameter uncertainty and foundation
   modeling uncertainty are not considered in the study. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Artisanal and small-scale gold mining accounts for a significant portion
   of the current global gold market. Many artisanal gold miners use
   mercury to amalgamate gold and separate it from undesired gangue
   minerals, because it is relatively inexpensive and readily available.
   Unfortunately, the inappropriate handling and use of mercury has created
   environmental and health concerns in artisanal mining camps throughout
   the world. While the vast majority of artisanal and small-scale gold
   mines in Mozambique use mercury amalgamation in the gold mining process,
   the privately owned Clean Tech Mine in the Manica Province has
   eliminated the use of mercury at their mine. Instead, gold is isolated
   by centrifugation and magnetic removal of gangue materials. Furthermore,
   the operation of this mine stands in contrast to other mines in the area
   due to the responsible business practices initiated by its owner to
   ensure worker safety. This report details the mining practices employed
   by Clean Tech Mine to eliminate mercury use throughout the mining
   process, increase worker safety, and provide the surrounding communities
   with an opportunity for sustainable employment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{15-28}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges are well known to influence the hydrodynamics of
   gas-solid fluidized beds, but no detailed description is currently
   available showing how they can influence bubble properties such as shape
   and velocity. This study simulates the injection of single bubbles into
   a fluidized bed of charged particles. The effect of electrostatic charge
   is modeled by the Two Fluid Model (TFM) implemented in MFIX code,
   solving the governing momentum, continuity and electrical equations.
   This model is initially evaluated for an uncharged system by comparing
   the numerical predictions with the bubble shape measured by Gidaspow D.,
   Seo, Y., Ettehadieh, B. {[}1983. Hydrodynamics of fluidization:
   Experimental and theoretical bubble sizes in a two dimensional bed with
   jet. Chem. Eng. Commun. 22, 253-272] and particle pressures measured by
   Rahman, K., Campbell, C. {[}2002. Particle pressures generated around
   bubbles in gas fluidized beds. J. Fluid Mech. 455, 103-127]. The effect
   of charged particles on bubble behavior is then simulated. The
   simulations show bubble elongation in the flow direction. As a result,
   bubbles rise more quickly than for the uncharged case. Analysis is
   performed on the magnitude of charge density and the choice of
   frictional model. The bubble deformation is explained based on forces on
   particles at the bubble periphery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   phenomena are very different for these two classes of polymers, although
   their rheological behaviors are nearly the same for many of these.
   Moreover, the metallocene HDPE shows significant slip at the die wall
   without exhibiting stick-slip transition. Important correlations are

Abstract = {{Novel nanostructured material WS2 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared through
   a simple and highly reproducible approach, namely, a mechanical
   activation strategy by using WO3 and S as the starting materials, and

   The as-prepared WS2 NSs reveal separate NSs nanostructure with a sheet
   thickness of less than 10 nm. On the basis of experimental results
   obtained under various synthesis conditions, a reasonable reaction
   process and formation mechanism is proposed, in which the pre-treatment
   of ball milling is assumed to play a key role for the formation of WS2
   NSs. Due to its large active sites originating from its unique
   structural characteristics such as loosely stacked layers, providing
   highly exposed rims particularly edges, WS2 NSs catalyst has
   demonstrated high electrocatalytic activity toward HER, which
   considerably outperforms the commonly used MoS2 (JDC) catalyst. (C) 2012

Title = {{Size-Differentiated Lateral Migration of Bubbles in Couette Flow of
   Two-Dimensional Foam}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{We report experiments on lateral migration of bubbles in a
   two-dimensional foam sheared in a narrow-gap Couette device. A larger
   bubble in an otherwise monodisperse bubble raft migrates toward the
   center of the gap as long as the bubble size ratio and the shear rate
   are each above a threshold. The migration speed is roughly two orders of
   magnitude higher than that of a single bubble, and increases with the
   shear rate and the size ratio. The bubble also deforms much more than an
   isolated one at the same shear rate. Modifying the Chan-Leal solution
   for the migration of a single submerged bubble or drop, we derive a
   formula that successfully predicts all the migration trajectories
   recorded in the experiment. The threshold for migration corresponds to
   the wall repulsion force overcoming the capillary force in the
   two-dimensional foam. The size-differentiated bubble migration provides
   an explanation for previously observed size segregation in sheared
   three-dimensional polydisperse foams.}},

Title = {{Load Transfer Characteristics Between Posterior Spinal Implants and the

Journal = {{SPINE}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A biomechanical human cadaveric study.
   Objective. To determine the percentage of shear force supported by
   posterior lumbar spinal devices of varying stiffnesses under anterior
   shear loading in a degenerative spondylolisthesis model.
   Summary of Background Data. Clinical studies have demonstrated
   beneficial results of posterior arthrodesis for the treatment of
   degenerative spinal conditions with instability. Novel spinal implants
   are designed to correct and maintain spinal alignment, share load with
   the spine, and minimize adjacent level stresses. The optimal stiffness
   of these spinal systems is unknown. To our knowledge, low-stiffness
   posterior instrumentation has not been tested under an anterior shear
   force, a highly relevant force to be neutralized in the clinical case of
   degenerative spondylolisthesis.
   Methods. The effects of implant stiffness and specimen condition on
   implant load and intervertebral motion were assessed in a biomechanical
   study. Fifteen human cadaveric lumbar functional spinal units were
   tested under a static 300 N axial compression force and a cyclic
   anterior shear force (5-250 N). Implants (high-stiffness {[}HSI]: (sic)
   5.5-mm titanium, medium-stiffness {[}MSI]: (sic) 6.35 x 7.2-mm oblong
   PEEK, and low-stiffness {[}LSI]: (sic) 5.5-mm round PEEK) instrumented
   with strain gauges were used to calculate loads and were tested in each
   of 3 specimen conditions simulating degenerative changes: intact, facet
   instability, and disc instability. Intervertebral motions were measured
   with a motion capture system.
   Results. As predicted, implants supported a significantly greater shear
   force as the specimen was progressively destabilized. Mean implant loads
   as a percent of the applied shear force in order of increasing specimen
   destabilization for the HSI were 43\%, 67\%, and 76\%; mean implant
   loads for the MSI were 32\%, 56\%, and 77\%; and mean implant loads for
   the LSI were 18\%, 35\%, and 50\%. Anterior translations increased with
   decreasing implant stiffness and increasing specimen destabilization.
   Conclusion. Implant shear stiffness significantly affected the load
   sharing between the implant and the natural spine in anterior shear ex
   vivo. Low-stiffness implants transferred significantly greater loads to
   the spine. This study supports the importance of load-sharing behavior
   when designing new implants.}},

Abstract = {{50 street dust samples from four major streets in eastern and southern
   Tehran, the capital of Iran, were analyzed for metal pollution (Cu, Cr,
   Pb, Ni, Cd, Zn, Fe, Mn and Li). Hakanson's method was used to determine
   the Risk Index (RI) and ecological risks. Amongst these samples, 21 were
   also analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Correlation,
   cluster and principal component analyses identified probable natural and
   anthropogenic sources of contaminants. The dust had elevated
   concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe and PAHs. Enrichment
   factors of Cu, Pb, Cd and Zn showed that the dust is extremely enriched
   in these metals. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed that Cu, Pb,
   Zn, Fe and PAHs and, to a lesser extent, Cr and Ni have common
   anthropogenic sources. While Mn and Li were identified to have natural
   sources, Cd may have different anthropogenic origins. All samples
   demonstrated high ecological risk. Traffic and related activities,
   petrogenic and pyrogenic sources are likely to be the main anthropogenic
   sources of heavy metals and PAHs in Tehran dust. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional Os anodes for direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFC)
   were developed by surfactant assisted electrodeposition of Os on two
   fibrous graphite substrates, AvCarb (TM) P75 and GF-S3, respectively.
   Structural characterization of the electrodes using SEM, TEM, and XPS
   revealed cluster-like Os deposits composed of nano-sized particles of
   less than 5 nm in diameter with partially oxidized surfaces. The
   structural and compositional features of the graphite fiber matrixes had
   a profound influence on the crystallography of the electrodeposited Os.
   The polycrystalline Os/AvCarb (TM) P75 exhibited superior
   electrocatalytic activity in cyclic voltammetry compared to Os/GF-S3
   with respect to oxidation of adsorbed intermediates. To explain the
   different activity XRD was used to investigate the crystallographic
   differences between the two electrodes. A DBFC with Nafion (R) 117
   membrane and operated at 333 K, with Os/AvCarb (TM) P75 anode (1.7 mg
   cm(-2) Os) and 4 mg cm-2 Pt black oxygen cathode catalyst, generated a
   peak power density of 109 mW cm(-2) with a standard error of the mean of
   +/- 12 mW cm(-2) at 90\% confidence level. The longer-term durability of
   the newly developed anodes was investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fuel cells face challenges related to performance and cost that stem in
   part from constraints of the conventional plate-and-frame architecture
   in vogue since Volta's time. Here, we present for the first time a
   cylindrical Swiss-roll mixed-reactant fuel cell (SR-MRFC) that addresses
   some of these challenges by eliminating ion exchange membranes and
   flow-field plates, to provide a light, compact multi-cell stack. We
   demonstrate the monopolar and bipolar SR-MRFC for the borohydride-oxygen
   system, using a liquid/gas mixture of 1 M NaBH4/2 M NaOH and O-2. A 3D
   anode with Pt/C (or PtRu/C) on carbon cloth was coupled with a
   gas-diffusion Ag/C (or MnO2/C) cathode. At 323 K and atmospheric
   pressure, a peak power density of density of 1000 W m(-2) was achieved
   with good performance stability. The reactor concept presented here is
   applicable to a variety of alkaline or acid fuel cell systems. (C) 2012

Title = {{Assessing impacts of high flow events on fish population: Evaluation of
   risk-based performance measures}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{16-28}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Water management decisions in regulated rivers are associated with
   uncertainty and complexity. For example, quantitative approaches for
   estimating immediate and long-term impacts of high flow events on fish
   populations have not sufficiently been addressed in the literature
   despite the institutional motivation for doing so. In this paper, a
   probabilistic model for estimating the long-term fish population
   recovery, given flood induced fish and egg losses, is developed. A
   framework that incorporates this model for estimating flood impacts in
   the form of risk-based performance measures of fish population is also
   presented. The performance measures are operational indicators that
   account for uncertainty in fish population response to high flow events.
   They include vulnerability, engineering resilience, and ecological
   resilience, as well as a modification of these measures introduced
   herein, which is equivalent to vulnerability multiplied by expected
   recovery time. Such measures characterize both short- and long-term
   fisheries impacts of water management decisions, and may be useful in
   planning, design, and real-time operation of reservoirs, and in
   participatory water use planning projects, along with other risk
   measures (e.g., life safety and economical risks). Applicability of the
   fish population recovery model and the estimated risk-based performance
   measures is explored for the case study of the Lower Campbell River in
   British Columbia, Canada. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) forests are known to be among the darkest
   materials on earth. They can absorb the entire visible range of
   electromagnetic wave more efficiently than any other known black
   material. We have attempted controlled mechanical processing of the CNTs

   area with 10\%-15\% reflectivity, a level higher than typical
   reflectivity of pure forests by over two orders of magnitude, for a wide
   range of the spectrum (570-1100 nm). Patterning of micro mirrors in the
   forest is demonstrated to show its potential application for producing
   monolithically integrated reflector-absorber arrays in the material. (C)

Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging tool in
   architecture/engineering/construction (A/E/C) industry that is used to
   design, document, and enhance communication among all the project
   stakeholders. Trim loss of rebar can be minimized with the use of
   discrete bars. To achieve this goal, a model to analyze reinforced
   concrete structure with one-dimensional (1D) cutting waste-optimization
   technique, integrated with BIM, is proposed. Building information
   modeling is selected as the hub in communicating project information
   among diverse design teams. This process permits project teams to
   utilize BIM models to simulate architectural and structural design
   requirements, and compare results speedily to make necessary changes in
   the designs to minimize rebar waste. The BIM rebar optimization analysis
   approach also supports cost-effective decision making during the design
   process. The proposed approach was validated with a two-story reinforced
   concrete structure, and the results indicated a high potential for
   budgetary savings. The proposed approach is also applicable for complex
   reinforced concrete construction projects, with repeated structural
   elements, and cost saving increases with the increase in the diameter of

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{During sheet forming, the structure of the forming fabric leaves wire
   marks on the pulp mat. Paper nonuniformity caused by the wire mark can
   lead to ink nonuniformity in printing. We investigated wire mark
   numerically through simulations of the interaction of individual fibers
   with a forming fabric. In the simulations, the flow field through the
   forming fabric was taken to be that of single-phase water flow without
   disturbance of fibers. A particle level simulation method was applied to
   simulate the motion of fibers in the flow through a single layer
   sine-wave fabric. A hundred fibers of random initial distribution were
   placed into the flow above the fabric. Those fibers were advected onto
   the fabric, forming a fiber mat. The surface roughness of the resulting
   fiber mat was then calculated. The results show that during the initial
   formation, topographic wire mark is caused partially by fiber bending
   and partially by the geometry of the fabric. For the specific fibers and
   sinusoidal forming fabric considered, more than 50\% of topographic wire
   mark is the result of geometry, with the remainder attributed to fiber
   bending. Fabrics with different geometries (e.g., different filament
   pitches or a nonsinusoidal geometry) will have different relative
   influences from geometry and fiber bending.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{395-399}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be an
   efficient method for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of
   graphene. It relies on the experimentally established near-linear
   dependence of the Raman peak shift on temperature. In earlier literature
   studies, the magnitude of the thermal conductivity was determined
   directly from the experimental data of the Raman peak shift as a
   function of the power of the laser. On the basis of the general
   principles of heat transfer at the continuum level we suggest that as
   the direct result of graphene's strongly negative temperature-dependent
   thermal conductivity, the temperature and associated Raman peak shift at
   the sample's center where the measurements are made should exhibit a
   strongly nonlinear, rather than a linear, dependence on the power of the
   laser. Such non-linearity was demonstrated analytically for the general
   experimental conditions encountered in practice. A reassessment of a set
   of literature data to take this effect into account indicated that the
   thermal conductivity values for single-layer graphene at or near ambient
   temperatures could be some 40\% higher than those originally reported.}},

   automatically create benchmark circuits for use in FPGA architecture
   studies. The circuits consist of a hierarchy of interconnected modules,
   reflecting the structure of circuits designed using a system-on-chip

   a bus, star, or dataflow configuration. Our circuit generator is
   calibrated based on a careful study of existing system-on-chip circuits.
   We show that our benchmark circuits lead to more realistic architectural
   conclusions than circuits generated using previous generators.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The measurement of airborne particles is important for environmental and
   exposure monitoring. Microfluidic technologies present potential
   advantages for aerosol monitoring but have been applied very little to
   the handling of airborne particles. In this paper, we examine the flow
   focusing and cross-streamline diffusion of aerosols in straight
   microchannels, and the size-based lateral displacement of aerosols
   caused by centrifugal forces in a curved channel. We present
   calculations, simulations, and experimental results verifying the
   models: measurements of the focusing and diffusion of 0.2 mu m and 0.75
   mu m particles in straight channels and of the size-dependent lateral
   displacement of particles between 0.2 mu m and 2 mu m in curved channels
   are demonstrated and shown to match well with the simulations. We
   observe lateral dispersion of the particles: particles closer to the top
   and bottom wall of the channel experience less lateral displacement than
   particles near the center due to the flow velocity distribution across
   the channel cross section. These results confirm that the microchannel
   techniques presented are a viable method for the size-based manipulation
   of airborne particles. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Methods for single-cell analysis are critical to revealing cell-to-cell
   variability in biological systems, especially in cases where relevant
   minority cell populations can be obscured by population-averaged
   measurements. However, to date single cell studies have been limited by
   the cost and throughput required to examine large numbers of cells and
   the difficulties associated with analyzing small amounts of starting
   material. Microfluidic approaches are well suited to resolving these
   issues by providing increased senstitivity, economy of scale, and
   automation. After many years of development microfluidic systems are now
   finding traction in a variety of single-cell analytics including gene
   expression measurements, protein analysis, signaling response, and
   growth dynamics. With newly developed tools now being applied in fields
   ranging from human haplotyping and drug discovery to stem cell and
   cancer research, the long-heralded promise of microfluidic single cell
   analysis is now finally being realized.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical evaluation of the Total Facet Arthroplasty System((R))
   (TFAS((R))): loading as compared to a rigid posterior instrumentation
   system}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{To gain insight into a new technology, a novel facet arthroplasty device
   (TFAS) was compared to a rigid posterior fixation system (UCR). The
   axial and bending loads through the implants and at the bone-implant
   interfaces were evaluated using an ex vivo biomechanical study and
   matched finite element analysis. Kinematic behaviour has been reported
   for TFAS, but implant loads have not. Implant loads are important
   indicators of an implant's performance and safety. The rigid posterior
   fixation system is used for comparison due to the extensive information
   available about these systems.
   Unconstrained pure moments were applied to 13 L3-S1 cadaveric spine
   segments. Specimens were tested intact, following decompression, UCR
   fixation and TFAS implantation at L4-L5. UCR fixation was via standard
   pedicle screws and TFAS implantation was via PMMA-cemented
   transpedicular stems. Three-dimensional 10 Nm moments and a 600 N
   follower load were applied; L4-L5 disc pressures and implant loads were
   measured using a pressure sensor and strain gauges, respectively. A
   finite element model was used to calculate TFAS bone-implant interface
   loads.
   UCR experienced greater implant loads in extension (p < 0.004) and
   lateral bending (p < 0.02). Under flexion, TFAS was subject to greater
   implant moments (p < 0.04). At the bone-implant interface, flexion
   resulted in the smallest TFAS (average = 0.20 Nm) but greatest UCR (1.18
   Nm) moment and axial rotation resulted in the greatest TFAS (3.10 Nm)
   and smallest UCR (0.40 Nm) moments. Disc pressures were similar to
   intact for TFAS but not for UCR (p < 0.04).
   These results are most applicable to the immediate post-operative period
   prior to remodelling of the bone-implant interface since the UCR and
   TFAS implants are intended for different service lives (UCR-until
   fusion, TFAS-indefinitely). TFAS reproduced intact-like anterior column
   load-sharing-as measured by disc pressure. The highest bone-implant
   moment of 3.1 Nm was measured in TFAS and for the same loading condition
   the UCR interface moment was considerably lower (0.4 Nm). For other
   loading conditions, the differences between TFAS and UCR were smaller,
   with the UCR sometimes having larger values and for others the TFAS was
   larger. The long-term physiological meaning of these findings is unknown
   and demonstrates the need for a better understanding of the relationship
   between spinal arthroplasty devices and the host tissue as development
   of next generation motion-preserving posterior devices that hope to more
   accurately replicate the natural functions of the native tissue
   continues.}},

Abstract = {{A three-valley Monte Carlo simulation approach is used in order to probe
   the transient electron transport that occurs within bulk wurtzite zinc
   oxide. For the purposes of this analysis, we follow O'Leary et al.
   {[}Solid State Commun. 150, 2182 (2010)], and study how electrons,
   initially in thermal equilibrium, respond to the sudden application of a
   constant applied electric field. We find that for applied electric field
   strength selections in excess of 300 kV/cm that an overshoot in the
   electron drift velocity is observed. An undershoot in the electron drift
   velocity is also observed for applied electric field strength selections
   in excess of 700 kV/cm, this velocity undershoot not being observed for
   other compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide and gallium
   nitride. We employ a means of rendering transparent the electron drift
   velocity enhancement offered by the transient electron transport, and
   then use the calculated dependence of the peak transient electron drift
   velocity on the applied electric field for the design optimization of
   short-channel high-frequency electron devices. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose combined relay selection and cooperative
   beamforming schemes for physical layer security. Generally, high
   operational complexity is required for cooperative beamforming with
   multiple relays because of the required information exchange and
   synchronization among the relays. On the other hand, while it is
   desirable to reduce the number of relays participating in cooperative
   beamforming because of the associated complexity problem, doing so may
   degrade the coding gain of cooperative beamforming. Hence, we propose
   combined relay selection and cooperative beamforming schemes, where only
   two of the available relays are selected for beamforming and data
   transmission. The proposed schemes introduce a selection gain which
   partially compensates for the decrease in coding gain due to limiting
   the number of participating relays to two. Both the cases where full and
   only partial channel state information are available for relay selection
   and cooperative beamforming are considered. Analytical and simulation
   results for the proposed schemes show improved secrecy capacities
   compared to existing physical layer security schemes employing
   cooperative relays.}},

Abstract = {{The so-called quasi-phase-matching (QPM) for second-harmonic generation
   (SHG) considering depletion of the pumping light power is amended. The
   conversion efficiency of SHG and the optimum domain width are discussed.
   The applicable scope of undepleted pump approximation (UPA) is estimated
   and a relative tolerance showing the difference in the SHG between the
   UPA and the pump depletion is solely determined by the SHG conversion
   efficiency. A model is fitted using the relevant data, and the results
   reveal that the conversion efficiency of SHG can be conveniently and
   easily assessed under the given conditions of pump intensity, the
   nonlinear media and the number of domains. The optimum domain widths
   deviate from the coherence length l(c) = pi/Delta k. The deviation
   increases with the pump intensity, but there is little impact on SHG due

Abstract = {{A steady-state 2D model is developed for a multichannel membrane reactor
   (MCMR) to produce pure hydrogen. The model includes one reforming
   channel coupled with a PdAg membrane to produce H2 and one combustion
   channel to generate the heat needed for the reforming. Both isothermal
   and non-isothermal simulations are applied in designing a
   laboratory-scale proof-of-concept reactor. Isothermal sensitivity
   analysis indicates parameter adjustments practically available to
   improve reactor performance. In non-isothermal simulations, catalyst
   layer thickness and kinetic pre-exponential factor are varied along the
   reactor length. Predictions indicate that the reforming methane
   conversion increased from 74?\% to 91?\%, while avoiding hot spots.
   Compared with other membrane reactors, the MCMR has the potential for
   one to two orders of magnitude higher H2 production per reactor volume
   and per mass of catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the applicability of several engineering models to
   the case of nickel loading onto an iminodiacetic chelating resin, under
   infinite solution volume conditions. Results showed that the Vermeulen
   model for intraparticle diffusion and the second order reaction model
   were best able to predict the shape of individual test runs. However,
   none of the models examined was able to fit data over the entire test
   range of 50-5000 ppm nickel, using a single fit parameter. A
   two-parameter hybrid correlation was developed which was able to provide
   a good fit to the data over this concentration range at two different
   resin bead size fractions. This hybrid correlation was fit to nickel
   loading onto a second iminodiacetic resin, as well as to copper and
   cobalt loading onto the first resin tested. The correlation showed
   versatility in being able to provide adequate fits to all data sets, and
   the order of magnitude of the empirical diffusivities is similar to
   self-diffusion coefficients reported in the literature. Preliminary
   results suggest that the second fit parameter, alpha, is an indicator of
   how sharp a boundary exists between the reacted and unreacted portions
   of the ion exchange bead. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports, for the first time, the kinetics of the
   ferric-ferrous couple on a passivated semiconductor chalcopyrite
   electrode. The electrode was passivated in sulfuric acid solution and,

   kinetics. An exchange current density of 2.44 x 10(-6) A cm(-2) and
   anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients of 0.37 and 0.50,
   respectively, were obtained. The reactions were surprisingly rapid. This
   work demonstrates that ferric reduction on chalcopyrite is faster than
   the chalcopyrite oxidation reaction itself. It is expected that this

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Restrictions in the proportion of recoverable cobalt from laterite ores
   in the Caron process are attributed to multiple effects. One of these is
   adsorption of cobalt solution species on the precipitated iron oxide
   phase. Cobalt loss to an iron oxide precipitate produced in an
   ammoniacal carbonate solution was investigated. Adsorption experiments,
   both during and after iron precipitation, were conducted under a variety
   of process conditions. While prior research has focused more on cobalt
   adsorption on hematite, the primary phase present in the residue was
   found to be ferrihydrite. Based on significant differences in adsorption
   capacity between various iron oxide phases, the material present in the
   residue will make a significant difference in cobalt losses. Cobalt loss
   was minimised at low iron concentrations, pH 10 and high ammonia
   concentrations, while temperature (over the range tested) did not
   display a significant impact on cobalt loss or the precipitated phase.

Abstract = {{Two main goals of the integrated solid waste management system (ISWMS)
   of Metro Vancouver (MV) include further recycling of waste and energy
   recovery via incineration of waste. These two very common goals,
   however, are not always compatible enough to fit in an ISWMS depending
   on waste characteristics and details of recycling programs. This study
   showed that recent recycling activities in MV have negatively affected
   the net heating value (NHV) of municipal solid waste (MSW) in this
   regional district. Results show that meeting MV's goal for additional
   recycling of MSW by 2015 will further reduce the NHV of waste, if
   additional recycling activities are solely focused on more extensive
   recycling of packaging materials (e.g. paper and plastic). It is
   concluded that 50\% additional recycling of paper and plastic in MV will
   increase the overall recycling rate to 70\% (as targeted by the MV for
   2015) and result in more than 8\% reduction in NHV of MSW. This
   reduction translates to up to 2.3 million Canadian dollar (CAD\$) less
   revenue at a potential waste-to-energy (WTE) plant with 500 000 tonnes
   year(-1) capacity. Properly designed recycling programmes, however, can
   make this functional element of ISWMS compatible with green goals of
   energy recovery from waste. Herein an explanation of how communities can
   increase their recycling activities without affecting the feasibility of
   potential WTE projects is presented.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{We focus on a specific class of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that is
   executed through Channel Eviction Triggering (CET), whereby adversary
   nodes unduly invoke mechanisms inherent in a cognitive radio (CR)
   network (CRN) operation to protect the licensed users and thus disrupt
   secondary access to the otherwise idle licensed bands. Skewing the
   spectrum sensing decision of CRN through sensing misreports is a
   manifestation of CET attacks. Whereas most studies in the literature
   focus on making the cooperative sensing more robust against such sensing
   misreports, we tackle the problem from the novel perspective of
   incentive alleviation. We distinguish two classes of such DoS attacks,
   which we refer to as CET and CET-jamming attacks. In the former case,
   the incentive of adversary CRs is to remove the competition of truthful
   CRs in accessing the licensed spectral ranges. The latter class of DoS
   attack deals with scenarios in which the adversary nodes are mainly
   interested in denying the chances of communication of CRN over primary
   bands and as such their incentive cannot be modelled by the same utility
   maximisation model as truthful CRs. We propose a solution for each class
   of attacks, and our numerical results verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed CET defence scheme in both cases. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley

Abstract = {{We consider how local and global decision policies interact in stopping
   time problems such as quickest time change detection. Individual agents
   make myopic local decisions via social learning, that is, each agent
   records a private observation of a noisy underlying state process,
   selfishly optimizes its local utility and then broadcasts its local
   decision. Given these local decisions, how can a global decision maker
   achieve quickest time change detection when the underlying state changes
   according to a phase-type distribution? This paper presents four
   results. First, using Blackwell dominance of measures, it is shown that
   the optimal cost incurred in social-learning-based quickest detection is
   always larger than that of classical quickest detection. Second, it is
   shown that in general the optimal decision policy for
   social-learning-based quickest detection is characterized by multiple
   thresholds within the space of Bayesian distributions. Third, using
   lattice programming and stochastic dominance, sufficient conditions are
   given for the optimal decision policy to consist of a single linear
   hyperplane, or, more generally, a threshold curve. Estimation of the
   optimal linear approximation to this threshold curve is formulated as a
   simulation-based stochastic optimization problem. Finally, this paper
   shows that in multiagent sensor management with quickest detection,
   where each agent views the world according to its prior, the optimal
   policy has a similar structure to social learning.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach is presented for using an eye tracker-based reference
   instead of EOG for methods that require an EOG reference to remove
   ocular artifacts (OA) from EEG. It uses a high-speed eye tracker and a
   new online algorithm for extracting the time course of a blink from eye
   tracker images to remove both eye movement and blink artifacts. It
   eliminates the need for EOG electrodes attached to the face, which is
   critical for practical daily applications. The ability of two adaptive
   filters (RLS and H-infinity) to remove OA is measured using: 1) EOG; 2)
   frontal EEG only (fEEG); and 3) the eye tracker with frontal EEG (ET +
   fEEG) as reference inputs. The results are compared for different eye
   movements and blinks of varying amplitudes at electrodes across the
   scalp. Both the RLS and H-infinity methods were shown to benefit from
   using the proposed eye tracker-based reference (ET + fEEG) instead of
   either an EOG reference or a reference based on frontal EEG alone.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next big possibility and challenge
   for the future information networks. It makes the interaction between
   people and things more active and provides the connection among
   different existing networks. Ubiquitous short-range wireless access and
   cognitive radio are key technologies for the IoT's realization. This
   paper deals with some problems in an integrated system of wireless local
   area network (WLAN) and cognitive radio cognitive WLAN over fiber
   (CWLANoF). CWLANoF is a cost-effective and efficient architecture that
   combines radio over fiber and cognitive radio technologies to provide
   centralized radio resource management and equal spectrum access in
   infrastructure-based IEEE 802.11 WLANs. In this paper, a reinforcement
   learning approach is applied to implement dynamic channel selection in
   CWLANoF. The cognitive access points select the best channels among the
   industrial, scientific, and medical band for data packet transmission,
   given that the objective is to minimize external interference and
   acquire better network-wide performance. The reinforcement learning
   method avoids solving complex optimization problems while being able to
   explore the states of a CWLANoF system during normal operations.
   Simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy is effective in
   avoiding aggregated interference, reducing outage probability, and
   improving network throughput. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved multiplicative spread spectrum (IMSS)
   embedding scheme for data hiding. We first analyze the error probability
   of the conventional multiplicative spread spectrum (MSS) scheme and
   derive the corresponding channel capacity and security level. It is
   noted that the interference effect of the host signal causes the
   distribution leakage and contributes to the decoding performance
   degradation. Since the host signal and the decoder structure information
   are available at the encoder side, the proposed IMSS scheme exploits
   both the correlation between the host signal and the watermark signal
   and the decoder structure in embedding the bit information to reduce the
   host interference effect. We can show that, compared with MSS, the
   proposed IMSS maintains the simple decoder structure and does not
   require additional information for decoding. We also analyze the
   decoding performances of MSS and IMSS in the presence of additional
   Gaussian noise. Simulation and real image results illustrate the
   superiority of the proposed IMSS data hiding scheme over the
   conventional MSS scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A highly sensitive relative humidity (RH) sensor is fabricated by a
   low-cost and scalable dielectrophoresis method that places a single
   crystalline zinc oxide nanowire (ZnO NWs) between pre-patterned
   electrodes in a freestanding device structure. The resistive device
   demonstrates an exponential sensitivity of more than 5 decades to
   changes from dry air to 60\% RH at room temperature, indebted to a
   subthreshold carrier modulation due to the high surface-to-volume-ratio
   and completely exposed NW surface that facilitates surface physisorption
   of water molecules. Transient and temperature-dependence measurements
   signify a reproducible sensing performance and an Arrhenius behavior
   with activation energy of 0.6 eV, expected for these metal oxide
   semiconductors. These results demonstrate the potential of such
   nanoscale devices for accurate monitoring of RH in different
   applications, including fuel cells and automotive sensors, smart
   clothing, smart food packaging and sensor networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider the uplink random access problem in a
   wireless multimedia network (WMN) with audio, video, and best effort
   applications. Since these multimedia applications have different
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, we model their utilities with
   concave, step, and quasi-concave functions. We assume that the access
   point performs admission control and assigns transmission probabilities
   to the users for random access, based on solving a non-convex network
   utility maximization problem. We propose a novel enumeration algorithm
   to obtain the global optimal solution by solving a number of
   computationally tractable convex optimization problems. We characterize
   the total number of iterations of the algorithm analytically. Simulation
   results show that our proposed algorithm achieves a higher average
   network aggregate utility than a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
   scheme implemented in a slotted time system.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative determination of the stress fields around the crack tip is
   a challenging and important subject to understand the fatigue
   crack-growth mechanism. In the current study, we measured the
   distribution of residual stresses and the evolution of the stress fields
   around a fatigue crack tip subjected to the constant-amplitude cyclic
   loading in a 304L stainless steel compact-tension (CT) specimen. The
   three orthogonal stress components (i.e., crack growth, crack opening,
   and through thickness) of the CT specimen were determined as a function
   of distance from the crack tip with 1-mm spatial resolution along the
   crack-propagation direction. In-situ neutron-diffraction results show
   that the enlarged tensile stresses were developed during loading along
   the through-thickness direction at a localized volume close to the crack
   tip, resulting in the lattice expansion in all three orthogonal
   directions during P (max). The current study suggests that the atypical
   plane strainlike behavior observed at the midthickness position might be
   the reason for the mechanism of the faster crack-growth rate inside the
   interior than that near the surface.}},

   gauges mounted on the sensor specimens.
   Sensing experiments indicate that under cyclic loading, the changes in
   resistivity mimic both the changes in the applied load and the measured
   material strain with high fidelity for both sensor types. The response,
   however, is nonlinear and rate dependent. At an arbitrary loading rate,

Abstract = {{Highway geometric design in mountainous areas has been a typical
   challenge. The combination of short horizontal curves and restricted
   right-of-way is a common ground for contemplating design exception in
   British Columbia, Canada. In practice, collision modification factors
   (CMFs) are advocated as quantitative measures of changes in road
   features on safety. However, in many situations, there are no CMFs in
   the literature to predict the safety impact of changing particular road
   features. An important example of these road features is sight distance
   restriction on horizontal curves. A mechanism for risk measurement has
   been proposed in earlier work to assist designers in comparing the
   safety impact of different deviations from sight distance requirements.
   This paper attempts to answer the questions as to whether it is possible
   to reduce overall risk and achieve consistency in such reduction without
   demanding wider right-of-way. This problem was formulated in a
   multi-objective optimization framework. Following this methodology, it
   was possible to achieve an average reduction in risk of 25\% on the nine
   critical cross-sections. This reduction in risk was achieved without
   demanding wider right-of-way and without creating measurable increase in
   expected collision frequency due to independent re-dimensioning of
   different geometric elements. On theoretical grounds, this paper
   represents another step into the direction of developing fully
   probabilistic geometric design standards. On practical grounds, this
   paper provides an important decision mechanism that enables the
   efficient use of available right-of-way for new highway construction.
   Case studies in this paper have been applied on a major highway
   development in British Columba, Canada. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) is a useful tool to
   prioritize strategies at any level including corporate, business and
   functional. The ratings and attractive scores used in QSPM, however,
   require judgmental decisions and should be based on expert's opinion to
   ensure the applicability of chosen strategies. Application of a fuzzy
   multi-criteria decision making method is proposed in this paper with the
   goal of improving the output of conventional QSPM by allowing the
   experts to employ linguistic terms (qualitative data) in their
   judgments. Namely, a multi-criteria decision making index via the
   technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)
   is adapted to the fuzzy QSPM in finding the sum total attractive scores
   of strategies. As a case study, the proposed method has been applied for
   strategy prioritization in a Tile Company. The results have been
   verified with expert knowledge and showed an improvement compared to the
   non-fuzzy QSPM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the effectiveness of sparse representations obtained
   by learning a set of overcomplete basis (dictionary) in the context of
   action recognition in videos. Although this work concentrates on
   recognizing human movements-physical actions as well as facial
   expressions-the proposed approach is fairly general and can be used to
   address other classification problems. In order to model human actions,
   three overcomplete dictionary learning frameworks are investigated. An
   overcomplete dictionary is constructed using a set of spatio-temporal
   descriptors (extracted from the video sequences) in such a way that each
   descriptor is represented by some linear combination of a small number
   of dictionary elements. This leads to a more compact and richer
   representation of the video sequences compared to the existing methods
   that involve clustering and vector quantization. For each framework, a
   novel classification algorithm is proposed. Additionally, this work also
   presents the idea of a new local spatio-temporal feature that is
   distinctive, scale invariant, and fast to compute. The proposed approach
   repeatedly achieves state-of-the-art results on several public data sets
   containing various physical actions and facial expressions.}},

Number = {{8, SI}},
Pages = {{1030-1035}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A family of correlation methods is presented that enables a modulo-2 pi
   phase map to be evaluated from a single ESPI fringe image and at least
   two phase-stepped reference images. The requirement for only a single
   fringe image is useful when making ESPI measurements on moving surfaces,
   where the time interval between the acquisition of multiple
   phase-stepped fringe images is not acceptable. The phase computation
   method involves correlating an image area within a small box around each
   pixel of the fringe image to the corresponding areas within the
   reference images. With careful arrangement of the computation sequence
   and the storage of some intermediate results it is possible to achieve
   computation times only double that of the classical 4+4 stepped image
   method, independent of correlation box size. The performance of the
   proposed phase calculation scheme is demonstrated using experimentally
   measured speckle images acquired from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. It
   is also shown that the phase map evaluation quality can be enhanced by
   subtracting the mostly uncorrelated phase-average component of the
   incident light. The correlation box size provides a simple means of
   controlling spatial filtering, with a small box size giving good spatial
   resolution with high noise, and a large box size giving smoother results
   but with slightly reduced spatial resolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Automatic artefact removal in a self-paced hybrid brain-computer
   interface system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: A novel artefact removal algorithm is proposed for a
   self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This hybrid
   system combines a self-paced BCI with an eye-tracker to operate a
   virtual keyboard. To select a letter, the user must gaze at the target
   for at least a specific period of time (dwell time) and then activate
   the BCI by performing a mental task. Unfortunately, electroencephalogram
   (EEG) signals are often contaminated with artefacts. Artefacts change
   the quality of EEG signals and subsequently degrade the BCI's
   performance.
   Methods: To remove artefacts in EEG signals, the proposed algorithm uses
   the stationary wavelet transform combined with a new adaptive
   thresholding mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   algorithm and other artefact handling/removal methods, semi-simulated
   EEG signals (i.e., real EEG signals mixed with simulated artefacts) and
   real EEG signals obtained from seven participants are used. For real EEG
   signals, the hybrid BCI system's performance is evaluated in an
   online-like manner, i.e., using the continuous data from the last
   session as in a real-time environment.
   Results: With semi-simulated EEG signals, we show that the proposed
   algorithm achieves lower signal distortion in both time and frequency
   domains. With real EEG signals, we demonstrate that for dwell time of
   0.0s, the number of false-positives/minute is 2 and the true positive
   rate (TPR) achieved by the proposed algorithm is 44.7\%, which is more
   than 15.0\% higher compared to other state-of-the-art artefact handling
   methods. As dwell time increases to 1.0s, the TPR increases to 73.1\%.
   Conclusions: The proposed artefact removal algorithm greatly improves
   the BCI's performance. It also has the following advantages: a) it does
   not require additional electrooculogram/electromyogram channels, long
   data segments or a large number of EEG channels, b) it allows real-time
   processing, and c) it reduces signal distortion.}},

Abstract = {{Surface behavior of the commonly found minerals in nickel laterite ores
   - quartz, magnetite, hematite and goethite was investigated using

   potentials as single minerals and in mixed systems to understand
   possible interactions between particles in laterite slurries. Surface
   potentials were evaluated according to the electroacoustic theory with
   the understanding that a direct relationship existed between zeta
   potential and electroacoustic sonic amplitude (ESA) values. Results were
   evaluated using Bruinsma's equations. Measured (actual) and calculated
   ESA values were compared to determine whether the mixed systems remained
   dispersed or a tendency towards heterocoagulation existed over a range
   of pHs. For all mixed systems the behavior of the system was affected by
   the mineral of higher proportion in the mixture. For the fine
   quartz-magnetite system, no heterocoagulation was observed at all
   proportions of quartz and magnetite over the entire pH range. In the
   fine quartz-hematite and fine quartz-goethite systems a tendency towards
   heterocoagulation was observed with increase in quartz. The effect of
   the particle size was also investigated using coarse quartz-magnetite
   mixtures. A higher tendency towards heterocoagulation was observed with
   coarser quartz. The amount of quartz was found critical for the rheology
   of laterite slurries, determining the state of dispersion and/or
   heterocoagulation in the slurry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{One-stage autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) has
   potential application in wastewater treatment plants due to its
   simplicity and small area occupation. Aimed to investigate the effects
   of digestion temperature on stabilization process and sludge properties,
   batch experiments were carried out at 35, 45, 55, and 65 degrees C in
   simulated one-stage ATAD digesters with effective volume of 5 L
   Thermophilic digestion systems at 45 and 55 degrees C attained more
   rapid volatile solids (VS) removal than a mesophilic digester at 35
   degrees C, however raising digestion temperature to 65 degrees C
   adversely affected sludge stabilization. At the end of the experiment
   (i.e. 552 h), VS removals in the 35, 45, 55 and 65 degrees C digesters
   were 33.6\%, 42.9\%, 45.0\% and 24.5\%, respectively. Digestion
   temperature has significant effect on VS reduction. As volatile fatty
   acids (VFA) accumulated rapidly from 72 to 264 h, acetic and propionic
   acids became the main VFA constituents in the thermophilic digester with
   digestion temperature of 55 degrees C, however only acetic acid was a
   major constituent of VFA in the 35 degrees C digester. After digestion
   for 552 h, characteristic absorption bands of carboxyl group, aliphatic
   chains, carboxylate group and amine group were significantly weakened in
   the 35 and 55 degrees C digesters. VS concentration is well fitted by an
   exponential decay function over a range of 35-55 degrees C. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Four types of pore formers: high-density polyethylene (HDPE),
   polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), mesocarbon-microbead (MCMB) carbon
   powder, and baking flour, are processed and characterized, then
   incorporated with NiO-YSZ nano-agglomerate powder to produce plasma
   sprayed SOFC anode coatings. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the
   coating microstructure, gas permeability measurements, and porosity
   determinations by image analysis are used to evaluate the effectiveness
   of each potential pore former powder. Under the spray conditions
   studied, the flour and MCMB pore former powders are effective as plasma
   sprayed pore formers, increasing the permeability of the coatings by
   factors of four and two, respectively, compared to a similarly sprayed
   NiO-YSZ coating without pore formers. The HOPE powder is unable to
   survive the plasma spray process and does not contribute to the final
   coating porosity. The PEEK pore former, though ineffective with the
   current powder characteristics and spray parameters, exhibits the
   highest relative deposition efficiency and the most favorable thermal
   characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenesis of malaria is largely due to stiffening of the infected
   red blood cells (RBCs). Contemporary understanding ascribes the loss of
   RBC deformability to a 10-fold increase in membrane stiffness caused by
   extra cross-linking in the spectrin network. Local measurements by
   micropipette aspiration, however, have reported only an increase of
   similar to 3-fold in the shear modulus. We believe the discrepancy stems
   from the rigid parasite particles inside infected cells, and have
   carried out numerical simulations to demonstrate this mechanism. The
   cell membrane is represented by a set of discrete particles connected by
   linearly elastic springs. The cytosol is modeled as a homogeneous
   Newtonian fluid, and discretized by particles as in standard smoothed
   particle hydrodynamics. The malaria parasite is modeled as an aggregate
   of particles constrained to rigid-body motion. We simulate RBC
   stretching tests by optical tweezers in three dimensions. The results
   demonstrate that the presence of a sizeable parasite greatly reduces the
   ability of RBCs to deform under stretching. With the solid inclusion,
   the observed loss of deformability can be predicted quantitatively using
   the local membrane elasticity measured by micropipettes.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the design, fabrication and measurement of integrated
   Bragg gratings in a compact single-mode silicon-on-insulator ridge
   waveguide. The gratings are realized by corrugating the sidewalls of the
   waveguide, either on the ridge or on the slab. The coupling coefficient
   is varied by changing the corrugation width which allows precise control
   of the bandwidth and has a high fabrication tolerance. The grating
   devices are fabricated using a CMOS-compatible process with 193 nm deep
   ultraviolet lithography. Spectral measurements show bandwidths as narrow
   as 0.4 nm, which are promising for on-chip applications that require
   narrow bandwidths such as WDM channel filters. We also present the
   die-to-die nonuniformity for the grating devices on the wafer, and our
   analysis shows that the Bragg wavelength deviation is mainly caused by
   the wafer thickness variation. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel modeling approach for wood composites
   using concepts of numerical homogenization employed in synthetic
   composites. It describes a multiscale model based on a unit cell that
   incorporates both the wood and resin phases for simulating structural
   composite lumber made of strands. In this approach, constant resin
   thickness and strand geometry, elastic properties of constituents, and
   perfect bonding between wood and resin are assumed. The multiscale
   modeling is composed of two steps. The first step estimates the
   effective elastic properties of a unit cell based on the numerical
   homogenization with periodic boundary conditions. The second step
   consists of a macroscopic finite element structural analysis of a beam
   (assembly of several unit cells) under three-point bending. Random
   distribution of strand orientation that may be encountered in an actual
   composite beam is introduced at this stage. Results indicate a
   significant influence of the resin. The first step of the approach
   provides an initial illustration when comparing effective properties of
   unit cells with different resin volume fractions and/or elastic
   properties. The resin decreases the Young's modulus of the unit cell in
   the fiber direction while strengthening the transverse and shear moduli
   depending on the contrast between the resin and wood properties. The
   final results obtained for the beam show that the bending modulus
   decreases with increasing resin content, which is a combined effect of
   the micro-mechanical phenomena. The key contribution of this paper to
   modeling wood composites is the addition of the resin phase to a
   numerical model and inclusion of random distribution of strand
   orientation. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000381. (C) 2012 American

   rapid and accurate estimation of the error rates and outage
   probabilities in large signal-to-noise ratio regimes. It is shown that
   asymptotic error rates and outage probability over correlated Nakagami-m
   branches can be obtained by scaling the asymptotic error rates and
   outage probability over independent branches with a factor det(m) (M),

Abstract = {{The Hole Erosion Test (HET) is used to determine a critical value of

   specimens of non-erodible PVC with a 6 mm, 12 mm, or 24 mm diameter
   hole, respectively. Measurements of total energy head and flow velocity
   of the exiting jet are obtained with the Pitot-static tube, and
   correlated with mean flow velocity in the hole. HET-P data obtained for
   non-erodible specimens show the value of hydraulic gradient deduced from
   measurement of hydraulic head at the sidewall of the standard HET device
   overestimates, significantly, the hydraulic shear stress on the boundary
   of the preformed hole. The error varies with size of the hole diameter,

Abstract = {{There are increased interests on using multiphoton imaging and
   spectroscopy for skin tissue characterization and diagnosis. However,
   most studies have been done with just a few excitation wavelengths. Our
   objective is to perform a systematic study of the two-photon
   fluorescence (TPF) properties of skin fluorophores, normal skin, and
   diseased skin tissues. A nonlinear excitation-emission-matrix (EEM)
   spectroscopy system with multiphoton imaging guidance was constructed. A
   tunable femtosecond laser was used to vary excitation wavelengths from
   730 to 920 nm for EEM data acquisition. EEM measurements were performed
   on excised fresh normal skin tissues, seborrheic keratosis tissue
   samples, and skin fluorophores including: NADH, FAD, keratin, melanin,
   collagen, and elastin. We found that in the stratum corneum and upper
   epidermis of normal skin, the cells have large sizes and the TPF
   originates from keratin. In the lower epidermis, cells are smaller and
   TPF is dominated by NADH contributions. In the dermis, TPF is dominated
   by elastin components. The depth resolved EEM measurements also
   demonstrated that keratin structure has intruded into the middle
   sublayers of the epidermal part of the seborrheic keratosis lesion.
   These results suggest that the imaging guided TPF EEM spectroscopy
   provides useful information for the development of multiphoton clinical
   devices for skin disease diagnosis. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{In this paper, resource allocation for energy-efficient secure
   communication in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access
   (OFDMA) downlink network is studied. The considered problem is modeled
   as a nonconvex optimization problem that takes into account the
   sum-rate-dependent circuit power consumption, multiple-antenna
   eavesdropper, artificial noise generation, and different
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, including a minimum required
   secrecy sum rate and a maximum tolerable secrecy outage probability. The
   power, secrecy data rate, and subcarrier allocation policies are
   optimized for maximization of the energy efficiency of secure data
   transmission (bit/joule securely delivered to the users). The considered
   nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex optimization
   problem by exploiting the properties of fractional programming, which
   results in an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each
   iteration, the transformed problem is solved by using dual
   decomposition. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative
   resource allocation algorithm not only converges in a small number of
   iterations but maximizes the system energy efficiency and guarantees a
   nonzero secrecy data rate for the desired users as well. In addition,
   the obtained results unveil a tradeoff between energy efficiency and
   secure communication.}},

Abstract = {{Security is the main concern and bottleneck for widely deployed wireless
   applications due to the fact that wireless channels are vulnerable to
   attacks and that wireless bandwidth is a constrained resource. In this
   sense, it is desirable to adaptively achieve security according to the
   available resource. In particular, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) based
   on cooperative communication (CC) present significant challenges to
   security issues, as well as issues of network performance and
   management. In this paper, we focus on authentication and topology
   control issues. Although authentication and topology control are
   separately studied in most existing works, they are, in fact, closely
   correlated in MANETs. For example, both authentication and topology
   control schemes have significant impacts on throughput. In this paper,
   we jointly consider authentication and topology control. Specifically,
   we analyze the effective throughput with upper layer authentication
   schemes and physical-layer schemes related to channel conditions and
   relay selections for CCs. A joint authentication and topology control
   (JATC) scheme is proposed to improve the throughput. JATC is formulated
   as a discrete stochastic optimization problem, which does not require
   prior perfect channel status but only channel estimate. We also
   mathematically prove the tracking convergence property and the
   convergence rate of the discrete stochastic optimization approach in
   this paper. Simulation results show that our scheme can substantially
   improve throughput in MANETs with CC.}},

Abstract = {{Study design: An in vitro and in vivo study in rats.
   Objectives: To design a novel rat spinal fixation device and investigate
   its biomechanical effectiveness in stabilizing the spine up to 8 weeks
   post injury.
   Methods: A fixation device made of polyetheretherketone was designed to
   stabilize the spine via bilateral clamping pieces. The device
   effectiveness was assessed in a Sprague-Dawley rat model after it was
   applied to a spine with a fracture-dislocation injury produced at C5-C6.
   Animals were euthanized either immediately (n=6) or 8 weeks (n=9)
   post-injury and the C3-T1 segment of the cervical spine was removed for
   biomechanical evaluation. Segments of intact spinal columns (C3-T1)
   (n=6) served as uninjured controls. In these tests, anterior-posterior
   shear forces were applied to the C3 vertebra to produce flexion and
   extension bending moments at the injury site (peak 12.8Nmm). The
   resultant two-dimensional motions at the injury site (that is, C5-C6)
   were measured using digital imaging and reported as ranges of motion
   (ROM) or neutral zones (NZ).
   Results: Flexion/extension ROMs (average +/- s.d.) were 18.1 +/- 3.3
   degrees, 19.9 +/- 7.5 degrees and 1.5 +/- 0.7 degrees, respectively for
   the intact, injured/fixed, and injured/8-week groups, with the
   differences being highly significant for the injured/8-week group
   (P=0.0002). Flexion/extension NZs were 3.4 +/- 2.8 degrees, 5.0 +/- 2.4
   degrees, and 0.7 +/- 0.5 degrees, respectively for the intact, injured/
   fixed, and injured/8-week groups, with the differences being significant
   for the injured/8-week group (P=0.04).
   Conclusion: The device acutely stabilizes the spine and promotes fusion

Abstract = {{Objective Fatal errors can occur in intensive care units (ICUs).
   Researchers claim that information integration at the bedside may
   improve nurses' situation awareness (SA) of patients and decrease
   errors. However, it is unclear which information should be integrated
   and in what form. Our research uses the theory of SA to analyze the type
   of tasks, and their associated information gaps. We aimed to provide
   recommendations for integrated, consolidated information displays to
   improve nurses' SA.
   Materials and Methods Systematic observations methods were used to
   follow 19 ICU nurses for 38 hours in 3 clinical practice settings.
   Storyboard methods and concept mapping helped to categorize the observed
   tasks, the associated information needs, and the information gaps of the
   most frequent tasks by SA level. Consensus and discussion of the
   research team was used to propose recommendations to improve information
   displays at the bedside based on information deficits.
   Results Nurses performed 46 different tasks at a rate of 23.4 tasks per
   hour. The information needed to perform the most common tasks was often
   inaccessible, difficult to see at a distance or located on multiple
   monitoring devices. Current devices at the ICU bedside do not adequately
   support a nurse's information-gathering activities. Medication
   management was the most frequent category of tasks.
   Discussion Information gaps were present at all levels of SA and across
   most of the tasks. Using a theoretical model to understand information
   gaps can aid in designing functional requirements.
   Conclusion Integrated information that enhances nurses' Situation
   Awareness may decrease errors and improve patient safety in the future.}},

   Surgical Decompression in a Large Animal Model of Traumatic Spinal Cord

Abstract = {{Study Design. Quantitative in vivo ultrasound imaging study of spinal
   cord and dura morphology after acute experimental spinal cord injury
   (SCI) and decompression in a pig model.
   Objective. To study the morphological changes of the spinal cord and
   dura immediately after surgical decompression for acute SCI.
   Summary of Background Data. Surgical decompression for traumatic SCI is
   currently a topic of debate. After decompression, relief of bony
   impingement on the thecal sac and spinal cord can be confirmed
   intraoperatively. However, postoperative imaging often reveals that the
   cord has swollen to fill the subarachnoid space. Little is known about
   the extent and timing of this morphological response.
   Methods. Yucatan miniature pigs received sham surgery (N = 1) or a
   moderate (N = 6, 20 g, 2.3 m/s) or high (N = 6, 20 g, 4.7 m/s) severity
   weight-drop SCI followed by 8 hours of sustained compression (100 g) and
   6 hours of postdecompression monitoring. Sagittal-plane ultrasound
   images were used to quantify spinal cord, dura, and subarachnoid space
   dimensions preinjury and once per hour after decompression.
   Results. Animals with a moderate SCI exhibited a residual cord
   deformation of up to 0.64 mm within 10 minutes of decompression, which
   tended to resolve during 6 hours because of tissue relaxation and
   swelling. For animals with high-severity SCIs, cord swelling was
   immediate and resulted in occlusion of the subarachnoid space within 10
   minutes to 5 hours, whereas this occurred for only half of the moderate
   injury group.
   Conclusion. Decompression of an acute SCI may result in residual cord
   deformation followed by gradual swelling or immediate swelling leading
   to subarachnoid occlusion. The response is dependent on initial injury
   severity. These observations may partly explain the lack of benefit of
   decompression in some patients and suggest a need to reduce cord
   swelling to optimize the clinical outcome after acute SCI.}},

   surface long water jet with high Reynolds number of 11?00050?000 and
   industrial jet parameters. The moving test surface impacts the radial
   evolution of circular wetted zone in all directions and alter the
   circular HJ at the wetting front into a non-circular contour that
   depends on the jet Re number. The limited relations in the literature do
   not represent these measured shapes and do not appropriately predict
   radii of HJ in industrial scale. A new correlation for radius of
   non-circular HJ has been derived in this study that compared more
   accurately to the experimental data. Numerical simulations of radial
   impingement flow on moving surface were performed using a variant of ke
   turbulent model and results are compared to the experimental data. The
   computational results for the wetting front were found to be close to
   the experimental data indicating the appropriate performance of the
   turbulent model.}},

Abstract = {{Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii L) particles were exposed to high
   pressure saturated steam (200 and 220 degrees C for Sand 10 min) to
   improve the durability and hydrophobicity of pellets produced from them.
   Depending on treatment severity, the moisture content of the particles
   increased from 10\% to 36\% (wet basis). Douglas fir particles
   steam-treated at 220 degrees C for 10 min had the fastest drying rate of
   0.014 min(-1). The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of steam-treated
   samples decreased with increasing steam temperature and treatment time.
   The Giggnheim-Anderson-deBoer (GAB) equilibrium model gave a good fit
   with the equilibrium data with R-2 = 0.99. The adsorption rate of
   untreated pellets exposed to humid air (30 degrees C, 90\% RH) for 72 h
   was 0.0152 min(-1) while that of steam-treated pellets ranged from
   0.0125 to 0.0135 min(-1) without a clear trend with steam treatment
   severity. These findings are critical to develop durable and less
   hygroscopic pellets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas low-level sensory processes can be linked to macroanatomy with
   great confidence, the degree to which high-level cognitive processes map
   onto anatomy is less clear. If function respects anatomy, more accurate
   intersubject anatomical registration should result in better functional
   alignment. Here, we use auditory functional magnetic resonance imaging
   and compare the effectiveness of affine and nonlinear registration
   methods for aligning anatomy and functional activation across subjects.
   Anatomical alignment was measured using normalized cross-correlation
   within functionally defined regions of interest. Functional overlap was
   assessed using t-statistics from the group analyses and the degree to
   which group statistics predict high and consistent signal change in
   individual data sets. In regions related to early stages of auditory
   processing, nonlinear registration resulted in more accurate anatomical
   registration and stronger functional overlap among subjects compared
   with affine. In frontal and temporal areas reflecting high-level
   processing of linguistic meaning, nonlinear registration also improved
   the accuracy of anatomical registration. However, functional overlap
   across subjects was not enhanced in these regions. Therefore, functional
   organization, relative to anatomy, is more variable in the frontal and
   temporal areas supporting meaning-based processes than in areas devoted
   to sensory/perceptual auditory processing. This demonstrates for the
   first time that functional variability increases systematically between
   regions supporting lower and higher cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{A fully automated and model-free baseline-correction method for
   vibrational spectra is presented. It iteratively applies a small, hut
   increasing, moving average window in conjunction with peak stripping to
   estimate spectral baselines. Peak stripping causes the area stripped
   from the spectrum to initially increase and then diminish as peak
   stripping proceeds to completion; a subsequent increase is generally
   indicative of the commencement of baseline stripping. Consequently, this
   local minimum is used as a stopping criterion. A backup is provided by a
   second stopping criterion based on the area under a third-order
   polynomial fitted to the first derivative of the current estimate of the
   baseline-free spectrum and also indicates whether baseline is being
   stripped. When the second stopping criterion is triggered instead of the
   first one, a proportionally scaled simulated Gaussian baseline is added
   to the current estimate of the baseline-free spectrum to act as an
   internal standard to facilitate subsequent processing and termination
   via the first stopping criterion. The method is conceptually simple,
   easy to implement, and fully automated. Good and consistent results were
   obtained on simulated and real Raman spectra, making it suitable for the
   fully automated baseline correction of large numbers of spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film casting involves melt flow
   through a slot die, across a small span, and onto a fast moving quench
   drum. In the wire-pinning casting process, a thin electrified wire close
   to the line of contact with the drum creates a strong pinning force that
   delays air entrainment to higher line speeds. Nonuniform wetting of the
   die lips by the extruded melt is thought to be responsible for the
   formation of streaks, a defect in the machine direction. A finite
   element model of the film casting process with wire pinning was
   developed to assist in understanding what causes significant wetting of
   the lips and whether this can be avoided by electrostatic pinning. The
   solution of the governing equations provide the location of the static
   and dynamic contact lines, thus finding the wetting and pinning points
   in the process. The simulations investigate the sensitivity of the
   static wetting line locations on the die lands to the imposed values of
   static contact angle and die-lip gap. It was found that while the
   contact angle has a small effect on the extent of die-lip wetting within
   the parameter ranges examined, there is a considerable chance that the
   feed slot surfaces can be dewetted. This seems to be the greatest danger
   for causing streaks rather than excessive wetting of the die lands. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a methodology to optimize coarse-grained floating
   point units (FPUs) in a hybrid field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
   where the FPU consists of a number of interconnected floating point
   adders/subtracters (FAs), multipliers (FMs), and wordblocks (WBs). The
   wordblocks include registers and lookup tables (LUTs) which can
   implement fixed point operations efficiently. We employ common subgraph
   extraction to determine the best mix of blocks within an FPU and study
   the area, speed and utilization tradeoff over a set of floating point
   benchmark circuits. We then explore the system impact of FPU density and
   flexibility in terms of area, speed, and routing resources. Finally, we
   derive an optimized coarse-grained FPU by considering both architectural
   and system-level issues. This proposed methodology can be used to
   evaluate a variety of FPU architecture optimizations. The results for
   the selected FPU architecture optimization show that although high
   density FPUs are slower, they have the advantages of improved area,

Abstract = {{Analysis of the linear vibration characteristics of unconstrained
   rotating isotropic thin disks leads to the important concept of
   ``critical speeds.{''} These critical rotational speeds are of interest
   because they correspond to the situation where a natural frequency of
   the rotating disk, as measured by a stationary observer, is zero. Such
   speeds correspond physically to the speeds at which a traveling
   circumferential wave, of shape corresponding to the mode shape of the
   natural frequency being considered, travel around the disk in the
   absence of applied forces. At such speeds, according to linear theory,
   the blade may respond as a space fixed stationary wave and an applied
   space fixed dc force may induce a resonant condition in the disk
   response. Thus, in general, linear theory predicts that for rotating
   disks, with low levels of damping, large responses may be encountered in
   the region of the critical speeds due to the application of constant
   space fixed forces. However, large response invalidates the predictions
   of linear theory which has neglected the nonlinear stiffness produced by
   the effect of in-plane forces induced by large displacements. In the
   present paper, experimental studies were conducted in order to measure
   the frequency response characteristics of rotating disks both in an
   idling mode as well as when subjected to a space fixed lateral force.
   The applied lateral force (produced by an air jet) was such as to
   produce displacements large enough that non linear geometric effects
   were important in determining the disk frequencies. Experiments were
   conducted on thin annular disks of different thickness with the inner
   radius clamped to the driving arbor and the outer radius free. The
   results of these experiments are presented with an emphasis on recording
   the effects of geometric nonlinearities on lateral frequency response.
   In a companion paper (Khorasany and Hutton, 2010, ``Vibration
   Characteristics of Rotating Thin Disks-Part II: Analytical
   Predictions,{''} ASME J. Mech., 79(4), p. 041007), analytical
   predictions of such disk behavior are presented and compared with the
   experimental results obtained in this study. The experimental results
   show that in the case where significant disk displacements are induced
   by a lateral force, the frequency characteristics are significantly
   influenced by the magnitude of forced displacements. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the geometric nonlinear analysis of the
   lateral displacement of thin rotating disks when subjected to a space
   fixed stationary force. Of particular interest is the development of the
   stationary wave and the effect of this wave on the frequency response of
   the disk as a function of its rotational speed. The predictions of this
   analysis are compared with experimental data obtained in a companion
   paper (Khorasany and Hutton, ``Vibration Characteristics of Rotating
   Thin Disks-Part I: Experimental Results,{''} ASME J. Appl. Mech., 79(4),
   p. 041006). The governing equations are based on Von Kaacutermaacuten
   plate theory. A Galerkin solution of the governing non linear equations
   is developed. The eigenfunctions derived from the linear analysis of a
   stationary disk are used as approximations to the spatial response of
   the disk, and the eigenfunctions of the biharmonic equation as
   approximations for the stress function. Using the developed solution,
   the equilibrium configuration of the disk under the application of a
   space fixed force is found. In order to facilitate the prediction of the
   frequency response, as a function of disk rotational speed, the
   governing nonlinear equations are linearized around the equilibrium
   solution. The linearized equations are then used to find the eigenvalues
   of the spinning disk under the application of a space fixed force. The
   effect of different levels of nonlinearity on the disk frequencies is
   studied and compared with experimental results. The analysis is shown to
   produce an accurate representation of the measured response. Of
   particular interest is the disk response at speeds close to and above
   the linear critical speed. In this region, both the analysis and the
   experimental results display frequency ``lock-in{''} behavior in which
   the frequency of backward travelling waves becomes constant for
   supercritical speeds. No speed exists for which backward travelling
   waves have zero frequency. Thus, critical speeds do not exist in the
   presence of geometric nonlinearities. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005810]}},

Abstract = {{Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated compounds
   (PFCs) are both classes of persistent organic pollutants with potential
   major health and environmental concerns. Many PBDE- and PFC-containing
   products are ultimately discarded in landfills. In samples from 28
   landfills and dumpsites across Canada, PBDEs and PFCs were detected in
   almost all landfill leachate samples, with concentrations up to 1,020
   and 21,300 ng/L, respectively. Mean concentrations were 166 ng/L for
   PBDEs and 2,950 ng/L for PFCs. Landfill leachates from southern Canada
   generally had greater concentrations of PBDEs and PFCs than those from
   northern Canada. The dominant compounds were decabromodiphenyl ether
   (BDE-209) (mean contribution 52 \%) for the PBDEs and perfluorohexanoic
   acid (mean contribution 25 \%) for the PFCs. There were strong
   correlations for some compounds within each contaminant class, such as
   the major congeners in the penta-BDE commercial mix (BDE-47, BDE-99, and
   BDE-100). Estimated average aPBDE and aPFC loadings from an urban
   landfill to the environment were calculated to be 3.5 and 62
   tonnes/year, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A new concept for the optimization of dynamic behavior of laminated
   nanocomposites is introduced where fiber orientation factor in
   continuous fiber-reinforced composites is replaced by different wt.\% of
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in each layer. First, at a design concept level,
   an optimum distribution of multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) through the
   thickness of a typical cantilever beam is sought to achieve its highest
   fundamental natural frequency for a given weight percent of MWCNTs. This
   is done using a finite element (FE) model in ABAQUS along with a
   user-defined Python code. Next, based on the obtained optimum
   distribution, actual laminated MWCNT/polystyrene (PS) composite beams
   were fabricated and their effective stiffness, fundamental natural
   frequencies and damping ratios were measured through static deflection
   and free vibration tests. It was found that the optimum distribution of
   MWCNTs resulted in an increase of 21.9\% and 10.4\% in the effective
   Young's modulus and the fundamental damped natural frequency values,
   respectively, which were almost two-fold higher than those of a beam
   with a uniform MWCNT distribution. In addition, compared to a pure
   polymer beam, 38.9\% and 27.8\% improvements in the damping ratio of the
   uniformly and optimally distributed MWCNT polymer composite beams were
   achieved. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Preventing infection is one of the major challenges in total hip and
   joint arthroplasty. The main concerns of local drug delivery as a
   solution have been the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and
   the potential inhibition of osseointegration caused by the delivery
   systems. This work investigated the in vitro drug release, antimicrobial
   performance, and cytotoxicity, as well as the in vivo bone growth of an
   antimicrobial peptide loaded into calcium phosphate coated Ti implants
   in a rabbit model. Two potent AMP candidates (HHC36: KRWWKWWRR, Tet213:
   KRWWKWWRRC) were first investigated through an in vitro cytotoxicity
   assay. MTT absorbance values revealed that HHC36 showed much lower
   cytotoxicity (minimal cytotoxic concentration 200 mu g/mL) than Tet 213
   (50 mu g/mL). The AMP HHC36 loaded onto CaP (34.7 +/- 4.2 mu g/cm2) had
   a burst release during the first few hours followed by a slow and steady
   release for 7 days as measured spectrophotometrically. The CaP-AMP
   coatings were antimicrobial against Staphylococcus aureus and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in colony-forming units (CFU) in vitro
   assays. No cytotoxicity was observed on CaP-AMP samples against MG-63
   osteoblast-like cells after 5 days in vitro. In a trabecular bone growth
   in vivo study using cylindrical implants, loading of AMP HHC36 did not
   impair bone growth onto the implants. Significant bone on-growth was
   observed on CaP-coated Ti with or without HHC36 loading, as compared
   with Ti alone. The current AMP-CaP coating thus offers in vivo
   osteoconductivity to orthopedic implants. It also offers in vitro
   antimicrobial property, with its in vivo performance to be confirmed in
   future animal infection models. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{Protecting drinking source water quality is a critical step in ensuring
   a safe supply of drinking water. Increasingly, drinking source water
   protection programs rely on the active participation of various
   stakeholders with differing degrees of water science knowledge. A
   drinking source water quality index presents a potential communication
   and analysis tool to facilitate cooperation between diverse interest
   groups as well as represent composite water quality. We tested the
   effectiveness of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment
   Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) in capturing expert assessments of
   drinking water quality. In cooperation with a panel of drinking water
   quality experts we identified a core set of parameters to reflect common
   source water concerns. Drinking source water target values were drafted
   for use in the index corresponding to two basic treatment levels. Index
   scores calculated using the core parameter set and associated source
   water target values were strongly correlated with expert assessments of
   water quality. We recommend a modified index calculation procedure to
   accommodate parameters measured at different frequencies within any
   particular study period. The resulting drinking source water CCME WQI
   provides a valuable means of monitoring, communicating, and

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an analytical model for accurately predicting the
   impact of contention on cache miss rates. The focus is multiprogrammed
   workloads running on multithreaded manycore architectures. This work
   addresses a key challenge facing earlier cache contention models as the
   number of concurrent threads exceeds the associativity of shared caches.
   The memory access characteristics of individual applications are
   obtained in isolation by profiling their circular sequences and two new
   measures of access locality are proposed. An evaluation of this model in
   the context of a Niagara processor shows that it achieves an average 8.7
   percent error in miss rate predictions which improves upon the best
   prior model by 48.1x. This paper also presents a novel Markov chain
   throughput model. When combining the contention model with the Markov
   chain model, throughput is estimated with an average error of 8.3
   percent compared to detailed simulation. Moreover, the combined model
   tracks throughput sufficiently well to find the same optimized design
   point for application-specific workloads 65 times faster than detailed
   simulation. This paper also shows that the models accurately predict
   cache contention and throughput trends across various workloads on real
   hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure evolution of electrodeposited copper thin films was
   studied at room temperature where self-annealing occurs with a
   transition from a nano to micrograin structures. The effect of
   deposition current density on the self-annealing rate of 1 mu m-thick
   films was characterized by resistivity and in situ electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). The progress of self-annealing at the film surface
   was captured during the first 10 h after deposition. The recrystallized
   grains appeared to have relatively high image quality, high twin density
   and low local orientation spread. The correlation between resistivity,
   image quality, grain average image quality and local orientation spread
   during self-annealing was investigated. A grain size threshold was used
   as a criterion to assess the fraction recrystallized of the
   microstructure as a function of time after deposition. The fractions
   recrystallized from resistivity and EBSD for films deposited at 30 and
   40 mA/cm(2) current densities were then compared. The self-annealing
   rate estimated from EBSD is in reasonable agreement with the rate of
   resistivity drop. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rheology of slurries prepared from artificial mixtures of bitumen
   with fine quartz of varying bitumen content, as well as slurries of
   actual oil sand ores, was investigated under different physicochemical
   conditions (pH and temperature). All rheological measurements were
   conducted using a Haake Rotovisco VT550 rotational viscometer, connected
   to a fixture specifically designed to measure the rheological properties
   of settling suspensions. It was found that when the bitumen content in
   slurries prepared from quartz-bitumen mixtures was low (0.7 vol. \%),
   the pH of the slurries was the most important parameter that controlled
   the rheology of these slurries. At higher bitumen contents (8 vol. \%),
   it was a combination of high temperature and high pH that gave the
   lowest apparent viscosities and yield stresses of the model mixtures.
   These model observations correlated well with the rheology data obtained
   for slurries of actual oil sand ores. The overall results were discussed
   in terms of aggregation-dispersion phenomena between bitumen and mineral
   particles. (C) 2012 The Society of Rheology.

Abstract = {{We report on ultra-fast intersubband transitions in strained coupled

   results demonstrate the capability of the studied structures to perform
   Tb/s all-optical switching in the telecommunication wavelength range
   employing exclusively intersubband transitions. The coupled double
   quantum wells embedded into a ridge-waveguide can be explored as an
   inline single-wavelength all-optical switch at 1430 or 1730 nm, with
   response times of 400fs and 2 ps, respectively. These structures can
   also be operated in a dual-wavelength mode, which allows a
   straightforward separation of signal pulses at 1730 nm from control
   pulses at 1430 nm by relaxed spectral filtering at the output of the
   device.}},

Abstract = {{The contamination of groundwater with arsenic is a serious health issue
   in many parts of the world. Although iron has been shown to be effective
   at removal of arsenic from water, there has been no research to assess
   the feasibility of using natural iron oxide minerals for water
   treatment. The successful treatment of water to remove arsenic requires
   an understanding of arsenic chemistry and the physical-chemical
   interactions between arsenic and iron oxide minerals. A study was
   conducted to evaluate hematite, magnetite, goethite and iron rich
   laterite soil as arsenic adsorbents. Electroacoustic measurements were
   conducted to assess the nature of arsenic adsorption. Results showed
   that arsenic adsorption occurred over the entire pH range tested (pH
   4-11). The isoelectric point shifted due to arsenic adsorption and this
   is a strong evidence of specific ion adsorption. This was supported by
   leaching tests that indicated strong attachment of arsenic to the
   surface of iron oxide minerals. Adsorption tests showed that iron rich
   laterite was most effective for arsenic removal, followed by goethite,
   magnetite and hematite. This was attributed to the higher specific
   surface area of the respective minerals. The study also demonstrates a
   simple water treatment method involving the use of low cost natural
   ironoxide minerals for arsenic removal to meet drinking water standards.
   Treatment of 100 mL of water containing 20 ppm arsenic with 5 g of
   laterite reduced the arsenic level down to 10 ppb within a period of 10
   min. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{53-63}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Alpine snow in which avalanches form is a quasi-brittle material with an
   energetic (or fracture mechanical) strength size effect. However, there
   is also a probabilistic aspect to the size effect. In this paper, we
   present field data for unnotched tensile fracture of uniaxially stressed
   samples and 3 point bending tensile experiments from a cold laboratory.
   In addition, we summarize field data on shear fracture tests of
   avalanche weak layers. Taken together, the argument is derived from
   about 1300 tests, 90\% of which are from field data. On the basis of the
   data, as well as simple theory relevant to unnotched quasibrittle
   fracture, we suggest that the tensile and shear fracture data follow a
   gamma probability density function (pdf). For our data, the gamma pdf is
   essentially equivalent to a normal pdf as in Daniels' fibre bundle model
   for the implied distribution shape factors. However, the physical
   description of the failure process to derive the gamma pdf for alpine
   snow differs substantially from that in Daniels' classical fibre bundle
   model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
