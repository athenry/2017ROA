Abstract = {{Smart meters have gained wide adoption as an integral part of the smart
   grid. However, their security remains problematic as many attacks are
   discovered against them. Smart meters are embedded devices that are
   constrained in terms of computing power and memory. They are also
   deployed on a large scale which imposes specific requirements (e.g., no
   false positives) on any IDS developed for them.
   In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for building intrusion
   detection systems (IDS) for smart meters, that takes these constraints
   into account. We implement our IDS on an open source smart meter
   platform. We show that our IDS imposes little performance overhead, even
   under severe memory constraints, and effectively detects a wide range of
   both known and unknown attacks. In comparison, existing IDSs incur
   unacceptable performance overheads on the meter.}},

Abstract = {{Laser ultrasonics for metallurgy is an innovative sensor dedicated to
   the measurement of microstructure evolution during thermomechanical
   processing. In this technique, broadband ultrasound pulses are generated
   and detected with lasers. The properties of the ultrasounds are then
   related to the characteristics of the microstructure. Ultrasound
   attenuation is primary originated by the scattering at grain boundaries
   and its frequency dependence can be related to the grain size. The
   present work aims to introduce this technology as an exciting tool for
   metallurgists. As an illustration of its capability, the evolution of
   the grain size during isothermal annealing from a fine grained structure
   is in-situ monitored in an Inconel 718 superalloy. Laser ultrasonic
   measurements are compared with ex-situ metallography observations.
   Indication of heterogeneous grain growth is observed, correlated to the
   dissolution of d-phase particles present in the initial structure. This
   preliminary study illustrates the potential of this new technique to
   monitor microstructure evolution in more complex scenarios including
   recrystallization during simulation of hot forging processes.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that cyclists can reduce the risk of severe
   head injuries by wearing a helmet. A system is proposed to collect
   cyclist helmet usage data automatically from video footage. Computer
   vision techniques are used to track the moving objects and then to
   analyze the object trajectories and speed profiles to identify cyclists.
   Image features are extracted from a region around the cyclist's head.
   Support vector machines determine whether the cyclist is wearing a
   helmet. The system can be approximately 90\% accurate in cyclist
   classification when provided with accurate tracks of the cyclist's head.
   Even for situations in which obtaining video to track a cyclist is
   challenging, the proposed method provides an effective retrieval system,
   potentially reducing the number of video records that must be analyzed
   manually to find instances of cyclists not wearing helmets.}},

   transmission networks can be restored using smart meters when it is
   unobservable. Moreover, improvement in the robustness of SE in
   transmission networks is studied by monitoring the condition number of
   the gain matrix in the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) SE process. Finally,
   it is demonstrated that the accuracy of SE in transmission level can be

Abstract = {{The quality of state estimation (SE) in distribution networks has
   suffered from lack of adequate measurements. Recently, a number of
   electrical companies have started to install smart meters throughout
   their distribution networks, which creates an opportunity to achieve
   high quality SE in distribution networks. However, the signals provided
   by smart meters are not synchronized, and the time gap between two
   consecutive measurements of smart meters is considerable, which implies
   that a snapshot of the entire network is not available. To address this
   issue, this paper employs an idea that is based on the credibility of
   each measurement signal. In the proposed methodology, the variance of
   error of each measured signal is modified to compensate for the
   non-synchronicity of smart meters. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is demonstrated using IEEE13-bus system. The results show that
   the introduced method is more reliable than traditional SE techniques
   and improves the accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of football concussions occur during tackles and other
   collisions and, thus, concussion associated with head impact is of
   primary concern for improving football helmet design. Our group is
   developing a helmet to minimize head-injury risk in head impacts in
   football. The Pro-Neck-Tor (PNT) football helmet consists of a
   commercially available football helmet outer shell and a custom
   carbon-fiber inner shell within the outer shell. A PNT mechanism is used
   to connect the two shells. Upon an impact to the top of the head, the
   PNT mechanism will deploy and the inner shell will rotate in either a
   flexion or extension manner. This deployment allows an escape path for
   the neck, provides acceleration ride-down, and significantly reduces
   head accelerations. Furthermore, in oblique impacts, the outer shell
   will deform into the void between the two shells, absorbing more energy
   than what padding alone can absorb. Testing conducted against a
   contemporary commercially available football helmet to show the
   effectiveness of the double-shell concept at mitigating head
   accelerations has shown reductions of 17 \% in linear acceleration in
   impacts to the back of the head (velocity similar to 3.0 m/s). In
   impacts to the top of the head (velocity similar to 3.3 m/s) where the
   inner shell deployed, resultant linear head accelerations were reduced
   by approximately 38 \%. Reductions in head rotational accelerations
   upward of 33 \% were also recorded. The potential of a PNT helmet to
   prevent concussions in college football was estimated. The PNT helmet
   reduced the potential for concussion in every impact sustained and, in
   four instances, it decreased the potential from 85 \%, 56 \%, 83 \%, and
   77 \% to 32 \%, 15 \%, 29 \%, and 24 \%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the applicability of an asymmetric force feedback
   control framework for bimanual robot-assisted surgery using the da Vinci
   surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). The core idea of this method,
   previously presented in {[}1], is that when completing two-handed tasks
   involving an action and a reaction force, the forces applied on the
   environment by the action hand are not transferred back to the same
   hand, but rather to the reaction hand. Such a method provides an
   intuitive way of feeling the force, while avoiding the instability
   issues, since the control loop in not closed from the slave to the
   master of the same hand. In the introductory paper {[}1], the technique
   was implemented using game controllers with simple tasks. In this paper,
   the technique was implemented on the da Vinci surgical system (Classic
   version) using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) controllers that enable
   complete access to all control levels of the da Vinci robot manipulators
   via custom mechatronics and open-source software. The implementation
   involved a full re-write of a teleoperation controller based on
   kinematic correspondence with gravity compensation, as well as torque
   control functions for force rendering on the da Vinci master
   manipulators. A series of suture knot tying and haptic exploration
   experiments were conducted in which a small group of users, both
   surgeons (N=3) and novices (N=6) evaluated the system. The results show
   that the proposed technique has some promise when implemented in a
   realistic 14 degrees of freedom system, but further work is necessary to
   make the system fully usable.}},

   achieves a 3-dB bandwidth of 27.3 GHz and a gain of 50 dB Omega while

Title = {{Temporal-lobe morphology differs between healthy adolescents and those
   with early-onset of depression}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},

Pages = {{145-155}},
Abstract = {{Major depressive disorder (MDD) has previously been linked to structural
   changes in several brain regions, particularly in the medial temporal
   lobes (Bellani, Baiano, Brambilla, 2010; Bellani, Baiano, Brambilla,
   2011). This has been determined using voxel-based morphometry,
   segmentation algorithms, and analysis of shape deformations
   (Bell-McGinty et al., 2002; Bergouignan et al., 2009; Posener et al.,
   2003; Vasic et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008): these are methods in which
   information related to the shape and the pose (the size, and anatomical
   position and orientation) of structures is lost. Here, we incorporate
   information about shape and pose to measure structural deformation in
   adolescents and young adults with and without depression (as measured
   using the Beck Depression Inventory and Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders criteria). As a hypothesis-generating study,
   a significance level of p < 0.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons,
   was used, so that subtle morphological differences in brain structures
   between adolescent depressed individuals and control participants could
   be identified. We focus on changes in cortical and subcortical temporal
   structures, and use a multi-object statistical pose and shape model to
   analyze imaging data from 16 females (aged 16-21) and 3 males (aged 18)
   with early-onset MDD, and 25 female and 1 male normal control
   participants, drawn from the same age range. The hippocampus,
   parahippocampal gyrus, putamen, and superior, inferior and middle
   temporal gyri in both hemispheres of the brain were automatically
   segmented using the LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (Shattuck et al.,
   2008) in MNI space. Points on the surface of each structure in the atlas
   were extracted and warped to each participant's structural MRI. These
   surface points were analyzed to extract the pose and shape features.
   Pose differences were detected between the two groups, particularly in
   the left and right putamina, right hippocampus, and left and right
   inferior temporal gyri. Shape differences were detected between the two
   groups, particularly in the left hippocampus and in the left and right
   parahippocampal gyri. Furthermore, pose measures were significantly
   correlated with BDI score across the whole (clinical and control)
   sample. Since the clinical participants were experiencing their very
   first episodes of MDD, morphological alteration in the medial temporal
   lobe appears to be an early sign of MDD, and is unlikely to result from
   treatment with antidepressants. Pose and shape measures of morphology,
   which are not usually analyzed in neuromorphometric studies, appear to
   be sensitive to depressive symptomatology. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an algorithm to design switching surfaces for the
   switching linear parameter-varying (LPV) controller with hysteresis
   switching. The switching surfaces are sought for to optimize the bound
   of the closed-loop L-2-gain performance. An optimization problem is
   formulated with respect to parameters characterizing Lyapunov matrix
   variables, local controller matrix variables, and locations of the
   switching surfaces. Since the problem turns out to be nonconvex in terms
   of these characterizing parameters, a numerical algorithm is given to
   guarantee the decrease of the cost function value after each iteration.
   A hybrid method which combines the steepest descent method and Newton's
   method is employed in each iteration to decide the update direction of
   switching surface parameters. A simple numerical example is provided to
   demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel respiratory motion compensation (MC)
   technique for hybrid PET/MR system. Existing PET/MR respiratory MC
   techniques mainly rely on respiratory gating to reconstruct 3D MR images
   for different respiratory phases, and use image registration techniques
   to estimate the deformation between different respiratory phases. A well
   known limitation of respiratory gating is its assumption that breathing
   motion is perfectly periodic, therefore MC techniques based on gated MR
   are sensitive to irregular breathing patterns. To address this
   limitation, the proposed technique uses dynamic 2D MRIs for PET/MR
   respiratory motion estimation. A static 3D MRI and a series of dynamic
   2D MRIs are acquired before and during the PET data acquisition,
   respectively. The dynamic 2D MRIs are registered against the static 3D
   MRI using a novel deformable 2D+t to 3D image registration method to
   derive a 3D+t deformation field, which is then used for motion corrected
   PET reconstruction. The proposed method is validated on synthetic PET/MR
   data and real MR data, demonstrating its efficacy to compensate for
   irregular respiratory motion and to deblur the PET image.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the behavior of a pure capacitive output filter in
   parallel and series-parallel resonant converters. Unlike traditional
   resonant voltage-and current-driven rectifiers, pure capacitive output
   filters present interruptions in power transfer from the transformer
   primary to the secondary, owing to the existence of a parallel resonant
   capacitor. Therefore, existing formulas for different specifications of
   the output rectifier (e.g., output voltage ripple, efficiency, etc.)
   cannot be employed. This work provides detailed analysis of, and design
   equations for, pure capacitive output filters to cover the
   characteristic behavior of this rectifier. These valuable equations can
   be employed in the design of both low and high voltage power supplies
   for a variety of applications such as telecom power supplies and medical
   therapy instruments. Experimental results of a 10kVDC, 1.1kW power
   supply are presented to validate the analysis, along with other

Abstract = {{This paper presents an advanced switching sequence based on boundary
   control for the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter applied in a
   Solid-State Transformer (SST). The implementation of the switching
   sequence follows the recent advancements in curved switching surfaces
   for DAB converters - the Natural Switching Surface (NSS) - and
   contributes to higher efficiency and transient regulation. The proposed
   switching sequence improves the overall efficiency of the converter by
   ensuring soft switching transitions in the full operating range.
   Furthermore, it incorporates a fully controlled burst-mode switching
   sequence for light loading conditions to further extend the efficiency
   gains. Dynamic regulation, an important requirement in SST, is also
   addressed by the proposed boundary-based sequence. As a result,
   excellent dynamic response is obtained by taking advantage of all the
   possible switching structures of the converter. The analysis provides
   insight into the natural trajectories of the converter, which produce
   soft-switching transitions and enable the converter structures to
   achieve the target operating point directly. Simulation and experimental
   results are presented to validate the benefits of the switching sequence
   and illustrate the dynamic regulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new hybrid resonant bridgeless ac-dc PFC boost
   converter operating in continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) is proposed for
   neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) battery charging. This
   hybrid-resonant boost converter has two active switches that operate in
   pulse-width modulation (PWM) and hybrid-resonant modes of operation.
   This combined modulation technique is called hybrid resonant PWM
   (HRPWM). The proposed converter with HRPWM features several benefits.
   The gates of the two active switches are tied together, so, the
   converter does not need any extra circuitry to sense the positive, or
   negative line-cycle operation. The semiconductor devices operate with a
   voltage stress close to the output voltage. The resonant tank components
   are relatively small in size and the hybrid-resonant mode of operation
   alleviates the reverse recovery losses for the body diode. The converter
   architecture exhibits less common mode noise compared with the
   dual-boost and bridgeless boost converters. Moreover, the converter
   architecture enables simple implementation of lightning and surge
   protection systems. And it has inherent inrush current limit capability.
   Experimental results of a prototype unit converting a universal ac input
   to a 400 V dc output at 650 W and 70 kHz switching frequency are
   presented to verify the proof of concept.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach to determine the small signal model of
   an LLC resonant converter is presented. The proposed model uses analysis
   techniques from communications theory to determine the control-to-output
   transfer function required for the design of a digital compensation
   network. The model considers the effects of higher order harmonics and
   sideband frequencies generated by the variable switching frequency
   control method, as well as the effects of the LLC resonant tank and the
   output voltage rectifier. Experimental data from a prototype LLC
   resonant converter was obtained to verify the analytical results, and
   revealed that the proposed model is an accurate representation of the
   prototype converter dynamics. Simulation results demonstrated that a
   digital compensator design based on the proposed model was able to
   achieve output voltage regulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a single-stage battery charger for neighborhood
   electric vehicles (NEVs) which has the following characteristics: i.
   operate in continuous-conduction-mode (CCM), ii. include bridgeless
   operation, iii. realize zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation for all
   MOSFETs, iv. provide controlled di/dt turn-off of the output diodes, v.
   has symmetric operation. The proposed battery charger exhibited minimum
   number of semiconductor devices compare with state-of-the-art battery
   charger. The input-output isolation reduces the possibility of safety
   hazards. The proposed isolation transformer acts as an AC transformer
   which is much smaller in size and increase transformer efficiency. The
   symmetric operation of the proposed converter reduces the common-mode
   (CM) noise. In the paper, the operation of the proposed converter is
   explained in detail and a mathematical analysis of its steady-state
   operation is performed. The feasibility of the converter is confirmed by
   comparing an experimental prototype of the benchmark hard switched ac-dc
   current-fed push-pull converter and simulation work of the proposed
   converter. Through experimentation and analysis the proposed converter
   can achieve a total loss reduction of 20 \%, at 70 kHz switching
   frequency, 120 V input, and 48 V/650 W output}},

Abstract = {{The nodes near sink in wireless sensor networks are featured with heavy
   transmission loads, so these performance bottleneck nodes are prone to
   running out of energy early with shortened network lifetime. Routing
   tactic plays important role on transmission performance and energy
   consumption of network. In this paper, we enumerate typical source
   routing tactics in Grid topology, include 1) Random Equal Probability
   Forwarding, 2) Line Forwarding, 3) Source-Zigzag Forwarding, 4)
   Destination-Zigzag Forwarding, and 5) Balance Forwarding. We analysis
   the traffic load distribution among nodes for these routing tactics, and
   calculate the load of performance bottleneck nodes and transmission
   delay in one data collection cycle. Based on the energy consumption
   model, we further make comparison on the energy consumptions of
   transmission and standing-by for these tactics. Numerical results show
   that Balance Forwarding tactic leads to the least overall energy
   consumption on performance bottleneck nodes, and Line Forwarding and
   Random Equal-Probability Forwarding lead to high energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies to support the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) is becoming more
   important as the need to better understand our environments and make
   them smart increases. As a result it is predicted that intelligent
   devices and networks, such as wireless network, will not be isolated but
   connected and integrated composing computer networks. So far, to enable
   an End-to-end M2M service, WebSocket has attracted lots of attentions
   because of its unique full-duplex communications features. Besides,
   ZigBee technology has widely been deployed in short-range wireless
   communication systems with its low-power dissipation and high
   transmission speed. In this paper, we focus on the emerging M2M gateway
   development for home and industry applications. Specifically, by
   providing the detailed system architecture and user cases, we give a
   specific analysis on environmental monitoring implemented with WebSocket
   and ZigBee technology. The ZigBee sensor network is used to collect the
   temperature and humidity information. The foreground of the system shows
   the related data through B/S (Browser/Server) mode by utilizing
   WebSocket to push the information received by a web server to the client

Abstract = {{Two different conditions were used to study the effect of homogenization

   24 h at 600 degrees C to produce a sample with a very low density of

   32 mm/s and extrusion ratio of 70: 1, the material with a high density
   of dispersoids formed <001> and <111> double fibre texture in the centre
   of extrusion rod and a smeared texture from <011> to <111> near the

   evolution of the constituent particles and Mn dispersoids were
   characterized by means of optical microscopy and FEG-SEM. The Mn content
   in and out of solution was estimated using the Thermo-calc (TTA16

Abstract = {{Bone localization in ultrasound (US) remains challenging despite
   encouraging advances. Current methods, e. g. local image phase-based
   feature analysis, showed promising results but remain reliant on
   delicate parameter selection processes and prone to errors at
   confounding soft tissue interfaces of similar appearance to bone
   interfaces. We propose a different approach combining US strain imaging
   and envelope power detection at each radio-frequency (RF) sample. After
   initial estimation of strain and envelope power maps, we modify their
   dynamic ranges into a modified strain map (MSM) and a modified envelope
   map (MEM) that we subsequently fuse into a single combined map that we
   show corresponds robustly to actual bone boundaries. Our quantitative
   results demonstrate a marked reduction in false positive responses at
   soft tissue interfaces and an increase in bone delineation accuracy.
   Comparisons to the state-of-the-art on a finite-element-modelling (FEM)
   phantom and fiducial-based experimental phantom show an average
   improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) between actual and estimated
   bone boundaries of 32\% and 14\%, respectively. We also demonstrate an
   average reduction in false bone responses of 87\% and 56\%,
   respectively. Finally, we qualitatively validate on clinical in vivo
   data of the human radius and ulna bones, and demonstrate similar
   improvements to those observed on phantoms.}},

Abstract = {{The Pico Lantern is proposed as a new tool for guidance in laparoscopic
   surgery. Its miniaturized design allows it to be picked up by a
   laparoscopic tool during surgery and tracked directly by the endoscope.
   By using laser projection, different patterns and annotations can be
   projected onto the tissue surface. The first explored application is
   surface reconstruction. The absolute error for surface reconstruction
   using stereo endoscopy and untracked Pico Lantern for a plane, cylinder
   and ex vivo kidney is 2.0 mm, 3.0 mm and 5.6 mm respectively. The
   absolute error using a mono endoscope and a tracked Pico Lantern for the
   same plane, cylinder and kidney is 0.8mm, 0.3mm and 1.5mm respectively.
   The results show the benefit of the wider baseline produced by tracking
   the Pico Lantern. Pulsatile motion of a human carotid artery is also
   detected in vivo. Future work will be done on the integration into
   standard and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a system for detecting dominant prostate
   tumors, based on a combination of features extracted from a novel
   multi-parametric quantitative ultrasound elastography technique. The
   performance of the system was validated on a data-set acquired from n =
   10 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Multi-frequency
   steady-state mechanical excitations were applied to each patient's
   prostate through the perineum and prostate tissue displacements were
   captured by a transrectal ultrasound system. 3D volumetric data
   including absolute value of tissue elasticity, strain and
   frequency-response were computed for each patient. Based on the
   combination of all extracted features, a random forest classification
   algorithm was used to separate cancerous regions from normal tissue, and
   to compute a measure of cancer probability. Registered whole mount
   histopathology images of the excised prostate gland were used as a
   ground truth of cancer distribution for classifier training. An area
   under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 +/- 0.01 was
   achieved in a leave-one-patient-out cross validation. Our results show
   the potential of multi-parametric quantitative elastography for prostate
   cancer detection for the first time in a clinical setting, and justify
   further studies to establish whether the approach can have clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{The current research studies investigate the synthesis and sintering of
   magnesia-rich chromium-free complex spinels and their solid solutions,
   prepared at much lower temperatures (1350-1550 degrees C) than the Cr3+
   bearing versions, which usually require firing at 1720-1800 degrees C,
   in order to achieve equivalent properties. The aim of this work was to
   understand the effects of sintering temperature on structural changes
   for spinel-bonded chromium-free basic refractories. The synthesis and
   sintering at low temperatures is due to the formation of distorted
   spinel phases at temperatures below 1350 degrees C which, as a result,
   could activate the cationic diffusion, leading to enhanced synthesis and
   sintering rates. The volume expansion due to spinel formation, which
   usually retards densification, is also overcome by the volume shrinkage
   due to sintering, in the range of temperatures where they take place
   simultaneously. In the current work, the calculated lattice parameters
   from theoretical considerations are correlated to the experimental
   lattice parameters through whole pattern fit (WPF) Rietveld analyses of
   the X-ray diffraction patterns of experimental samples fired at various
   temperatures. The changes in lattice parameters with firing temperature
   were correlated to the level of inversion and magnesia dissolution in
   the complex spinel phase.}},

   objective of this study was to reduce the synthesis and sintering
   temperature of MC by using spinel forming additives (called
   ``spinelalizers{''}) and stabilizing chromium in +3 oxidation state
   through incorporating it into a solid solution. A series of sintering
   studies were performed to elucidate the effect of solid solution
   formation on the sinterability of MC. The experimental compositions
   contained MC and trivalent oxides (Al2O3 and Fe2O3). The results showed
   a reduced synthesis temperature of MC in the presence of the

   densification of MC during the early stages of solid state sintering at

Abstract = {{This study presents the experimental results of processing and sintering
   of chromium-free spinel bonded basic castables through the use of
   ultra-fine particles and spinel forming oxides that can create
   metastable phases leading to the formation of a complex spinel solid
   solution. The metastable phases formed during the low temperature
   reactions lead to an activated synthesis of the complex spinel. The
   subsequent reaction of the formed spinel matrix bonding to the basic
   aggregates was achieved, which resulted in lower temperatures of
   synthesis and sintering of the spinel phases. The binder system based on
   in-situ spinel forming technology allows the matrix of the castables to
   sinter at 5\% open porosity, when fired below 1500 degrees C. The
   effects of commercial dispersants on the flow and setting behavior of
   the castables were studied. The effect of the aggregate hydration on
   green properties of the castables was also studied in order to
   understand the impact of brucite formation on the flow and working time
   of the castables and their subsequent fired properties. Castables using
   our novel chromium-free spinel bonding system, fired at as low as 1450
   degrees C, have been scaled up to industrial size and tested in an
   industrial nonferrous Bottom Blown Oxygen Furnace (BBOC). They showed
   similar properties and behavior in use to the industrial rebonded fused
   grain (RFG) grade of magnesia-chrome basic bricks, which are considered
   at this time the best for non-ferrous applications.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonics biosensors continue to be an area of active research,
   showing the potential to revolutionize Lab-on-Chip applications ranging
   from environmental monitoring to medical diagnostics. As near-infrared
   light propagates through nano-scale silicon wires on an SOI chip, a
   portion of the light resides outside the waveguide and interacts with
   biomolecules and the biological matrix on the waveguide's surface. This
   capability makes silicon photonics an ideal platform for label-free
   biosensing. Additionally, the SOI platform is compatible with standard
   CMOS fabrication processes, facilitating manufacturing at the economies
   of scale offered by today's foundries. In this paper, we describe our
   efforts to improve the performance of SOI-based biosensors-specifically,
   TE and TM mode microring resonators, thin waveguide resonators,
   sub-wavelength grating resonators, as well as strip and slot Bragg
   gratings. We compare device performance in terms of sensitivity,
   intrinsic limit of detection, and their potential for biosensing
   applications in Lab-on-Chip systems.}},

Abstract = {{Urban communities rely heavily on the system of interconnected critical
   infrastructures. The interdependencies in these complex systems give
   rise to vulnerabilities that must be considered in disaster mitigation
   planning. Only then will it be possible to address and mitigate major
   critical infrastructure disruptions in a timely manner.
   This paper describes an intelligent decision making system that
   optimizes the allocation of resources following an infrastructure
   disruption. The novelty of the approach arises from the application of
   Monte Carlo estimation for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning
   to draw on experiential knowledge gained from a massive number of
   simulations. This method enables a learning agent to explore and exploit
   the available trajectories, which lead to an optimum goal in a
   reasonable amount of time. The specific goal of the case study described
   in this paper is to maximize the number of patients discharged from two
   hospitals in the aftermath of an infrastructure disruption by
   intelligently utilizing the available resources. The results demonstrate
   that a learning agent, through interactions with an environment of
   simulated catastrophic scenarios, is capable of making informed
   decisions in a timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the wide range and long history of ultrasound guided needle
   insertions, an unresolved issue in many cases is clear needle
   visibility. A well-known ad hoc technique to detect the needle is to
   move the stylet and look for changes in the needle appearance. We
   present a new method to automatically locate a moving stylet/catheter
   within a stationary cannula using motion detection. We then use this
   information to detect the needle trajectory and the tip. The differences
   between the current frame and the previous frame are detected and
   localized, to minimize the influence of tissue global motions. A
   polynomial fit based on the detected needle axis determines the
   estimated stylet shaft trajectory, and the extent of the differences
   along the needle axis represents the tip. Over a few periodic movements
   of the stylet including its full insertion into the cannula to the tip,
   a combination of polynomial fits determines the needle trajectory and
   the last detected point represents the needle tip. Experiments are
   conducted in water bath and bovine muscle tissue for several
   stylet/catheter materials. Results show that a plastic stylet has the
   best needle shaft and tip localization accuracy in the water bath with
   RMSE = 0.16 mm and RMSE = 0.51 mm, respectively. In the bovine tissue,
   the needle tip was best localized with the plastic catheter with RMSE =
   0.33 mm. The stylet tip localization was most accurate with the steel
   stylet, with RMSE = 2.81 mm and the shaft was best localized with the
   plastic catheter, with RMSE = 0.32 mm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a registration pipeline to compensate for
   prostate motion and deformation during targeted freehand prostate
   biopsies. We perform 2D-3D registration by reconstructing a thin-volume
   around the real-time 2D ultrasound imaging plane. Constrained Sum of
   Squared Differences (SSD) and gradient descent optimization are used to
   rigidly align the moving volume to the fixed thin-volume. Subsequently,
   B-spline deformable registration is performed to compensate for
   remaining non-linear deformations. SSD and zero-bounded Limited memory
   Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon (LBFGS) optimizer are used to find the
   optimum B-spline parameters. Registration results are validated on five
   prostate biopsy patients. Initial experiments suggest
   thinvolume-to-volume registration to be more effective than
   slice-to-volume registration. Also, a minimum consistent 2 mm
   improvement of Target Registration Error (TRE) is achieved following the
   deformable registration.}},

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy as one of the treatment methods for prostate cancer takes
   place by implantation of radioactive seeds inside the gland. The
   standard of care for this treatment procedure is to acquire transrectal
   ultrasound images of the prostate which are segmented in order to plan
   the appropriate seed placement. The segmentation process is usually
   performed either manually or semi-automatically and is associated with
   subjective errors because the prostate visibility is limited in
   ultrasound images. The current segmentation process also limits the
   possibility of intra-operative delineation of the prostate to perform
   real-time dosimetry. In this paper, we propose a computationally
   inexpensive and fully automatic segmentation approach that takes
   advantage of previously segmented images to form a joint space of images
   and their segmentations. We utilize joint Independent Component Analysis
   method to generate a model which is further employed to produce a
   probability map of the target segmentation. We evaluate this approach on
   the transrectal ultrasound volume images of 60 patients using a
   leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The results are compared with
   the manually segmented prostate contours that were used by clinicians to
   plan brachytherapy procedures. We show that the proposed approach is
   fast with comparable accuracy and precision to those found in previous
   studies on TRUS segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Labeling and segmentation of the spinal column from CT images is a
   pre-processing step for a range of imageguided interventions.
   State-of-the art techniques have focused either on image feature
   extraction or template matching for labeling of the vertebrae followed
   by segmentation of each vertebra. Recently, statistical multiobject
   models have been introduced to extract common statistical
   characteristics among several anatomies. In particular, we have created
   models for segmentation of the lumbar spine which are robust, accurate,
   and computationally tractable. In this paper, we reconstruct a
   statistical multi-vertebrae pose+shape model and utilize it in a novel
   framework for labeling and segmentation of the vertebra in a CT image.
   We validate our technique in terms of accuracy of the labeling and
   segmentation of CT images acquired from 56 subjects. The method
   correctly labels all vertebrae in 70\% of patients and is only one level
   off for the remaining 30\%. The mean distance error achieved for the
   segmentation is 2.1 +/- 0.7 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of vertebral structures in magnetic resonance (MR) images
   is challenging because of poor contrast between bone surfaces and
   surrounding soft tissue. This paper describes a semi-automatic method
   for segmenting vertebral bodies in multi-slice MR images. In order to
   achieve a fast and reliable segmentation, the method takes advantage of
   the correlation between shape and pose of different vertebrae in the
   same patient by using a statistical multi-vertebrae anatomical
   shape+pose model. Given a set of MR images of the spine, we initially
   reduce the intensity inhomogeneity in the images by using an
   intensity-correction algorithm. Then a 3D anisotropic diffusion filter
   smooths the images. Afterwards, we extract edges from a relatively small
   region of the pre-processed image with a simple user interaction.
   Subsequently, an iterative Expectation Maximization technique is used to
   register the statistical multi-vertebrae anatomical model to the
   extracted edge points in order to achieve a fast and reliable
   segmentation for lumbar vertebral bodies. We evaluate our method in
   terms of speed and accuracy by applying it to volumetric MR images of
   the spine acquired from nine patients. Quantitative and visual results
   demonstrate that the method is promising for segmentation of vertebral
   bodies in volumetric MR images.}},

Abstract = {{The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) is a highly
   utilized open source medical imaging library providing chiefly the
   functionality to register, segment, and filter medical images. Although
   extremely powerful, ITK has a steep learning curve for users with little
   or no background in programming. It was for this reason that SimITK was
   developed. SimITK wraps ITK into the model driven engineering
   environment Simulink, a part of the Matlab development suite. The first
   released version of SimITK was a proof of concept, and demonstrated that
   ITK could be wrapped successfully in Simulink. In this paper a new
   version of SimITK is presented where ITK classes are wrapped using a
   fully automated process. In addition, SimITK is transitioned to
   successfully support ITK version 4, in order to remain current with the
   ITK project. SimITK includes thirty-seven image filters, twelve
   optimizers, and nineteen transform classes from ITK version 4 which are
   successfully wrapped and tested, and can be quickly and easily combined
   to perform medical imaging tasks. These classes were chosen to represent
   a broad range of usability, and to allow for greater flexibility when
   creating registration pipelines. SimITK has the potential to reduce the
   learning curve for ITK and allow the user to focus on developing
   workflows and algorithms. A release of SimITK along with tutorials and
   videos is available at www.simitkvtk.com.}},

Abstract = {{MRI and Computed Tomography (CT) are used in image-based solutions for
   guiding High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer.
   MRI is costly and CT exposes the patients to ionizing radiation.
   Ultrasound, on the other hand, is affordable and safe. The long-term
   goal of our work is to enable the use of multiparametric ultrasound
   imaging in image-guided HDR for cervical cancer. In this paper, we
   report the development of enabling technology for ultrasound guidance
   and tissue typing. We report a system to obtain the 3D freehand
   transabdominal ultrasound RF signals and B-mode images of the uterus,
   and a method for registration of ultrasound to MRI. MRI and 3D
   ultrasound images of the female pelvis were registered by contouring the
   uterus in the two modalities, creating a surface model, followed by
   rigid and B-spline deformable registration. The resulting transformation
   was used to map the location of the tumor from the T2-weighted MRI to
   ultrasound images and to determine cancerous and normal areas in
   ultrasound. B-mode images show a contrast for cancer vs. normal tissue.
   Our study shows the potential and the challenges of ultrasound imaging
   in guiding cervical cancer treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in brain morphology and white matter lesions are two hallmarks
   of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology, but their variability beyond
   volumetrics is poorly characterized. To further our understanding of
   complex MS pathology, we aim to build a statistical model of brain
   images that can automatically discover spatial patterns of variability
   in brain morphology and lesion distribution. We propose building such a
   model using a deep belief network (DBN), a layered network whose
   parameters can be learned from training images. In contrast to other
   manifold learning algorithms, the DBN approach does not require a
   prebuilt proximity graph, which is particularly advantageous for
   modeling lesions, because their sparse and random nature makes defining
   a suitable distance measure between lesion images challenging. Our model
   consists of a morphology DBN, a lesion DBN, and a joint DBN that models
   concurring morphological and lesion patterns. Our results show that this
   model can automatically discover the classic patterns of MS pathology,
   as well as more subtle ones, and that the parameters computed have
   strong relationships to MS clinical scores.}},

   processing and display. The receiver is designed and laid out in a
   0.35-mu m CMOS process. Post-layout simulations show that each receiver

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the automated analysis of pedestrians' conformance
   behavior and data collection in an intersection with a perceived high
   rate of traffic conflicts involving pedestrians. The intersection is
   located in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
   Despite implementation of countermeasures such as reducing the speed
   limit, safety issues linger at the intersection. The intersection is
   characterized by a high pedestrian volume and considerable crossing
   violations by pedestrians, which elevate the safety risk and disrupt
   vehicle traffic flow. A challenge in performing pedestrian road safety
   analysis is the shortfall of reliable data. Recent advances in automated
   detection of pedestrians through the use of computer vision expanded the
   range of applications in traffic safety. In this study, an automated
   system for identifying pedestrian crossing nonconformance to traffic
   regulations by using pattern matching was developed and tested. The
   results show satisfactory accuracy in detecting both spatial and
   temporal violations, with the detection rate for violations being more
   than 84\% correct. The automated collection of pedestrian data on
   crossing speed and counts is also demonstrated with high accuracy. The
   availability of these data is important for diagnosing the safety issues
   at the intersection and for justifying capital for implementing
   pedestrian safety countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{Models of the spatial distribution of the scatterers that surrounds a
   transmission path, i.e., spatial channel models, play a crucial role in
   predicting the performance of multiple-input multiple-output wireless
   communication systems. Most conventional approaches to characterizing
   spatial channels based on measured channel response data require either
   mechanically steerable directional antennas or multiple antenna systems
   at both the transmitter and receiver to resolve the directions of
   arrival and departure. Here, we show that when either the receiving or
   transmitting platform is moving with a constant velocity, as in the case
   of high speed rail, the channel measurement system can be simplified
   considerably by exploiting the manner in which the signal associated
   with a multipath component located at a given angle with respect to the
   direction of travel is Doppler shifted. Further, the accuracy and
   resolution of the spatial channel model that is so obtained can be
   improved greatly by collecting the entire range-Doppler history of the
   returns from a given scatterer and focusing them into a single point
   using techniques adopted from bistatic synthetic aperture radar signal
   processing. Fourier methods commonly used to process SAR data are not
   appropriate here due to the proximity of the scatterers to the
   transmission path. The back projection technique, however, is entirely
   suitable albeit at the expense of greater computational overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Channel sounding is generally conducted under the assumption that the
   wireless channel is free from interfering signals, i.e., in clear
   channels. As regulators begin to deploy new services in spectrum that is
   already occupied by other services, channel sounding must often be
   conducted in occupied channels with all the obvious attendant
   difficulties. Here, we propose alternative sense-decide-act strategies
   based upon cognitive radio principles that can mitigate interference
   when a conventional vector network analyzer is used to collect
   swept-frequency measurements of static channels. We show that a
   three-step process involving: 1) the use of sensing to reduce the
   probability that the channel sounder will interfere with a transmission
   that is underway, 2) robust estimation to eliminate outliers due to
   measurements corrupted by transmissions that began while the measurement
   was underway, and 3) estimation of the number of samples required to
   yield estimates of the channel response that fall within an acceptable
   confidence interval. Implementation of the scheme using an Agilent
   E8362C PNA vector network analyzer augmented by an external sensing
   receiver and control software yields pristine channel measurements even
   in the presence of significant interference.}},

Abstract = {{To measure fabric permeability over the body at air velocities
   encountered in running, a series of air pressure measurements were
   conducted on a mannequin torso in a wind tunnel. Pressure measurements
   were made at wind speeds of 3.3 m/sec, 5.3 m/sec and 10.0 m/sec from 15
   pressure taps that ringed the circumference of the mannequin torso. The
   pressure measurements were then repeated at the two higher velocities
   when the pressure taps were covered in one of five fabrics commonly used
   for sports apparel. Each of the fabrics are considered highly permeable,
   based on an air permeability rating provided by the fabric manufacturer.
   The goals of the pressure measurements were: (1) to quantify the ability
   for air to be transmitted through a garment to an athlete's skin when
   the athlete is running; and (2) to compare the pressure tap measurements
   with the manufacturers' air permeability ratings. The pressure
   measurements indicated that the only areas of the torso that encounter
   measurable airflow at wind velocities up to 10 m/sec are the flanks, a
   phenomenon also observed during dye-injection flow visualization studies
   conducted on a torso model in a water flume. Covering portions of the
   torso that receive very little airflow with any fabric further subdued
   the incoming airflow and the reduction in airflow was not consistently
   correlated with the fabric air permeability rating. The results of this
   study suggest that fabric air permeability ratings are of limited
   utility in the selection of permeable materials for running apparel
   because of the low air pressures encountered by the torso at running
   velocities. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Open access under CC

Abstract = {{A novel diagnostic tool and methods to characterize the catalyst

   outlet segment increased to 4\%, 14\%, and 21\%, respectively from that
   of the inlet. Pt dissolution rate increased by 50\% at the outlet
   compared to the inlet segment reducing the durability of the cell. The
   EPSA-kinetic loss relationships suggested higher degradation in a
   segmented cell compared to those of a non-segmented cell. During the
   AST, the variations in the local operating parameters of each segment
   (e. g., relative humidity, temperature and pressure) are used to explain

Abstract = {{Rotational hardening (RH) is a constitutive feature of anisotropic clay
   plasticity models that allows the rotation of the yield and plastic
   potential surfaces in stress space for a more realistic simulation of
   the material response under various loading conditions. The introduction
   of a RH rule must address the following attributes: (i) it must yield a
   unique critical state line in the e-p space (ii) it must prevent
   excessive and unrealistic rotation of the yield and plastic potential
   surfaces (iii) it is desirable to provide simple analytical description
   of the response to loading at constant stress and strain-rate ratios,
   including K-o consolidation. These attributes will be examined in
   regards to several known RH rules and a novel proposition. Special
   attention is given to the calibration of the RH rules parameters based
   on attribute (iii), particularly in association with the K-o value.
   Simulations of experimental data under undrained loading will illustrate
   the simulative capabilities of the RH rules considered, and the
   necessity to consider a non-associative flow rule. Finally the dilemma
   of zero or non-zero anisotropic fabric at Critical State expressed by
   the RH adopted will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity is often an integral part of composite materials such as
   rocks and concrete and may present in different forms including
   porosity, weak grain boundaries and microcracks. Microcracks are often
   present in crystalline rocks in two forms: natural and stress-induced;
   the amount of stress-induced microcracking increasing with depth and
   magnitude of tectonic stresses. In this study, the finite-discrete
   element method(FDEM) code ELFEN is used to model
   microcrack-heterogeneity by introducing sets of microcrack using the
   discrete fracture network (DFN) approach into the simulated intact
   medium. The applicability of this method in rock mechanics is then
   evaluated through a series of numerical simulations of uniaxial/biaxial
   compressive laboratory tests. The results of the FDEM-mu DFN models
   indicate that micro-heterogeneity has a profound influence on both the
   mechanical behaviour and resulting fracture pattern. An increase in the
   microcrack population leads to a reduction in the strength of the
   laboratory specimen and changes the character of the strength envelope.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-port converters (MPCs) have been identified as a cost-effective
   approach for energy harvesting and dispatching in hybrid power systems.
   Compared with relatively complex set-up of single-input single-output
   converters linked at a common dc bus to exchange power, the MPCs possess
   promising features of fewer components, higher power density and
   centralized control. This paper proposes a transformerless MPC that
   transfers power between different sources and loads with a minimal
   number of conversion steps. The steady-state analysis and dynamic
   modeling of the proposed MPC are introduced in detail. The output
   voltage regulation and power flow control can be achieved simultaneously
   by a multivariable control. Detailed switch simulation and average model
   are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MPC.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic response of photovoltaic (PV) power converters plays a
   critical role to perform fast Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Among
   different options, linear controllers are a very popular choice to
   control power converters due to their design simplicity and basic
   implementation. However, the simplicity of the controller comes with a
   sacrifice in the speed and performance given the extremely large
   operating range in PV applications (V-OC to I-SC). For example, in the
   boost topology, the Right-Half-Plane Zero induces overshoot and the
   severe inability to handle extreme operating points.
   In this paper, a non-linear controller based on phase-plane analysis is
   implemented for a boost converter for PV-battery charging applications.
   The novel proposed controller provides a number of advantages,
   including: 1) Faster transient response, close to the physical limit; 2)
   Overshoot elimination; 3) Minimization and tight handling of
   disturbances caused by changes in environmental conditions. The
   combination of these benefits translates into faster MPPT algorithms and
   a minimization of the losses during the MPPT scan process. A comparative
   analysis is presented to demonstrate the characteristic features of the
   controller, showing significant improvements over the traditional
   dual-loop linear controller tuned by an optimal method.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, soot has been modeled as fractal-like aggregates of nearly
   equiaxed spherules. Cluster-cluster aggregation simulations, starting
   from a population of primary particles, give rise to structures that
   closely match real aerosols of solid particles produced in flames. In
   such simulations, primary particle size is un-correlated with aggregate
   size, as all aggregates contain primary particles drawn from the same
   population. Aerosol measurements have been interpreted with this
   geometric model. Examination of transmission electron micrographs of
   soot samples from various sources shows that primary particle sizes are
   not well mixed within an aerosol population. Larger aggregates tend to
   contain larger primary particles and the variation in size is much
   larger between aggregates than within aggregates. The soot sources
   considered here are all substantially not well-mixed (aircraft jet
   engine, inverted diffusion flame, gasoline direct injection engine,
   heavy-duty compression ignition engine). The observed variations in
   primary particle size can be explained if soot aggregates are formed and
   grew by coagulation in small zones of the combustion chamber, prior to
   dilution and transport (with minimal coagulation) to the sampling
   system.}},

   Evaluations}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2434}},
Pages = {{103-112}},
Abstract = {{A traffic conflict is usually composed of a chain of events in which at
   least one of the involved road users performs some sort of evasive
   action to avoid a collision. An evasive action usually involves powerful
   braking, which leads to sudden, negative change in acceleration
   (deceleration). The temporal dynamics (variation over time) of the
   acceleration of a vehicle is represented by the jerk profile. More
   formally, jerk is the derivative of the acceleration. In the case of an
   evasive action by braking, the jerk profile is characterized by strong,
   negative values. This study examined two issues in the quest to
   understand the benefits of evasive action analysis. The first issue was
   whether jerk profiles can be used to identify critical traffic events
   (conflicts). The second issue addressed the validity of the assumption
   that the deceleration profile is inadequate as a stand-alone measure for
   conflict identification. Automated video analysis was used to collect
   traffic data and analysis was applied on two data sets with distinct
   traffic patterns. The study revealed a significant difference between
   the jerk behavior of the groups of drivers involved in conflictive and
   normal traffic interactions. It also showed instances in which automated
   jerk evaluation was successful in finding conflicts undetected by
   conventional conflict indicators. The same could not be demonstrated for
   the road users' deceleration behavior. These findings support earlier
   studies on the shortcomings of the use of deceleration data for conflict
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{Although modern cars are equipped with advanced technologies to be
   faster, more comfortable and safer, one essential piece of the driving
   system, the driver, is missing in the picture. Among the physiological
   measures used for wellness purposes, heart rate variability has been
   shown to be directly associated with mental and physical status, and is
   easy to measure. In this paper, to maintain the driver's comfort and
   enhance the driving safety, we propose a non-contact, video-based
   approach to continuously monitor the driver's heart rate variability
   under real-world driving circumstances. Previously, several methods were
   proposed for similar goals under laboratory conditions, where simple
   face detectors and independent component analysis approach were used,
   and they may fail in both image understanding and signal processing
   steps under real-world circumstances in driving. Here we propose using
   advanced facial landmark and pose estimation, and independent vector
   analysis to extract heart rate variability. Our preliminary experimental
   results demonstrated that the proposed approach works better than the
   previous state-of-arts.}},

Abstract = {{A model was developed to describe the microstructure evolution during

   recrystallization and austenite formation are adopted from a previous

   development for the decomposition of intercritical austenite. The
   overall microstructure evolution model is validated using simulated
   industrial thermal paths for intercritical annealing. Model validation
   is expedited by in-situ measurements of the recrystallization completion
   temperature using laser ultrasonics and the intercritical austenite
   formation and decomposition using dilatometry.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents numerical simulations of a minimally constrained
   mechanical valve model using a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction
   method with COMSOL Multiphysics, a fmite-element-based software package.
   The model applies a physiological pulsatile pressure gradient across an
   aortic valve with an approximately symmetric aortic root. The complex
   hinge from the exact model is simplified with a pin joint and weak
   constraints to control the designated valve leaflet positions. The
   arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method is applied in order to accommodate
   large mesh displacements due to leaflet motion. Constant material
   properties are applied to both the fluid and structure with the
   assumption that the flow is Newtonian and turbulent. The valve leaflet
   positions and flow patterns are verified against the results from
   literature. Hemodynamic performance in terms of flow velocity and shear
   stress is investigated. The maximum von Mises stress for each valve
   leaflet is calculated. Moreover, a simulation on a defective mechanical
   valve is conducted and hemodynamic and structural analyses are
   performed. It is found that vortices were generated with higher blood
   velocity passing through the unconstrained leaflet, which may lead to
   diagnostic confusion.}},

Title = {{The effect of Reynolds number on mixing in Kelvin-Helmholtz billows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{759}},
Abstract = {{Mixing induced through the life-cycle of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) billows
   is studied for a range of low and intermediate Reynolds numbers using
   direct numerical simulations (DNS). The amount of stirring, and
   therefore mixing, is significantly controlled by the process of vortex
   pairing of two KH billows. For low Reynolds numbers, vortex pairing of
   the billows is complete in the pre-turbulent stage or early stages of
   turbulence, generating a high amount of stirring. At higher Reynolds
   numbers, vortex pairing is suppressed by the growth of three-dimensional
   instabilities, and the amount of stirring is significantly reduced. For
   single KH billows, as the Reynolds number increases, there is a
   transition in the characteristics of the mixing, similar to the
   laboratory measurements of Breidenthal (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 109, 1981,
   pp. 1-24) and Koochesfahani \& Dimotakis (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 170,
   1986, pp. 83-112). The transition in mixing is associated with the
   growth and sustainability of three-dimensional motions at sufficiently
   high Reynolds numbers. We examine this `mixing transition' and the
   influence of vortex pairing on it by examining the flow properties at
   different stages and the exchange between the energy partitions. As the
   Reynolds number increases, three-dimensional motions develop over a
   wider range of length scales, and smaller scale eddies form. However,
   this does not necessarily result in a greater amount of mixing. The
   maximum total amount of mixing induced over the lifetime of a KH
   instability, for billows both with and without vortex pairing, occurs
   when the large-scale eddies that cause the stirring are the most
   energetic. The mixing efficiency reveals a non-monotonic dependence on
   the Reynolds number.}},

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole-based actuators are of interest due to their
   biocompatibility, low operation voltage and relatively high strain and
   force. Modeling and simulation are very important to predict the
   behaviour of each actuator. To develop an accurate model, we need to
   know the electro-chemo-mechanical specifications of the Polypyrrole. In
   this paper, the non-linear time-variant model of Polypyrrole film is
   derived and proposed using a combination of an RC transmission line
   model and a state space representation. The model incorporates the
   potential dependent ionic conductivity. A function of ionic conductivity
   of Polypyrrole vs. local charge is proposed and implemented in the
   non-linear model. Matching of the measured and simulated electrical
   response suggests that ionic conductivity of Polypyrrole decreases
   significantly at negative potential vs. silver/silver chloride and leads
   to reduced current in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. The next stage
   is to relate the distributed charging of the polymer to actuation via
   the strain to charge ratio. Further work is also needed to identify
   ionic and electronic conductivities as well as capacitance as a function
   of oxidation state so that a fully predictive model can be created.}},

Abstract = {{The forest products sector in developing countries has been losing its
   competitiveness due to the fast rate of change in technologies and
   globalization. Partnership with other companies within and outside the
   sector could help as a strategy to remain competitive. However,
   partnership is costly and has a high failure rate. Therefore, partner
   selection and partnership evaluation are important. This article
   summarizes the success factors in partnerships based on the literature
   and reviews the previous studies on partnership in the forest industry.
   Previous studies in the forest products sector have identified the
   potential opportunities and attributes of partnerships in different
   business functions, such as in marketing, procurement, and
   transportation. Nonetheless, the objectives of entering into
   partnerships and the factors contributing to successful partnerships in
   the forest products industry have not been investigated yet. Moreover,
   to our knowledge, no study has focused on the selection of partners and

Abstract = {{A new class of all-digital encoders for radio frequency switch-mode
   power amplifiers (SMPA) is introduced. The introduction of new signaling
   is motivated by practical limitations in SMPAs which restrict bandwidth.
   Harmonic frequency components or dither are synthesized at baseband and
   then up-converted to create a RF carrier. The resultant spectrum is band
   limited and the out-of-band spectrum is concentrated near the carrier
   frequency. The time domain waveform has quasi-constant envelope signal
   properties and power amplifier efficiency remains high as the signals do
   not create significant back-off in the PA. Because the architecture
   employs up-conversion, this significantly reduces the high frequency
   clock requirements that are typically required for other pulse encoding
   methods such as delta-sigma modulation. Two all-digital encoders and
   experimental results with WCDMA and LTE carriers at 990 MHz are shown to
   demonstrate the concepts. Results are also shown to evaluate efficiency
   enhancement assuming out-of-band energy is recycled in the SMPA.}},

Title = {{Macro-Scale Direct Shear Test Device for Assessing Soil-Solid Interface
   Friction Under Low Effective Normal Stresses}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The paper describes a new macro-scale direct shear test device for
   assessing the large-displacement soil/solid interface drained shear
   strength at low effective normal stresses. The testing method arises
   from a need to obtain the interface friction between soils and pipelines
   under low effective normal stress levels, which is an important
   consideration in the design of pipelines laid on the sea bed. The test
   device is fundamentally similar to the conventional small-scale direct
   shear box device except for its large footprint that provides a plan
   interface shear area of 3m(2) (1.72m by 1.75 m). The device is designed
   to impart displacement-controlled interface-shearing at displacement
   rates ranging from 0.0001 mm/s to 1 mm/s and with the ability to reach a
   maximum interface shear displacement of 1.2 m. The desired normal stress
   at the soil/solid interface is obtained using surcharge loads externally
   applied by means of bulk sand or water masses, or both in certain cases.
   The device is instrumented with transducers mounted flush with the top
   of the solid surface for the measurement of pore-water pressure at the
   shear interface. As a result, the device allows for accurate
   determination of the effective normal stress at the soil/solid interface
   during interface shear testing. The key features of this device are
   described, and the device capabilities are demonstrated using tests
   conducted on Fraser-River-sand/mild-steel,
   plastic-silt/epoxy-coated-mild-steel,
   non-plastic-silt/epoxy-coated-mild-steel, and
   kaolinite/epoxy-coated-mild-steel interfaces at effective normal
   stresses between 3 and 7 kPa. The results can be also used as benchmarks
   to justify possible modifications of the currently available small-scale
   apparatus to reliably measure interface shear strength at such low
   effective normal stresses.}},

Abstract = {{In-line mixers, combined with chemical injectors, are commonly used in
   pulp bleaching processes to pre-distribute chemicals in pulp suspensions
   ahead of tower reactors to achieve efficient lignin removal. This work
   investigated uniformity of liquid/gas in pulp suspensions downstream of
   an in-line mechanical mixer for 0.5 - 3.0\% wt. softwood and hardwood
   kraft pulp suspensions over a wide range of operating conditions.
   Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) was used to quantify mixing based
   on two novel mixing indices. For liquid mixing, jet penetration,
   mainstream velocity and impeller rotation speed were key parameters. Jet
   penetration to the axis of the pipe provided optimum mixing. Although
   mixing improved substantially with increasing mainstream velocity,
   increasing impeller speed at high mainstream velocity did not improve
   mixing significantly. Sufficient residence time in the high-shear zone
   around the impeller was required to improve mixing with increasing
   impeller speed. Gas mixing depended greatly on gas volume fraction,
   impeller speed and buoyancy. Optimum mixing was obtained at high
   superficial liquid/pulp velocity and at low gas volume fraction to
   prevent formation of a gas cavity around the impeller.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation on the influence of transit service attributes on mode
   switching toward local transit for home-based commuting trips involved
   the design, implementation, and analysis of a Commuting Survey for Mode

   to build the stated preference mode switching experiments. The collected
   data set was used for estimating econometric choice models of mode
   switching toward transit. Separate models were estimated for car drivers
   and shared ride users. The empirical models showed that travel cost and
   in-vehicle travel time were of lower importance compared with other
   transit level-of-service attributes such as crowding level and number of
   transfers. That commuters prefer rail-based transit modes (e.g., subway
   and light rail transit) to other transit options (e.g., bus rapid
   transit) was evident. The developed models can enrich the transit
   service planning toolbox for delivering more efficient and attractive
   services that maximize transit ridership along with other objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Si-Ge interdiffusion and strain relaxation were studied in a metastable

   strain analysis, it was shown that during thermal anneals, both Si-Ge
   interdiffusion and strain relaxation occurred. Furthermore, the time
   evolutions of both strain relaxation and interdiffusion were
   characterized. It showed that during the ramp-up stage of thermal
   anneals at higher temperatures (800 degrees C and 840 degrees C), the
   degree of relaxation, R, reached a ``plateau{''}, while interdiffusion
   was negligible. With the approximation that the R value is constant
   after the ramp-up stage, a quantitative interdiffusivity model was built
   to account for both the effect of strain relaxation and the impact of
   the relaxation induced dislocations, which gave good agreement with the

Abstract = {{Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were used as a model system of human
   pancreas development to study characteristics of the polyhormonal cells
   that arise during fetal pancreas development. HESCs were differentiated
   into fetal-like pancreatic cells in vitro using a 33-day, 7-stage
   protocol. Cultures were similar to 90-95\% PDX1-positive by day (d) 11
   and 70-75\% NKX6.1-positive by d17. Polyhormonal cells were scattered at
   d17, but developed into islet-like clusters that expressed key
   transcription factors by d33. Human C-peptide and glucagon secretion
   were first detected at d17 and increased thereafter in parallel with INS
   and GCG transcript levels. HESC-derived cells were responsive to KCl and
   arginine, but not glucose in perifusion studies. Compared to adult human
   islets, hESC-derived cells expressed similar to 10-fold higher levels of
   glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, but similar levels of glucokinase
   (GCK). In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of GLUT1 transcript
   within endocrine cells. However, GLUT1 proteinwas excluded from this
   population andwas instead observed predominantly in non-endocrine cells,
   whereas GCK was co-expressed in insulin-positive cells. In rubidium
   efflux assays, hESC-derived cells displayed mild potassium channel
   activity, but no responsiveness to glucose, metabolic inhibitors or
   glibenclamide. Western blotting experiments revealed that the higher
   molecular weight SUR1 band was absent in hESC-derived cells, suggesting
   a lack of functional K-ATP channels at the cell surface. In addition,
   KATP channel subunit transcript levels were not at a 1: 1 ratio, as
   would be expected (SUR1 levels were similar to 5-fold lower than
   KIR6.2). Various ratios of SUR1: KIR6.2 plasmids were transfected into
   COSM6 cells and rubidium efflux was found to be particularly sensitive
   to a reduction in SUR1. These data suggest that an impaired ratio of
   SUR1: KIR6.2 may contribute to the observed KATP channel defects in
   hESC-derived islet endocrine cells, and along with lack of GLUT1, may
   explain the absence of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The growing number of electronic devices inside vehicles has motivated
   research and development activities in Vehicular Power Line
   Communication (VPLC) systems. Advantages of the VPLC approach include
   reduced complexity and cost of the wiring harness. Among the design
   challenges of VPLC systems is the problem of impedance matching. The
   access impedance at the modem port is a time varying quantity which also
   depends on the location of the VPLC modem. Impedance mismatch degrades
   the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus the signal integrity. Given the
   variable nature of the access impedance, a fixed matching circuit will
   be inefficient. A potential solution to cope with the access impedance
   variability is an adaptive impedance matching system which is the
   subject of this work. Here we have designed an adaptive impedance
   matching system. The system is simulated and its performance is
   evaluated under extreme changes in access impedance.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of deteriorating pipes on water quality (WQ) in the
   distribution network has not been consistently taken into account in
   decision making related to pipe renewals. In this paper, a detailed
   modeling approach based on fuzzy cognitive maps is developed using fuzzy
   rule-based models and fuzzy measures theory to investigate potential of
   WQ (physical, chemical, and biological) failure in distribution
   networks. Based on information and data obtained from preliminary
   analysis, literature, and expert opinion, a decision support tool named
   Q-WARP (water quality - water main renewal planner) is developed to
   consider uncertain, subjective/linguistic and/or incomplete data. Q-WARP
   provides a plausible way to represent and comprehend ill-defined and
   complex relationships such as those that govern WQ in the distribution
   network. The proposed model has the capacity to perform the `baseline
   analysis' that performs risk assessment and risk evaluation; and the
   `decision analysis' that performs risk management and guides decision
   making. The developed model has also been applied to a case study in
   Stanley Street (Philadelphia) to evaluate the model's capability. The
   results manifested that the model can efficiently assess the `potential'
   for WQ failures and can also be used in decision making for WQ
   improvements by making infrastructure changes in distribution systems.}},

Title = {{Sight Distance Standards Based on Observational Data Risk Evaluation of
   Passing}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2404}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents an application of a reliability analysis for
   evaluating the risk associated with passing sight distance (PSD)
   standards in terms of the expected probability of noncompliance.
   Calculation of PSD is required to determine where drivers can safely
   execute passing maneuvers. Traditional PSD standards are based on
   deterministic, theoretical models, which are calibrated with
   conservative percentile values for uncertain design inputs to account
   for uncertainty. The PSD standards do not provide information about the
   risk of deviation from them. Reliability analysis is a technique that is
   based on limit state design and that accounts for the propagation of
   variability from input random parameters to the design outputs. A total
   of 1,098 passing maneuvers were observed on several two-lane highways in
   Spain; two data collection methodologies were used: external
   observations and an instrumented vehicle. The most significant factors
   affecting PSD were impeding-vehicle speed, passing-vehicle acceleration,
   and head-ways between impeding and passing vehicles. A uniform
   acceleration model described the passing-vehicle trajectory. The
   characterized input parameters and the passing model were used to
   perform a reliability analysis. The results showed the probability of
   noncompliance in different scenarios, defined as the proportion of cases
   in which the required PSD would exceed the available sight distance.
   American and Spanish PSD standards were evaluated. Geometric design
   standards presented a probability of noncompliance of about 0.15,
   whereas some marking standards had a probability of noncompliance
   exceeding 0.85. These standards may be associated with higher risk
   levels if they are followed by drivers. As well, PSD risk levels were
   not consistent for different design speeds, since they underestimated
   operating speed at some locations.}},

Abstract = {{To produce ultrasound images of tissue elasticity, the
   vibro-elastography technique involves applying a steady-state
   multi-frequency vibration to tissue, estimating displacements from
   ultrasound echo data, and using the estimated displacements in an
   inverse elasticity problem with the shear modulus spatial distribution
   as the unknown. The governing equation used requires all three
   displacement components to fully solve the inverse problem. However,
   using ultrasound, only the axial component of the displacement can be
   measured accurately. Therefore, simplifying assumptions must be used.
   Usually, the equations of motion are transformed into a Helmholtz
   equation by assuming tissue incompressibility and local homogeneity. In
   this paper, we remove the local homogeneity assumption which causes
   significant imaging artifacts in areas of varying elasticity. We
   introduce a new finite element based direct inversion technique in which
   only the coupling terms in the equation of motion are ignored, so it can
   be used with only one component of the displacement. The use of
   multi-frequency excitation also allows us to obtain multiple
   measurements and reduce artifacts in areas where the displacement of one
   frequency is close to zero. The proposed method was tested in
   simulations and experiments against a conventional approach in which the
   local homogeneity is used. The results show significant improvements in
   elasticity imaging with the new method.}},

   synthesize a series of amorphous mixed-metal oxide films. The series,

   results indicate that the as-deposited films are amorphous and can be

   the films indicates the photochemically driven process drives complete
   loss of the organic constituents from the film. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy confirmed the loss of the organic ligand and enabled
   estimation of metal oxidation states. Electrochemical characterization
   revealed significant variation in catalytic performance toward the
   oxygen evolving reaction (OER) upon variation of metal oxide
   composition. Analysis of the Tafel behavior was used to distinguish

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of the impedance characteristics of a laminar flow-based

   different fuel concentrations and voltages is modeled using equivalent
   circuits. A t-test is performed on the values of the elements of the

   concentrations. As a result, intervals for the voltage, current and fuel
   concentration are identified in which the changes in the impedance
   characteristics of the cell cannot be distinguished statistically. These
   intervals, referred to as indifference intervals, show that the

Abstract = {{In this article, seismic vulnerability assessment is carried-out on a
   novel hybrid structure (steel moment resisting frame (SMRF) and cross
   laminated timber (CLT) infill panels). For the seismicity of Vancouver,
   Canada, a three-bay, 3-, 6-, and 9-story height SMRFs are designed for
   two ductility levels (ductile and limited ductility). To study the
   seismic vulnerability CLT infilled building, parametric analysis was
   performed by varying infill configuration (bare frame, one-bay infilled,
   two-bay infilled, and fully infilled). The structure is modeled in
   OpenSees and nonlinear dynamic analysis is performed. Peak inter-story
   drift demand and corresponding FEMA performance limits (capacity) values
   are used to compute the corresponding fragility curves. From the
   analyses, it can be seen that as more bays are infilled, the fundamental
   period and seismic vulnerability is reduced significantly. The results
   highlight that, within the performance-based earthquake engineering,
   different objectives can be met with varying the CLT configuration.}},

Abstract = {{All over the world water mains are under increasing threat due to aging,
   aggressive environmental factors, operational factors and inadequate
   maintenance. Extensive maintenance, repair and rehabilitation practices,
   or replacement of water mains are required to ensure an acceptable
   performance of water supply systems. Investment deficit for water system
   maintenance and rehabilitation has been estimated in billions. Small to
   medium sized water utilities are generally impacted more because of
   limited financial resources and lack of technical expertise. However,
   water mains integrity is of primary interest due to potential adverse
   consequences related to public health, safety, and heavy financial
   liabilities in case of a failure. This paper presents a user-friendly
   decision support tool to help managers of these water utilities to
   prioritize maintenance, repair, and replacement (M/R/R) strategies for
   water mains. This paper proposes a risk index approach which aggregates
   the water mains vulnerability and associated failure consequences. The
   developed tool can help decision-makers to rank the water mains and help
   to prioritize M/R/R strategies. The results have been integrated with a
   geographic information system that will allow a decision-maker to
   visualize the vulnerable zones within the network. The City of Kelowna
   water network is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate a temporal-domain intensity-based
   photoacoustic imaging method that can differentiate between fatty and
   non-fatty tissues. PA pressure intensity is partly dependent on the
   tissue's speed of sound, which increases as temperature increases in
   non-fatty tissue and decreases in fatty tissue. Therefore, by
   introducing a temperature change in the tissue and subsequently
   monitoring the change of the PA intensity, it is possible to distinguish
   between the two types of tissue. A commercial ultrasound system with a
   128-element 5-14 MHz linear array transducer and a tunable ND:YAG laser
   were used to produce PA images. Ex-vivo bovine fat and porcine liver
   tissues were pr-ecooled to below 10 degrees C and then warmed to
   room-temperature over similar to 1 hour period. A thermocouple monitored
   the temperature rise while PA images were acquired at 0.5 degrees C
   intervals. The averaged intensity of the illuminated tissue region at
   each temperature interval was plotted and linearly fitted. Liver samples
   showed a mean increase of 2.82 \%/degrees C, whereas bovine fat had a
   mean decrease of 6.24 \%/degrees C. These results demonstrate that this
   method has the potential to perform tissue differentiation in the
   temporal-domain.}},

   bar is actively damped, and the dynamic stiffness of the system was
   increased significantly, resulting in chatter-free higher depth of cuts.

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been significant interest to develop a model
   of the wrist joint that can capture the statistics of shape and pose
   variations in a patient population. Such a model could have several
   clinical applications such as bone segmentation, kinematic analysis and
   prosthesis development. In this paper, we present a novel statistical
   model of the wrist joint based on the analysis of shape and pose
   variations of carpal bones across a group of subjects. The carpal bones
   are jointly aligned using a group-wise Gaussian Mixture Model
   registration technique, where principal component analysis is used to
   determine the mean shape and the main modes of its variations. The pose
   statistics are determined by using principal geodesics analysis, where
   statistics of similarity transformations between individual subjects and
   the mean shape are computed in a linear tangent space. We also
   demonstrate an application of the model for segmentation of wrist CT
   images.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of the prostate in medical imaging is a challenging and
   important task for surgical planning and delivery of prostate cancer
   treatment. Automatic prostate segmentation can improve speed,
   reproducibility and consistency of the process. In this work, we propose
   a method for automatic segmentation of the prostate in magnetic
   resonance elastography (MRE) images. The method utilizes the
   complementary property of the elastogram and the corresponding
   T2-weighted image, which are obtained from the phase and magnitude
   components of the imaging signal, respectively. It follows a variational
   approach to propagate an active contour model based on the combination
   of region statistics in the elastogram and the edge map of the
   T2-weighted image. The method is fast and does not require prior shape
   information. The proposed algorithm is tested on 35 clinical image pairs
   from five MRE data sets, and is evaluated in comparison with manual
   contouring. The mean absolute distance between the automatic and manual
   contours is 1.8mm, with a maximum distance of 5.6mm. The relative area
   error is 7.6\%, and the duration of the segmentation process is 2s per
   slice.}},

Abstract = {{Broad adoption of silicon photonics technology for photonic integrated
   circuits requires standardized design flows that are similar to what is
   available for analog and mixed signal electrical circuit design. We have
   developed a design flow that combines mature electronic design
   automation (EDA) software with optical simulation software.
   An essential component of any design flow, whether electrical or
   photonic, is the ability to accurately simulate large-scale circuits.
   This is particularly important when the behavior of the circuit is not
   trivially related to the individual component performance. While this is
   clearly the case for electronic circuits consisting of hundreds to
   billions of transistors, it is already becoming important in photonic
   circuits such as WDM transmitters, where signal cross talk needs to be
   considered, as well as optical cross-connect switches. In addition,
   optical routing to connect different components requires the
   introduction of additional waveguide sections, waveguide bends, and
   waveguide crossings, which affect the overall circuit performance.
   Manufacturing variability can also have dramatic circuit-level
   consequences that need to be simulated. Circuit simulations must rely on
   compact models that can accurately represent the behavior of each
   component, and the compact model parameters must be extracted from
   physical level simulation and experimental results.
   We show how large scale circuits can be simulated in both the time and
   frequency domains, including the effects of bidirectional and, where
   appropriate, multimode and multichannel photonic waveguides. We also
   show how active, passive and nonlinear individual components such as
   grating couplers, waveguides, splitters, filters, electro-optical
   modulators and detectors can be simulated using a combination of
   electrical and optical algorithms, and good agreement with experimental
   results can be obtained. We then show how parameters, with inclusion of
   fabrication process variations, can be extracted for use in the circuit
   level simulations. Ultimately, we show how a multi-channel WDM
   transceiver can be created, from schematic design to tapeout, using key
   features of EDA design flows such as schematic driven layout, design
   rule checking and layout versus schematic.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss recent progress and challenges in realizing Bragg-grating
   devices on the submicron silicon-on-insulator platform for
   next-generation optical communications applications, such as on-chip
   optical interconnects and signal processing. In particular, we focus on
   grating-assisted, wavelength-selective couplers, known as
   contra-directional couplers (contra-DCs). In contrast to conventional
   two-port Bragg gratings operating in the reflection mode, contra-DCs are
   four-port devices with very weak backreflections and, therefore, can be
   easily integrated with other photonic components on a chip. In order to
   provide a reliable on-chip wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
   solution for high-speed optical interconnects, we have developed
   high-performance add-drop filters and, furthermore, wavelength
   multiplexers/demultiplexers with combined advantages of flat-top
   responses, low insertion loss (< 1 dB), and low crosstalk (< -23 dB).
   These WDM devices are ultra-compact and highly tolerant to temperature
   fluctuations (up to +/- 50 degrees C), showing great potential for
   large-scale integration and low-power consumption. We further discuss a
   novel four-port Bragg photonic resonator for high-speed, low-power
   optical switching. Using a coupler-chirped design with uniform Bragg
   gratings, we have recently achieved an on-chip, continuously tunable
   photonic delay line with low insertion loss. These system-orientated
   devices indicate great potential for large-scale integration of
   Bragg-grating-defined functions using CMOS-compatible silicon photonics
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly dynamic contrast enhanced
   (DCE) imaging, has shown great potential in prostate cancer diagnosis
   and prognosis. The time course of the DCE images provides measures of
   the contrast agent uptake kinetics. Also, using pharmacokinetic
   modelling, one can extract parameters from the DCE-MR images that
   characterize the tumor vascularization and can be used to detect cancer.
   A requirement for calculating the pharmacokinetic DCE parameters is
   estimating the Arterial Input Function (AIF). One needs an accurate
   segmentation of the cross section of the external femoral artery to
   obtain the AIF. In this work we report a semi-automatic method for
   segmentation of the cross section of the femoral artery, using circular
   Hough transform, in the sequence of DCE images. We also report a
   machine-learning framework to combine pharmacokinetic parameters with
   the model-free contrast agent uptake kinetic parameters extracted from
   the DCE time course into a nine-dimensional feature vector. This
   combination of features is used with random forest and with support
   vector machine classification for cancer detection. The MR data is
   obtained from patients prior to radical prostatectomy. After the
   surgery, wholemount histopathology analysis is performed and registered
   to the DCE-MR images as the diagnostic reference. We show that the use
   of a combination of pharmacokinetic parameters and the model-free
   empirical parameters extracted from the time course of DCE results in
   improved cancer detection compared to the use of each group of features
   separately. We also validate the proposed method for calculation of AIF
   based on comparison with the manual method.}},

Title = {{Removal of Muscle Artifacts from Single-Channel EEG Based on Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition and Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with muscle
   artifacts. This disturbing muscular activity strongly affects the visual
   analysis of EEG and impairs the results of EEG signal processing such as
   brain connectivity analysis. If multichannel EEG recordings are
   available, then there exist a considerable range of methods which can
   remove or to some extent suppress the distorting effect of such
   artifacts. Yet to our knowledge, there is no existing means to remove
   muscle artifacts from single-channel EEG recordings. Moreover,
   considering the recently increasing need for biomedical signal
   processing in ambulatory situations, it is crucially important to
   develop single-channel techniques. In this work, we propose a simple,
   yet effective method to achieve the muscle artifact removal from
   single-channel EEG, by combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   (EEMD) with multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA). We
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through numerical
   simulations and application to real EEG recordings contaminated with
   muscle artifacts. The proposed method can successfully remove muscle
   artifacts without altering the recorded underlying EEG activity. It is a
   promising tool for real-world biomedical signal processing applications.}},

Abstract = {{In infrastructure management, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) has
   emerged as a decision support tool to integrate various technical
   information and stakeholder values. Different MCDM techniques and tools
   have been developed. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the
   application of MCDM literature in the field of infrastructure
   management. Approximately 300 published papers were identified that
   report MCDM applications in the field of infrastructure management
   during 1980-2012. The reviewed papers are classified into application to
   the type of infrastructure (e.g. bridges and pipes), and prevalent
   decision or intervention (e.g. repair and rehabilitate). In addition,
   the papers were also classified according to MCDM methods used in the
   analysis. The paper provides taxonomy of those articles and identifies
   trends and new developments in MCDM methods. The results suggest that
   there is a significant growth in MCDM applications in infrastructure
   management applications of MCDM over the last decade. It has also been
   noted that many decision support tools based on multiple MCDM methods
   have been successfully used for infrastructure management.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-36}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{We examine how haptic feedback could enable an implicit human-computer
   interaction, in the context of an audio stream listening use case where
   a device monitors a user's electrodermal activity for orienting
   responses to external interruptions. When such a response is detected,
   our previously developed system automatically places a bookmark in the
   audio stream for later resumption of listening. Here, we investigate two
   uses of haptic feedback to support this implicit interaction and
   mitigate effects of noisy (false-positive) bookmarking: (a)
   low-attention notification when a bookmark is placed, and (b)
   focused-attention display of bookmarks during resumptive navigation.
   Results show that haptic notification of bookmark placement, when paired
   with visual display of bookmark location, significant improves
   navigation time. Solely visual or haptic display of bookmarks elicited
   equivalent navigation time; however, only the inclusion of haptic
   display significantly increased accuracy. Participants preferred haptic
   notification over no notification at interruption time, and combined
   haptic and visual display of bookmarks to support navigation to their
   interrupted location at resumption time. Our contributions include an
   approach to handling noisy data in implicit HCI, an implementation of
   haptic notifications that signal implicit system behavior, and
   discussion of user mental models that may be active in this context.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results in the literature show that there are two flow
   areas of material during the friction stir welding (FSW) process {[}1];
   namely the ``pin-driven flow{''} and the ``shoulder-driven flow{''}.
   These areas should completely join together to create a weld with no
   defect. First, in order to numerically predict the local distribution of
   flow stress around the pin as well as the temperature, strain, and
   strain rate fields during FSW, a two-dimensional steady-state Eulerian
   multiphysics finite element model has been employed in this work for
   aluminum alloy 606 lusing the COMSOL software. In this model, the
   non-Newtonian flow mode of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) module,
   general heat transfer mode of the heat transfer module, and the plain
   stress mode of the structural mechanics module of the software have been
   coupled. Slip/stick condition between the tool and workpiece, frictional
   and deformation heat sources, the convectional heat transfer in the
   workpiece, the solid mechanics-based viscosity definition, the
   temperature-dependent physical properties and the Zener-Hollomon- based
   thermo-visco-plastic mechanical properties with a cut-off temperature of
   582 degrees C were considered. Next, the thermal history during the
   process predicted by the model was used as input for an
   elasto-visco-plastic analysis to estimate the local residual stresses
   distribution due to the workpiece thermal expansion effect. Finally, the
   predicted longitudinal and transverse residual stresses were verified by
   comparing to experimental data.}},

   frequency-doubled pulses at 790 nm with average power of 75 mW and pulse
   width of 130 fs are applied as the excitation source. The fiber laser is
   optimized for its parameters along with the dispersive properties of the
   delivery fiber such that the MPM signal is maximized at the sample
   location. Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) scanner, miniature
   objective, and multimode fiber are further used to make the MPM system
   compact. MPM images are obtained from unstained biological samples. The
   MPM system with a compact, portable, low-cost fiber laser has a great
   potential to transform the bench-top MPM system to a portable system for

Abstract = {{A confocal multiphoton microscopy system with various detection pinholes
   was used to differentiate backward scattered second harmonic generation
   (BS-SHG) from backward generated SHG (BG-SHG) based on the fact that
   BS-SHG is more scattered and therefore has a much bigger spot size than
   BG-SHG. BS-SHG is quantified from two types of mouse tissues, such as
   Achilles tendon, and skin, and at various focal depths. It is found that
   the BS-SHG contributes less to the total backward SHG for the skin than
   Achilles tendon with thicknesses of around three hundred micrometers.
   For tissue with larger F/B intensity ratio such as Achilles tendon,
   increasing the tissue thickness reduces it tremendously. However, for
   tissue with smaller F/B intensity ratio, tissue thickness increment does
   not alter it significantly. In addition, larger F/B intensity ratio
   might be related with a greater scattering coefficient from our Achilles
   tendon and skin comparison. When the focal point is moved deeper into
   tissue, the contribution of BS-SHG is found to decrease due to a reduced
   pass length of the forward propagated photons. On the contrary, when the
   tissue thickness increases, the contribution of the BS-SHG is increased.
   These observations for thicker skin tissues are related with our F/B
   intensity ratio measurement for thin mouse skin sample in terms of that
   the magnitude of backward generated SHG are dominant among the total
   backward SHG in mouse skin tissue. Considering the phase mismatching
   condition in the forward and backward directions, these results may
   indicate that quasi-phase matching originating from the regular
   structure of collagen could help with reducing the phase mismatch
   especially in the backward direction.}},

Abstract = {{This work is aimed at investigating the energy conversion effectiveness
   and the economical advantages of a total integrated solution for
   on-field biodiesel and electrical energy production. The system proposed
   here is based on the synergy of four sub-systems: a seed press for oil
   production, a downdraft gasifier, a biodiesel conversion plant and a
   Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). Two possible culture rotations, suggested
   by literature review, were analyzed here from economical and energy
   balance points of view. Both the rotations were composed of oleaginous
   crops only, therefore the seeds collected from the different cultures
   were pressed, then the protein cake produced in the process was gasified
   in the downdraft reactor. The gasification process was modeled here, and
   its output suggested that, for a precise number of hectares, the syngas
   obtained through the cake gasification was enough for producing methanol
   required for oil-biodiesel conversion and feeding a 10-kW SOFC. The
   purge line in the methanol reactor was used in the SOFC as well. The
   system was simulated using ASPEN PEUS (TM) and MATEAB (TM) codes.
   Results of the SOFC and gasifier models underlined the capability of the
   fuel cell to work with this particular system, furthermore the whole
   system analysis suggested that the surface required for sustainability
   of the processes is a function of the rotation choice. In both cases
   little surfaces ranging from 11 to 21 hectares were found to be enough
   for system self-sustainability with a ROT under 7 years in all the
   operating conditions analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) environments can offer immersion, interaction and
   realistic images to users. A VR system is usually expensive and requires
   special equipment in a complex setup. One approach is to use
   Commodity-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) desktop multi-projectors manually or
   camera based calibrated to reduce the cost of VR systems without
   significant decrease of the visual experience. Additionally, for
   non-planar screen shapes, special optics such as lenses and mirrors are
   required thus increasing costs. We propose a low-cost, scalable,
   flexible and mobile solution that allows building complex VR systems
   that projects images onto a variety of arbitrary surfaces such as
   planar, cylindrical and spherical surfaces. This approach combines three
   key aspects: 1) clusters of DLP-pico-projectors to provide homogeneous
   and continuous pixel density upon arbitrary surfaces without additional
   optics; 2) LED lighting technology for energy efficiency and light
   control; 3) smaller physical footprint for flexibility purposes.
   Therefore, the proposed system is scalable in terms of pixel density,
   energy and physical space. To achieve these goals, we developed a
   multi-projector software library called FastFusion that calibrates all
   projectors in a uniform image that is presented to viewers. FastFusion
   uses a camera to automatically calibrate geometric and photometric
   correction of projected images from ad-hoc positioned projectors, the
   only requirement is some few pixels overlapping amongst them. We present
   results with eight Pico-projectors, with 7 lumens (LED) and DLP 0.17
   HVGA Chipset.}},

Abstract = {{Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) plays an important role in the metabolism of
   hydrogen peroxide in higher plants. In the present study, a novel APX
   gene (JctAPX) was cloned from Jatropha curcas L. The deduced amino acid
   sequence was similar to that of APX of some other plant species. JctAPX
   has a chloroplast transit peptide and was localized to the chloroplasts
   by analysis with a JctAPX-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion
   protein. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed
   that JctAPX was constitutively expressed in different tissues from J.
   curcas and was upregulated by NaCl stress. To characterize its function
   in salt tolerance, the construct p35S: JctAPX was created and
   successfully introduced into tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation. Compared with wild type (WT), the transgenic plants
   exhibited no morphological abnormalities in the no-stress condition.
   However, under 200 mM NaCl treatment, JctAPX over-expressing plants
   showed increased tolerance to salt during seedling establishment and
   growth. In addition, the transgenic lines showed higher chlorophyll
   content and APX activity, which resulted in lower H2O2 content than WT
   when subjected to 400 mM NaCl stress. These results suggest that the
   increased APX activity in the chloroplasts from transformed plants
   increased salt tolerance by enhancing reactive oxygen species
   (ROS)-scavenging capacity under short-term NaCl stress conditions.}},

Pages = {{929-949}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a seismically deficient three-column reinforced concrete
   bridge bent has been considered which was designed in the pre-1965.
   Several retrofitting provisions, namely carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics
   jacketing, steel jacketing, concrete jacketing, and engineered
   cementitious composites jacketing, have been considered in this study to
   enhance the seismic resistance and the performance of a gravity
   load-designed bridge bent under seismic forces. Performance evaluation
   and optimal selection of retrofit techniques have multi-level and
   multi-factor features and, therefore, are regarded as multiple criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) problem. MCDM methods are decision-support
   procedures, which are used when there are multiple decision-makers
   involved in the evaluation and comparison of a set of alternatives
   involving different evaluation criteria. This paper shows the
   application of such methodological framework for a performance-based
   seismic retrofit selection of a multi-column bridge bent. Here,
   different seismic retrofit strategies, reflecting common as well as
   innovative approaches, are adopted, and their seismic performances are
   compared by using the technique for order preference by similarity to
   ideal solution MCDM algorithm. Through rigorous analyses, a
   decision-making tool has been developed to identify the most effective
   retrofitting scheme considering its seismic performance alone.}},

Title = {{First-principles study of borohydride adsorption properties on osmium
   nanoparticles and surfaces: understanding the effects of facets, size
   and local sites}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We present the first density functional theory investigation on the
   adsorption properties of borohydride on Os surfaces and nanoparticles
   with respect to the effects of facets, size and local sites. We found
   that the adsorption configuration and the binding energy significantly
   changed with respect to these factors. On Os surfaces, the most stable
   adsorbate configuration is molecular on (0001) but dissociated on (10
   (1) over bar0) and (1 (1) over bar0). For the Os nanoparticles, the
   preferred configurations on the Os surface are preserved only on the
   counterpart (0001) and (10 (1) over bar0) planes and the binding
   energies are significantly larger due to the presence of vertices/edges.
   The difference in the structures between the (1 (1) over bar 00) facet
   of the slab and of the nanoparticle is attributed to very different Os
   lateral distances. With respect to the nanoparticle size, the adsorbate
   structure is also preserved but the binding energy increases when the
   particle size is increased. At various electrode potentials, borohydride
   oxidative adsorption is less favorable on the similar to 2.0 nm Os
   nanoparticles as compared to the Os surface of the same facet due to
   enhanced solvation at the vertex sites of the former. Finally, using ab
   initio molecular dynamics, we found that these less coordinated sites of
   the Os nanoparticles reconstruct significantly with temperature,
   especially the smaller sized ones. Only when the nanoparticle size is
   similar to 2.0 nm do these reconstructions become minimal. These
   findings present fundamental borohydride adsorption information on
   nanoparticles and surface facets relevant for modeling/screening of
   suitable nanostructures of anode catalysts for direct borohydride fuel
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{The use of wireless body sensor networks is gaining popularity in
   monitoring and communicating information about a person's health. In
   such applications, the amount of data transmitted by the sensor node
   should be minimized. This is because the energy available in these
   battery powered sensors is limited. In this paper, we study the wireless
   transmission of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We propose the use
   of a compressed sensing (CS) framework to efficiently compress these
   signals at the sensor node. Our framework exploits both the temporal
   correlation within EEG signals and the spatial correlations amongst the
   EEG channels. We show that our framework is up to eight times more
   energy efficient than the typical wavelet compression method in terms of
   compression and encoding computations and wireless transmission. We also
   show that for a fixed compression ratio, our method achieves a better
   reconstruction quality than the CS-based state-of-the art method. We
   finally demonstrate that our method is robust to measurement noise and
   to packet loss and that it is applicable to a wide range of EEG signal

Abstract = {{We report the fabrication of functional nanoelectronic sensors on

   increase in conductance is demonstrated when the sensors are exposed to
   30 s long 1220 mu W cm(-2) ultra-violet (UV) irradiation pulses in the
   dark with a 6 s and 3 s rise and recovery times, respectively. Moreover,
   a 200\% increase in current is also observed at room temperature, when
   these sensors are exposed to successive pulses of pure CO. The sensors
   exhibit a fast response to variations in concentration of CO as small as
   a 1\% volume change. The sensitivity to CO concentration can be
   significantly improved by using UV irradiation. This work shows that

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-29}},
Abstract = {{The main problem in the flotation of Cu-Mo sulfide ores in seawater is
   poor floatability of molybdenite at pH>9.5. Froth stability plays a very
   important role in determining concentrate grade and recovery in
   flotation operations and in this paper both floatability and
   frothability have been tested. The frothability have been studied by
   measuring froth equilibrium layer thickness in a modified laboratory
   flotation cell. Two chemical aspects of seawater need to be considered:
   the content of NaCl (around 87\% of salinity), and the concentration of
   secondary ions (around 13\%) (sulfate, magnesium, calcium, bicarbonate
   ions, etc.). Seawater, NaCl solutions, and seawater's ions were found to
   depress frothability. The effect of pH on frothability over the pH range
   from 9.5 to 11, which is very strong in freshwater, becomes negligible
   in seawater and the tested electrolyte solutions. The analysis of the
   relationship between the mechanisms of molybdenite depression and the
   loss of frothability in seawater implies that the effects of the studied
   ions on molybdenite floatability and on pulp frothability are different.
   While depression of molybdenite floatability could be tracked down to
   magnesium hydroxide precipitation as a main culprit, the depression of
   frothability is a much more complicated issue.}},

Abstract = {{Amenability of mafic ores to pre-concentration was investigated with
   respect to ore mineralization characteristics. For the pre-concentration
   tests seven ores from various nickel-copper operations at Sudbury,
   Ontario were subjected to dense medium separation. Size assays of metal
   values, i.e. distribution of nickel and copper with respect to size
   fractions, were also determined. The ores were assessed in three
   categories of valuable mineralization as massive pure sulphides, coarse
   massive sulphide grains and disseminated sulphides. For ores with
   massive pure sulphides and coarse massive sulphide grains even a size
   classification based pre-concentration route could be sought since a
   clear trend of metal enrichment was identified towards finer fractions.
   Orebodies of similar mineralogy had similar responses to
   pre-concentration tests. The best results were for those ore bodies with
   a distinct differentiation between mineralization and gangue, i.e. the
   ores with massive pure sulphides, where nickel recoveries of 97\% and
   mass rejections of 38-53\% were achieved. Similar results were obtained
   for ores with coarse massive sulphides. For disseminated sulphide
   mineralogy relatively lower mass rejection was attained with acceptable
   recoveries of metals. Rejection of magnesium bearing gangue, such as
   talc, was identified as another benefit of pre-concentration. The extent
   of magnesium rejection occurred as a function of ore mineralogy. Clear
   distinction between valuable mineralization and gangue provided
   preferential magnesium rejection at high levels with no or minor metal
   losses.}},

Abstract = {{New imaging technologies are changing the field of digital pathology.
   This field faces numerous challenges and there is a pressing need for
   standardization, calibration protocols, quality control and quantitative
   assessment. We have designed a new calibration imaging slide (Cancer
   Imaging Slide), specifically to measure the characteristics of old or
   new imaging systems or scanners. The layout of the slide consists of 138
   boxes with the side length of 1.6 mm, containing objects of known
   morphologic and photometric characteristics. Among them, 112 boxes
   contain different permutations of circles, ovals, and squares. The
   circles have different radii, radius/pitch ratios and step
   transmissions. The ovals have different sizes and orientations. The
   squares are consistent in size and orientation but have different step
   transmission values. Also, 16 boxes contain three resolution test
   targets: crosses, USAF target and Siemens star. The last 10 boxes are
   blank boxes with different transmission values. Four slides were scanned
   and imaged on one commercial whole-slide scanner and one high resolution
   imaging system. After segmenting the images, about 200 features
   (photometric, morphologic and architectural) were measured with our
   in-house image processing software. The objective of the project is to
   develop a statistical process control using this new slide. In this
   paper, we describe the characteristics of the slide and present our
   preliminary results.}},

   a review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{1-40}},
Abstract = {{Water supply systems (WSSs) are one of the most important and expensive
   core public infrastructures. The primary objective of a water supply
   utility is to have this valuable asset operate at its maximum possible
   efficiency with minimum cost throughout its design period. To achieve
   this objective, the first step is to evaluate the existing efficiency of
   all the components of the WSS using suitable performance indicators
   (PIs). Various agencies and organizations worldwide have developed
   detailed performance evaluation frameworks including several indicators
   to comprehensively cover all the aspects (e. g., physical asset,
   staffing, operational, customer satisfaction, economical) of the WSSs.
   Most of these frameworks and indicators have been developed for
   large-sized WSSs. Small-and medium-sized water supply systems (SM-WSSs)
   have specific performance-related issues, ranging from difficulties in
   collecting the data required to use the available systems of PIs to lack
   of skilled personnel and financial resources for efficient operations. A
   comprehensive review of the literature has been carried out to assess
   the suitability of reported performance evaluation systems for SM-WSSs
   in terms of their simplicity (easy and simple data requirements) and
   comprehensiveness (i.e., all the components of a WSS). This review also
   evaluates the individual PI with respect to its understandability,
   measurability, and comparability (i.e., within and across utility
   comparisons). On the basis of this detailed review, a conceptual
   performance evaluation system for SM-WSSs, consisting of a list of PIs
   grouped into their respective categories, has been proposed. The
   proposed system provides a stepwise approach, starting the performance
   evaluation process with the most significant and easy to measure PIs for
   small-sized WSSs and moving to a relatively complex set of indicators
   for SM-WSS depending on the availability of resources and specific
   operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of two juice-based beverage
   industrial wastes, screen cake (SC) and thickened waste activated sludge
   (TWAS), along with municipal sludge cake (MC) was investigated.
   Experiments were conducted in twenty mesophilic batch 160 ml serum
   bottles with no inhibition occurred. The statistical analysis proved
   that the substrate type had statistically significant effect on both
   ultimate biogas and methane yields (P = 0.0003 < 0.05). The maximum and
   minimum ultimate cumulative methane yields were 890.90 and 308.34
   mL/g-VSremoved from the digesters containing only TWAS and SC as
   substrate. First-order reaction model well described VS utilization in
   all digesters. The first 2-day and 10-day specific biodegradation rate
   constants were statistically higher in the digesters containing SC (P =
   0.004 < 0.05) and MC (P = 0.0005 < 0.05), respectively. The cost-benefit
   analysis showed that the capital, operating and total costs can be
   decreased by 21.5\%, 29.8\% and 27.6\%, respectively using a co-digester
   rather than two separate digesters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During the last decades, huge efforts have been made to enhance the
   efficiency as well as performance of lead-acid batteries. The
   configuration of grid wires plays an important role in minimizing the
   ohmic drop and hence, improving its current collecting ability. In the
   current study, numerical methods have been employed to investigate the
   effects of grid configuration on the performance of a positive electrode
   in lead-acid batteries. Potential and current density distributions have
   been modeled through grid wires, active material and adjacent
   electrolyte to the surface of each grid. The modeling results are
   consistent with experimental findings in the literature saying that the
   optimized diagonal design for grid configuration provides lower total
   grid weight as well as enhanced current collecting role comparing to
   other designs such as, conventional, diagonal and expanded metal. This
   confirms that numerical modeling is a fast, inexpensive and effective
   method for optimization of the battery grid configuration. Crown

Abstract = {{Droplet deformation is the first stage of all aerodynamically
   induced-breakups, considerably affecting the characteristics of the
   atomization. In the present study, using an adaptive volume of fluid
   method, two and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations have been
   performed to understand droplet deformation. A high Reynolds number and
   a range of relatively high Weber numbers are chosen, addressing the
   shear breakup of droplets in a stream. The study is focused on the
   initiation and growth of instabilities over the droplet. The role of
   Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in wave formation and
   azimuthal transverse modulation are shown and the obtained results for
   the most amplified wave-numbers are compared with instability theories
   for zero and non-zero vorticity layers. The present results for the most
   amplified wave-numbers and deformation topologies are in good agreement
   with the previous experimental results. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{SYNTHETIC METALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{145-151}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The rate of charging of supercapacitor and battery electrodes is often
   limited by the transport of ions through the active electrode material.
   One way to accelerate this transport is to increase the porosity of the
   electrode, at the cost of electrode capacity. This tradeoff is studied
   through the fabrication and characterization of porous carbon
   nanofibre/polypyrrole films used as storage electrodes. Electrospun poly
   (acrylonitrile-co-acrylamide) fibres were carbonized and then
   electrochemically coated with variable amounts of polypyrrole. The
   resulting hybrid materials were characterized using both conventional
   methods such as cyclic voltammetry, electron microscopy and
   conductivity, as well as ionic conductivity and pulsed-field-gradient
   nuclear magnetic resonance which directly probe ion transport. It is
   found that with modest porosity, these materials retain much of the
   capacitance (similar to 50\%) of bulk polypyrrole with dramatically
   increased (similar to 300 times) charge and discharge rates, suggesting
   the potential of the approach for increasing the useful frequency range
   of polypyrrole-based supercapacitors, as well as other storage materials
   whose porosity can be varied. Simple transport models based on series or
   parallel arrangements of electrolyte and active electrode are developed
   to explain the results and identify the factors limiting
   charge/discharge rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The archetypal feature of a viscoplastic fluid is its yield stress: If
   the material is not sufficiently stressed, it behaves like a solid, but
   once the yield stress is exceeded, the material flows like a fluid. Such
   behavior characterizes materials common in industries such as petroleum
   and chemical processing, cosmetics, and food processing and in
   geophysical fluid dynamics. The most common idealization of a
   viscoplastic fluid is the Bingham model, which has been widely used to
   rationalize experimental data, even though it is a crude
   oversimplification of true rheological behavior. The popularity of the
   model is in its apparent simplicity. Despite this, the sudden transition
   between solid-like behavior and flow introduces significant
   complications into the dynamics, which, as a result, has resisted much
   analysis. Over recent decades, theoretical developments, both analytical
   and computational, have provided a better understanding of the effect of
   the yield stress. Simultaneously, greater insight into the material
   behavior of real fluids has been afforded by advances in rheometry.
   These developments have primed us for a better understanding of the
   various applications in the natural and engineering sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium is known to produce solutions of complex speciation as a

   phosphine oxide (Cyanex 923) extractants. Among selected extractants,
   Cyanex 923 showed the best selectivity for vanadium (V) over iron (III)
   by extracting of VO2SO4- in the system. Moreover, D2EHPA revealed a
   suitable separation for vanadium (IV) over iron (II) by extracting VO+2.

Pages = {{59-66}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium has been produced from both primary and secondary sources
   having various compositions. One of the most available sources of
   vanadium is vanadium pentoxide. In this paper, vanadium pentoxide
   leaching was investigated using three chemistries. First, vanadium
   leaching and the solubility of pentavanadyl ion (VO2+) at different pHs
   and temperatures were investigated in the sulfuric acid system. It was
   shown that decreasing pH and temperature as well as increasing sulfate
   concentration in the solution will increase the solubility and
   extraction of vanadium. The extraction of vanadium (V) was found to be
   limited by solubility. To overcome the solubility problem of vanadium
   (V), the kinetics of vanadium leaching from vanadium pentoxide at mildly
   basic pHs and reductive leaching in the low acidic pHs were then
   investigated. The kinetics of leaching was reasonably fast in both
   cases. Moreover, the progressive-conversion model was applied to model
   reductive leaching of vanadium using sodium sulfite. The rate of the
   reaction was reported as:
   rate = k(x) {[}H-1]/(K-e + {[}H-1])(0.5){[}SO2](total)(0.57) (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Electrolytic manganese metal has been used in a wide range of
   applications such as production of steel and aluminum alloys. However,
   manganese electrowinning is technically and commercially challenging due
   to a low current efficiency and high cell voltage. Rigorous purification
   and the use of additives are required for commercial manganese
   electrowinning. Some effective additives, such as selenium compounds,
   contaminate the metal and have negative environmental impacts. This
   literature review summarizes the background information on hydrogen
   evolution on manganese, manganese electrodeposition and its polarization
   behavior, effects of impurities, and the effects of additives such as
   selenium compounds, and their mechanisms in order to provide guidelines
   for development of cleaner and more efficient manganese
   electrodeposition conditions.
   Electrolytic manganese is conventionally produced from ammonium sulfate
   media in a diaphragm cell. Hydrogen evolution on manganese in Mn-free
   electrolyte is very slow compared to manganese deposition. However, it
   is catalyzed by manganese deposition. With increasing polarization, the
   manganese deposit structure changes from gamma-Mn to alpha-Mn. Heavy
   metal impurities (e.g. Ni and Co) are co-deposited with manganese and
   catalyze the dissolution of manganese and then hydrogen evolution
   through the formation of galvanic micro-cells, resulting in a low
   manganese current efficiency. With increasing deposition time, the
   manganese deposit gradually becomes rougher and more dendritic,
   resulting in an increase in the rate of manganese dissolution. Smooth
   and compact deposition reduces the harmful effect of impurities and
   increases manganese current efficiency. Various additives (typically
   sulfite and selenite) have been used to counteract the harmful effects
   of impurities and improve manganese deposit quality. The addition of
   selenite (or selenate) and sulfite inhibits hydrogen evolution,
   increases the overpotential of manganese deposition in the low
   polarization region and decreases the overpotential of manganese
   deposition in the high polarization region, facilitates the
   crystallization of stable a-manganese, improves the leveling effects of
   the electrolyte, and finally increases the manganese current efficiency.
   The formation of insoluble selenides and sulfides with impurities
   eliminates or suppresses the generation of galvanic micro-cells and then
   contributes to an increase in the current efficiency of manganese
   deposition. Alternative additives should inhibit hydrogen evolution
   significantly, but manganese deposition to an appropriate degree,
   promote the formation of a-Mn, function as a leveling agent, have a
   minimum contamination of the manganese deposit and reducing capacity to
   stabilize the electrolyte. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Generalized Correlation-Based Model for Out-of-Plane Motion Estimation
   in Freehand Ultrasound}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A big challenge in sensorless image-based ultrasound tracking is in the
   out-of-plane motion estimation. The correlation value of a specific
   model of speckle known as fully developed speckle (FDS) can be used to
   estimate the out-of-plane displacement. In real tissue, this kind of
   pattern is rare and the deviation of speckle pattern from the ideal FDS
   model diminishes the accuracy of the out-of-plane motion estimation. In
   this paper a new method for estimation of the out-of-plane motion is
   proposed. Firstly a closed-form mathematical derivation is provided for
   the correlation of two RF echo signal patches at different positions. A
   linear regression model of the ultrasound beam profile is proposed to
   account for the spatial variability of the ultrasound beam and enhance
   the accuracy of out-of-plane motion estimation in real tissue. The
   statistical model of speckle used here is based on the Rician-Inverse
   Gaussian (RiIG) stochastic process of the speckle formation, which can
   be considered as a generalized form of the K-distribution with richer
   parametrization. In this work, for the first time the second-order
   statistics of the RIG model is used for speckle tracking. This
   statistical model allows for derivation of a closed-form formulation for
   the correlation coefficient based on the statistical parameters of every
   patch. Since the effect of coherency is considered in the RiIG model, it
   increases the reliability of the out-of-plane motion estimation. The
   flexibility of the proposed method enables almost any patch through the
   whole image to be used for the purpose of displacement estimation. The
   method has been evaluated both on ex vivo and in vivo tissues in various
   experiments including out-of-plane rotation (tilt, yaw) and free-hand
   imaging. The overall outcome demonstrates the potential of the proposed
   method for in vivo tissues.}},

Pages = {{62-74}},

Abstract = {{We jointly optimize the source and relay precoders for multi-antenna
   multi-relay networks employing a prefixed receiver. Prefixed receivers
   are of practical interest since they enable low complexity at the
   end-user's receiver as well as backward compatibility. To compute the
   source and relay precoders, we consider two different criteria. The
   objective of the first criterion is to maximize the worst stream
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the
   receiver subject to source and relay transmit power constraints. Under
   the second criterion, we minimize the source and relay transmit powers
   subject to a certain quality-of-service constraint. Both optimization
   problems are non-convex. To solve them, we propose iterative alternating
   algorithms, where, in each iteration, we compute the precoders
   alternately, i.e., for each precoder optimization, we fix all the
   precoders except the one which is optimized. For both criteria, we
   formulate the optimization problem for the computation of the source
   precoder as a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem, for which
   the optimal solution can be found using interior point algorithms. For
   each relay precoder, we formulate the optimization problem as a
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) problem for which ready-to-use solvers
   exist. If the solution to the SDR problem is not of rank one, matrix
   rank-one decomposition or randomization is applied. We also provide
   sufficient conditions for the convergence of the proposed iterative
   alternating algorithms to a fixed point. Simulation results show that
   the performance of the proposed algorithms is close to the performance
   achieved if the source, relay, and receiver filters are jointly
   optimized.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a direct hydrogen fuel cell is operated in the absence of

   allowed for the use of a 3-D carbon cathode structure which in
   conjunction with a liquid electrolyte was used to eliminate the membrane
   and the need for precious metals on the cathode. Non-optimized maximum
   power density up to 250 mW/cm(2) (330 mW/cm(2) iR-corrected) and a
   current density in excess of 1000 mA/cm(2) were achieved with a total Pt

   Electromagnetic Energy Harvesters for Random Vibration Environments}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The simulation results for electromagnetic energy harvesters (EMEHs)
   under broad band stationary Gaussian random excitations indicate the
   importance of both a high transformation factor and a high mechanical
   quality factor to achieve favourable mean power, mean square load
   voltage, and output spectral density. The optimum load is different for
   random vibrations and for sinusoidal vibration. Reducing the total
   damping ratio under band-limited random excitation yields a higher mean
   square load voltage. Reduced bandwidth resulting from decreased
   mechanical damping can be compensated by increasing the electrical
   damping (transformation factor) leading to a higher mean square load
   voltage and power. Nonlinear EMEHs with a Duffing spring and with linear
   plus cubic damping are modeled using the method of statistical
   linearization. These nonlinear EMEHs exhibit approximately linear
   behaviour under low levels of broadband stationary Gaussian random
   vibration; however, at higher levels of such excitation the central
   (resonant) frequency of the spectral density of the output voltage
   shifts due to the increased nonlinear stiffness and the bandwidth
   broadens slightly. Nonlinear EMEHs exhibit lower maximum output voltage
   and central frequency of the spectral density with nonlinear damping
   compared to linear damping. Stronger nonlinear damping yields broader
   bandwidths at stable resonant frequency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper constructs dynamical models and signal processing-based
   estimation algorithms for computing the concentration of target
   molecules in a fluid flow using an array of biosensors. Each biosensor
   is constructed out of protein molecules embedded in a synthetic cell

   partial differential equation, which is coupled with chemical reaction
   equations on the biosensor surface. By using asymptotic analysis and the
   divergence theorem, an approximate model is constructed that describes
   the asymptotic behavior of the concentration as a system of ordinary
   differential equations. The estimate of target molecule concentration is
   then obtained by solving a nonlinear least squares problem. Then,
   explicit expressions are obtained for the variance and bias of the
   estimate using the derived approximate model. These expressions can
   evaluate the achievable improvement in the estimate based on the number

Abstract = {{Different from the previous studies on distributed-antenna (DA) systems
   (DASs) that mostly focused on the enhancement of downlink or uplink
   performance of cellular systems through cooperation of DAs, this paper
   proposes and investigates the performance of a novel fiber-connected DA
   relay system (DARS) that employs radio-over-fiber (RoF) techniques to
   interconnect a DAS to a central processor, which collectively form a
   relay node. Under the assumption that self-interference can be perfectly
   canceled in DARS, full-duplex (FD) operation is possible, by which some
   antennas receive from the source, whereas other antennas simultaneously
   transmit to the destination. The numbers of transmit and receive
   antennas can be controlled to achieve a balance between the
   transmissions of the source-relay (SR) and relay-destination (RD) links.
   Consequently, higher spectral efficiency can be achieved compared with
   half-duplex (HD) relaying systems. For Nakagami fading channels with no
   direct source-destination (SD) link, we show that DARS can obtain the
   optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Moreover, as the primary
   purpose of FD relaying is to increase the throughput, we also analyze
   the throughput performance of DARS. Numerical results show that the
   FD-DARS with a large number of antennas exhibits a much better
   throughput performance than HD relaying systems and in regions with high
   signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Switch-and-stay combining (SSC) is a low-complexity alternative to
   selection combining (SC) in dual diversity systems. These diversity
   systems can either be the conventional colocated diversity setups, where
   two antennas are available at the receiver, or the cooperative diversity
   systems, where two relays assist one transmitter-receiver pair. In SSC,
   a single diversity branch (i.e., a single antenna or a single relay) is
   activated and remains active as long as the corresponding channel is
   sufficiently strong, regardless of the quality of the other branch.
   Thereby, the switching threshold determines both the bit error rate
   (BER) and the switching rate, which are defined as the number of times
   per second a branch switching occurs. Since high switching rates are not
   preferred in practice, in this paper, we optimize the switching
   threshold of SSC to minimize the BER under a constraint on the switching
   rate. To this end, we derive approximate closed-form solutions for the
   optimization problem for both the colocated and the distributed antenna
   case. These solutions are shown to achieve close-to-optimal performance
   through computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a quarter model of an automobile having passive and
   semiactive suspension systems to develop a scheme for an optimal
   suspension controller. Semi-active suspension is preferred over passive
   and active suspensions with regard to optimum performance within the
   constraints of weight and operational cost. A fuzzy logic controller is
   incorporated into the semi-active suspension system. It is able to
   handle nonlinearities through the use of heuristic rules. Particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) is applied to determine the optimal gain parameters
   for the fuzzy logic controller, while maintaining within the normalized
   ranges of the controller inputs and output. The performance of resulting
   optimized system is compared with different systems that use various
   control algorithms, including a conventional passive system, choice
   options of feedback signals, and damping coefficient limits. Also, the
   optimized semi-active suspension system is evaluated for its performance
   in relation to variation in payload. Furthermore, the systems are
   compared with respect to the attributes of road handling and ride
   comfort. In all the simulation studies it is found that the optimized

Abstract = {{Metabolic flux analysis with its ability to quantify cellular metabolism
   is an attractive tool for accelerating cell line selection, medium
   optimization, and other bioprocess development activities. In the
   stoichiometric flux estimation approach, unknown fluxes are determined
   using intracellular metabolite mass balance expressions and measured
   extracellular rates. The simplicity of the stoichiometric approach
   extends its application to most cell culture systems, and the steps
   involved in metabolic flux estimation by the stoichiometric method are
   presented in detail in this chapter. Specifically, overdetermined
   systems are analyzed since the extra measurements can be used to check
   for gross measurement errors and system consistency. Cell-specific rates
   comprise the input data for flux estimation, and the logistic modeling
   approach is described for robust-specific rate estimation in batch and
   fed-batch systems. A simplified network of mammalian cell metabolism is
   used to illustrate the flux estimation procedure, and the steps leading
   up the consistency index determination are presented. If gross
   measurement errors are detected, a technique for determining the source
   of gross measurement error is also described. A computer program that
   performs most of the calculation described in this chapter is presented,
   and references to flux estimation software are provided. The procedure
   presented in this chapter should enable rapid metabolic flux estimation
   in any mammalian cell bioreaction network by the stoichiometric
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Microfabrication technology provides a highly versatile platform for
   engineering hydrogels used in biomedical applications with
   high-resolution control and injectability. Herein, we present a strategy
   of microfluidics-assisted fabrication photo-cross-linkable gelatin
   microgels, coupled with providing protective silica hydrogel layer on
   the microgel surface to ultimately generate gelatin-silica core-shell
   microgels for applications as in vitro cell culture platform and
   injectable tissue constructs. A microfluidic device having flow-focusing
   channel geometry was utilized to generate droplets containing
   methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), followed by a photo-cross-linking step to
   synthesize GelMA microgels. The size of the microgels could easily be
   controlled by varying the ratio of flow rates of aqueous and oil phases.
   Then, the GelMA microgels were used as in vitro cell culture platform to
   grow cardiac side population cells on the microgel surface. The cells
   readily adhered on the microgel surface and proliferated over time while
   maintaining high viability (similar to 90\%). The cells on the microgels
   were also able to migrate to their surrounding area. In addition, the
   microgels eventually degraded over time. These results demonstrate that
   cell-seeded GelMA microgels have a great potential as injectable tissue
   constructs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that coating the cells on GelMA
   microgels with biocompatible and biodegradable silica hydrogels via
   sol-gel method provided significant protection against oxidative stress
   which is often encountered during and after injection into host tissues,
   and detrimental to the cells. Overall, the microfluidic to generate
   cell-adhesive microgel core, coupled with silica hydrogels as a
   protective shell, will be highly useful as a cell culture platform to
   generate a wide range of injectable tissue constructs.}},

   examined further using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
   Potentiodynamic polarization experiments demonstrated that the presence
   of Cl-, Cu2+, and Fe3+ facilitated the anodic passivity of titanium in
   sulfuric acid. EIS experiments showed that modest addition of Fe3+ (1.0
   g/L) increased the polarization resistance most significantly. Both

Abstract = {{Resource assignment in underwater acoustic communication (UWAC) networks
   has recently drawn much attention in the research community. Although in
   most applications the number of nodes in the UWAC network is relatively
   small, the long propagation delay of acoustic signals underwater
   motivates the application of spatial reuse in channel access protocols
   for throughput enhancement. In this paper, we address the problem of
   spatial-reuse scheduling in UWAC networks that support frequent
   transmission of broadcast packets and require robustness to inaccurate
   topology information. Taking the possibility of outdated network
   topology information into account is of great importance for UWAC
   applications due to time-varying topologies in the underwater
   environment. Our main contribution is the derivation of a broadcast
   scheduling algorithm that combines topology-transparent and
   topology-dependent spatial-reuse scheduling methodologies to achieve
   high throughput in static and dynamic topology scenarios. Simulation
   results demonstrate that our protocol provides a favorable tradeoff
   between network throughput and robustness to outdated topology
   information due to topology changes, and that it also achieves fairness
   in terms of per-node throughput.}},

Abstract = {{An optimization design simulating the electro-mechanical property of the
   conductive elastic knitted fabric is built based on a loops structure
   under biaxial extensions. A computer program can give the fabric
   equivalent resistance, which is obtained by solving the circuit network
   equations. So, it can simplify the computational process immensely. In
   order to simplify the calculation of the contacting forces on the
   overlapped yarns, two hooked yarns are used to represent the loop
   configurations. From the theoretical analysis and experimental
   investigations, it is found that the resistance changing due to the yarn
   segment transfer is the key factor for the sensitivity of elastic fabric
   sensors. This makes the resistance linear increasing with the strain
   increasing. Analysis of the experimental results show that change in the
   resistance of a fabric sensor due to the contact resistance has a minor
   contribution to the sensitivity of the sensor in the large-strain
   regime. Also, the fabric structure and the yarn elongating affect the
   characteristics of the fabric sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar, a by-product of woody biomass pyrolysis, is investigated as a
   renewable and low-cost carbon-based electrode material for electric
   double layer (EDL) applications. To increase the surface area and
   porosity of the biochar chemical (7 M KOH) and thermal (at 675 and 1,000
   A degrees C, respectively) activation treatments are applied. The
   thermo-chemically activated biochar samples are investigated by a
   combination of physico-chemical surface characterization and
   electrochemical methods to reveal the relationship between the
   activation process variables, the resulting porous carbon structural
   features and EDL capacitance. For electrochemical testing, the activated
   biochar is sprayed onto Ni mesh current collectors with or without
   Nafion(A (R)) as binder. Based on cyclic voltammetry experiments in 0.1
   M NaCl-0.1 M NaOH a maximum EDL capacitance of 167 F g(-1) is obtained
   for the activated biochar electrode prepared at 675 A degrees C. The
   latter capacitance is about 50 times higher than the EDL capacitance of
   a Vulcan XC-72 electrode prepared and tested under identical conditions.
   The activated biochar electrodes show also promising galvanostatic
   charge/discharge behavior and electrical conductivities up to 0.058 S
   cm(-1) indicating suitability for EDL-type applications.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this research is to investigate spatial variations
   of mean annual precipitation in a watershed. As a case study, the
   research focused on the Namak Lake watershed in Iran. Literature
   provides various techniques for studying spatial patterns of
   precipitation in a watershed. These techniques often require a large
   dataset. On the other hand, nonuniform data distribution in a watershed
   can reduce the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. To overcome
   these problems, this research applied the cluster method coupled with
   ordinary Kriging and Bayesian maximum entropy techniques. An estimated
   point was modified based on the distance from the point to the cluster
   center. The research considered elevation variations as a secondary
   variable. A cross-validation technique was used for evaluating the
   results of mean annual precipitations. The research compared the results
   of ordinary Kriging and Bayesian maximum entropy methods with and
   without the application of the clustering method. The research concluded
   that the cluster-based method can estimate the dynamics of long-term
   mean annual precipitation more reliably and accurately. The research
   also revealed more informative results for the cluster-based method.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum UV (VUV) process is an incipient advanced oxidation process,
   which can be used for water treatment. This process relies on the
   formation of hydroxyl radicals through the VUV-induced photolysis of
   water. In particular, the use of ozone-generating mercury vapor lamps,
   which emit 10\% of the radiation at 185nm and 90\% at 254nm, is showing
   very promising results for the degradation of micropollutants. The
   kinetics of VUV process has been studied in batch- and flow-through
   reactors, but the effect of 254 and 185nm photons cannot be isolated,
   mass transfer resistances can take place and the interpretation of the
   results is complex. In this technical note, a new VUV collimated beam to
   conduct kinetic tests is presented, which offers several advantages: (1)
   it allows the irradiation of samples with 185, 254nm photons, or both,
   (2) the concentration of reagents is uniform in the reaction volume and
   (3) it allows to change the fluence rate by changing the distance
   between the lamp and the photoreactor. Details of the geometry are
   presented, as well as an analysis of the collimation and uniformity of
   the radiation of the new VUV-collimated beam setup.}},

Abstract = {{In order to guarantee pay-TV services, data of digital television (DTV)
   programs are scrambled by conditional access systems (CAS). In practical
   applications, some DTV transmitting nodes need descramble the scrambled
   DTV programs for editing purposes. After editing, how to re-scramble
   these edited programs is a challenging task since building CAS at
   transmitting nodes is expensive and insecure. In this paper, we proposed
   a novel scheme to solve this problem. Together with the recommended
   scheme, we also proposed techniques regarding video key data selection
   and extraction, synchronization of scrambled and descrambled transport
   stream (TS) packets, and scrambled/unscrambled interleaving multiplexer.
   The proposed scheme requires much lower complexity than existing methods
   while maintaining enough security for practical applications. Neither
   professional CAS equipment nor real-time common key (CK) transmitting is
   required by our re-scrambling scheme. Various experimental results
   demonstrated that the proposed re-scrambling scheme achieved superior
   performance in practical DTV systems, and it also obtained good
   compatibility with different CAS algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics of an i-CFB (internal circulating fluidized bed) deNO(x)

   measured using an optical fibre probe at bed solid loadings of 33 kg and
   2.275 kg. Radial profiles of bed voidage and solid velocity were
   discussed in detail. A hydrodynamic model was developed based on mass
   and pressure balances. Discharging coefficient C, was extracted from
   fitting the experimental data and an average value of 0.167 was taken
   for model simulation. The model could well capture the characteristics
   of the solid flow and gas flow distribution, and could serve as a useful
   tool for the design and simulation of the i-CFB deNO(x) reactor system.

Abstract = {{The role of compressive strain on Si-Ge interdiffusion in epitaxial SiGe
   heterostructures was systematically investigated both by experiments and
   by theoretical analysis. The Ge fraction x(Ge) range (0.36-0.75) studied
   in this work extended to a wider Ge regime. With x-ray diffraction and
   Raman spectroscopy measurements, it was demonstrated that the epitaxial
   SiGe structures were kept pseudomorphic during the annealing. Complete
   theoretical analysis was presented to address the strain impact on the
   interdiffusion driving force, the interdiffusivity prefactor and the
   activation energy. The strain derivative of the interdiffusivity q', was
   shown to be temperature dependent. q' was quantitatively extracted from
   the experimental data in the Ge content range (0.36-0.75) and the
   temperature range (720-880 degrees C), and is shown to have the form of
   q' = (-0.081T + 110) eV/unit strain, where T is temperature in Kelvin.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty-Driven Characterization of Climate Change Effects on Drought
   Frequency Using Enhanced SPI}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-40}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a well-established drought
   index that is based on transforming the interannual distribution of
   precipitation to a standard normal distribution. Because of its robust
   statistical basis, SPI is readily applicable to different regions making
   comparisons between locations and time windows possible. Nevertheless,
   the usability of SPI results is undermined by shortcomings that are
   partly resultant from data and model uncertainties. One such shortcoming
   is the inability of the existing SPI model to include change in
   variability of interannual precipitation from non-stationary normal -
   mostly caused by climate change. In addition, epistemic uncertainty in
   the form of incompleteness in station-wide precipitation records results
   in heterogeneity and inconsistency in SPI results. The effects of such
   epistemic uncertainty on the accuracy of estimations of long-term
   changes in drought frequency are mostly unknown. Given such deficiency,
   SPI's procedure and subsequent results remain deterministic and
   inadequately informative. Here, we introduce modifications to the
   traditional SPI using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to enable modeling
   and propagation of variability and epistemic uncertainty with the
   regular SPI procedure. By generalizing the SPI model from a
   deterministic setting to an ``uncertainty-driven setting{''} provided by
   DST, this work makes possible: (a) efficiently propagating data
   uncertainty in interpolation of station-wide precipitation and SPI, and
   (b) modeling the effects of shift in precipitation normals (due to e.g.,
   climate change) on drought frequency. In addition, the significance of
   this shift may then be evaluated with respect to the epistemic
   uncertainty by measuring how much of the surrounding epistemic
   uncertainty this shift encloses (i.e., ``probability of enclosing{''}).
   The latter is especially important due to large unknowns already
   associated with climate change modeling. We implement the model on
   summer extreme drought for the Okanagan Basin, BC, Canada. For a single
   general circulation model and scenario (CGCM3 A2) a maximum 7 \%
   increase in summer extreme drought (for 2080s, as per current
   definition) is estimated with a maximum probability of enclosing of 36
   \%.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly cloud-based virtual networking environments are required to
   provide fine-grained Quality of Service (QoS) management without
   sacrificing scalability. However, no single approach currently can meet
   these requirements simultaneously. This paper introduces a layered
   concept that uses a common overlay mechanism to virtualize networks and
   enable fine-grained QoS management through resource slicing. Based on
   this mechanism, a fully distributed network virtualization platform
   called Distributed FlowVisor (DFVisor) is proposed. It uses a layered
   overlay to improve the network addressing space, reduce flow setup
   latency, and remove the single point of failure in the network - the
   central slice controller. Through a distributed synchronized two-level
   database, DFVisor incorporates a push-based flow setup and statistics
   collecting mechanism using a dedicated data channel to address the
   scalability issues caused by the current pull-based mechanism and the
   limited control channel bandwidth shared by both control flows and
   network statistics. The potential issues in DFVisor implementation and
   evaluation are discussed for future research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a low-power high-dynamic-range

   of a Wilkinson-type digitizer, a digital control unit and a 9-bit

   the supply for the digital control circuitry is 1.2 V. The input dynamic
   range of the ADC is 2.7 V and the ADC consumes 631 mu W. The ADC is
   designed and laid-out in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS process and occupies
   0.026 mm(2). Post-layout simulation results show that the
   signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of the ADC is just over 50

Abstract = {{In this paper, two wide-tuning-range CMOS LC voltage-controlled
   oscillator (LC-VCO) topologies are studied and their performance is
   compared. Proof-of-concept prototypes of each topology are implemented
   in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The first design incorporates multiple VCO
   cores with overlapping tuning ranges and has an extra buffer compared to
   the second design. The second design uses one VCO core and a
   switched-capacitor array. Based on measurement results they achieve a
   wide tuning range of 28.20\% and 24.42\% and dissipate 5.07 mW and 5.10
   mW from a 1.2-V supply, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of the
   source-follower buffer to the first structure reduces the loading effect
   on the VCO core and thus facilitates higher oscillation frequency.}},

Abstract = {{We present an automated method for decomposing EMG signals into their
   components, motor-unit action-potential (MUAP) trains based on short
   time Fourier transform STFT and wavelet transform. Since the number of
   MUAP classes composing the EMG signal, the number of MUAP's per class,
   their firing pattern, and the expected shape of the MUAP waveforms are
   unknown, the decomposition of real EMG signals into their constituent
   MUAP's and their classification into groups of similar shapes is a
   typical case of an unsupervised learning pattern recognition problem.
   The method is able to handle single-or multi-channel signals, recorded
   by concentric needle electrodes during low and moderate levels of
   muscular contraction. The method uses empirical features in STFT
   transform, shape and template of MU and CWT in order to decompose the
   signal to its original MUAP. Also the discrete wavelet transform has
   been acquired in early steps in order to eliminate the level of low
   amplitude noise in signal. We compare the output of the automated
   algorithm with manual decomposition and results seems quiet acceptable.
   The average success rate for the FCM with wavelet coefficients as
   features was 91.01 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Engaging first-year engineering students in their mandatory, first-term,
   communication course can be a challenge when some may not yet understand
   how these communication skills will be used in their day-to-day
   professional interactions. However, adding a real client with real needs
   where the students' work can have real impact adds immediacy and
   interest. To those ends, a community service learning team proposal
   project was created in 2011 for 60 students of a first term, first-year
   engineering writing course, which is a part of a common first-year
   engineering curriculum. In this assignment, students had the opportunity
   to practice the communication skills required for engineering through
   team fundraising proposals and presentations for local not-for-profit
   organizations. A proposed idea from one student team was implemented by
   the community organization the following summer. The not-for-profit used
   the idea to raise over \$18,000, and it has since become one of their
   annual fundraising events.
   After the success of the first iteration of the project, it was offered
   to all 220 incoming first-year engineering students in 2012. The 2012
   iteration of the team proposal project marked the first time that an
   entire cohort of students was able to participate in community service
   learning in any discipline at that small university campus. The team
   proposal project was offered again in 2013.
   There are multiple considerations for this type of project in terms of
   logistics and sustainability, especially for yearly participation of 220
   students in this project. This paper will discuss the strategies
   involved in adapting a community service learning project originally
   designed for 60 students to a larger scale project for 220 students
   while maintaining the academic robustness of the proposal assignment and
   the good will of the partnering community organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Human sleep is classified into Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM
   sleep. In non-REM sleep, the heart rate and respiratory rate decrease
   whereas during REM sleep, breathing and heart rate become more irregular
   As such, identification of sleep stages by monitoring the autonomic
   regulation of heart rate is a promising approach. In this study we
   analysed the standard features of heart rate variability extracted from
   the pulse oximeter photoplethysmogram (PPG) to identify different sleep
   stages. The overnight PPG signals were recorded from 146 children with
   the Phone Oximeterm in addition to overnight polysomnography. The
   recordings were divided into 1-min segments and labelled as wake,
   non-REM and REM based on the event log file of the polysomnography. For
   each segment, six standard time and frequency domain features of heart
   rate variability were estimated. Two support vector machine classifiers
   were separately trained to classify wake from sleep and non-REM from REM
   sleep. Wake and sleep were classified with an accuracy of 77\% and REM
   and non-REM were classified with an accuracy of 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) on classical
   computers are highly limited due to the exponential growth in resources
   required for the numerical simulation of quantum mechanics involving
   networks of finite state nodes. Recent advancements in computing based
   on networks of flux-qubits, and in particular the platform technology
   developed by D-Wave Systems Inc., have made it possible to explore QCA
   networks that are intractable on classical machines. However, the
   embedding of such networks onto the available processor architecture is
   a key challenge in setting up such simulations. In this work, two
   approaches to embedding QCA circuits are characterized: a dense
   placement algorithm that uses a routing method based on negotiated
   congestion; and a heuristic method implemented in D-Wave's SAPI package.
   Both embedding methods are characterized using a set of basic QCA
   benchmark circuits of various sizes and complexities. When including
   diagonal interactions only in the case of an inverter, both methods were
   able to embed a 4-bit 2-1 multiplexer circuit containing 192 non-driver
   QCA cells onto the 512 qubit D-Wave Vesuvius chip architecture.
   Including diagonal interactions for all cells, both methods successfully
   embedded a serial adder circuit containing 126 non-driver cells.}},

Abstract = {{Despite offering higher security than radio frequency (RF) channels, the
   broadcast nature of the visible light communication (VLC) channel makes
   VLC links inherently susceptible to eavesdropping by unauthorized users.
   In this work, we consider the physical-layer security of VLC links aided
   by friendly jamming. The jammer has multiple light sources, but does not
   have access to the data transmitted. The eavesdropper's reception is
   degraded by a jamming signal that causes no interference to the
   legitimate receiver. Due to the limited dynamic range of typical
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs), both the data and jamming signals are
   subject to amplitude constraints. Therefore, we begin with deriving a
   closed-form secrecy rate expression for the corresponding wiretap
   channel, and adopt secrecy rate as the performance measure. Then, we
   formulate a linear programming problem to maximize the secrecy rate when
   the eavesdropper's channel is accurately known to the jammer. Finally,
   we consider robust beamforming to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate
   when information about the eavesdropper's channel is uncertain due to
   location uncertainty. The robust scheme makes use of simple linear
   programming, making real-time implementation feasible in a variety of
   real-world scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The world is advancing towards Internet of Things (IoT) where various
   types of devices communicate and share data with each other. The
   communication between the devices are enabled and controlled through
   Machine Type Communications (MTC). MTC has a wide range of applications
   and forms an integral part of IoT. The 3rd Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP) standardization body has recognized the potential for MTC
   and is currently working on standardizing the specifications and
   deployment of MTC services as part of Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   networks. The system requirements of these MTC devices are different
   from the regular devices using the LTE network. Many MTC devices are
   expected to be low cost, low data rate and delay tolerant. One of the
   challenges in MTC using 3GPP LTE is to reduce the power consumption of
   the User Equipment (UE) in order to prolong their battery life. The
   power consumption of a UE is directly proportional to its processing
   time. In this paper, we introduce quick sleeping to the current 3GPP LTE
   MTC framework. First, we compare the quick sleeping mechanism with the
   present Discontinuous Reception (DRX) mechanism for sleeping in LTE and
   show that there can be significant savings in the UE processing time if
   quick sleeping is adopted. Then we present different methods to
   incorporate quick sleeping into the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)
   with minimal changes to the current LTE standard. The impact of these
   quick sleeping solutions on PBCH Block Error Rate (BLER) performance is
   also discussed.}},

   Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) mechanism. We describe
   novel heuristic methods which can be adopted for both LTE and LTE-A to

Abstract = {{We present a novel graph-based resource allocation and interference

   small cells into cell-clusters according to their neighboring
   relationships in the network and examine the network morphology under
   different neighborhood bounds. Then we develop another graph clustering
   scheme to group the users in each cell-cluster into user-clusters with
   minimum intra-cluster interference. Finally, we employ a proportional
   fair scheduling scheme to assign subchannels among the user-clusters and
   allocate power using water-filling method. The simulation results show
   that our method achieves a significant improvement in spectral
   efficiency compared to previous works under both co-channel and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the system performance from the physical
   layer security provision under imperfect channel state information
   (CSI). In a classical transmitter (Alice)-legitimate receiver (Bob)-
   eavesdropper (Eve) model, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to disturb
   Eve's reception, as Eve's CSI is unknown to Alice. For designing the
   transmit beamforming vector of the information signal and precoding
   matrix of AN, Bob feeds back the quantized CSI estimation to Alice. Due
   to the effects of imperfect CSI at Alice, the secrecy system performance
   is upper bounded at high SNRs. In order to overcome the problem, by
   utilizing our derived upper bound on the secrecy rate loss, we put
   forward a scaled feedback strategy for the secrecy system. By employing
   the proposed strategy, the secrecy rate increases with transmit power
   despite that Alice can only obtain imperfect Bob's CSI, and the secrecy
   rate loss between perfect CSI and imperfect CSI can be controlled within
   a certain gap. Computer simulations are provided to verify our derived
   results.}},

   of job scheduling with respect to CC-WSN integration and then studies
   two traditional and popular job scheduling algorithms (i.e., Min-Min and

   priority-based two phase MM-MM (PTMM) and priority-based two phase
   Max-MM (PTAM), are proposed for CC integrated with WSN. Extensive

Abstract = {{As the game industry `natures, processing complex game logics in a
   timely manner is no longer an insurmountable problem. Many researchers
   are now trying to find ways to optimize the gaming system regarding the
   network usage, local resource utilization, and energy consumption.
   However, current cloud-based mobile gaming solutions are limited by
   their relatively high requirements on Internet resources. Also, they
   typically do not consider the geographical locations of nearby mobile
   users and thus ignore the potential cooperation among users. Therefore,
   inspired by existing cloud computing techniques and the concept of
   ad-hoc cloudlet computing, in this paper, we propose an ad-hoc cloudlet
   based gaining architecture. Two modules of the architecture are
   introduced: 1) progressive game resources download, by which mobile
   users can adaptively download gaining resources from cloud servers or
   nearby mobile users according to the gaining progress, and 2) ad-hoc
   cloudlet-based cooperative task allocation, by which gaming components
   can be executed dynamically over local devices, nearby devices, or cloud
   servers. We also formulate the mechanism for both modules as an
   optimization problem and propose several algorithms for both modules,
   which are later used for evaluation purposes. We carry out simulations
   based on real mobility traces, and the results show that our system's
   performance depends highly on the ad-hoc network environment (the more
   concurrent and balanced connections within the ad-hoc network, the lower
   the energy costs). Also, regardless of the network environment, our
   system has lower energy costs while utilizing resources of nearby
   devices, compared to the cloud-based gaming architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Recent events, such as Hurricane Katrina, have revealed the need for
   coordinated and efl{''}ective disaster responses. An optimal
   distribution of available resources is essential for disaster response
   effectiveness. Emergency responders are faced with the challenges of
   increased size and complexity of critical infrastructures that provide
   vital resources for disaster response operations. In this paper, we
   propose a simulation-based tool to assist emergency responders in
   finding the optimal distribution of available resources during a
   disaster event. The proposed tool utilizes the Disaster Response Network
   Enabled Platform (DRNEP) which is an infrastructure interdependencies
   simulation platform for disaster response support. DR-NEP is a
   simulation network platform that integrates different simulators for
   different infrastructures to form a universal simulation platform. We
   employ a new concept in Discrete Event Systems optimization called
   Ordinal Optimization to address the problem of resources allocation
   during a disaster event. The objective of the optimization problem is
   maximizing the operational capacity of a critical infrastructure, a
   hospital in this case. Due to the huge combinatorial feasible search
   space, an Ordinal Optimization based approach is used to solve the
   problem using two main concepts: goal softening and order comparison.
   This approach aims at finding a Good Enough solution set (G) with an
   acceptable probability and efficient computational effort. This paper
   describes early results of our work that shows the use of our approach
   in optimizing resources allocation in a simulated disaster event.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable energy supply and demand can partially be solved by the
   conservation of energy, which is a personal and self-driven action.
   However, energy conservation currently requires the purchase of
   third-party products. The upfront cost of purchasing these products to
   monitor energy consumption in a home is a barrier that further cements
   the divide of those that have and those that have not. Detailed
   appliance power consumption reporting should be made available for free
   as part of the home's smart meter. Governments and power utilities must
   improve and expand policies that promote a socio-economic balance
   allowing everyone to participate in energy conservation regardless of
   their economic situation in a sustained way. We critically look at what
   economics and government polices exist and need to exist. We also
   demonstrate the computational means to achieve this -nonintrusive load
   monitoring (NILM) -and discuss how manufacturing and standards
   organizations need to work together to provide the essential information
   that describes how appliances consume energy. This paper proposes a
   Consumer Bill of Rights for Energy Conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Although electrocardiogram (ECG) is one standard way for monitoring
   heart beat rate, there are of great interests in exploring other types
   of biophysical signals. A novel type of nanofiber (NF) sensor signals,
   as a potential alternative choice to ECG signals for heart beat
   monitoring, are investigated in this paper. To get the heart beat
   signal, three nano sensors are deployed at the wrist. However, detecting
   the heart beat rate (HBR) directly from the raw data is challenging
   because the signals of interest are masked by different types of noise.
   To address this concern, a two-step framework based on ensemble
   empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and multiset canonical correlation
   analysis (MCCA) is proposed to extract the interesting signals. Further,
   a specific HBR detection method is presented based on peak detection and
   peak filtering. We apply the proposed framework to the real data
   collected from one subject performing 8 tasks, and the results
   demonstrate its effectiveness and potential in real applications.}},

   extraction and saliency extraction problems, food baking images are also
   subject to lighting noise, glass reflection and shadow effects. In this
   paper, the HSV color map is employed to effectively eliminate oven
   lighting effects, then a one-bit transform (1BT) with global adaptive
   thresholding method is performed to obtain preliminary ROI segmentation
   results. Further, a local contour refinement algorithm is designed to
   reduce glass reflection and shadow effects for extracting the ROI
   contour more precisely. The ROI extraction results presented in this

Abstract = {{The recent advance of hybrid PET/MR system enables MR-based motion
   correction of PET data. In this paper, we propose a PET/MR motion
   compensation (MC) strategy and a non-parametric orthogonal slice to
   volume deformable registration technique for respiratory motion
   estimation from the MRIs. In our imaging strategy, a static 3D MRI is
   acquired before the PET acquisition, and a series of dynamic 2D MRIs are
   acquired in sagittal and coronal planes by turns during the PET
   acquisition. The 2D MRIs in orthogonal orientations are then registered
   with the static 3D MRI to derive a 3D+t deformation field for PET MC.
   Unlike most previously reported works in the literature, our MC strategy
   does not rely on respiratory gating, and therefore is able to address
   irregular and/or varying breathing patterns. We validated our approach
   using MRI data acquired from 5 volunteers and synthetic simultaneous PET
   data, demonstrating up to 30.5\% improvement in registration accuracy
   and sharper motion corrected PET images over the reported MC approaches.}},

   optimization. With the quantized CSI available, the relay station (RS)
   optimizes its precoder by maximizing the transmit power of the
   artificial noise, which is radiated isotropically to mask the
   information signals of the intended users, while meeting minimum mean
   square error (NINISE) constraints of the intended user links under CSI
   mismatch. An optimal solution for the relay design is derived based on
   the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, having a comparable
   computational complexity as the conventional strategy. Numerical results

Abstract = {{Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are being widely installed in modern
   power systems worldwide. The most important advantage of PMUs is their
   capability to provide fast, reliable and synchronized real-time
   measurements of different system parameters. This characteristic leads
   to an essential role of PMUs in real-time monitoring, advanced power
   system protection, and advanced control schemes. In this paper, a new
   scheme for controlled separation of two real power systems, i.e.,
   British Columbia and Alberta power systems, based on PMUs synchronized
   measurements of angles is proposed. Two indices, based on region center
   of angle and kinetic energy function are obtained for the two power
   systems. The results demonstrate the reliability, speed and efficiency
   of the proposed scheme in comparison to the existing installed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances of self-interference cancellation techniques enable
   full-duplex relaying (FDR) systems, which transmit and receive
   simultaneously in the same frequency band with high spectrum efficiency.
   Unlike most existing works, we study the problem of energy efficient
   resource allocation in FDR networks. We consider a shared FDR deployment
   scenario, where a FDR relay is deployed at the intersection of three
   sectors in a cell. Firstly, a simple but practical transmission strategy
   is proposed to deal with the involved interferences, i.e., multi-access
   interference, multi-user interference and self-interference. Then, the
   joint resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the
   network-level energy efficiency while taking the residual
   self-interference into account. Since the formulated problem is a mixed
   combinatorial and non-convex problem, we use Dinkelbach and discrete
   stochastic optimization methods to solve it efficiently. Simulation
   results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies distance estimation for diffusive molecular
   communication. The strength of the channel impulse response generally
   decreases with distance, so it is measured to estimate the distance. The
   Cramer-Rao lower bound on the variance of the distance estimation error
   is derived. The lower bound is derived for a physically unbounded
   environment with molecule degradation and steady uniform flow. The
   maximum likelihood distance estimator is derived and its accuracy is
   shown via simulation to perform very close to the Cramer-Rao lower
   bound. An existing protocol is shown to be equivalent to the maximum
   likelihood distance estimator if only one observation is made.
   Simulation results also show the accuracy of existing protocols with
   respect to the Cramer-Rao lower bound.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, motivated by incorporating the advantages of social networks
   (SNs) and mobile cloud computing (MCC), the integration of SNs and MCC
   receives a lot of attention from both academia and industry, since the
   SNs could be utilized to share the rich cloud resources and services as
   well as the cloud can be taken to host or enhance SNs. However, one very
   critical and unexplored issue when integrating SNs and MCC is evaluating
   the importance of users to obtain the potential influential users. In
   this paper, focusing on exploring the user importance evaluation issue
   during the integration of SNs and MCC, we propose a RFTRS scheme, which
   innovatively considers the Reputation, Fractal, and Topological
   importance in SNs as well as the Request and Storage importance in MCC
   to evaluate user importance. The detailed design about RFTRS is
   presented. A further case study is also conducted to compare the user
   evaluation results identified by RFTRS and other popular traditional
   user importance evaluation approaches in SNs. They show that new user
   evaluation approaches (e.g., RFTRS) when integrating SNs and MCC are
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the cell association problem in the downlink of a
   multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), where base stations (BSs)
   have finite number of resource blocks (RBs) available to distribute
   among their associated users. We define the global outage probability as
   the event where at least one user in the network experiences outage. An
   optimization problem is defined to minimize this global outage
   probability while maintaining quality of service (QoS) through two
   phases: Cell association phase followed by the optional RB distribution
   phase. The cell association problem is an NP-hard problem. We transform
   the cell association problem into a linear program, for which we propose
   a distributed cell association algorithm by using Lagrange dual
   decomposition method. An admission control scheme is also proposed to
   address the infeasibility problem and achieve load balancing. Finally,
   the effectiveness of our proposed distributed algorithm is examined
   through numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology can provide a ranging accuracy of tens
   of centimeters with fine time resolution. UWB radio occupies a large
   bandwidth, e. g. at least 500 MHz, which translates to high multipath
   resolution. Thus, UWB is a suitable technology for accurate positioning
   through estimating time of flight (TOF) of the transmitted signal. In
   this paper, we present a highly accurate positioning scheme by
   estimating the round trip time (RTT) of frequency-converted transponded
   signal. The proposed scheme avoids complicated beam-forming techniques
   and clock synchronization between the unknown terminal and the
   referenced stations. To avoid employing high rate sampling
   analog-to-digital converters, we propose a novel time estimation method
   based on sliding correlation and a fractional delay polyphase filter. We
   use low-rate sampling data with polyphase filter to estimate the RTT,
   and obtain an equivalent sampling rate as high as tens of gigahertz. The
   theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that the
   proposed scheme can realize high accuracy positioning.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel cooperative resource management

   on cooperation between mobile devices using their short range radio
   technology such as WiFi with the goal of maximizing the revenue of the
   cellular service provider. Users with poor cellular link quality connect
   with nearby devices through their WiFi interface. The service provider
   provides incentives to mobile devices to motivate them to contribute in
   such cooperative scheme. We first formulate the resource management
   problem as a mixed integer linear programming model. The optimal
   solution has an NP-hard complexity. To tackle the complexity of the
   problem, we then propose iCoMe, which is an Incentivized COoperative
   MobilE resource management mechanism. The resource management problem in
   iCoMe is solved distributively by the service provider and mobile
   devices. We prove that iCoMe has a polynomial time computational
   complexity. Simulation results confirm the close to optimal performance
   of iCoMe. Results also show that our proposed mechanism considerably

Abstract = {{When energy efficiency is considered, cooperative communications may not
   be appealing since it involves multiple nodes in transmissions. To
   exploit the benefits of distributed user cooperation in cooperative
   wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs), we propose a distributed
   energy-efficient selective diversity (EESD) topology control to improve
   energy efficiency in the network, which jointly considers network
   capacity and energy consumption in terms of bits per Joule. EESD forms
   transmission coalitions via cooperative manner (i.e, diversity)
   selections, by taking into account the cost of channel information
   exchange. We then formulate EESD as a coalition game and propose an
   adaptive coalition formation algorithm for EESD with proved convergence
   property and stable coalition structures. Simulation results show the
   performance improvement of EESD in energy efficiency compared to the
   existing topology control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{By incorporating the advantages of cloud computing (CC) and wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs), the integration of CC and WSNs attracts a lot of
   attention from both academia and industry. However, trust and reputation
   management for CC and WSNs integration is a critical and barely explored
   issue, which could strongly prevent the cloud service users (CSUs) from
   choosing the desirable cloud service providers (CSPs) or hinder the CSP
   from selecting appropriate sensor network providers (SNPs). To fill the
   gap, this paper proposes a novel trust and reputation management system
   for CC and WSNs integration. Considering the attribute requirement of
   CSU and CSP as well as the cost, trust and reputation of the service of
   CSP and SNP, the proposed system achieves the following two goals: 1)
   calculate and manage the trust and reputation regarding the service of
   CSP and SNP; 2) help CSU choose CSP and assist CSP in choosing SNP.
   Evaluation results are also shown to verify effectiveness of the
   proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{The existing wireless cellular networks can provide machine-to-machine
   (M2M) service to machine-type communication (MTC) devices deployed in
   large coverage areas. However, the current Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   cellular networks designed for human users may not be able to handle a
   large number of bursty random access requests from MTC devices. In this
   paper, we propose to jointly use access class barring (ACB) and timing
   advance (TA) command to reduce the random access overload. In our
   proposed scheme, the expected number of MTC devices served in one random
   access slot is determined by the coverage of the base station, total
   number of devices to be served, the number of preambles, and ACB
   parameter. By choosing the optimal ACB parameter, we can maximize the
   number of MTC devices being served in each random access slot. The total
   number of random access slots required by an LTE base station to serve
   all MTC devices can be minimized. Simulation results show that in
   typical LTE cellular networks, our proposed scheme can reduce at least a
   half of the total slots required by the base station to serve all MTC
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study uplink channel selection in a system where a
   macro base station (MBS) and a number of cognitive femto base stations
   (FBSs) share the same spectrum to serve their intended users with
   quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this system, the MBS may
   experience significant aggregate interference when multiple FBSs select
   the same channel to serve their FUs. An FBS also experiences strong
   interference from nearby femtocells if the same channel is utilized by
   adjacent FBSs. We investigate how to coordinate the channel selection at
   FBSs to reduce the interference experienced at the MBS and FBSs. We
   propose a cluster-based coordination mechanism where the operator groups
   the set of FBSs into clusters, and FBSs in the same cluster can utilize
   a set of channels simultaneously without violating the QoS requirements.
   To find the desired clusters, we employ a graph-theoretic approach and
   propose an efficient FBS clustering scheme. Simulation results show that
   the proposed coordination mechanism achieves a better performance
   compared to the channel selection scheme without coordination.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-homed wireless devices equipped with multiple network interfaces
   that support the Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) of data are an
   inevitable part of future wireless networks. The Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a multi-homed transport layer protocol
   that can support CMT. However, the receiver buffer blocking issue causes
   throughput degradation and prevents CMT from realizing its vast
   potential over multi-hop wireless networks. This paper is focused on
   integrating network coding with SCTP-based CMT to resolve the receiver
   buffer blocking problem. We propose an adaptive network coding mechanism
   for SCTP-CMT to desensitize the receiver against packet reordering and
   consequently eliminate the receiver buffer blocking problem. Our
   state-of-the-art network coding scheme uses a Q-learning algorithm to
   control the number of redundant packets based on the network dynamics.
   The effectiveness and soundness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated
   through simulations and proved to outperform original SCTP-CMT up to a
   factor of 62\% in the presence of severe path dissimilarities and
   limited receiver buffer. Our proposed scheme is one step forward towards
   future multi-homed devices over multi-hop wireless networks.}},

   eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known and
   entirely unknown to the transmitter, respectively. In both scenarios,
   the legitimate receiver's CSI is available to the transmitter. We
   numerically evaluate achievable secrecy rates under typical VLC

Abstract = {{In this paper, the downlink multi-user scheduling problem is studied for
   a time-slotted system with simultaneous wireless information and power
   transfer. In particular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled
   to receive information, while the remaining users opportunistically
   harvest the ambient radio frequency (RF) energy. We devise novel
   scheduling schemes in which the tradeoff between the users' ergodic
   capacities and their average amount of harvested energy can be
   controlled. To this end, two fair scheduling schemes used in
   information-only transfer systems are modified. First, proportionally
   fair maximum normalized signal-to-noise ratio (N-SNR) scheduling is
   modified by scheduling the user having the jth ascendingly ordered
   (rather than the maximum) N-SNR. We refer to this scheme as order-based
   N-SNR scheduling. Second, conventional equal-throughput (ET) fair
   scheduling is modified by scheduling the user having the minimum moving
   average throughput among the set of users whose N-SNR orders fall into a
   certain set of allowed orders Sa (rather than the set of all users). We
   refer to this scheme as order-based ET scheduling. The feasibility
   conditions required for the users to achieve ET with this scheme are
   also derived. It is shown that the smaller the selection order j for the
   order-based N-SNR scheme, and the lower the orders in Sa for the
   order-based ET scheme, the higher the average amount of energy harvested
   by the users at the expense of a reduction in their ergodic capacities.
   The performance of the considered scheduling schemes is analyzed for
   independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) Ricean fading
   channels, and closed-form results for the special case of i.n.d.
   Rayleigh fading are provided.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel cumulative-distribution-function-based
   scheduling (CS) with flexible-beam transmissions (CSFB) as an
   opportunistic downlink scheduling with fair resource sharing for
   distributed antenna systems (DASs). Taking advantage of the spatially
   distributed nature of remote antenna units (RAUs) in DASs, CSFB
   dynamically assigns a different weight for each user-RAU pair and
   adjusts the number of beams for transmissions based on the channel
   conditions, in order to increase the probability that each RAU can
   contribute to the throughput of users located near it by efficiently
   exploiting spatial multiplexing gain. Furthermore, by simply setting a
   single threshold for each RAU, which is applied for user selection, CSFB
   maintains fair resource sharing constraints. This simple setting greatly
   facilitates the scheduler design. Thus, our proposed CSFB can exploit
   the multiuser diversity gain provided by the independent channel fading
   of multiple users, as well as the spatial multiplexing gain through the
   effective utilization of distributed RAUs. Simulation results
   demonstrate that CSFB achieves a better throughput performance than CS
   with all-beam transmissions and CS with single-beam transmissions, while
   satisfying the fair resource sharing constraints.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a robust cooperative relay beamforming (rBF)
   design for single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA)
   based multiuser multi-relay systems with imperfect channel state
   information. We maximize a lower bound on the achievable bit rate (ABR)
   of the network, subject to an aggregate relay transmit power constraint.
   Employing the primal decomposition technique, we decompose the problem
   into two subproblems: the rBF coefficient optimization and the relay
   power allocation. For a given power allocation across the frequency
   tones, a closed-form solution for the rBF matrices is obtained first.
   Subsequently, the convexity of the remaining power allocation problem is
   then proved, and efficient convex optimization methods are employed to
   find the global optimum. Simulation results validate the excellent
   performance of the proposed rBF schemes and show their superiority
   compared to conventional non-robust designs.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the context of human-object interactions plays an
   important role in human activity recognition. Modeling the interaction
   context is a challenging problem due to the large number of possible
   objects in the scene and the large number of ways these objects may seem
   to relate to human activities taking place in the scene. In addition,
   providing labeling information of the object and human body parts is a
   very difficult and labor intense part of the training process. In this
   paper, we use a new class of kernels for image/ video data as an
   extension of string kernels for 2 and 3 dimensional signals to model the
   human body parts and objects interaction context. In contrast to similar
   works, the proposed method does not require labeling of the human body
   parts and objects in the scene for the learning process, making it more
   practical when dealing with large datasets. Our experimental results
   show that the proposed kernel efficiently models the context of
   human-object interactions in image/ video sequences and results in
   improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods.}},

   through subjective experiments. Experiment results showed that viewers
   find an asymmetric video more pleasant when the view with higher quality
   is projected to their dominant eye. Moreover, the eye dominance changes
   the mean opinion quality score by 16 \% at most, a result caused by
   slight asymmetric video compression. For all other representative types

Abstract = {{A robot that can fluently hand over objects to people can be useful in
   many applications. In an effort to develop a fluent robot-to-human
   handover system, this work investigates people's behavioural responses
   to a robot that hands over objects to them while using different types
   of gaze cues. In our previous work, we found empirical evidence that the
   use of a robot's head gaze can affect a person's timing of reaching
   towards the offered object. In this paper, we investigate this effect
   further by exploring the manner in which human's reaching and gaze
   behaviours are affected by a robot's head gaze. We conducted a
   video-based investigation of 97 naive participants' behavioural
   responses to robot-to-human handovers. Through a frame-by-frame
   analysis, we recorded a detailed timeline of the robot's and human's
   gaze and reaching behaviours. Results confirm the finding from our
   previous study that the robot's head gaze can significantly impact the
   timing of human receiver's reaching behaviour during handovers. In
   addition, our results demonstrate that the robot's head gaze affects
   human's gaze behaviour during handovers, and this effect explains some
   unexpected findings in our previous work.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of distributed generators with DC output power and the
   advancement in power electronics devices have motivated system planners
   and grid operators to move towards integration of DC microgrids into
   conventional AC grid. In this paper, we address the optimal power flow
   (OPF) problem in AC-DC networks. The goal of the AC-DC OPF problem is to
   jointly minimize the total electricity generation cost of the network
   and the cost of transferring active power from the AC grid to the DC
   microgrids. The optimization problem is subject to the power flow
   constraints, voltage magnitude limits, the limits of the network power
   lines, and the limits imposed by the power ratings of AC-DC power
   electronic converters. The formulated AC-DC OPF problem is shown to be
   nonlinear. We propose an approach to reformulate the AC-DC OPF problem
   as an equivalent traditional AC OPF problem. Due to the non-convexity of
   the AC OPF problem, we use convex relaxation techniques and transform
   the problem to a semidefinite program (SDP). We show that the relaxation
   gap is zero. That is the optimal solution of the non-convex and the
   transformed convex problems are equal. Simulation studies are performed
   on an IEEE 14-bus system connected to two 9-bus DC microgrids. We show
   that the sufficient condition for the zero relaxation gap is satisfied,
   and the proposed SDP approach enables us to find the global optimal
   solution efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to provide frequency
   regulation service to an independent system operator (ISO) by changing
   their real-time charging or discharging power according to an automatic
   generation control (AGC) signal. Recently, the Federal Energy Regulatory
   Commission has issued an order to ISOs to introduce a performance-based
   compensation paradigm. In this new compensation scheme, the ISOs make
   payments to the EVs for providing the frequency regulation capacity and
   the real-time dispatch when following the AGC signal. In this paper, we
   propose a robust EV frequency regulation (REF) algorithm to determine
   the hourly regulation capacity for each EV considering the randomness of
   the AGC signal. The proposed REF algorithm is based on a robust
   optimization problem formulation. It enables EVs to follow the random
   AGC signal reliably and to improve the EV frequency regulation revenue.
   Simulation results show that the proposed REF algorithm obtains a higher
   revenue compared with a benchmark algorithm from the literature under a
   performance-based compensation paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering schools in North America aim to prepare students for
   transitioning to the workplace by embedding the teaching of graduate
   attributes within the curriculum and using robust ways to measure
   learning outcomes. Some of the graduate attributes for engineering
   students include individual and team work, communication skills,
   professionalism, the impact of engineering on society and the
   environment, ethics and equity. Our paper discusses the collaboration
   between technical communication instructors and the staff of the
   Engineering Co-op program of the Faculty of Applied Science in the
   University of British Columbia, Canada. Our purpose is to examine the
   relationship between employability and graduate attributes and to
   explore the experiential aspects of transformative learning in the
   cooperative education model. In addition to learning about graduate
   attributes in the classroom, students can practice them and understand
   them better through their co-op work experience. Three instruments for
   measuring the learning outcomes are discussed: 1) a reality-based
   assignment designed to measure students' understanding of graduate
   attributes; 2) a self-administered online survey; 3) a de-briefing
   questionnaire administered at the end of the co-op work term. The
   authors describe the instrument development and discuss the significance
   of students' progressive understanding of graduate attributes.}},

Abstract = {{Most cloud computing clusters are built from unreliable, commercial
   off-the-shelf components. The high failure rates in their hardware and
   software components result in frequent node and application failures.
   Therefore, it is important to predict application failures before they
   occur to avoid resource wastage. In this paper, we investigate how to
   identify application failures based on resource usage measurements from
   the Google cluster traces. We apply recurrent neural networks to the
   resource usage measures, and generate features to categorize the input
   resource usage time series into different classes. Our results show that
   the model is able to predict failures of batch applications, which are
   the dominant jobs in the Google cluster. Moreover, we explore early
   classification to identify failures, and find that the prediction
   algorithm provides the cloud system enough time to take proactive
   actions much earlier than the termination of applications, with an
   average 6\% to 10\% of resource savings.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental measurements have shown that the noise in many
   communication channels is non-Gaussian. Bit interleaved coded modulation
   (BICM) is very popular for spectrally efficient transmission. Recent
   results have shown that the performance of BICM using convolutional
   codes in non-fading channels can be significantly improved if the coded
   bits are not interleaved at all. This particular BICM design is called
   BICM trivial (BICM-T). In this paper, we analyze the performance of a
   generalized BICM-T design for communication over Gaussian mixture noise
   (GMN) channels. The results disclose that for an optimal bit error rate
   (BER) performance, the use of an interleaver in BICM for GMN channels
   depends upon the strength of the impulsive noise components in the
   Gaussian mixture. The results presented for 16-QAM show that the BICM-T
   can result in gains up to 1.5 dB for a target BER of 10(-6) if the
   impulsive noise in the Gaussian mixture is below a certain threshold
   level. The simulation results verify the tightness of developed union
   bound (UB) on BER performance.}},

Abstract = {{In a cooperative cognitive radio (CR) network when a group of CR users
   acts as relays for a given user, a cooperative beamforming among these
   relays can be used to improve the quality of communications. However,
   this cooperative beamforming can introduce asynchronous interference at
   the primary receivers due to different propagation delays between
   different CR relays and the primary receivers. We propose an innovative
   cooperative beamforming method that maximizes the received signal power
   at the secondary destination while keeping the asynchronous interference
   signals at multiple primary receivers below their corresponding target
   thresholds. Moreover, in this paper, we propose two relay selection
   strategies in conjunction with cooperative beamforming. The presented
   numerical results show that the relay selection schemes can further
   improve the received signal power at the secondary destination.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, competition among multiple secondary users (SUs) for
   spectrum access is modeled as a simultaneous repeated auction. Upon
   participation in an auction, a SU is charged with an entry fee. However,
   participation does not ensure an access to the channel. This tradeoff
   leads it to decide either for or against entering the auction. We
   consider no cooperation among the SUs, and model this situation as a
   Bayesian game. A modification of the standard regret testing procedure
   is proposed to fit our system model. Our proposed procedure converges to
   Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game. Since this procedure is
   computationally expensive, we propose a less expensive learning based
   procedure for the decision taking. We present computer simulation
   results to compare the average profits and bidding efficiencies over
   time for the proposed procedure. We also compare their bidding
   efficiencies to another procedure in the literature, based on second
   highest bid prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) enable spectrum channels to be used by
   secondary users (SUs) without interfering with the transmission of
   primary users (PUs). Cooperation among SUs in CRNs not only improves
   sensing performance but also increases spectrum efficiency. In this
   work, we study a cooperation strategy in multi-channel CRNs, which
   allows an energy constrained SU to selectively participate in
   cooperative sensing. We consider CRNs where SUs can make distributed
   decisions on cooperative sensing based on traffic demand. We formulate
   this problem as a non-transferable utility (NTU) coalition formation
   game problem, where each SU in a coalition has a coalition value that
   takes into account traffic demand and energy efficiency. We also propose
   a sequential coalition formation (SCF) algorithm to find the coalition
   structure. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves
   higher throughput and energy efficiency with a lower computational
   complexity compared to previously proposed coalition formation algorithm

Abstract = {{Cloud gaming systems host the game in the cloud, and stream players'
   gaming videos to the terminals in the form of encode video frames. To
   address the high bandwidth issue of real-time gaming video transmission,
   a cloudlet-assisted multiplayer cloud gaming system was proposed to
   encourage cooperative video sharing via a secondary ad-hoc network, on
   the purpose of exploiting the similarities of video frames among
   multiple players in a same game. However, the video cooperative sharing
   among players also introduces fairness problems. In this paper, we
   complete the ad hoc cloudlet-assisted cloud gaming system by further
   considering the mobility of terminal devices and the diversity of
   network quality for distinct players. With mathematical formulation, we
   study the players' behavior in cooperative sharing patterns and propose
   a reputation-based multiplayer fairness scheme in terms of frame
   encoding. Experimental results illustrate the impact of mobility on the
   system performance and evaluate that the proposed solution provides
   better fairness gaming ecosystem compared to the existing platform.}},

Abstract = {{Smart embedded devices most often operate on batteries and in some cases
   these batteries cannot be replaced so frequently. As a result, both the
   available power and energy budgets are severely limited which forces
   designers to use low performance processors that use the least amount of
   power possible. The conundrum is that an increasing number of smart
   devices implement advanced functions that require more performance than
   what these processors can deliver. In this paper we propose a dual-issue
   32-bit RISC processor that delivers up to 60\% improvement in IPC
   (instruction-per-cycle) performance with less than 20\% increase in
   power consumption compared to a scalar single-issue processor. The
   proposed processor is implemented in an FPGA and its performance is
   compared to similar publicly available embedded processors.}},

   for moving objects, and combined nonlinear kernels for SVM. For the
   purpose of real time application in autonomous navigation, the SimpleMKL
   algorithm is implemented into the proposed MKL-SVM classifier. It is
   able to converge rapidly with comparable efficiency through a weighted
   2-norm regularization formulation with an additional constraint on the

Abstract = {{This paper develops a hierarchical controller to avoid randomly moving
   obstacles in autonomous navigation of a robot. The developed method
   consists of two parts: a high-level Q-Iearning controller for choosing
   an optimal plan for navigation and a low-level, appearance-based visual
   servo (ABVS) controller for motion execution. The use of robot learning
   ability in collision avoidance is a novel feature, in a combined system
   framework of planning and visual servo control. The developed approach
   takes advantage of the on-board camera of robot whose finite field of
   view is naturally suitable for the Q-Iearning algorithm. Because of the
   Q-Iearning controller, knowledge of obstacle movement and a control law
   for the ABVS controller are not needed. This is a significant
   computational advantage. The method is implemented in a simulation
   system of robot navigation. The results show that Q-Iearning, which is a
   method of reinforcement learning, successfully converges to an optimal
   strategy for the robot to establish a proper motion plan.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a four degree of freedom commercial robot manipulator is
   transformed and simplified into a two degree of freedom planar
   manipulator in order to verify different types of control algorithms
   without the need to consider redundancy. Due to the property of high
   back-drivability of this manipulator, it has been designed without joint
   brakes or locks. To lock two joints, a mechanical technique together
   with a control algorithm is proposed, which guarantees the stillness of
   these joints. Reference trajectories are chosen to be smooth and
   differentiable to avoid numerical and mechanical problems in the
   experimental implementation. Experimental results are given to
   illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
   experimental setup.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the optimal mechatronic design of a regenerative chatter
   controller in a lathe machine is presented. As an innovative
   consideration, a structured artificial immune system (AIS) is utilized
   for optimization of the topology and the parameter values of the system.
   To remove the chatter in a specific spindle speed, a mechatronic system
   including smart piezoelectric actuator, piezoelectric sensor and
   controller is designed. A rather comprehensive structure is considered
   for the transfer function of the controller with the aim to cover common
   types of industrial controllers. The overall objective of the present

Abstract = {{In Engineering, designers encounter many challenges due to the
   increasing complexity of mechatronic systems and the presence of
   multiple domains and stringent functionality. The elimination of
   different design alternatives in an early phase without the need for
   more detail is a common practice. The huge search space makes the
   identification of design concepts a tedious process. In this paper, a
   systematic methodology is presented to facilitate the relationship
   between the functional requirements and conceptual design solutions.
   Mechatronic design quotient (MDQ), which represents the ``goodness{''}
   of a mechatronic design, is used to help facilitate the decision-making
   process of the conceptual solutions. A case study of the design of an
   electro-mechanical conveyor system is presented to illustrate the

Abstract = {{Design of a multi-domain engineering system can be complicated due to
   its complex structure and dynamic coupling between domains. Ideally,
   designing a multi-domain system should be done in an integrated and
   concurrent manner, where dynamic interactions between domains in the
   entire system have to be considered simultaneously, throughout the
   design process. In recent years, researchers have made some progress in
   the integrated and optimal design of multi-domain systems. Dynamic
   modeling tools such as Bond Graphs and Linear Graphs have been
   considered for modeling multi-domain systems, which can facilitate the
   design process. In the process of design optimization, a rather
   challenging task is to concurrently satisfy multiple design objectives.
   Methods of evolutionary computing, genetic programing in particular,
   have received much attention in recent years for application in design
   optimization. These methods can be extended to evolutionary
   optimization, which may involve complex and non-analytic objective
   functions and a variety of design specifications. More recently, machine
   health monitoring system (MHMS) has been considered for integration into
   the scheme of design evolution even though no concrete developments have
   made in this regard. In this paper, a framework of design weakness
   detection through machine health monitoring for evolutionary design
   optimization of multi-domain system is proposed. MHMS is integrated with
   evolutionary design optimization to make the overall process of design
   evolution more effective and feasible from the practical point of view.
   Information form MHMS is utilized to detect the ``sites{''} or
   ``candidates{''} of design weakness, which will involve computation of a
   new measure that can reflect the quality of the current design. These
   candidates of design weakness are then provided to the process of
   evolutionary design optimization. On subsequent analysis, design
   improvements would be made only if these candidates were found to be
   related to design weaknesses. Otherwise, the monitoring process will
   continue. Supervised design weakness detection is achieved through the
   integrated system of MHMS and evolutionary design optimization. In
   addition, a Design Expert System is employed to monitor and assist both
   design weakness detection and isolation, and feasible design selection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a self-tuning control scheme for local
   adjustment of water quality, through treatment by using Generalized
   Minimum-Variance Control (GMVC). It incorporates a self-tuning estimator
   with Recursive Extended Least-Squares (RELS) method to approximate the
   unknown parameters of a discrete-time single-input single-output local
   water quality model. The proposed self-tuning scheme can be implemented
   on-line to automatically tune the parameters and derive the controller
   using an indirect self-tuning procedure. When deriving the controller,
   the closed-loop tracking performance in achieving the desired level of
   the particular water quality parameter at the measured node is the
   primary consideration. Additionally, the influence of noise and
   disturbance on the local water quality model is considered. The good
   performances of the set-point tracking and disturbance rejection in the

Abstract = {{Web applications have become one of the fastest growing types of
   software systems today. Despite their popularity, understanding the
   behaviour of modern web applications is still a challenging endeavour
   for developers during development and maintenance tasks. The challenges
   mainly stem from the dynamic, event-driven, and asynchronous nature of
   the JavaScript language. We propose a generic technique for capturing
   low-level event-based interactions in a web application and mapping
   those to a higher-level behavioural model. This model is then
   transformed into an interactive visualization, representing episodes of
   triggered causal and temporal events, related JavaScript code
   executions, and their impact on the dynamic DOM state. Our approach,
   implemented in a tool called CLEMATIS, allows developers to easily
   understand the complex dynamic behaviour of their application at three
   different semantic levels of granularity. The results of our industrial
   controlled experiment show that CLEMATIS is capable of improving the
   task accuracy by 61\%, while reducing the task completion time by 47\%.}},

Abstract = {{JavaScript is used in web applications for achieving rich user
   interfaces and implementing core functionality. Unfortunately,
   JavaScript code is known to be prone to faults. In an earlier study, we
   found that over 65\% of such faults are caused by the interaction of
   JavaScript code with the DOM at runtime (DOM-related faults). In this
   paper, we first perform an analysis of 190 bug reports to understand
   fixes commonly applied by programmers to these DOM related faults; we
   observe that parameter replacements and DOM element validations are
   common fix categories. Based on these findings, we propose an automated
   technique and tool, called VEJOVIS, for suggesting repairs for DOM-based

Abstract = {{Mechanical engineers are submitted to the antagonistic criteria when
   designing security components, such as, used in aeronautic, automotive
   and industrial components. They have to look for solutions leading to
   have as less as possible the weight, cost and in the same time as more
   as possible the security under complex and severe conditions of use.
   They consider fatigue to be the most common mechanism which causes
   components fail. In this context, cast A356-T6, which presents a good
   casting properties and mechanical strength resistance, will be studied
   in this paper.
   This work presents an experimental investigation to characterise the
   effect of mean stress on the Multiaxial High Cycle Fatigue ( HCF) of
   cast A356-T6 alloy containing natural and artificial defects with
   various Secondary Dendrite Arming Spacing ( SDAS). Traction, torsion and
   combined traction-torsion fatigue tests have been carried for two
   loading ratio R-sigma = 0 and R-sigma = - 1. The fractured surfaces are
   analyzed through fracto graphic Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in
   order to determine the defect causing failure. To study the effect of
   the mean stress, the results are reported in kitagawa diagrams and
   Goodman diagrams for all the studied cases. In order to characterise
   qualitatively the effects of the defect size and SDAS, surface response
   method has been used. Interesting relationships and correlations have
   been obtained and introduced to improve the defect stress gradient (DSG)
   criterion for such defective material.
   The obtained results show clearly that: (i) the mean stress has
   detrimental, it is more significant in tension, lesser in
   tension-torsion case and slightly in torsion tests. (ii) The improved
   DSG criterion describes very well the trend of the fatigue limit as a
   function of defect size and SDAS.}},

Abstract = {{Flowforming is an incremental rotary forming technology consisting of
   deforming a cylindrical workpiece through contact between a roller and a
   rotating mandrel. This process delivers significant local compressive
   plastic strain to the workpiece. The effects on fatigue resilience of a
   common aluminum foundry alloy (A356) processed in this manner at an
   elevated temperature has been shown to improve post heat treatment.
   Fatigue properties of material processed with a standard heat treatment
   following casting is compared to material which has been cast and
   flowformed to varying degrees and then heat treated. Flowformed material
   with varying degrees of rotary deformation have been tested. Endurance
   limits have been found to be generally governed by porosity and maximum
   principal stress for high cycle fatigue on undeformed material. Fatigue
   properties have been quantified employing stress-life relationships
   derived from uniaxial fatigue tests. A 30\% increase in the high-cycle
   endurance limits of flowformed compared to non-deformed material has
   been observed and is linked to the extent of deformation. Fractographic
   examination shows that this increase in endurance limit can be
   attributed primarily to the mitigation of porosity. Microstructural
   changes due to processing appear to be a secondary factor.}},

Title = {{Excessive sensitivity to uncertain visual input in L-DOPA-induced
   dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease: further implications for cerebellar
   involvement}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{When faced with visual uncertainty during motor performance, humans rely
   more on predictive forward models and proprioception and attribute
   lesser importance to the ambiguous visual feedback. Though disrupted
   predictive control is typical of patients with cerebellar disease,
   sensorimotor deficits associated with the involuntary and often
   unconscious nature of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease
   (PD) suggests dyskinetic subjects may also demonstrate impaired
   predictive motor control.
   Methods: We investigated the motor performance of 9 dyskinetic and 10
   non-dyskinetic PD subjects on and off L-DOPA, and of 10 age-matched
   control subjects, during a large amplitude, overlearned, visually guided
   tracking task. Ambiguous visual feedback was introduced by adding
   ``jitter{''} to a moving target that followed a Lissajous pattern. Root
   mean square (RMS) tracking error was calculated, and ANOVA, robust
   multivariate linear regression, and linear dynamical system analyses
   were used to determine the contribution of speed and ambiguity to
   tracking performance.
   Results: Increasing target ambiguity and speed contributed significantly
   more to the RMS error of dyskinetic subjects off medication. L-DOPA
   improved the RMS tracking performance of both PD groups. At higher
   speeds, controls and PDs without dyskinesia were able to effectively
   de-weight ambiguous visual information.
   Conclusion: PDs' visually guided motor performance degrades with visual
   jitter and speed of movement to a greater degree compared to age-matched
   controls. However, there are fundamental differences in PDs with and
   without dyskinesia: subjects without dyskinesia are generally slow, and
   less responsive to dynamic changes in motor task requirements, but in
   PDs with dyskinesia, there was a trade-off between overall performance
   and inappropriate reliance on ambiguous visual feedback. This is likely
   associated with functional changes in posterior
   parietal-ponto-cerebellar pathways.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The performance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinylcaprolactam
   (PVCap) as kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors in saline solutions and with
   heptane was evaluated using high pressure microdifferential scanning
   calorimetry, as well as with a new apparatus, consisting of two high
   pressure stainless steel crystallizers. Although PVP and PVCap were
   found to prolong natural gas hydrate induction time in saline solutions,
   nucleation was followed by catastrophic hydrate crystal growth. PVP was
   found to be more effective in this case, since this hydrate growth was
   modestly slower. The addition of n-heptane to the natural gas in the
   system created a 4th phase. This resulted in increased induction time
   and a slowing of hydrate growth relative to the gas mixture.
   Unexpectedly, in the presence of n-heptane, addition of kinetic hydrate
   inhibitors (KHIs) decreased induction time, but catastrophic growth did
   not occur. Here PVCap was more effective than PVP in both prolonging the
   induction time and decreasing the rate of hydrate crystal growth. Once
   formed, however, hydrate decomposition took longer and proceeded in two
   steps in the presence of n-heptane. This observation has profound
   applications on the use these KHIs under ocean field conditions. In the
   case of hydrate blockages, our observations that hydrate dissociation
   started later with the KHIs and complete dissociation took longer could
   have far reaching economic implications for industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Combination of renewable energy sources with utility grid and/or energy
   storage systems can deliver continuous power to the loads. Since many
   energy sources and loads use dc, it is envisioned that future smart
   homes may have dc distribution systems in order to interconnect various
   energy sources, storage, and loads with fewer converter stages and
   higher energy efficiency. In such applications, the system may have
   multiple sources and load voltage levels. The use of multiple-input
   multiple-output converters (MIMOCs) can simplify the conversion
   structure, reduce the design component, and lower the manufacturing
   cost. This paper introduces a nonisolated MIMOC, which can
   simultaneously draw power from different energy sources and provide
   multiple supply voltages. A specific switching scheme is proposed, and a
   multivariable control is presented to enable power budgeting between
   diverse sources and loads in addition to regulating all output voltages.}},

Abstract = {{Feasibility of closed-loop anesthesia has been shown in a number of
   clinical studies. Demonstration of patient safety will be essential to
   convince regulatory authorities of the benefits of such systems. This
   paper considers safety constraints for closed-loop propofol anesthesia
   based on its therapeutic range. Simulation scenarios are proposed for
   evaluation of control strategies in the presence of these constraints.
   The scenarios reproduce realistic situations encountered in clinical
   practice. Using the proposed scenarios, the performance of L-2
   anti-windup is compared to sliding mode reference conditioning and to
   back-calculation anti-windup. It is concluded that L-2 anti-windup might
   not be appropriate for this problem. The sliding mode solution results
   in behaviour comparable to the Hanus conditioned controller and there
   seems to be no need for fast switching. The back-calculation anti-windup
   performs well in a variety of situations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a feasibility study investigating an inexpensive
   novel technique to measure urine flow rate using image processing
   techniques. The majority of existing clinical uroflowmeters determine
   urine flow rate using a scale to measure increasing mass of urine
   expelled with time; however, they are expensive and typically found only
   in specialists' offices, making it difficult for patients to receive
   testing. An opportunity therefore exists to develop a much more
   affordable device which would allow flow rate testing to become a part
   of routine care and to be conducted in a wider variety of environments
   such as in General Practitioners' offices and home monitoring. The high
   demand for digital cameras, particularly due to their extensive use in
   mobile devices, has resulted in their accelerated advancement and cost
   reduction. Therefore, a device based on this technology was investigated
   and found to have comparable accuracy to currently used clinical
   devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{National critical infrastructures (e.g., electricity, water,
   transportation, etc.) form large complex systems that sustain essential
   living functions. During large emergencies (earthquakes, tsunamis,
   floods, etc.) multiple critical systems suffer damage and the normal
   recovery processes of individual infrastructures are not sufficient to
   bring back the combined system of systems. Coordinated action among
   infrastructures is needed to make the combined system operational and
   save as many human lives as possible. The complexity of the combined
   system of systems and the uncertainties of the available data require an
   approach that limits the number of possible operational states and leads
   to robust real-time solutions. An optimum coordinated response needs to
   consider the interactions among the multiple layers of an effective
   disaster response: the physical layer of buildings, lifelines, and
   critical resources, the information and control layer, and the decision
   layer where choices are made as to the best responses. The solution
   framework discussed in this chapter provides a structure to capture
   these interactions.}},

   periodic structure, which is externally driven at one end with a
   harmonic force. We show that when the driving frequency is within the
   stopband of the periodic structure, there is a threshold for the driving
   amplitude, above which there is a sudden increase in the energy
   transmitted through the finite structure. This is a generic phenomenon
   for discrete nonlinear periodic systems. The onset of transmission is
   due to loss of stability of the harmonic solutions localized at the
   driven end of the structure. The transmission threshold is predicted
   analytically based on the underlying bifurcation. The influence of both
   hardening and softening types of nonlinearity on the transmission
   phenomenon is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{District heating (DH) systems are commonly used in urban areas to
   distribute thermal energy from central heat sources. Buried pipes, with
   a composite cross-sectional construction, are used transport a heated
   medium, usually water. These pipes expand and contract radially and
   axially due to changing water temperatures, invoking soil-pipe
   interaction situations during operation, and potentially leading to
   significant pipeline material strains. A series of full-scale tests were
   undertaken to specifically investigate the influence of thermal
   expansion on axial pullout resistance using DH pipes buried in sand in a
   full-scale soil-pipe interaction test chamber During testing, the pipe
   is filled with water that is subjected to temperature changes to
   simulate field conditions. Axial pipe pull-out tests were conducted
   after applying a given ``heating history{''} with axial pullout force
   and displacements recorded. The work leads to better understanding of
   soil pipe interaction mechanisms generating currently scarce data needed
   for robust and cost-effective designs of DH pipe systems.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of bicarbonate ion (HCO3) concentration and related
   environmental parameters such as pH and temperature on the passivation
   of API-X100 pipeline steel is the focus of this investigation. NS4
   solution simulating groundwater trapped under disbonded coatings at
   regions where near-neutral stress corrosion cracking (SCC) occurs was
   used as a reference. Bicarbonate content in the solutions was increased
   steadily and the critical HCO3 concentration at which passivation
   becomes evident is found using potentiodynamic polarization sweeps.
   Multi-step dissolution is observed especially in higher pH solutions,
   owing to the involvement of hydroxide ions (OH) in the adsorption of
   hydrous Fe(OH)(2). Dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS)
   is used to study and compare interfacial processes in active, pre
   passive, passive, and trans-passive regions. The results of the
   potentiodynamic and DEIS tests achieve good agreement.
   The protective properties of the passive film formed at three different
   HCO3- concentrations (critical passivation and two higher
   concentrations) and temperatures (25, 50, and 75 degrees C) are studied.
   The combined effect of HCO3 and temperature resulted in a pH range from
   6.7 to 9.3 for the nine conditions in the corresponding test matrix.
   Passive films were formed at a suitable anodic potential and then
   studied with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
   Mott-Schottky, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. Evidence of adsorption
   and diffusion, in addition to significant resistance from the passive
   film, is observed and accounted for in the equivalent circuit, which
   achieved good correspondence when fitted.with the experimental data. The
   protective properties of the overall passive film are enhanced with
   increased bicarbonate and decreased temperature. Positive slopes in the
   Mott-Schottky plots reveal the n-type semi-conductive behavior of the
   passive films in all conditions and the CV results highlight the
   proposed reaction sequences occurring in different potential scan
   regions. CV measurements also confirm the enhanced protective properties
   of passive films with increased bicarbonate and lower temperatures
   observed in the EIS analysis.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art linepipe steels are microalloyed low-carbon steels that
   combine high strength and fracture toughness with good weldability.
   During welding of pipe sections the heat affected zone (HAZ) experiences
   rapid thermal cycles resulting in a graded microstructure that can be
   significantly different from that of the base metal. In particular a
   variety of bainitic microstructures can form in the HAZ. Depending on
   the type of bainite mechanical properties may be improved or may lead to
   poor fracture resistance and be detrimental to the overall HAZ
   performance. Optical microscopy is not sufficient to differentiate
   bainitic morphologies which vary with the transformation temperature.
   The investigated X80 linepipe steel also contains retained austenite at
   room temperature. Based on the retained austenite it is possible to
   characterize the orientation relationship (OR) between austenite and the
   transformation products. It is found that bainite shows an orientation
   relationship near Kurdjumov-Sachs with the prior austenite. Variant
   selection is related to the driving force for the bainite reaction and
   hence depends on the transformation temperature. In the current study
   Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD) mapping is used to characterize
   transformation products based on their orientation relationship. This
   approach offers a quantitative way to determine volume fractions of
   different types of bainite in complex HAZ microstructures which is
   necessary to establish structure-property relationships of the HAZ.}},

Abstract = {{Geotechnical hazards can be a major cause of damage to pipelines,
   particularly as a result of unacceptable strains induced in buried
   pipelines due to permanent ground deformations. The common design
   philosophy in reducing soil restraint involves taking measures to
   effectively isolate the pipeline from the anticipated surrounding soil
   movements. One of the important engineering design considerations in
   this regard is the selection of suitable trench backfill material(s).
   Full-scale model tests have revealed that, in addition to the internal
   friction angle, coarseness of the backfill material is also an important
   parameter in controlling the lateral soil restraints on the pipes due to
   ground movements. It can be demonstrated that discrete element approach
   is suitable to study the effect of particle size on lateral soil loads
   of buried pipelines subjected to ground movement. This paper describes
   the outcome from DEM numerical modeling of the response of buried
   pipelines subjected to lateral ground movements, with a comparison of

Abstract = {{We describe the design of a PC-to-FPGA data streaming platform that
   enables hardware acceleration of gigabyte scale input data.
   Specifically, the acceleration is an FPGA implementation of the Dialign
   Algorithm, which performs both global and local alignment of query
   biological sequences against relatively larger reference strands of
   biological sequences. Earlier implementations of this algorithm could
   not be scaled to handle gigabyte-length reference sequences, nor
   megabyte-length query sequences, due to the inherent limitations of
   available memory and logic on single-FPGA platforms. We solve these
   issues via the design of an Ethernet channel to stream the reference
   sequence, and describe the novel use of SATA based Solid State Drives
   (SSDs) to time multiplex the FPGA logic into handling larger query
   sequences as well. In doing so, this paper also presents a general
   method to achieve gigabyte-depth FIFOs on commercially available FPGA
   development boards. This benefits data-intensive acceleration even
   outside of the bioinformatics application domain. Through the
   development of our acceleration logic and careful coupling of the
   required IO peripherals, we have successfully demonstrated a processing
   time of 28.61 minutes for a 200 base-pair query-sequence aligned against
   a 1 GB reference-sequence, a rate that is limited only by SATA 2 SDD
   write speeds. The present runtime offers a 38x speedup (18.36 hours down
   to 28.61 minutes) compared to standalone PC based processing.}},

Abstract = {{Binary Content Addressable Memories (BCAMs) are massively parallel
   search engines capable of searching the entire memory space in a single
   clock cycle. BCAMs are used in a wide range of applications, such as
   memory management, networks, data compression, DSP, and databases. Due
   to the increasing amount of processed information, modern BCAM
   applications demand a deep searching space. However, traditional BCAM
   approaches in FPGAs suffer from storage inefficiency. In this paper, a
   novel and efficient technique for constructing deep and narrow BCAMs out
   of standard SRAM blocks in FPGAs is proposed. This technique is most
   efficient for deep and narrow CAMs since the BRAM consumption is
   exponential to pattern width. Using Altera's Stratix V device,
   traditional methods achieve up to 64K-entry BCAM while the proposed
   technique achieves up to 4M entries. For the 64K-entry test-case,
   traditional methods consume 43 times more ALMs and achieves only
   one-third of the Fmax. A fully parameterized Verilog implementation is
   available(1). This implementation has been extensively tested using
   Altera's tools.}},

Abstract = {{System provisioning, resource allocation, and system configuration
   decisions for I/O-intensive workflow applications are complex even for
   expert users. Users face choices at multiple levels: allocating
   resources to individual sub-systems (e.g., the application layer, the
   storage layer) and configuring each of these optimally (e.g.,
   replication level, chunk size, caching policies in case of storage) all
   having a large impact on overall application performance. This paper
   presents our progress on addressing the problem of supporting these
   provisioning, allocation and configuration decisions for workflow
   applications. To enable selecting a good choice in a reasonable time, we
   propose an approach that accelerates the exploration of the
   configuration space based on a low-cost performance predictor that
   estimates total execution time of a workflow application in a given
   setup. Our evaluation shows that: (i) the predictor is effective in
   identifying the desired system configuration, (ii) it can scale to model
   a workflow application run on an entire cluster, while (iii) using over
   2000x less resources (machines x time) than running the actual
   application.}},

Abstract = {{It is not well understood how co-feeding of coal and biomass influences
   the reaction kinetics of gasification and pyrolysis. Co-pyrolysis of
   biomass and fossil fuels is investigated in this paper. After fuel
   characterization, the influences of temperature on the physical and
   chemical properties of char produced from biomass and non-biomass fuels
   were investigated, and the kinetics of atmospheric-pressure pyrolysis in
   a nitrogen environment were determined. The results show that product
   physical properties, such as surface area, depend on the pyrolysis
   temperature. For individual fuels, pine sawdust char prepared at 750
   degrees C had the highest CO2 and N-2 uptake, while switchgrass had very
   low N-2 uptake, but high CO2 uptake. The surface area of the fluid coke
   decreased with increasing temperature, but was almost constant for coal.
   Co-pyrolysis in a thermogravimetric analyzer exhibited three stages.
   Devolatilization of the biomass and coal portions of blended samples
   occurred independently, i.e. without significant synergy. The
   Coats-Redfern method was used to analyze the kinetics of solid fuel
   pyrolysis, indicating that it can be described by multi-step reactions.
   The model was able to identify likely reaction mechanisms and activation
   energies of each pyrolysis stage, giving predictions consistent with the
   experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Steam gasification of biomass integrated with CO2 capture in a dual
   fluidized bed with carbon sequestration is among the promising
   technologies being developed for sustainable production of hydrogen. A
   simple steady state model which considers two coupled reactors, one
   calcining limestone particles, while the other steam gasifies biomass
   and simultaneously carbonates the lime sorbent, is developed in this
   paper. A stoichiometric equilibrium model is applied for biomass
   gasification, with enhancement of CO2 removal by carbonation and
   incomplete conversion of sorbent particles due to kinetic limitations,
   mixing of the solids and loss of sorbent reactivity because of
   sintering. To optimize the overall performance of the process,
   sensitivity analyses are preformed over the most important design and
   operational parameters. Model predictions are compared with available
   data from the literature, showing the influence of CO2 capture on
   gasification. A parametric study reveals the effects of key process
   variables such as temperature, pressure and solids circulation rate. The
   model is useful in identifying design and operating conditions for
   integrated gasification and carbon capture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are malignant cells shed into the
   bloodstream from a tumor that have the potential to establish metastases
   in different anatomical sites. The separation and subsequent
   characterization of these cells is emerging as an important tool for
   both biomarker discovery and the elucidation of mechanisms of
   metastasis. Established methods for separating CTCs rely on biochemical
   markers of epithelial cells that are known to be unreliable because of
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which reduces expression for
   epithelial markers. Emerging label-free separation methods based on the
   biophysical and biomechanical properties of CTCs have the potential to
   address this key shortcoming and present greater flexibility in the
   subsequent characterization of these cells. In this review we first
   present what is known about the biophysical and biomechanical properties
   of CTCs from historical studies and recent research. We then review
   biophysical label-free technologies that have been developed for CTC
   separation, including techniques based on filtration, hydrodynamic
   chromatography, and dielectrophoresis. Finally, we evaluate these
   separation methods and discuss requirements for subsequent

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{578-587}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effects of temperature, pressure, dissolved carbon dioxide and shear
   rate on the rheological response of bitumen are investigated by using
   the reduced variable method at the temperature range of -10 degrees C to
   180 degrees C and pressures up to 15 MPa. A state of the art pressure
   cell set-up was utilized with a stress/strain controlled rheometer (
   Anton-Paar, MCR-501) to collect the experimental data on the Athabasca
   bitumen-CO2 mixture. The double-log model is found to be the most
   accurate equation in describing the effect of temperature on the
   viscosity of bitumen over a wide range of temperature while the Barus
   model with the temperature-dependent parameter is found to be the most
   appropriate correlation to represent the effect of pressure. Excluding
   the effect of overhead pressure, the Fujita-Kishimato equation,
   resulting from the free volume concept modelling, is employed to account
   for the effect of dissolved CO2 on the viscosity of the bitumen-CO2
   mixture more precisely. Moreover, a psuedoplastic model with a
   zero-shear viscosity is more rational to consider the effect of shear
   rate on the flow properties of the bituminous mixtures. The experimental
   conditions are carefully considered to avoid introducing flow
   instabilities into the mixture. It is demonstrated that the rheological
   properties of bitumen are more sensitive to the variables at lower
   temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the influence of the inlet gas-liquid mixture
   non-uniformity on the performance of the TEB-type effervescent nozzle.
   The flow conditions studied are chosen to be relevant to industrial
   Fluid Coking operations. The investigation is limited to radial and
   vertical non-uniformities and conducted numerically by applying the
   mathematical model previously developed by the authors. The
   comprehensive mathematical model includes the liquid continuous flow
   through the variable cross-section nozzle, atomization, and spray
   dispersion. To quantify the inlet non-homogeneity, a new criterion
   related to the slope of the volume fraction inlet profile is proposed
   and utilized in the analysis. The simulations of a number of cases
   demonstrate that the inlet mixture radial non-uniformity does not
   produce substantial variations in the nozzle performance in terms of the
   spray quality. At the same time, the vertical non-uniformity can have a
   significant influence on the spray provided it is sufficiently strong.
   Further analysis reveals that the first convergent section of the TEB
   nozzle generates turbulence to facilitate phase mixing as the flow moves
   through the following divergent section. While this turbulence is
   sufficient for the flow with any radial non-uniformity and considered
   range of the inlet droplet diameter to completely eliminate the
   influence of the inlet conditions, it is not enough for the flow with
   moderate to strong degree of vertical non-uniformity. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an application of the switching gainscheduled
   control technique to the flexible ball-screw drive servo system with a
   wide range of operating conditions. The wide operating range is caused
   by the change of the table position and the workpiece mass during the
   machining operation, and leads to plant dynamics variations. To achieve
   high tracking performance of the table position against the dynamics
   variations and the cutting force disturbance, a set of gain-scheduled
   controllers is designed so that each controller damps out the resonance
   of the ball-screw system and increases the closed-loop bandwidth for a
   local operating range, and tracking performance is guaranteed under the
   switching between these controllers. Experimental results with a
   laboratory-scale ball-screw drive setup demonstrate that the switching
   gain-scheduled controller outperforms the nonswitching one by up to 52\%
   in tracking accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel mixed conduction mode (MCM) digital
   controller with a digital signal processor (DSP)-based discontinuous
   conduction mode (DCM) detection technique to realize total harmonic
   distortion (THD) and power factor improvements in boost power factor
   correction (PFC) converters operating in both continuous conduction mode
   (CCM) and DCM during a single ac line half-cycle. By using the
   integrated comparators found on many DSPs, simplification and
   cost-reductions over existing DCM and zero-current detection methods are
   made possible. Additionally, performance improvements over a
   conventional CCM digital control technique are possible with simple
   software modification, and can be extended to existing boost PFC
   converter designs provided a compatible DSP is present. At an output
   power of 98 W, an experimental 650 W boost PFC converter operating in
   the MCM controlled by a TMS320F28035 provides a THD reduction of 40.2\%
   and power factor improvement of 1.5\% over a conventional digital

Abstract = {{Mathematical relationships have been developed for reaeration rate
   coefficient (K-a) by various researchers. These relationships have a
   number of variables such as depth, velocity, width, slope, Froud number,
   molecular diffusion coefficient, kinematic viscosity and the
   gas-transfer Reynolds number. From these variables, 29 relations have
   been developed and divided into four groups. To evaluate their
   predictive capability for highly variable flow rivers receiving high
   pollution loads form large cities, these relationships have been used to
   model dissolved oxygen (DO) in the River Ravi. Such rivers are either
   saturated with DO during high flows or anaerobic during critical
   low-flow conditions. The evaluation is based on the agreement between
   model DO values calculated using K-a obtained from the available
   equations and the measured DO concentrations in the river samples in
   terms of sum of square of residuals (SSR) and coefficient of
   determination (R-2). It has been found that in general, the group of
   equations containing depth and velocity as the only two variables
   affecting K-a performed better than the equations in other groups as
   reflected by lower SSR and higher R-2 values. The study results also
   reveal that the turbulence-based reaeration rate coefficient equation
   containing additional variables also resulted in close agreement between
   DO model results and the measured values. The study results identify the
   most important parameters affecting the reaeration rate coefficient and
   the suitability of various K-a relationships as well for rivers with
   highly variable flows. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Consider wireless local area network (WLAN) service providers (SPs)
   operating in an overlapping service area. The SPs compete with each
   other to attract users. The price charged is utilised by the SPs as a
   tool to maximise revenue, resulting in a price competition between the
   WLAN SPs. The users are assumed to be selfish, trying to maximise their
   individual utility. They have varied sensitivity towards quality of
   service experienced and the price charged. In such a scenario, the user
   demand distribution is the one that achieves Wardrop equilibrium.
   Approximate analytical expressions are obtained for the best response of
   SPs to each other's price. Existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) between
   the competing SPs is proved and the price vector at which the NE occurs
   is obtained. It is found that, while in one extreme monopoly leads to
   very high revenue for WLAN SPs with minimal consumer surplus, in the
   other extreme unregulated duopoly/oligopoly leads to high consumer
   surplus at the cost of minimal revenue generation for the competing SPs.
   Thus, price regulation is proposed in the WLAN market for equitable
   distribution of the surplus among the SPs and the users.}},

Abstract = {{Calcite microbialites in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia, exhibit a
   diverse range in macro-morphology, biomass abundance, porosity, and
   mineral content To evaluate the role of microorganisms in their
   formation, samples collected from a range of depths were examined by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and synchrotron radiation-based
   micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) spectroscopy to characterize both
   their outer surfaces as well as internal structures. Observed trends in
   both surface colonization as well as microbialite framework with
   increasing lake depth include decreasing microbial abundance on outer
   surfaces as well as increasing ratios of carbonate :biomass in the
   microbialites. Microscopic investigations of the interiors show bacteria
   and algae entrapped within calcite, with this calate exhibiting
   micropores and casts similar in size and shape to microorganisms. Based
   on these observations, it is hypothesized that microbialite development
   in Pavilion Lake initiates calcite precipitation in phototrophic
   microbial mats, i.e., combined phototrophy and heterotrophy, followed by
   heterotrophic oxidation of organic matter leading to eventual carbonate
   infilling of the microbial-mineral matrix. In addition, an observed
   shift from cyanobacteria to algae with increasing lake depth suggests
   variability in contemporary conditions controlling microbialite growth
   and diagenesis. High photosynthetic growth rates at shallower depths
   result in significant porosity and friability due to biomass
   accumulation outpacing carbonate precipitation. At intermediate depths,
   lower light levels and slower growth rates of phototrophs lead to a
   greater proportion of the microbialite matrix being in-filled by
   carbonate. Carbonates precipitate initially within the bacteria-EPS
   matrix, with abundant uncalcified algae maintaining microbialite
   porosity. In the deepest waters, the presence of only sparse algal
   colonization as well as fine-grained, laminated metal-rich sediments
   covering microbialites suggests that present-day insolation levels are
   too low to support the development of photosynthetic microbial mats. As
   a consequence, heterotrophic carbonate precipitation has progressively
   in-filled these microbialite interiors to create lithified calcite
   fabrics that exhibit minimal porosity but preserve the casts of
   microorganisms as biosignatures. While the origin of microbialites in
   Pavilion Lake remains unknown, current observations provide valuable
   information in evaluating how environmental conditions influence
   microbialite growth in a freshwater, lacustrine environment Published by

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{407-414}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Phyto-sterols and extractives found in pulp mill effluents are suspected
   to cause endocrine abnormalities in receiving water fish. The control of
   sterols in pulp mill effluents through biological secondary wastewater
   treatment was studied using two lab-scale bioreactor systems. After
   achieving a stable performance, both bioreactor systems successfully
   removed (>90\%) sterols and the estimated biodegradation was up to 80\%.
   Reactor 1 system operating at 6.7 +/- 0.2 pH effectively treated pulp
   mill effluent sterols spiked up to 4500 mu g/L in 11 h HRT and 11 day
   SRT. However, Reactor 2 system operating at 7.6 +/- 0.2 pH performed
   relatively poorly. Retention time reductions beyond critical values
   deteriorated the performance of treatment systems and quickly reduced
   the sterols biodegradation. The biodegradation loss was indicated by
   mixed liquor sterols content that started increasing. This
   biodegradation loss was compensated by the increased role of
   bio-adsorption and the overall sterols removal remained relatively high.
   Hence, a relatively small (20-30\%) loss in the overall sterols removal
   efficiency did not fully reflect the associated major (60-70\%) loss in
   the sterols biodegradation because the amount of sterols accumulated in
   the sludge due to adsorption increased so the estimate of sterols
   removal through adsorption increased from 30-40\% to 70-80\% keeping the
   overall sterols removal still high. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Abstract = {{Periodic density functional theory calculations are performed to
   investigate the nature of the BH4ad and its interaction with H2Oad in
   the presence of homogenous electric field. We observed a significant
   charge polarity of BH4ad on Os(111) and such property could explain the
   electrostatic interaction with water monomer (Had) with its HOH plane
   parallel to the surface. This interaction changes the BHad molecular
   structure to BH3ad + H-ad. In the presence of homogenous electric field,
   the water co-adsorption effect is reduced due to the stabilization of
   H2Oad on the surface and the deviation of the O-H bond from the plane,
   decreasing the electrostatic interaction between BH4ad and H2Oad. These
   fundamental findings imply accessible control of borohydride structures
   on an electrode surface, which could be relevant for direct borohydride
   fuel cell (DBFC) and reversible hydrogen storage/release applications.

Title = {{Surface shear stress and membrane fouling when considering natural water

Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{330}},
Pages = {{22-27}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The effect of surface shear stress on membrane fouling during submerged
   hollow fiber ultrafiltration of three different surface waters ( two
   lakes, one river) was investigated. Surface shear stresses that mimicked
   those induced when applying continuous and intermittent coarse bubble
   air sparging, large pulse bubble air sparging, as well as no air
   sparging were considered. The results suggest that fouling was mainly
   due to the accumulation of the biopolymer fraction of the natural
   organic matter present in the raw water. Inducing shear stresses onto
   the membrane surface significantly decreased the rate of membrane
   fouling (relative to no shear stress applied) in all waters tested. Of
   the shear stress conditions studied, that which mimicked large pulse
   bubble sparging had the greatest effect, reducing fouling by up to 80\%
   when compared to conditions with no sparging applied. Conditions that
   mimicked intermittent and continuous coarse bubble fouling reduced the
   rate of fouling by up to 77 and 49\%, respectively. These results
   suggest that the shear stresses induced by sparging can promote back
   transport of soluble organic material from the membrane surface. A
   semi-empirical relationship was developed to estimate the effect of raw
   water characteristics and applied sparging conditions on membrane
   fouling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mineralogical characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a high
   throughput automated quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning
   electron microscopy (QEMSCAN) was conducted on samples from a
   sulphate-reducing biochemical reactor (BCR) treating high concentrations
   of metals (As, Zn, Cu) in smelter waste landfill seepage. The samples
   were also subjected to energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of
   specific particles. The bulk analysis results revealed that the samples
   consisted mainly of silicate and carbonate minerals. More detailed phase
   analysis indicated four different classes: zinc-arsenic
   sulphosalts/sulphates, zinc-arsenic oxides, zinc phosphates and
   zinc-lead sulphosalts/sulphates. This suggests that sulphates and
   sulphides are the predominant types of Zn and As minerals formed in the
   BCR. Sphalerite (ZnS) was a common mineral observed in many of the
   samples. In addition, X-ray point analysis showed evidence of As and Zn
   coating around feldspar and amphibole particles. The presence of
   arsenic-zinc-iron, with or without cadmium particles, indicated
   arsenopyrite minerals. Copper-iron-sulphide particles suggested
   chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and tennantite (Cu, Fe)(12)As4S13. Microbial
   communities found in each sample were correlated with metal content to
   describe taxonomic groups associated with high-metal samples. The
   research results highlight mineral grains that were present or formed at
   the site that might be the predominant forms of immobilized arsenic,
   zinc and copper.}},

Abstract = {{Patient nonadherence with therapy is a major barrier to rehabilitation.
   Recovery is often limited and requires prolonged, intensive
   rehabilitation that is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult. We
   review evidence for the potential use of video games in rehabilitation
   with respect to the behavioral, physiological, and motivational effects
   of gameplay. In this Special Interest article, we offer a method to
   evaluate effects of video game play on motor learning and their
   potential to increase patient engagement with therapy, particularly
   commercial games that can be interfaced with adapted control systems. We
   take the novel approach of integrating research across game design,
   motor learning, neurophysiology changes, and rehabilitation science to
   provide criteria by which therapists can assist patients in choosing
   games appropriate for rehabilitation. Research suggests that video games
   are beneficial for cognitive and motor skill learning in both
   rehabilitation science and experimental studies with healthy subjects.
   Physiological data suggest that gameplay can induce neuroplastic
   reorganization that leads to long-term retention and transfer of skill;
   however, more clinical research in this area is needed. There is
   interdisciplinary evidence suggesting that key factors in game design,
   including choice, reward, and goals, lead to increased motivation and
   engagement. We maintain that video game play could be an effective
   supplement to traditional therapy. Motion controllers can be used to
   practice rehabilitation-relevant movements, and well-designed game
   mechanics can augment patient engagement and motivation in
   rehabilitation. We recommend future research and development exploring
   rehabilitation-relevant motions to control games and increase time in
   therapy through gameplay.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticipated environmental
   benefits from integrating a dairy farm and a greenhouse; the integration
   is based on anaerobic digestion of manures to produce biogas energy,

   has been conducted on six modeled cases applicable in British Columbia,
   to evaluate non-renewable energy consumption, climate change,
   acidification, eutrophication, respiratory effects and human toxicity.
   Compared to conventional practice, an integrated system has the
   potential to nearly halve eutrophication and respiratory effects caused
   by inorganic emissions and to reduce non-renewable energy consumption,
   climate change, and acidification by 65-90\%, while respiratory effects
   caused by organic emissions become negative as co-products substitute
   for other materials. Co-digestion of other livestock manures, greenhouse
   plant waste, or food and food processing waste with dairy manure can
   further improve the performance of the integrated system. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of optimal bit and power allocation in
   linear periodically time varying (LPTV) channels in broadband (BB) power
   line communication (PLC). Previous work has demonstrated that
   improvements in bit loading can be achieved with LPTV channel adaptation
   via so-called microslots in time for an orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) system. In this paper, we present that the
   application of a power constraint that is averaged over many microslots
   can be exploited for further performance improvements through loading.
   Due to the matroid structure of the optimization problem, greedy-type
   algorithms are proven to be optimal for the new LPTV-aware bit and power
   loading. Significant gains are attained especially at reduced
   transmit-power levels, where the energy per bit-transmission is also
   low, and for poor (i.e. high attenuation) channel conditions.
   Furthermore, two mechanisms are utilized to reduce the complexity of the
   optimal LPTV-aware bit loading and peak microslot power levels: (i)
   employing representative values from microslot transfer functions, and
   (ii) power clipping. Our results indicate that the reduced complexity
   LPTV-aware bit loading with power clipping performs very close to the
   optimal LPTV-aware bit loading, which makes it an attractive option in a
   practical setting.}},

Abstract = {{Power line communications (PLC) has attracted considerable attention for
   supporting smart grid applications. Since it reuses the existing grid
   infrastructure, it offers cost advantages over alternative
   communications methods and gives electric utilities control over the
   communications medium. Furthermore, the ``through-the-grid{''} property
   of PLC extends its possible use beyond mere communications. Since the
   PLC signals are bound to travel through the power grid, they can also be
   used for inference tasks, such as online diagnostics of power line
   integrity. In this paper, we consider such an inference application of
   PLC, enabled by modern signal processing. We assume a power grid at
   whose edges PLC devices are deployed to form a PLC network for purposes
   such as advanced meter reading. We are interested in retrieving the
   physical power-grid topology, i.e., the connections and lengths of power
   lines reaching to the locations of the PLC devices. To this end, we
   propose the combination of PLC-based ranging with inference based on
   end-to-end measurements. In the context of communication networks, the
   latter is known as tomography and hence, we refer to the developed
   method as power grid tomography. For the purpose of ranging we formulate
   a new super-resolution ranging algorithm specifically tailored for
   signal propagation through power lines. Numerical results for
   low-voltage distribution grid examples demonstrate the successful
   reconstruction of the grid topology by the proposed power grid
   tomography method.}},

Abstract = {{Because global landfills are filling at a fast rate with waste that can
   potentially be recycled, it is now time for the development and
   implementation of sustainable materials in construction. This article
   investigates the properties of a new generation concrete containing
   fiber reinforced polymer (FRP), fiber scrap aggregate (FSA), and
   recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). Although previous research has been
   undertaken for the use of RCA in concrete, the use of FSA is a new
   research area and has been found in this study to have exciting
   potential. Through different replacements of these aggregates in the
   concrete, both individually and in combination, conclusive test results
   were produced. The results indicate that both the fresh and hardened RCA
   concrete properties were similar to those of the control concrete
   containing only natural aggregate. In the case of fresh properties, the
   RCA concrete experienced slightly lower slump than the control concrete.
   The FSA concrete had a lower compressive strength than the control
   concrete; however, it produced sufficient strength for nonstructural
   applications. The results determined for FSA and RCA concrete were
   better than expected and illustrate the potential for concretes be used
   for nonstructural and structural applications. The results found for the
   combination batches indicate that both their fresh and hardened
   properties produce values between the individual RCA and FSA concrete
   batches that were mixed and tested. The conclusions drawn from this
   research will hopefully encourage further development of new sustainable
   materials in the construction industry. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider a point-to-point communication link where the
   transmitter has a hybrid supply of energy. Specifically, the hybrid
   energy is supplied by a constant energy source and an energy harvester,
   which harvests energy from its surrounding environment and stores it in
   a battery which suffers from energy leakage. Our goal is to minimize the
   power consumed by the constant energy source for transmission of a given
   amount of data in a given number of time intervals. Two scenarios are
   considered for packet arrival. In the first scenario, we assume that all
   data packets have arrived before transmission begins, whereas in the
   second scenario, we assume that data packets are arriving during the
   course of data transmission. For both scenarios, we propose an optimal
   offline transmit power allocation scheme which provides insight into how
   to efficiently consume the energy supplied by the constant energy source
   and the energy harvester. For offline power allocation, we assume that
   causal and non-causal information regarding the channel and the amount
   of harvested energy is available a priori. For optimal online power
   allocation, we adopt a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) approach for
   both considered scenarios. For online power allocation, only causal
   information regarding the channel and the amount of harvested energy is
   assumed available. Due to the inherent high complexity of DP, we propose
   suboptimal online algorithms which are appealing because of their low
   complexity. Simulation results reveal that the offline scheme performs
   best among all considered schemes and the suboptimal online scheme
   provides a good performance-complexity tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{Cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) is known to
   be effective in meeting the different channel access ratio (CAR)
   requirements of users in a multi-user wireless system. In this paper, we
   propose a one-bit-feedback scheme for CS (OBCS) to reduce the feedback
   overhead from users in a cell. In OBCS, each user sets its individual
   threshold to decide whether to send one-bit feedback to the base station
   (BS). The BS randomly generates numbers for all users based on their
   feedback behavior and selects a user who is assigned with the largest
   value. We further propose OBCS with reduced complexity, OBCS-RC, which
   employs a universal threshold for all users, and relieves the BS to
   generate random numbers only for the users who have sent feedback. Both
   OBCS and OBCS-RC inherit the properties of CS in meeting diverse CAR
   requirements of users in arbitrary fading channels. Extensive analytical
   and simulation results indicate that simply setting the OBCS-RC
   threshold to 0.1 is adequate for good throughput performance compared to
   OBCS with the optimal threshold for each user. Although OBCS and OBCS-RC
   induce a throughput loss due to the reduced feedback overhead, their
   throughput still grows in a double-logarithmic manner as CS in
   Nakagami-m channels when the number of users increases to infinity.}},

Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1406-1418}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rotational hardening is a constitutive feature of anisotropic clay
   plasticity models that allows rotation of the yield and plastic
   potential surfaces in stress space in order to simulate, more
   realistically than isotropic models, the material response under various
   loading conditions. The anatomy of some well-known rotational hardening
   rules, as well as a novel proposition with certain advantages, is
   performed in relation to the following characteristics: (a) the
   conditions under which rotational hardening yields a unique critical
   state line in e-p space; (b) the restrictions on model parameters
   necessary to prevent excessive and unrealistic rotation of the yield and
   plastic potential surfaces; and (c) the analytical description of the
   response of rotational hardening to loading at constant stress and
   strain-rate ratios, including K-0 consolidation, and to undrained
   shearing. The anatomy will reveal strong and weak features, and
   corrections for the latter are proposed. Special attention is given to
   calibration of the rotational hardening rules parameters based on easily
   available experimental data, such as the K-0 value. Simulations of
   experimental data under drained and undrained loading after isotropic
   and K-0 consolidation at various OCRs for associative and
   non-associative flow rules illustrate the simulative capabilities of the
   rotational hardening rules considered.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present explicit operators needed for the solution of

   solve a variety of laminated plate problems with high accuracy. For the
   first time we present explicit relations for the evaluation of the

   degrees, 90 degrees, 0 degrees) stacking sequence while considering a
   wide range of ratios between the material properties of the layers. The
   operators needed for other cases are presented. The explicit EBFs and

Abstract = {{Characterising the mechanical properties of human facial skin is a
   challenging but important endeavour with applications in biomedicine,
   surgery simulation, forensics, and animation. Many existing computer
   models of the face are not based on in vivo facial skin deformation data
   but rather on experiments using in vitro facial skin or other soft
   tissues. The facial skin of five volunteers was subjected to a rich set
   of deformations using a micro-robotic device. The force-displacement
   response was recorded for each deformation. All volunteers' facial skin
   exhibited a non-linear, anisotropic, and viscoelastic forcedisplacement
   response. We propose a finite element model that simulated the
   experimental deformations with error-of-fits ranging from 11\% to 23\%.
   The skin was represented by an Ogden strain energy function and a
   quasi-linear viscoelastic law. From non-linear optimisation procedures,
   we determined material parameters and in vivo pre-stresses for the
   central cheek area of five volunteers and five other facial points on
   one volunteer. Pre-stresses ranged from 15.9 kPa to 89.4 kPa. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal and management is one of the most
   significant challenges faced by urban communities around the world.
   Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) over the years has utilized many
   sophisticated technologies and smart strategies. Municipalities
   worldwide have pursued numerous initiatives to reduce the environmental
   burden of the MSW treatment strategies. One of the most beneficial MSWM
   strategies is the thermal treatment or energy recovery to obtain cleaner
   renewable energy from waste. Among many waste-to-energy strategies,
   refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is a solid recovered fuel that can be used as
   a substitute for conventional fossil fuel. The scope of this study is to
   investigate the feasibility of RDF production with MSW generated in
   Metro Vancouver, for co-processing in two cement kilns in the region.
   This study investigates environmental impacts and benefits and economic
   costs and profits of RDF production. In addition, RDF utilization as an
   alternative fuel in cement kilns has been assessed. Cement manufacturing
   has been selected as one of the most environmentally challenged
   industries and as a potential destination for RDF to replace a portion
   of conventional fossil fuels with less energy-intensive fuel. A
   comprehensive environmental assessment is conducted using a life cycle
   assessment (LCA) approach. In addition, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has
   been carried out to study the economic factors. This research confirmed
   that RDF production and use in cement kilns can be environmentally and
   economically viable solution for Metro Vancouver. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Circadian Variation of Heart Rate Variability Across Sleep Stages}},
Journal = {{SLEEP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1919-1928}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Nocturnal cardiovascular events are more frequent at
   the beginning and end of the night. It was proposed that this pattern
   reflects the nocturnal distribution of sleep and sleep stages. Using
   heart rate variability (HRV), we recently showed an interaction between
   the circadian system and vigilance states on the regulation of cardiac
   rhythmicity. Here, we further investigate this interaction in order to
   clarify the specific effects of sleep stages on the regulation of the
   heart.
   Design: Participants underwent a 72-h ultradian sleep-wake cycle
   procedure in time isolation consisting of alternating 60-min wake
   episodes in dim light and 60-min nap opportunities in total darkness.
   Setting: Time isolation suite.
   Patients or participants: Fifteen healthy young participants; two were
   subsequently excluded.
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: The current study revealed that sleep onset
   and progression to deeper sleep stages was associated with a shift
   toward greater parasympathetic modulation, whereas rapid eye movement
   (REM) sleep was associated with a shift toward greater sympathetic
   modulation. We found a circadian rhythm of heart rate (HR) and
   high-frequency power during wakefulness and all non-REM sleep stages. A
   significant circadian rhythm of HR and sympathovagal balance of the
   heart was also observed during REM sleep. During slow wave sleep,
   maximal parasympathetic modulation was observed at similar to 02:00,
   whereas during REM sleep, maximal sympathetic modulation occurred in the
   early morning.
   Conclusion: The circadian and sleep stage-specific effects on heart rate
   variability are clinically relevant and contribute to the understanding
   of the degree of cardiovascular vulnerability during sleep.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the integration of a probing scheme into a robust
   MPC-based robot motion planning and control algorithm. The proposed
   solution tackles the output-feedback tube-based MPC problem using the
   partially-closed loop strategy to incorporate future measurements in a
   computationally efficient manner. This combination will provide not only
   a robust controller but also avoids overly conservative planning which
   is a drawback of the original implementation of the output-feedback
   tube-based MPC. The proposed solution is composed of two controllers:
   (i) a nominal MPC controller with probing feature to plan a globally
   convergent trajectory in conjunction with active localization, and (ii)
   an ancillary MPC controller to stabilize the robot motion around the
   planned trajectory. The performance and real-time implementation of the
   proposed planning and control algorithms have been verified through both
   extensive numerical simulations and experiments with a mobile robot. (C)

Abstract = {{The behaviour of steel column at elevated temperature is significantly
   different than that at ambient temperature due to its changes in the
   mechanical properties with temperature. Reported literature suggests
   that steel column may become vulnerable when exposed to fire condition,
   since its strength and capacity decrease rapidly with temperature. The
   present study aims at investigating the lateral load resistance of
   non-insulated steel columns under fire exposure through finite element
   analysis. The studied parameters include moment-rotation behaviour,
   lateral load-deflection behaviour, stiffness and ductility of columns at
   different axial load levels. It was observed that when the temperature
   of the column was increased, there was a significant reduction in the
   lateral load and moment capacity of the non-insulated steel columns.
   Moreover, it was noted that the stiffness and ductility of steel columns
   decreased sharply with the increase in temperature, especially for
   temperatures above 400 degrees C. In addition, the lateral load capacity
   and the moment capacity of columns were plotted against fire exposure
   time, which revealed that in fire conditions, the non-insulated steel
   columns experience substantial reduction in lateral load resistance
   within 15 minutes of fire exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Today, North American governments are more willing to consider compact
   neighborhoods with increased use of sustainable transportation modes.
   Bicycling, one of the most effective modes for short trips with
   distances less than 5 km is being encouraged. However, as vulnerable
   road users (VRUs), cyclists are more likely to be injured when involved
   in collisions. In order to create a safe road environment for them,
   evaluating cyclists' road safety at a macro level in a proactive way is
   necessary. In this paper, different generalized linear regression
   methods for collision prediction model (CPM) development are reviewed
   and previous studies on micro-level and macro-level bicycle-related CPMs
   are summarized. On the basis of insights gained in the exploration
   stage, this paper also reports on efforts to develop negative binomial
   models for bicycle-auto collisions at a community-based, macro-level.
   Data came from the Central Okanagan Regional District (CORD), of British
   Columbia, Canada. The model results revealed two types of statistical
   associations between collisions and each explanatory variable: (1) An
   increase in bicycle-auto collisions is associated with an increase in
   total lane kilometers (TLKM), bicycle lane kilometers (BLKM), bus stops
   (BS), traffic signals (SIG), intersection density (INTD), and
   arterial-local intersection percentage (IALP). (2) A decrease in bicycle
   collisions was found to be associated with an increase in the number of
   drive commuters (DRIVE), and in the percentage of drive commuters (DRP).
   These results support our hypothesis that in North America, with its
   current low levels of bicycle use (<4\%), we can initially expect to see
   an increase in bicycle collisions as cycle mode share increases.
   However, as bicycle mode share increases beyond some unknown `critical'
   level, our hypothesis also predicts a net safety improvement. To test
   this hypothesis and to further explore the statistical relationships
   between bicycle mode split and overall road safety, future research
   needs to pursue further development and application of community-based,
   macro-level CPMs. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Interfacing of ac electrical machine models in power system transient
   simulation programs is receiving increasing attention in the literature.
   Models based on the voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) formulation have been
   recently proposed to achieve a direct interface with external power
   networks. However, the rotor-position-dependent interfacing inductances
   due to dynamic saliency in synchronous machine models increase the
   computational cost of the overall system solution and limit the
   application of most VBR formulations. This paper presents new methods
   for elimination of dynamic saliency using continuous-and discrete-time
   approximation techniques to achieve explicit formulations. The proposed
   models have simple interfacing circuit consisting of decoupled
   constant-parameter RL branches. The new models are implemented in
   MATLAB/Simulink and the PLECS toolbox, and are shown to offer simple and
   easy-to-use interface, high accuracy, and numerical efficiency as
   compared to the existing models. The proposed models can find wide
   application in common state-variable-based transient simulation
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the electrochemical behavior of Pd(II) in nitric acid
   media was investigated using various electrochemical techniques. By
   analyzing the cyclic voltammogram of Pd(II) recorded at Pt electrode, a
   series of electrochemical reactions associated with palladium were
   recognized, indicating that Pd(II) undergoes a single step two-electrons
   irreversible process. Electroreduction reaction of Pd(II) and
   auto-catalytic reactions of nitrous acid are supposed to play a leading
   role in low and high concentrations of nitric acid, respectively.
   Stirring could facilitate the reduction of Pd(II) in relatively low
   nitric acid concentration (<= 3 mol/L). The value of charge transfer
   coefficient was determined to be 0.18 for the measurements at 298 K. The
   diffusion coefficient of Pd(II) increased from 1.89 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s at
   288 K to 4.23 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s at 318 K, and the activation energy was
   calculated to be 21.5 kJ/mol. In electrowinning experiments, SEM images
   of palladium obtained by electrolysis reveal the dendrite growth in all
   cases, which is uniform all over the entire surface of Pt electrode. The
   recovery ratios of Pd at different nitric acid concentrations are high,
   and the faradic efficiency of electrolysis decreases with increasing the
   nitric acid concentration. When stirring was introduced during
   electrolysis, the electrodeposition rate of Pd increased substantially.}},

Title = {{Curl-Based Finite Element Reconstruction of the Shear Modulus Without

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In elasticity imaging, the shear modulus is obtained from measured
   tissue displacement data by solving an inverse problem based on the wave
   equation describing the tissue motion. In most inversion approaches, the
   wave equation is simplified using local homogeneity and
   incompressibility assumptions. This causes a loss of accuracy and
   therefore imaging artifacts in the resulting elasticity images. In this
   paper we present a new curl-based finite element method inversion
   technique that does not rely upon these simplifying assumptions. As done
   in previous research, we use the curl operator to eliminate the
   dilatational term in the wave equation, but we do not make the
   assumption of local homogeneity. We evaluate our approach using
   simulation data from a virtual tissue phantom assuming time harmonic
   motion and linear, isotropic, elastic behavior of the tissue. We show
   that our reconstruction results are superior to those obtained using
   previous curl-based methods with homogeneity assumption. We also show
   that with our approach, in the 2-D case, multi-frequency measurements
   provide better results than single-frequency measurements. Experimental
   results from magnetic resonance elastography of a CIRS elastography
   phantom confirm our simulation results and further demonstrate, in a
   quantitative and repeatable manner, that our method is accurate and
   robust.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a visual attention servo control (VASC) method which
   uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for task-specific applications of
   mobile robots. In particular, low dimensional bias feature template is
   obtained using GMM to get an efficient attention process. An image-based
   visual servo (IBVS) controller is used to search for a desired object in
   a scene through an attention system which forms a task-specific state
   representation of the environment. First, task definition and object
   representation in semantic memory (SM) are proposed, and bias feature
   template is obtained using GMM deduction for features from high
   dimension to low dimension. Second, the features intensity, color, size
   and orientation are extracted to build the feature set. Mean shift
   method is used to segment the visual scene into discrete proto-objects.
   Given a task-specific object, top-down bias attention is evaluated to
   generate the saliency map by combining with the bottom-up saliency-based
   attention. Third, a visual attention servo controller is developed to
   integrate the IBVS controller and the attention system for robotic
   cognitive control. A rule-based arbitrator is proposed to switch between
   the episodic memory (EM)-based controller and the IBVS controller
   depending on whether the robot obtains the desired attention point on
   the image. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on task-specific
   object detection under different conditions and visual attention servo
   tasks. The obtained results validate the applicability and usefulness of
   the developed method for robotics.}},

Abstract = {{Animal-borne instruments provide researchers with valuable data to
   address important questions on wildlife ecology and conservation.
   However, these devices have known impacts on animal behaviour and
   energetics. Tags deployed on migrating animals may reduce reproductive
   output through increased energy demands or cause phenological mismatches
   of foraging and nesting events. For marine organisms, the only tagging
   guidelines that exist are based on lift and thrust impacts on birds -
   concepts that do not translate well to aquatic animals. Herein, we
   provide guidelines on assessing drag from animal-borne instruments and
   discuss the ecological impacts on marine organisms. Of particular
   concern is the effect of drag from instruments to the welfare of the
   animals and for the applicability of collected data to wild populations.
   To help understand how drag from electronic tags affects marine animals
   in the wild, we used marine turtles as model aquatic organisms and
   conducted wind tunnel experiments to measure the fluid drag of various
   marine turtle body types with and without commercially available
   electronic tags (e.g. satellite, TDR, video cameras). We quantified the
   drag associated with carrying biotelemetry devices of varying frontal
   area and design (squared or tear drop shaped) and generated contour
   plots depicting percentage drag increase as a framework for evaluating
   tag drag by scientists and wildlife managers. Then, using concepts of
   fluid dynamics, we derived a universal equation estimating drag impacts
   from instruments across marine taxa. The drag of the marine turtle casts
   was measured in wind speeds from 2 to 30ms(-1) (Re 30x10(4)-19x10(6)),
   equivalent to 01-19ms(-1) in seawater. The drag coefficient (C-D) of the
   marine turtles ranged from 011 to 022, which is typical of other large,
   air-breathing, marine vertebrates (008-026). The C-D of tags in
   reference to the turtle casts was 091018 and most tags caused minimal
   additional drag (<5\%) to adult animals, but the same devices increased
   the drag for juveniles significantly (>100\%). The sensitivity of
   aquatic animals to instrument drag is a dynamic relationship between the
   fluid flow patterns, or C-D, and the frontal area ratio of the animal
   and tag. In this paper, we have outlined methods for quantifying the
   drag costs from animal-borne instrumentation considering the instrument
   retention time (time to release from the animal) and the activity of the
   instrumented animal. With this valuable tool, researchers can quantify
   the drag costs from animal-borne instrumentation and choose appropriate
   tags for their intended study organism and question. Reducing drag will
   ultimately reduce the impact on the instrumented animals and lead to
   greater biological realism in the collected data.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling of CMOS technology has greatly influenced the design of
   analog and radio-frequency circuits. In particular, as technology
   advances, due to the use of lower supply voltage the available voltage
   headroom is decreased. In this paper, after a brief overview of
   conventional low-power CMOS active mixer structures, we introduce an
   active mixer structure with sub-mW-level power consumption that is
   capable of operating from a supply voltage comparable or lower than the
   threshold voltage of the transistor. In addition, the proposed
   architecture provides a performance and conversion gain (CG) that
   compares favorably or exceeds those of the state-of-the-art designs. As
   a proof-of-concept, a wide-band DC to 8.5 GHz down-conversion mixer is
   designed and fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS process. Measurement results
   show that the mixer achieves a CG as high as 18 dB while consuming 98 mu
   W from a 0.3-V supply.}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic performance assessment requires the development of
   probability distributions that can predict different performance levels
   of structures with reasonable accuracy. This study evaluates the
   performance of a non-seismically designed multi-column bridge bent
   retrofitted with four different alternatives, and based on their
   performance under an ensemble of earthquake records it proposes accurate
   prediction models and distribution fits for different performance
   criteria as a case study. Here, finite element methods have been
   implemented where each retrofitting technique has been modeled and
   numerically validated with the experimental results. Different
   statistical distributions are employed to represent the variation in the
   considered performance criteria for the retrofitted bridge bents. The
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test was carried out to compare
   different distributions and find the suitable distribution for each
   performance criteria. An important conclusion drawn here is that the
   yield displacement of CFRP, steel, and ECC jacketed bridge bents are
   best described by a gamma distribution. The crushing displacement and
   crushing base shear of all four retrofitted bent follow a normal and
   Weibull distribution, respectively. A probabilistic model is developed
   to approximate the seismic performance of retrofitted bridge bents.
   These probabilistic models and response functions developed in this
   study allow for the performance prediction of retrofitted bridge bents.}},

Abstract = {{Soft clay deposits are highly plastic, normally consolidated fine
   grained soils characterized by their low inherent shear strength. The
   mixing of soft clays with cement as a chemical stabilizer has become a
   well-known stabilization technique. The resulting strength of the
   clay-cement mix is controlled by different factors, but mainly the water
   to cement ratio, the cement content, and the curing conditions. It is
   crucial to develop a clear understanding of the changes in engineering
   behavior of the clay-cement mix that result from changes in controlling
   factors. A phase diagram was established to define the initial
   conditions of the mass-volume relationships of air, cement, clay, and
   water of a typical clay-cement mix. This phase diagram was then used to
   determine the total dry density, void ratio, and specific gravity of the
   clay-cement mix as a function of the cement content and water to cement
   ratio. The main objective of this work was to develop generalized trends
   for the geotechnical properties of clay-cement mixes. These trends were
   evaluated based on unconfined compressive strength as well as
   consistency tests carried out on soft clay samples before and after
   mixing with cement and at different curing times. A reduction in the
   plasticity index (PI) of 16 \% and an increase in the unconfined shear
   strength of more than 200 kPa were obtained from the addition of 15 \%
   cement. The reduction in the PI of the clay-cement mix was found to be
   an efficient tool to represent the improvement in the strength of the
   clay after mixing with cement.}},

Abstract = {{Cell shape changes drive tissue morphogenesis during animal development.
   An important example is the apical cell constriction that initiates
   tissue internalisation. Apical constriction can occur through a phase of
   cyclic assembly and disassembly of apicomedial actomyosin networks,
   followed by stabilisation of these networks. Delayed negative-feedback
   mechanisms typically underlie cyclic behaviour, but the mechanisms
   regulating cyclic actomyosin networks remain obscure, as do mechanisms
   that transform overall network behaviour. Here, we show that a known
   inhibitor of apicomedial actomyosin networks in Drosophila amnioserosa
   cells, the Par-6-aPKC complex, is recruited to the apicomedial domain by
   actomyosin networks during dorsal closure of the embryo. This finding
   establishes an actomyosin-aPKC negative-feedback loop in the system.
   Additionally, we find that aPKC recruits Bazooka to the apicomedial
   domain, and phosphorylates Bazooka for a dynamic interaction.
   Remarkably, stabilising aPKC-Bazooka interactions can inhibit the
   antagonism of actomyosin by aPKC, suggesting that Bazooka acts as an
   aPKC inhibitor, and providing a possible mechanism for delaying the
   actomyosin-aPKC negative-feedback loop. Our data also implicate an
   increasing degree of Par-6-aPKC-Bazooka interactions as dorsal closure
   progresses, potentially explaining a developmental transition in
   actomyosin behaviour from cyclic to persistent networks. This later
   impact of aPKC inhibition is supported by mathematical modelling of the
   system. Overall, this work illustrates how shifting chemical signals can
   tune actomyosin network behaviour during development.}},

Abstract = {{The use of unconventional arterial intersection designs (UAIDs) has been
   advocated as a novel solution that can efficiently enhance the
   operational and safety performance of at-grade signalised intersections.
   Several studies suggest that UAIDs can lead to higher capacity, lower
   delays and fewer crashes. As well, these non-traditional' designs are
   cost-effective as only minor geometric modifications are usually
   required. In recent years, there has been considerable valuable research
   work undertaken to discuss methods for analysing the operational and
   safety performance of UAIDs. Nevertheless, these studies are sparse and
   no collective effort is currently available to identify the basic
   principles of the analysis of UAIDs and to determine gaps within the
   current methods. This article presents an in-depth literature review of
   existing methods of analysing the operational and the safety performance
   of unconventional intersection designs. These methods differ in
   principle issues, such as objective and scope, and in technical issues,
   such as experimental design, analysis tools and evaluation measures.
   Based on the reviewed methods, areas that need further research and
   improvements are identified.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{119-132}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Typical five-axis machine tools have three translational and two rotary
   drives. This paper presents a generalized kinematics model that allows
   automatic configurations of all five-axis machine tools using screw
   theory. First, each kinematic element is modelled as a revolute joint,
   prismatic joint, workpiece or cutting tool. The kinematic elements are
   mathematically assembled through screw theory by using the base
   coordinate system. The general inverse kinematics solutions for both
   rotary and translational motions are evaluated. The singularities in
   five axis contouring are avoided by deforming splined tool orientation
   vectors. The tool orientation vectors are represented by a fifth degree
   B-spline curve in a quaternion space, while the movement of tool tip is
   represented by a fifth degree B-spline curve in the Cartesian space.
   Both splines, which form the C-3 continuous tool path, are fitted to
   curve length parameter of the tool tip positions. If the tool path
   traverses the singular area of the machine, it is deformed by modifying
   the control points of the tool orientation spline in the quaternion
   space while respecting the machining tolerance. The proposed kinematics
   module, tool path generation algorithm and method for avoiding kinematic
   singularities are experimentally verified on a five-axis machine tool
   controlled by an in-house developed CNC system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A new method for laboratory testing of human proximal femora in
   conditions simulating a sideways fall was developed. Additionally, in
   order to analyze the strain state in future cadaveric tests, digital
   image correlation (DIC) was validated as a tool for strain field
   measurement on the bone of the femoral neck. A fall simulator which
   included models for the body mass, combined lateral femur and pelvis
   mass, pelvis stiffness, and trochanteric soft tissue was designed. The
   characteristics of each element were derived and developed based on
   human data from the literature. The simulator was verified by loading a
   state-of-the-art surrogate femur and comparing the resulting force-time
   trace to published, human volunteer experiments. To validate the DIC, 20
   human proximal femora were prepared with a strain rosette and speckle
   paint pattern, and loaded to 50\% of their predicted failure load at a
   low compression rate. Strain rosettes were taken as the gold standard,
   and minimum principal strains from the DIC and the rosettes were
   compared using descriptive statistics. The initial slope of the
   force-time curve obtained in the fall simulator matched published human
   volunteer data, with local peaks superimposed in the model due to
   internal vibrations of the spring used to model the pelvis stiffness.
   Global force magnitude and temporal characteristics were within 2\% of
   published volunteer experiments. The DIC minimum principal strains were
   found to be accurate to 1276239 le. These tools will allow more
   biofidelic laboratory simulation of falls to the side, and more detailed

Abstract = {{The contamination of groundwater with arsenic is a serious health issue
   in many parts of the world. Although iron has been shown to be effective
   at removal of arsenic from water, there has been no research to assess
   the feasibility of using natural iron oxide minerals for water
   treatment. The successful treatment of water to remove arsenic requires
   an understanding of arsenic chemistry and the physical-chemical
   interactions between arsenic and iron oxide minerals. A study was
   conducted to evaluate hematite, magnetite, goethite and iron rich
   laterite soil as arsenic adsorbents. Electroacoustic measurements were
   conducted to assess the nature of arsenic adsorption. Results showed
   that arsenic adsorption occurred over the entire pH range tested (pH
   4-11). The isoelectric point shifted due to arsenic adsorption and this
   is a strong evidence of specific ion adsorption. This was supported by
   leaching tests that indicated strong attachment of arsenic to the
   surface of iron oxide minerals. Adsorption tests showed that iron rich
   laterite was most effective for arsenic removal, followed by goethite,
   magnetite and hematite. This was attributed to the higher specific
   surface area of the respective minerals. The study also demonstrates a
   simple water treatment method involving the use of low cost natural
   ironoxide minerals for arsenic removal to meet drinking water standards.
   Treatment of 100 mL of water containing 20 ppm arsenic with 5 g of
   laterite reduced the arsenic level down to 10 ppb within a period of 10

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional atomistic Kinetic Monte Carlo (aKMC) model was
   developed and used to study the interaction between mobile solutes and a
   migrating interface. While the model was developed with a simplified
   energetic and topological description, it was also constructed to
   capture, in the absence of solute, the Burke-Turnbull model for
   interface migration and, in the presence of solutes, solute segregation
   to different types of interface sites. After parameterizing the model,
   simulations were performed to study the relationship between average
   interface velocity and imposed driving pressure for varying solute
   concentration and solute diffusivity. Despite significant differences in
   the underlying assumptions of numerical and analytical solute drag
   models, the latter was found to be a phenomenological tool that
   adequately captures the trends observed by the aKMC simulations (e.g.
   the effect of solute concentration on solute drag pressure). One trend
   that could not be adequately explained was the observed dependence of
   maximum drag pressure on solute diffusivity. This effect is attributed
   to the coupling between the structure of a migrating interface and the
   ability for solute to remain segregated to the interface.}},

   ultimate concrete strength (low strength with f(c)(1)<50 MPa and high
   strength with f(c)(1)<50 MPa), span-depth ratio (shallow beam with a/d
   >= 2.5 and deep beam with a/d<2.5) and steel fiber shape (plain, crimped
   and hooked). Principal component and multiple regression analyses were
   performed to determine the most feasible model in predicting the shear
   strength of SFRC beams. A variety of statistical analyses were
   conducted, and compared with those of the existing equations in
   estimating the shear strength of SFRC beams. The results showed that the

Abstract = {{In this paper, the time-optimal feedrate planning problem under confined
   feedrate, axis velocity, axis acceleration, axis jerk, and axis tracking
   error for a high-order CNC servo system is studied. The problem is
   useful in that the full ability of the CNC machine is used to enhance
   the machining productivity while keeping the machining precision under a
   given level. However, the problem is computationally challenging. The
   main contribution of this paper is to approximate the problem nicely by
   a finite-state convex optimization problem which can be solved
   efficiently. The method consists of two key ingredients. First, a
   relationship between the tracking error and the input signal in a
   high-order CNC servo system is established. As a consequence, the
   tracking error constraint is reduced to a constraint on the kinematic
   quantities. Second, a novel method is introduced to relax the nonlinear
   constraints on kinematic quantities to linear ones. Experimental results
   are used to validate the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{182}},

Abstract = {{A simple sal gel synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate multimodal
   porous carbon (MPC) with hierarchical nanoarchitectures, in which
   monodisperse polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) spheres self-assemble
   themselves into an ordered lattice while the meso-sized silica particles
   generated in situ through basecatalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl
   orthosilicate aggregate closely at the interstices between the PSS
   spheres. Removal of the PSS lattice by calcination leaves a
   three-dimensional interconnected ordered macroporous structure, the
   walls of which are composed of a templated aggregate of the small silica
   particles, leading to a bimodal porous silica (BPS) template with open
   mesopores at the interstices between the small silica particles. This
   synthesis route allows one to readily fabricate BPS with a tailored
   three-dimensional ordered nanostructure, which can be further converted
   to MPC through the inverse replication. The MPC not only possesses
   ultrahigh surface area (i.e., 2220 m(2)/g), but also a unique
   hierarchical porosities composed of macro-, meso-, and micropores, which
   enable MPC to store and release large electrical charges rapidly whether
   at a low-mid or high rate. The well-developed 3D interconnected ordered
   macropore framework with open mesopores embedded in the macropore walls
   favors fast mass transport at high charge/discharge rates, providing
   better electric double layer capacitor performance. Compared with
   commonly used electrode material carbon black Pearls 2000 and other
   nanostructured carbons such as CMK-1 and CMK-3, the MPC has demonstrated
   much higher specific capacitance and energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A two-phase computational fluid dynamics model of the low-pressure
   die-cast process for the production of A356 aluminum alloy wheels has
   been developed to predict the flow conditions during die filling. The
   filling model represents a 36-deg section of a production wheel, and was
   developed within the commercial finite-volume package, ANSYS CFX,
   assuming isothermal conditions. To fully understand the behavior of the
   free surface, a novel technique was developed to approximate the vent
   resistances as they impact on the development of a backpressure within
   the die cavity. The filling model was first validated against
   experimental data, and then was used to investigate the effects of
   venting conditions and pressure curves during die filling. It was found
   that vent resistance and vent location strongly affected die filling
   time, free surface topography, and air entrainment for a given pressure
   fill-curve. With regard to the pressure curve, the model revealed a
   strong relation between the pressure curve and the flow behavior in the
   hub, which is an area prone to defect formation. (C) The Minerals,

Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{540-547}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In large-scale power systems, classical centralized control approaches
   may fail due to geographically distribution of information and
   decentralized controllers result in sub-optimal solution for
   load-frequency control (LFC) problems. In this paper, a two-level
   structure is presented to obtain optimal solution for LFC problems and
   also reduce the computational complexity of centralized controllers. In
   this approach, an interconnected multi-area power system is decomposed
   into several sub-systems (areas) at the first-level. Then an
   optimization problem in each area is solved separately, with respect to
   its local information and interaction signals coming from other areas.
   At the second-level, by updating the interaction signals and using an
   iterative procedure, the local controllers will converge to the overall
   optimal solution. By parallel solving of areas, the computational time
   of the algorithm is reduced in contrast to centralized controllers. This
   approach is applicable to any interconnected large-scale power system.
   However, for simulation purposes, a three-are power system is presented
   to show advantages and optimality of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We consider a broadcast channel in which the base station is equipped
   with multiple antennas and each user has a single antenna, and we study
   the design of transceivers based on Tomlinson-Harashima precoders with
   probabilistic quality of service (QoS) requirements for each user, in
   scenarios with uncertain channel state information (CSI) at the
   transmitter. Each user's QoS requirement is specified as a constraint on
   the maximum allowed outage probability of the receiver's mean square
   error (MSE) with respect to a specified target MSE, and we demonstrate
   that these outage constraints are associated with constraints on the
   outage of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR).
   We consider four different stochastic models for the channel
   uncertainty, and we design the downlink transceiver so as to minimize
   the total transmitted power subject to the satisfaction of the
   probabilistic QoS constraints. We present three conservative approaches
   to solving the resulting chance constrained optimization problems. These
   approaches are based on efficiently solvable deterministic convex design
   formulations that guarantee the satisfaction of the probabilistic QoS
   constraints. We also demonstrate how to apply these approaches in order
   to obtain computationally efficient solutions to some related design
   problems. Our simulations indicate that the proposed methods can
   significantly expand the range of QoS requirements that can be satisfied
   in the presence of uncertainty in the CSI. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel zero-voltage switching full-bridge converter with
   trailing edge pulse width modulation and capacitive output filter is
   presented. The target application for this study is the second stage
   dc-dc converter in a two stage 1.65 kW on-board charger for a plug-in
   hybrid electric vehicle. For this application the design objective is to
   achieve high efficiency and low cost in order to minimize the charger
   size, charging time, and the amount and the cost of electricity drawn
   from the utility. A detailed converter operation analysis is presented
   along with simulation and experimental results. In comparison to a
   benchmark full-bridge with an LC output filter, the proposed converter
   reduces the reverse recovery losses in the secondary rectifier diodes,
   therefore, enabling a converter switching frequency of 100 kHz.
   Experimental results are presented for a prototype unit converting 400 V
   from the input dc link to an output voltage range of 200-450 V dc at
   1650 W. The prototype achieves a peak efficiency of 95.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{Hexavalent chromium is mobile and hazardous in the environment.
   Electrokinetic remediation of chromium (IV)-contaminated soils is
   intended either to remove or to reduce Cr (VI) to Cr (III). This study
   examines the effectiveness of utilizing EDTA and acetic acid solutions
   as alternative electrolytes in the electrokinetic (EK) process, with
   coupled nano-scale zero-valent iron (nZVI) as a barrier for the
   remediation of Cr (VI)-contaminated clay. An nZVI barrier was installed
   adjacent to the anode, and different electrolyte solutions (0.1 M EDTA
   and 1 M acetic acid) were used to investigate the effect of both on the
   electrokinetic remediation efficiency. Soil was contaminated to 300 ppm
   of Cr (IV), and a constant DC voltage gradient of 1 V/cm was applied to
   the soil sample for 72 h. It was found that an nZVI permeable reactive
   barrier (PRB) could improve the Cr (VI) remediation efficiency and
   reduce electrical energy consumption. Results also showed that acetic
   acid as electrolyte promoted the reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr (III), while
   EDTA application as electrolyte led to more chromium removal and
   reduction than an EK-nZVI barrier.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{358}},
Pages = {{114-120}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{We simulated decomposition of structure I methane hydrate (H) with all
   cages filled in contact with two reservoirs (pools) of liquid water (W)
   which in turn are in contact with either two methane gas reservoirs (G),
   or with vacuum (V), under constant volume-constant energy conditions. By
   adding gas or empty spaces to the simulation box we allow the released
   methane to diffuse out of the liquid phase and into the gas phase
   similar to what happens during methane hydrate dissociation. The
   evolution of the released methane molecules during the hydrate
   dissociation process was carefully monitored. We found that some of the
   released methane gas reaches the gas phase and contributes to the
   increase of gas pressure on the hydrate phase. As the hydrate
   dissociates, liquid water phase becomes supersaturated with methane,
   methane molecules aggregate, and spherical regions of high concentration
   of methane form which we identify as ``nano-bubbles{''}. These
   nano-bubbles grew to a specific size range which depends on simulation
   conditions and remained stable in the liquid phase for the duration of
   the simulations (5 ns). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The exposure and toxicological data used in human health risk assessment
   are obtained from diverse and heterogeneous sources. Complex mixtures
   found on contaminated sites can pose a significant challenge to
   effectively assess the toxicity potential of the combined chemical
   exposure and to manage the associated risks. A data fusion framework has
   been proposed to integrate data from disparate sources to estimate
   potential risk for various public health issues. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed data fusion framework, an illustrative
   example for a hydrocarbon mixture is presented.
   The Joint Directors of Laboratories Data Fusion architecture was
   selected as the data fusion architecture and Dempster-Shafer Theory
   (DST) was chosen as the technique for data fusion. For neurotoxicity
   response analysis, neurotoxic metabolites toxicological data were fused
   with predictive toxicological data and then probability-boxes (p-boxes)
   were developed to represent the toxicity of each compound. The
   neurotoxic response was given a rating of ``low{''}, ``medium{''} or
   ``high{''}. These responses were then weighted by the percent
   composition in the illustrative F1 hydrocarbon mixture. The resulting
   p-boxes were fused according to DST's mixture rule of combination. The
   fused p-boxes were fused again with toxicity data for n-hexane.
   The case study for F1 hydrocarbons illustrates how data fusion can help
   in the assessment of the health effects for complex mixtures with
   limited available data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Sustainable nitrate-contaminated water treatment using multi cycle

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{539-544}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability of ion-exchange treatment processes using high
   capacity single use resins to remove nitrate from contaminated drinking
   water can be achieved by regenerating the exhausted resin and reusing it
   multiple times. In this study, multi cycle loading and bioregeneration
   of tributylamine strong base anion (SBA) exchange resin was studied.
   After each cycle of exhaustion, biological regeneration of the resin was
   performed using a salt-tolerant, nitrate-perchlorate-reducing culture
   for 48 h. The resin was enclosed in a membrane to avoid direct contact
   of the resin with the culture. The results show that the culture was
   capable of regenerating the resin and allowing the resin to be used in
   multiple cycles. The concentrations of nitrate in the samples reached a
   peak in first 0.5-1 h after placing the resin in medium because of
   desorption of nitrate from resin with desorption rate of 0.099 +/- 0.003
   hr(-1). After this time, since microorganisms began to degrade the
   nitrate in the aqueous phase, the nitrate concentration was generally
   non-detectable after 10 h. The average of calculated specific
   degradation rate of nitrate was -0.015 mg NO3-/mg VSS h.
   Applying 6 cycles of resin exhaustion/regeneration shows resin can be
   used for 4 cycles without a loss of capacity, after 6 cycles only 6\% of
   the capacity was lost. This is the first published research to examine
   the direct regeneration of a resin enclosed in a membrane, to allow
   reuse without any disinfection or cleaning procedures. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Rollover crashes are dynamic and complex events in which head impacts
   with the roof can cause catastrophic neck injuries. Ex vivo and
   computational models are valuable in understanding, and ultimately
   preventing, these injuries. Although neck posture and muscle activity
   influence the resulting injury, there is currently no in vivo data
   describing these parameters immediately prior to a head-first impact.
   The specific objectives of this study were to determine the in vivo neck
   vertebral alignment and muscle activation levels when upside down, a
   condition that occurs during a rollover. Eleven human subjects (6F, 5M)
   were tested while seated upright and inverted in a custom-built
   apparatus. Vertebral alignment was measured using fluoroscopy and muscle
   activity was recorded using surface and indwelling electrodes in eight
   superficial and deep neck muscles. In vivo vertebral alignment and
   muscle activation levels differed between the upright and inverted
   conditions. When inverted and relaxed, the neck was more lordotic, Cl
   was aligned posterior to C7, the Frankfort plane was extended, and the
   activity of six muscles increased compared to upright and relaxed. When
   inverted subjects were asked to look forward to eliminate head
   extension, flexor muscle activity increased, C7 was more flexed, and Cl
   was aligned anterior to C7 versus upright and relaxed. Combined with the
   large inter-subject variability observed, these findings indicate that
   cadaveric or computational models designed to study injuries and
   prevention devices while inverted need to consider a variety of postures
   and muscle conditions to be relevant to the in vivo situation. (C) 2013

Title = {{A fuzzy-based approach for characterization of uncertainties in emergy
   synthesis: an example of paved road system}},

Abstract = {{Emergy synthesis is capable of quantifying environmental resources and
   services, as well as economic and human services, that are used up
   directly or indirectly to make a product available. However, a
   controversial aspect of emergy synthesis is the lack of research
   characterizing and documenting uncertainties in the emergy evaluation
   process. Uncertainty can arise from analysis of numerous components and
   flows in a complex environmental system. The reliability of emergy
   synthesis results may be undermined by both the inherent uncertainty of
   emergy parameters and models, and by a lack of knowledge regarding the
   certainty of resulting outputs. This paper explores the utility of
   fuzzy-based methods in emergy synthesis. Applying fuzzy set theory
   facilitates the gradual assessment of Unit Emergy Values (UEVs) as a set
   of possible UEVs. In other words, uncertainty of UEVs is described with
   the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval {[}0,
   1]. The proposed fuzzy-based emergy synthesis has been applied for Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a transportation infrastructure system. A
   paved road, with different pavement options (i.e. asphalt and concrete),
   has been selected as a case study to highlight the impacts of
   propagation of different sources of uncertainties in the emergy
   evaluation process and decision making. Results indicate that
   fuzzy-based modeling can provide better insight for both emergy and LCA
   practitioners. The developed methodology provides transparency that
   should be an integral part of an emergy-based decision making process.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{8-14}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Inhibition of bubble coalescence is of fundamental importance in a
   flotation process because it determines the size of bubbles and foam
   stability. For this work commercial frothers have been selected, MIBC,
   DF-250, DF-400 and DF-1012; and NaCl as inorganic electrolyte. Surface
   tension measurements used to characterize the tested frothers revealed
   that these frothers have quite different properties. Polypropylene
   glycols are much more surface active than MIBC. The differences between
   these two are further augmented in concentrated NaCl electrolyte
   solutions. The concept of the surface tension switch point (s.t.s.p.) is
   introduced to characterize the effect of electrolyte concentration on
   frother properties. The s.t.s.p. values for MIBC and DF-250 were
   determined to be around 120 ppm and 12 ppm, respectively. The effect of
   MIBC and DF-250 frothers on bubble coalescence was not very different,
   although finer bubbles were generated in the presence of MIBC than of
   DF-250 in seawater. Only dynamics foamability measurements (DFI)
   confirmed the differences, the foams produced in the presence of DF-250
   were much more stable, also in electrolyte solutions. This fact confirms
   the importance of dynamic effects in foam formation and stabilization.

Title = {{A role of flocculant chain flexibility in flocculation of fine quartz.
   Part I. Intrinsic viscosities of polyacrylamide-based flocculants}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{50-57}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic viscosities of five commercial polyacrylamide-based
   flocculants were measured as a function of pH, temperature (25-50
   degrees C), and the degree of anionicity of the polymers (from nearly 0
   to almost 50\%). The tests were carried out in distilled water and in a
   dilute background electrolyte (0.01 mol/L sodium chloride). It was
   demonstrated that the raw viscosity data could accurately be described
   using the Fedors equation in order to obtain the intrinsic viscosity.
   Generally, the intrinsic viscosity increased with the degree of
   anionicity at any pH value although a plateau region was observed
   between degrees of anionicity of about 10\% and 30\%. It was also found
   that the ionic strength had a much more significant impact on the
   measured intrinsic viscosities than pH over the studied range of pH
   values (5.7-10.5). The results obtained in distilled water showed that
   temperature had a negligible effect on the intrinsic viscosity of any of
   the tested polymers, but a substantial decrease was observed at higher
   temperatures in the presence of sodium chloride for more anionic samples
   only. The data were discussed in terms of conformational changes of the
   flocculant chains. The background electrolyte primarily brought about
   coiling of the flocculant chains leading to a decrease in the intrinsic
   viscosity. It was also suggested that this main coiling effect promoted
   further intramolecular bonding for more anionic polymers at higher
   temperatures. An exceptional affinity of calcium ions towards anionic
   polyacrylamides was also demonstrated as even a small amount of calcium
   (0.001 mol/L) was sufficient to reduce the intrinsic viscosity to a
   value indicating a physical limit of coiling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Surgical patients present with a wide variety of body sizes
   and blood volumes, have large differences in baseline volume status, and
   may exhibit significant differences in cardiac function. Any closed-loop
   fluid administration system must be robust against these differences. In
   the current study, we tested the stability and robustness of the
   closed-loop fluid administration system against the confounders of body
   size, starting volume status, and cardiac contractility using control
   engineering methodology.
   METHODS: Using an independently developed previously published
   hemodynamic simulation model that includes blood volumes and cardiac
   contractility, we ran a Monte-Carlo simulation series with variation in
   starting blood volume and body weight (phase 1, weight 35-100 kg), and
   starting blood volume and cardiac contractility (phase 2, contractility
   from 1500 {[}severe heart failure] to 6000 {[}hyperdynamic]). The
   performance of the controller in resuscitating to the target set point
   was evaluated in terms of milliliters of blood volume error from
   optimal, with <250 mL of error defined as ``successful.{''}
   RESULTS: One thousand simulations were run for each of the 2 phases of
   the study. The phase 1 mean blood volume error +/- SD from optimal was
   25 +/- 59 mL. The phase 2 mean blood volume error from optimal was -60
   +/- 89 mL. The lower 95\% Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence interval
   for resuscitation to within 250 mL of optimal blood volume for phase 1
   and 2 was 99.6\% and 97.1\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the controller is highly effective
   in targeting optimal blood and stroke volumes, regardless of weight,
   contractility or starting blood volume.}},

Abstract = {{It is challenging to design effective scheduling algorithms for
   multimedia transmissions over wireless channels that employ adaptive
   modulation and coding (AMC). On the one hand, it is desirable for the
   overall system throughput to be enhanced by taking advantage of
   multi-user diversity. On the other hand, fairness or QoS guarantees need
   to be maintained for individual users, especially in the case of
   multimedia applications that have strict delay requirements. In this
   paper, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm called QoS-based
   cross-layer scheduling (QoS-CLS) to achieve a good design tradeoff. To
   maximize the system throughput, the algorithm takes into account the
   information on both the physical layer and the data link layer to
   schedule user transmissions. Using cross-layer information, the
   scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process and the
   optimal decision policy (based on the channel status, traffic state, and
   buffer status of each traffic flow) is pre-calculated by linear
   programming. This policy is then stored in the system for scheduling in
   real-time. Simulation results show that QoS-CLS can greatly enhance the
   channel throughput compared to existing algorithms because of its
   cross-layer QoS consideration and the optimization method. Moreover, it
   can provide QoS guarantees while achieving efficient resource sharing
   among different traffic flows.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges accumulated on wood particles through
   triboelectrification during their transportation and handling processes
   can cause hazardous electrical discharge which may further trigger dust
   explosion. In this work, tribo-charging behavior of different kinds of
   wood particles was investigated by a vibrating plate charging method. It
   was found that reduction in the work function difference between contact
   bodies might contribute to the reduction of tribo-charge generation,
   while the reduction of electrical resistivity of wood pellets could
   effectively accelerate the charge dissipation. As the particle size
   decreases, accumulated charges increase significantly. In contrast,
   higher moisture content of wood particles leads to lower charge
   accumulation due to an accelerated charge dissipation rate.
   Tribo-charging behaviors of white pellets, torrefied pellet, steam
   treated pellets and dark pellets have also been investigated. Compared
   to the white pellets, they all have shown a reduction on charge
   accumulation to some extent. However, results suggested that all of them

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an individualized approach to closed-loop control of
   depth of hypnosis during propofol anesthesia. The novelty of the paper
   lies in the individualization of the controller at the end of the
   induction phase of anesthesia, based on a patient model identified from
   the dose-response relationship during induction of anesthesia. The
   proposed approach is shown to be superior to administration of propofol
   based on population-based infusion schemes tailored to individual
   patients. This approach has the potential to outperform fully adaptive
   approaches in regards to controller robustness against measurement
   variability due to surgical stimulation. To streamline controller
   synthesis, two output filters were introduced (inverting the Hill
   dose-response model and the linear time-invariant sensor model), which
   yield a close-to-linear representation of the system dynamics when used
   with a compartmental patient model. These filters are especially useful
   during the induction phase of anesthesia in which a nonlinear
   dose-response relationship complicates the design of an appropriate
   controller. The proposed approach was evaluated in simulation on
   pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of 44 patients identified
   from real clinical data. A model of the NeuroSense, a hypnotic depth
   monitor based on wavelet analysis of EEG, was also included. This
   monitor is similar to the well-known BIS, but has linear time-invariant
   dynamics and does not introduce a delay. The proposed scheme was
   compared with a population-based controller, i.e. a controller only
   utilizing models based on demographic covariates for its tuning. On
   average, the proposed approach offered 25\% improvement in disturbance
   attenuation, measured as the integrated absolute error following a step
   disturbance. The corresponding standard deviation from the reference was
   also decreased by 25\%. Results are discussed and possible directions of
   future work are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A rack clad building (RCB) is a type of warehouse building system built
   using steel storage racks as the seismic force resisting system.
   Generally, these rack systems are larger and taller compared to the
   conventional steel storage racks commonly used in warehouses. These
   buildings have peripheral racks that can support the claddings. These
   rack systems possess some unique properties, such as the members built
   using thin-walled perforated steel sections and the beam-to-column
   connection utilizing a teardrop connector in the down-aisle direction.
   Due to the pinched-type hysteretic behavior of these connections, the
   structure shows unique behavior under lateral loading. To date, very
   little research has been carried out to determine the seismic
   performance of an RCB. Current building codes have no provisions for
   designing a RCB against seismic loading. This study presents a direct
   displacement-based design (DDBD) procedure for designing these
   structures in the down-aisle direction.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major worldwide healthcare problem.
   Despite promising outcomes from many preclinical studies, the failure of
   several clinical studies to identify effective therapeutic and
   pharmacological; approaches for TBI suggests that methods to improve the
   translational potential of preclinical studies are highly desirable.
   Rodent models of TBI are increasingly in demand for preclinical
   research, particularly for closed head injury (CHI), which mimics the
   most common type of TBI observed clinically. Although seemingly simple
   to establish, CHI models are particularly prone to experimental
   variability. Promisingly, bioengineering-oriented research has advanced
   our understanding of the nature of the mechanical forces and resulting
   head and brain motion during TBI. However, many neuroscience-oriented
   laboratories lack guidance with respect to fundamental biomechanical
   principles of TBI., Here, we review key historical and current
   literature that is relevant to the investigation of TBI from clinical,,
   physiological and biomechanical perspectives, and comment on how the
   current challenges associated with rodent TBI models, particularly those
   involving CHI, could be improved.}},

Abstract = {{The backward second harmonic generation (SHG) in mouse tissues is
   studied with a confocal multiphoton microscopy system. The total
   backward collected SHG (B-SHG) consists of the backward generated SHG
   and the backward-scattered forward-generated SHG (BS-SHG), which can be
   modeled by a Gaussian and a uniform distribution, respectively, at the
   confocal pinhole plane. By varying the pinhole size with a series of
   collection fibers, the proportion of the BS-SHG to the B-SHG and the
   proportion of BS-SHG to the forward generated SHG can be obtained. The
   approach is first validated by Monte Carlo simulation. It is then
   applied to two types of mouse tissues: mouse tail tendon and Achilles
   tendon. It is found that the BS-SHG contributes less to the B-SHG for
   the tail tendon than Achilles tendon with thicknesses of similar to 300
   mu m. With the thickness of the Achilles tendon tissue increased to 1000
   mu m but the focal plane kept at the same depth, as high as similar to
   10\% of the total forward SHG is backscattered and collected. The
   results indicate that BS-SHG may not be the major source of B-SHG in the
   tail tendon, but it may be the major source in the Achilles tendon.
   These methods and results provide a noninvasive method and supporting
   information for investigating the generation mechanism of SHG and help
   with optimizing backward SHG microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.

Abstract = {{The kinetic and thermodynamic effects of three typical low-dosage
   imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) on methane hydrate formation and
   dissociation were investigated, considering the anion nature and
   subcooling and/or overpressure driving forces. Isochoric hydrate
   formation and dissociation data were obtained by the modified slow
   step-heating method. ILs proved to have a dual effect on both formation
   and dissociation of methane hydrate including thermodynamic and kinetic
   inhibition. Kinetic modeling of methane hydrate inhibition by low-dosage
   ILs was performed. Kinetic analysis showed that IL inhibitors mainly
   cause a delay in the nucleation or hydrate growth step. The related
   inhibition mechanism was resolved regarding the ionic nature and
   electrostatic interactions of ILs with water molecules. Two binomial
   exponential kinetic relations were derived and used for simple methane
   hydrate formation in the presence of ILs as kinetic hydrate inhibitors.
   The proposed relations can serve for a quick estimation of the nature,
   extent, strength, and effectiveness of ILs on various gas hydrates.}},

Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{59-65}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted as part of the development of a novel process
   for copper recovery from chalcopyrite by chloride leaching, simultaneous
   cuprous oxidation and cupric solvent extraction to transfer copper to a
   conventional sulfate electrowinning circuit, and hematite precipitation
   to reject iron. Ferrous pressure oxidation and hematite precipitation
   from concentrated solutions of calcium, copper and iron chlorides have
   been studied with respect to temperature, retention time, seeding, and
   the behavior of the impurities. As the temperature increased from 140 to
   185 degrees C, the time for the complete oxidation of ferrous ions at an
   oxygen partial pressure of 310 kPa (45 psi) decreased from 17 to 9 min
   while the acid concentration increased from 0.02 to 0.1 M. At 140
   degrees C, the iron precipitate consisted of akaganeite with a small
   amount of hematite. At 155 degrees C or higher, only hematite was
   precipitated. With increasing temperature, the iron content of the
   precipitate increased. The chloride contents of the precipitates were
   about 2.8\% at 140 degrees C and 0.3\% at 155 degrees C or higher. This
   is believed due to chloride becoming significantly incorporated into
   akaganeite, but not into hematite. At 155 degrees C or higher, the
   particle size increased with increasing temperature. Pb, Ni, and Hg were
   not incorporated into hematite while Zn, Co, Cd, Ag and Cr were slightly
   incorporated. As and Sb were co-precipitated with hematite. The iron
   precipitated was slightly more than that extracted in leaching. The
   pressure oxidation of ferrous ions and subsequent hematite precipitation
   are suitable for the rejection of the excess iron as a by-product for
   disposal or possibly for sale as pigments/coloring agents. (C). 2013

   higher surface area and larger pore volume than those of Re/Cu/MC
   catalyst. Therefore, Re/Cu-MC catalyst showed higher copper dispersion
   than Re/Cu/MC catalyst, although both catalysts retained the same
   amounts of copper and rhenium. In the liquid-phase hydrogenation of

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory rougher flotation tests were conducted with two samples of
   Cu-Mo ores in fresh water and in sea water as a function of pH. In both
   cases Cu recoveries were slightly lower in sea water than in fresh water
   for a wide range of pH (pH 7-12). Flotation of molybdenite was however
   strongly depressed in sea water at pH higher than 9.5. Frothers were
   characterized by measuring froth thickness in a modified laboratory
   flotation cell as a function of pH, salinity, frother type, and solids
   content (\%). It was found that for all tested frothers, foamability in
   two-phase systems was better in sea water than in fresh water. However,
   froth layer thickness measurement showed that frothability also depends
   on solids content and increases with increasing pulp density. At high
   solids content (35\%) the frothability depended strongly on pH. At pH of
   9 it was similar for fresh water and sea water, however, once the pH is

Abstract = {{In a cognitive radio (CR) network when a group of CR users acts as
   relays for a given CR user, a cooperative beamforming can be used to
   improve the quality of communications. However, this cooperative
   beamforming can introduce asynchronous interference at the primary
   receiver due to different propagation delays between different CR relays
   and the primary receiver. In this paper, we propose an innovative
   beamforming method that maximizes the received signal power at the
   secondary destination while keeping the asynchronous interference at the
   primary receiver below a target threshold. The presented numerical
   results show that the proposed beamforming method can significantly
   reduce the interference at the primary receiver compared to the zero
   forcing beamforming as well as joint leakage suppression method and
   thereby decreases the outage probability. This beamforming method is
   further extended for the case when the channels between the primary
   receiver and the CR relays are not known perfectly. Moreover, in this
   paper, we propose and investigate two relay selection strategies in
   conjunction with cooperative beamforming. The presented numerical
   results show that the relay selection schemes in conjunction with the
   cooperative beamforming method can further improve the received signal
   power at the secondary destination.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a cooperative diversity scheme for wireless
   systems where the relay is equipped with a buffer. We consider practical
   frequency-selective channels and adopt the combination of bit
   interleaved coded modulation and orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (BICM-OFDM). We propose a novel link selection protocol for
   BICM-OFDM systems where the relay either transmits or receives in a
   given time slot depending on the quality of the links. We derive a
   closed-form upper bound for the asymptotic worst-case pairwise error
   probability (PEP) and the diversity gain of the considered buffer-aided
   relaying scheme for both infinite and finite buffer size. We show that
   significant diversity gains can be achieved with buffer-aided relaying
   compared to conventional relaying at the expense of larger packet
   delays. In fact, for buffers of infinite (or very large) size, the
   diversity gain is doubled for links with identical frequency diversity,
   and an even higher diversity gain advantage is possible for links with
   non-identical frequency diversities. Furthermore, we perform an exact
   closed-form average delay analysis for buffers of both finite and
   infinite size which provides important insight into the achieved
   delay-performance tradeoff. The derived analytical results and
   performance gains are corroborated by extensive simulation results.}},

Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{6516-6526}},

Abstract = {{To shed light onto the relationship between sparging conditions and
   fouling control in submerged hollow fiber membranes, the effects of
   bubble size and frequency on the hydrodynamic conditions induced in
   membrane system were studied. Two general classes of bubbles were
   considered: coarse (0.75-2.5 mL) and pulse (100-500 mL). The power
   transferred (P-trans) onto membranes could be used to characterise the
   multiple effects induced under different sparging conditions. P-trans is
   proportional to root mean square of shear stress (tau(rms)), the area of
   zone of influence (i.e. the fraction in the system where high velocity
   and high vorticity (turbulence) are induced by the bubble) and their
   rise velocity. At a given sparging rate, the power transferred onto
   membranes was less with coarse bubble sparging than pulse bubble
   sparging and increased with the size of pulse bubbles. For all cases,
   the power transfer efficiency was consistently higher for pulse bubble
   sparging than for coarse bubble sparging. The power transfer efficiency
   to the system was greatest for the small pulse bubbles considered when a
   small amount of power is required for fouling control. However, when
   fouling is extensive, large pulse bubbles may be required to generate
   the required amount of power for fouling control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this work, a series of aging treatments has been conducted on AA6111
   alloy samples for various times at ambient temperature (so-called
   natural aging) and at temperatures between 60 and 180 degrees C
   (artificially aged). The time at artificial ageing was chosen such that
   samples with approximately the same yield stress were produced. The
   microstructures of these alloy samples have been carefully characterized
   using atom probe tomography together with advanced cluster-finding
   techniques in order to obtain quantitative information about the changes
   in distribution of both the solute clusters and early-stage precipitates
   that are formed. The size distribution of clusters has been mapped onto
   the glide plane and then the stress necessary for a dislocation to pass
   through the range of obstacles has been estimated using an areal glide
   model where the dislocation obstacle interaction strength has been
   assumed to be related to the obstacle size on the glide plane. It is
   demonstrated that the contribution of cluster strengthening during
   artificial aging at higher temperatures is dominated by the high number
   density of small clusters (Guinier radius <1 nm), whereas the situation
   during room temperature natural aging is more complex. Crown Copyright

   understanding of its structural properties. Using these testing results,
   two hysteretic models (Saws model and Pinching4 model) in OpenSees are
   calibrated in this paper. For both models, pinching behavior, strength
   and stiffness degradation have been taken into consideration. Both
   models are compared with three kinds of connection load-slip tests for
   CLT shear wall under monotonic and cyclic loading protocols. From the
   results, Pinching4 model showed better performance than Saws model in
   accounting for rapid degradation of reloading stiffness and unloading
   stiffness of the bracket connection. Finally, the wall modeling results,
   based on three types of connections, are compared with the corresponding
   full scale CLT wall tests results. Utility of Pinching4 model is

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a low computational cost, super-resolution
   ultrasound imaging method that leverages the asymmetric vibration mode
   of CMUTs. Instead of focusing on the broadband received signal on the
   entire CMUT membrane, we utilize the differential signal received on the
   left and right part of the membrane obtained by a multi-electrode CMUT
   structure. The differential signal reflects the asymmetric vibration
   mode of the CMUT cell excited by the nonuniform acoustic pressure field
   impinging on the membrane, and has a resonant component in immersion. To
   improve the resolution, we propose an imaging method as follows: a set
   of manifold matrices of CMUT responses for multiple focal directions are
   constructed off-line with a grid of hypothetical point targets. During
   the subsequent imaging process, the array sequentially steers to
   multiple angles, and the amplitudes (weights) of all hypothetical
   targets at each angle are estimated in a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
   process with the manifold matrix corresponding to that angle. Then, the
   weight vector undergoes a directional pruning process to remove the
   false estimation at other angles caused by the side lobe energy.
   Ultrasound imaging simulation is performed on ring and linear arrays
   with a simulation program adapted with a multi-electrode CMUT structure
   capable of obtaining both average and differential received signals.
   Because the differential signals from all receiving channels form a more
   distinctive temporal pattern than the average signals, better MAP
   estimation results are expected than using the average signals. The
   imaging simulation shows that using differential signals alone or in
   combination with the average signals produces better lateral resolution
   than the traditional phased array or using the average signals alone.
   This study is an exploration into the potential benefits of asymmetric
   CMUT responses for super-resolution imaging.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1068-1074}},

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been widely used for the deposition of
   various types of nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Here,
   we report the results of experiments that show that the interactions
   between deposited and suspended nanotubes during the deposition process
   can considerably affect the dynamics and the final results of the
   deposition. Semiperiodic stripes of nanotubes bridging two electrodes
   are formed from solutions containing no surfactant. The periodicity of
   the patterns depends on the geometry of the electrodes. Finite-element
   method simulations are used to explain the mechanisms underlying the
   observed experimental outcomes. The pattern formation is shown to be
   related to the mutual effects of CNTs on each other. The reason lies in
   the changes in the electric field as a result of deposition of CNTs.
   These changes directly alter the DEP force field and, therefore, the way
   the CNTs are guided. The extent of effectiveness of the electrothermal
   force, which turns out to be substantial for some solutions, is also
   investigated, and it is shown that although in some situations the heat
   generated by the current passing through the nanotubes considerably
   increases this force, the DEP force remains dominant when a
   surfactant-free solution is used.}},

Pages = {{1032-1036}},

Abstract = {{ASTM C1609 remains one of the most prescribed tests for characterizing
   the performance of fiber reinforced concrete (FRC). Although numerous
   deficiencies in this test have been addressed over the years, concerns
   persist regarding the loading rate prescribed in the current version of
   the test. A test program was carried out to investigate the influence of
   the loading rate in ASTM C1609-2010. Normal-strength FRCs with 1.0
   kg/m(3) (0.11 \% by volume) and 3.0 kg/m(3) (0.33 \% by volume)
   polypropylene fiber were tested. The results indicate that although the
   prescribed loading rate is appropriate for the 3.0 kg/m(3) fiber dosage
   rate, it is too high for FRC with a 1.0 kg/m(3) fiber dosage rate. In
   order to obtain a stable load-deflection curve in FRC with a 1.0 kg/m(3)
   fiber dosage rate, a reduced loading rate was required. In the context
   of these findings, this paper argues that either the loading rate in
   ASTM C1609 should be reduced or a minimum fiber dosage rate for which
   the test is valid should be specified.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A series of experiments were conducted on handsheets to investigate
   small-scale variations in filler concentration on the surface of paper.
   The surface distribution of two types of filler material was
   investigated: precipitated calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and kaolin clay
   (Al2Si2O5(OH)(4)). The effect of retention aids, dewatering rate, and
   forming fabric geometry on filler distribution was tested. Local filler
   concentration was found to be strongly correlated with the relative flow
   velocity during formation. In samples formed by gravity and vacuum
   drainage, kaolin displayed a significantly greater variation in local
   concentration than precipitated calcium carbonate, though the difference
   was reduced under vacuum drainage conditions. The distribution on the
   top side of the paper was comparable between the filler types,
   independent of drainage velocity. Under vacuum drainage, retention aids
   did not improve filler uniformity on the wire side. However, on the top
   side of the paper, a moderate reduction in spatial variation was
   observed. Additionally, on the wire side of samples made with gravity
   drainage, the addition of retention aids produced a significant
   improvement in the uniformity of the filler material. These filler
   distribution trends are believed to be related to variable filler
   retention as a function of filler type, drainage velocity, and chemical
   retention aids. Additionally, samples made with an industry forming
   fabric showed the same distribution trends and an improvement in the
   uniformity of the filler material.}},

Abstract = {{The use of unconventional arterial intersection designs (UAIDs) has been
   advocated as a novel solution that can efficiently enhance the
   operational and safety performance of at-grade signalised intersections.
   Several studies suggest that UAIDs can lead to higher capacity, lower
   delays and fewer crashes. As well, these non-traditional' designs are
   cost-effective as only minor geometric modifications are usually
   required. In recent years, there has been considerable valuable research
   work undertaken to discuss methods for analysing the operational and
   safety performance of UAIDs. Nevertheless, these studies are sparse and
   no collective effort is currently available to identify the basic
   principles of the analysis of UAIDs and to determine gaps within the
   current methods. This article presents an in-depth literature review of
   existing methods of analysing the operational and the safety performance
   of unconventional intersection designs. These methods differ in
   principle issues, such as objective and scope, and in technical issues,
   such as experimental design, analysis tools and evaluation measures.
   Based on the reviewed methods, areas that need further research and
   improvements are identified.}},

Abstract = {{The industrial anthraquinone auto-oxidation process produces most of the
   world's supply of hydrogen peroxide. For applications that require small
   amounts of H2O2 or have economically difficult transportation means, an
   alternate, on-site H2O2 production method is needed. Advanced drinking
   water purification technologies use neutral-pH H2O2 in combination with
   UV treatment to reach the desired water purity targets. To produce
   neutral H2O2 on-site and on-demand for drinking water purification, the
   electroreduction of oxygen at the cathode of a proton exchange membrane
   (PEM) fuel cell operated in either electrolysis (power consuming) or
   fuel cell (power generating) mode could be a possible solution. The work
   presented here focuses on the H-2/O-2 fuel cell mode to produce H2O2.
   The fuel cell reactor is operated with a continuous flow of carrier
   water through the cathode to remove the product H2O2. The impact of the
   cobalt-carbon composite cathode catalyst loading, Teflon content in the
   cathode gas diffusion layer, and cathode carrier water flowrate on the
   production of H2O2 are examined. H2O2 production rates of up to
   200molh(-1)cm(geometric) (-2) are achieved using a continuous flow of
   carrier water operating at 30\% current efficiency. Operation times of
   more than 24h have shown consistent H2O2 and power production, with no
   degradation of the cobalt catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional image hashing maps invariant features of each digital image
   into a unique, compact, robust, and secure signature, which can be used
   as an index for fast content identification and copyright protection.
   This paper addresses an important issue of compressing the real-valued
   image hashes into short binary signatures, which can support fast image
   identification using Hamming distance metrics. The proposed binary image
   hashing approach presents a fundamental departure from existing methods:
   Prior information from virtual image distortions and attacks is explored
   the first time in image hash generation. More specifically, the proposed
   scheme takes advantages of the extended hash feature space from virtual
   distortions and attacks and generates the binary signature for each
   image based on spectral embedding. Since the objective function to learn
   the embedding is designed to both preserve local similarity between
   distorted copies of the same image and to distinguish visually distinct
   images, the generated binary image hash is more robust compared with the
   one using conventional quantization-based compression approaches.
   Further, the proposed method can be generalized to combine different
   types of image hashes to generate a fixed-length binary signature. Our
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed binary image hash by
   combining different real-valued image hashes is more robust against
   various distortions and it is computationally efficient for image
   similarity comparison using Hamming metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Proper modelling of a dynamic system can benefit analysis, simulation,
   design, evaluation and control of the system. The linear-graph (LG)
   approach is suitable for modelling lumped-parameter dynamic systems. By
   using the concepts of graph trees, it provides a graphical
   representation of the system, with a direct correspondence to the
   physical component topology. This paper systematically extends the
   application of LGs to multi-domain (mixed-domain or multi-physics)
   dynamic systems by presenting a unified way to represent different
   domains - mechanical, electrical, thermal and fluid. Preservation of the
   structural correspondence across domains is a particular advantage of
   LGs when modelling mixed-domain systems. The generalisation of Thevenin
   and Norton equivalent circuits to mixed-domain systems, using LGs, is
   presented. The structure of an LG model may follow a specific pattern.
   Vector LGs are introduced to take advantage of such patterns, giving a
   general LG representation for them. Through these vector LGs, the model
   representation becomes simpler and rather compact, both topologically
   and parametrically. A new single LG element is defined to facilitate the
   modelling of distributed-parameter (DP) systems. Examples are presented
   using multi-domain systems (a motion-control system and a
   flow-controlled pump), a multi-body mechanical system (robot
   manipulator) and DP systems (structural rods) to illustrate the
   application and advantages of the methodologies developed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The shared medium used in wireless networks makes them vulnerable to
   spoofing attacks, in which an adversary masquerades as one or more
   legitimate nodes to disturb normal operation of the network. In this
   paper we present a novel spoofing detection method for static IEEE
   802.15.4 networks based on spatial correlation property of received
   signal strength (RSS). While most existing RSS based techniques directly
   process RSS values of the received frames and rely on multiple traffic
   air monitors (AMs) to provide an acceptable detection performance, we
   extract features of RSS streams to reduce data redundancy and provide a
   more distinguishable representation of the data. Our algorithm employs
   two features of RSS streams, summation of detailed coefficients (SDCs)
   in discrete Haar wavelet transform (DHWT) of the RSS streams and the
   ratio of out-of-bound frames. We show that in a typical scenario, a
   single AM with SDC as detection parameter, can theoretically outperform
   a system with 12 AMs which directly applies RSS values as detection
   parameter. Using ratio of out-of-bound frames facilitates detection of
   high rate attacks. In addition, we suggest adaptive learning of
   legitimate RSS values which enhances the robustness of the attack
   detector against environmental changes. Using both magnitude and
   frequency related features, we achieved high detection performance with
   a single AM; this enables development of preventive measures for
   spoofing attacks. The performance of our approach was evaluated through
   an IEEE 802.15.4 testbed in an office environment. Experimental results
   along with theoretical analysis show that the proposed method
   outperforms the existing RSS-based spoofing detection solutions. Using a
   single AM, we were able to attain 94.75\% detection rate (DR) with
   0.56\% false positive rate (FPR). For 4 AMs, the results improved to
   99\% DR and 0\% FPR. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Natural convection flows of a Bingham fluid in a long vertical channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{39-55}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We analyze the 1D flow of a Bingham fluid between two differentially
   heated vertical plates, in the presence of a stabilizing vertical
   temperature gradient, imposed at the walls. The solution is
   parameterized by the Bingham number, B. and the stratification parameter
   Gamma, and is surprisingly complex. When B >= B-cr = 1/16 the fluid is
   unyielded everywhere and heat transfer is via pure conduction. We refer
   to this as a 1-plug solution. For B <= B-cr, a perturbation solution
   shows that yielding starts at the walls and the centerline of the
   channel, breaking into two asymmetric counter-current streams and with a
   single plug in each stream (a 2-plug solution). We characterize the
   solution regimes in the Gamma-B plane in terms of the number of plugs
   that are found. We identify the main characteristics of these solutions
   and provide data suitable for numerical benchmarking. For increasing
   Gamma and decreasing B, we show that in principle, an arbitrarily large
   number of plugs can be found in the finite width channel. Primarily we
   solve for the 1-plug (conductive), 2-plug and 3-plug solutions, which
   are found to dominate the Gamma-B parameter space. (c) 2013 Elsevier

   Highly inclined pipes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},

Abstract = {{We present results of an experimental study of buoyant miscible
   displacement flows of a yield-stress fluid (Carbopol) by a higher
   density Newtonian fluid along a long inclined pipe. We focus on the
   industrially interesting case where the yield stress is significantly
   larger than a typical viscous stress in the displacing fluid, but where
   buoyancy forces may be significant. We find that the slump and
   centre-type displacements identified in our earlier work on
   near-horizontal flows are in fact observed over the full range of pipe
   inclinations. Interestingly, the occurrence of these regimes is
   primarily governed by approximately the same ratio of Reynolds number to
   densimetric Froude number, Re/Fr, as in near-horizontal case. However,
   we do observe a range of exotic behaviour for slump flows at higher
   inclinations associated with the progressive break-up of the Carbopol
   layer. We give a detailed description of these secondary regimes and
   their formation. We also observe a third regime which we refer to as
   turbulent-mixed flow. In this case, despite the existence of the yield
   stress, the flow is very similar to that for a Newtonian displacement
   when the mixing is very efficient. In the absence of an imposed flow of
   the displacing fluid, we observe that flows may nonetheless develop
   under the action of buoyancy despite the yield stress. We discuss the
   probable mechanisms and potential implications for the plug cementing
   process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing aspheric deformities of the femoral head-neck junction in
   cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) requires representing the
   location, size, or extent of the bony lesion. The objectives of this
   work are to (1) assess the feasibility of creating 3D models of cam
   deformities from MRI sets, (2) present a standardized 2D visualization
   of the lesion, and (3) present and evaluate the potential utility of
   summary metrics in distinguishing between FAI patients and control
   subjects.
   Using MRIs from five subjects with diagnosed cam-type FAI and four
   healthy subjects, we developed a technique based on subtracting an
   estimated normal surface from each subject's actual bone surface in
   order to generate a subject-specific 2D ``diagnosis graph{''} that
   characterized the femoral deformity. The models from three control
   subjects were combined to create the baseline model.
   The RMS fitting error between the surface models of individual control
   subjects and their corresponding baseline models was 1.05 mm across the
   head and the head-to-neck transition region. In the anterosuperior
   region of the 2D diagnosis graphs, the mean height of the detected cam
   deformities relative to the estimated baseline normal shape was 17.9 \%
   of the head radius for the five FAI subjects (95 \% CI 8.5-27.3 \%) and
   7.0 \% (95 \% CI 2.9-11.1 \%) for the four control subjects. A binary
   logistic regression analysis indicated that an h/r ratio larger than a
   threshold of = 10.7 \% (equivalent to approximately 2.3 mm in height)
   yielded the best discrimination between cam-type FAI subjects and normal
   subjects.
   Our 2D diagnosis graph qualitatively enabled the cam-type lesions in
   four of our five diagnosed patients to be clearly visualized on
   MRI-derived models. We believe this visualization tool may be helpful in
   better characterizing cam-type lesions for diagnosis and for developing
   more precise plans for surgical treatment.}},

Title = {{A simulation model for the design and analysis of wood pellet supply
   chains}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, the global trade of wood pellets has been
   growing. Rapid increases in the production and consumption of wood
   pellets, and predictions on its increased demand in the near future have
   formed a competitive global market. Several studies have focused on the
   economic, environmental, and technological aspects of wood pellet
   production and consumption. In this paper, a simulation model is
   developed to enhance and facilitate the studies concerning the design
   and analysis of wood pellet supply chains. The scope of the model covers
   the entire supply chain from sources of raw materials to the end
   customers, providing a framework for assessment of the supply chains.
   The model includes uncertainties, interdependencies between stages of
   the supply chain, and resource constraints, which are usually simplified
   or ignored in previous studies. The outputs of the model include the
   amount of energy consumed in each process and its related CO2 emissions,
   and the cost components of delivered wood pellets to the customers. The
   model was applied to an existing supply chain located in BC, Canada. The
   estimated cost of wood pellets was 69.27\$ t(-1) at the pellet mill's
   gate and 101.33 \$ t(-1) at customers' locations. Distribution of wood
   pellets to the customers contributed about 30.65\% to total costs. Raw
   material procurement and transportation accounted for 29.16\% of the
   total delivered cost, while pellet production contributes 40.19\% to the
   total delivered cost. The energy consumption and CO2 emission along the
   supply chain were estimated at 568.93 kW h t(-1) and 136.91 kg t(-1),
   respectively. The results of scenario-based analysis showed that by
   changing the drying fuel from sawdust to bark, about 1.5\% cost
   reduction was achievable. Blending 10\% bark in the whitewood feedstock
   reduced the estimated cost to 96.51 \$ t(-1) (4.75\% reduction). (C)

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio cooperative communication (CR-CC) systems, the
   achievable data rate can be improved by increasing the transmission
   power. However, the increase in power consumption may cause the
   interference with primary users and reduce the network lifetime. Most
   previous work on CR-CC did not take into account the tradeoff between
   the achievable data rate and network lifetime. To fill this gap, this
   paper proposes an energy-efficient joint relay selection and power
   allocation scheme in which the state of a relay is characterized by the
   channel condition of all related links and its residual energy. The
   CR-CC system is formulated as a multi-armed restless bandit problem
   where the optimal policy is decided in a distributed way. The solution
   to the restless bandit formulation is obtained through a first-order
   relaxation method and a primal-dual priority-index heuristic, which can
   reduce dramatically the on-line computation and implementation
   complexity. According to the obtained index, each relay can determine
   whether to provide relaying or not and also can control the
   corresponding transmission power. Extensive simulation experiments are
   conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The
   results demonstrate that the power consumption is reduced significantly
   and the network lifetime is increased more than 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{In bit-depth scalable video coding, the tone-mapping scheme used to
   convert high-bit-depth to eight-bit videos is an essential yet very
   often ignored component. In this paper, we demonstrate that an
   appropriate choice of a tone-mapping operator can improve the coding
   efficiency of bit-depth scalable encoders. We present a new tone-mapping
   scheme that delivers superior compression efficiency while adhering to a
   predefined base layer perceptual quality. We develop numerical models
   that estimate the base layer bit-rate (R-b), the enhancement layer
   bitrate (R-e), and the mismatch (Q(L)) between the resulting low dynamic
   range (LDR) base-layer signal and the predefined base layer
   representation. Our proposed tone curve is given by the solution of an
   optimization problem which minimizes a weighted sum of R-b, R-e, and
   Q(L). The problem formulation also considers the temporal effect of
   tone-mapping by adding a constraint to the optimization problem that
   suppresses flickering artifacts. We also propose a technique with which
   to tone-map a high-bit-depth video directly in a compression-friendly
   color space (e. g., one luma and two chroma channels) without converting
   to the RGB domain. Experimental results show that we can save up to 40\%
   of the total bit-rate (or 3.5 dB PSNR improvement for the same bitrate),
   and, in general, about 20\% bit-rate savings can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Described is designing a construction management (CM) data visualization
   environment with emphasis on exploring a bottom-up design methodology as
   part of the environment development process. Investigated is how such a
   methodology combined with design guidelines and a top-down approach can
   aid the creation of ready-to-use visualizations that help CM
   practitioners answer specific CM questions and support general CM
   analytics useful for a range of CM functions/tasks. Three visualization
   development cases for the time performance control application are used
   to demonstrate the bottom-up design process. The visualizations
   implemented are tested to show their usefulness and to identify
   opportunities for incorporating new visualization features that are
   common to other visualizations supported in the environment. The key
   lesson learned from the bottom-up development process is that by
   attending to individual image details, the developed visualizations: 1)
   are responsiveness to answering specific CM questions, 2) apply
   state-of-the-art data visualization techniques, 3) fit within an
   environment architecture, and 4) allow for the enrichment of design
   guidelines and lists of common visualization features. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A 1D fluid model is implemented for the purpose of fluid-structure
   interaction (FSI) simulations in complex and completely collapsible
   geometries, particularly targeting the case of obstructive sleep apnea
   (OSA). The fluid mechanics are solved separately from any solid
   mechanics, making possible the use of a highly complex and/or black-box
   solver for the solid mechanics. The fluid model is temporally
   discretized with a second-order scheme and spatially discretized with an
   asymmetrical fourth-order scheme that is robust in highly uneven
   geometries. A completely collapsing and reopening geometry is handled
   smoothly using a modified area function. The numerical implementation is
   tested with two driven-geometry cases: (1) an inviscid analytical
   solution and (2) a completely closing geometry with viscous flow.
   Three-dimensional fluid simulations in static geometries are performed
   to examine the assumptions of the 1D model, and with a well-defined
   pressure-recovery constant the 1D model agrees well with 3D models. The
   model is very fast computationally, is robust, and is recommended for
   OSA simulations where the bulk flow pressure is primarily of interest.}},

Title = {{Compressive Follower Load Influences Cervical Spine Kinematics and
   Kinetics During Simulated Head-First Impact in an in Vitro Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Current understanding of the biomechanics of cervical spine injuries in
   head-first impact is based on decades of epidemiology, mathematical
   models, and in vitro experimental studies. Recent mathematical modeling
   suggests that muscle activation and muscle forces influence injury risk
   and mechanics in head-first impact. It is also known that muscle forces
   are central to the overall physiologic stability of the cervical spine.
   Despite this knowledge, the vast majority of in vitro head-first impact
   models do not incorporate musculature. We hypothesize that the
   simulation of the stabilizing mechanisms of musculature during
   head-first osteoligamentous cervical spine experiments will influence
   the resulting kinematics and injury mechanisms. Therefore, the objective
   of this study was to document differences in the kinematics, kinetics,
   and injuries of ex vivo osteoligamentous human cervical spine and
   surrogate head complexes that were instrumented with simulated
   musculature relative to specimens that were not instrumented with
   musculature. We simulated a head-first impact (3 m/s impact speed) using
   cervical spines and surrogate head specimens (n = 12). Six spines were
   instrumented with a follower load to simulate in vivo compressive muscle
   forces, while six were not. The principal finding was that the axial
   coupling of the cervical column between the head and the base of the
   cervical spine (T1) was increased in specimens with follower load.
   Increased axial coupling was indicated by a significantly reduced time
   between head impact and peak neck reaction force (p = 0.004) (and time
   to injury (p = 0.009)) in complexes with follower load relative to
   complexes without follower load. Kinematic reconstruction of vertebral
   motions indicated that all specimens experienced hyperextension and the
   spectrum of injuries in all specimens were consistent with a primary
   hyperextension injury mechanism. These preliminary results suggest that
   simulating follower load that may be similar to in vivo muscle forces
   results in significantly different impact kinetics than in similar
   biomechanical tests where musculature is not simulated.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of the spouting in slot-rectangular spouted beds with multiple
   compartments and slots is investigated and compared with a
   single-chamber, single-slot spouted bed. Several different
   configurations of multiple slots were tested, including parallel and
   aligned, with gas drawn from a common plenum chamber. The stability of
   the spouting was observed visually and identified by the evolution of
   pressure drop and its fluctuation. The stability of multiple spouting
   was found to be mainly affected by the interaction between adjacent
   fountains and spouts. Stable steady state spouting could be achieved
   when the chambers were separated by a suspended partition, providing a
   scale-up method for slot-rectangular spouted beds.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D) Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model (two-fluid

   conical-cylindrical vessel. The gas motion was simulated by the k-E
   two-equation turbulent model, while the particle phase motion was
   estimated from the kinetic theory of granular flow. The inlet minimum
   spouting velocity, u(ms), was numerically predicted by visual
   observations and analysis of simulated distributions of the solid volume
   fraction and particle vector field for decreasing gas flow. The effects
   of particle diameter, static bed height and fluid inlet diameter on
   u(ms) were checked, in order to confirm the validity of the present
   developed method. In addition, numerical predictions are compared with

Abstract = {{The recognition of flow regimes is very important in the application of
   spouted beds. In this paper, two-dimensional computer simulations of a
   slot-rectangular spouted bed using FLUENT commercial software were
   utilised to construct flow regime maps. Two-phase gas-solid flows in the
   bed were simulated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the
   two-phase Eulerian-Eulerian granular model. The numerical simulations
   were applied to predict different flow regimes. The constructed flow
   regime map for a bed containing solid particles with a diameter of
   1.44mm was in good agreement with the experimental map previously
   reported elsewhere. With this successful numerical mapping, a flow
   regime map for particles with a diameter of 3.77mm was constructed for
   various superficial gas velocities and static bed heights. The map was
   composed of six distinct flow patterns, that is fixed bed, internal jet,
   jet-in-fluidised-bed, spouting, incoherent spouting and slugging. The
   slugging flow regime occurred at large values for the static bed height
   and air inlet velocity, while the spouting regime arose by increasing
   the air inlet velocity at low values of static bed height. Unlike the
   spouting regime, large pressure drop fluctuations were observed in the
   incoherent spouting regime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces SymPLFIED, a program-level framework that allows
   specification of arbitrary error detectors and the verification of their
   efficacy against hardware errors. SymPLFIED comprehensively enumerates
   all transient hardware errors in registers, memory, and computation
   (expressed symbolically as value errors) that potentially evade
   detection and cause program failure. The framework uses symbolic
   execution to abstract the state of erroneous values in the program and
   model checking to comprehensively find all errors that evade detection.
   We demonstrate the use of SymPLFIED on a widely deployed aircraft
   collision avoidance application, tcas. Our results show that the
   SymPLFIED framework can be used to uncover hard-to-detect catastrophic
   cases caused by transient errors in programs that may not be exposed by
   random fault injection-based validation. Further, the errors exposed by
   the framework help us formulate a set of error detectors for the
   application to avoid the catastrophic case and other incorrect outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHypothermia (core body temperature <36 degrees C) during
   surgery has been associated with surgical site infection, a major risk
   in all spine deformity surgeries. Forced air warming is an important
   method of intraoperative temperature maintenance in children. In
   mid-2010, we empirically introduced preoperative warming as a strategy
   to reduce intraoperative hypothermia.
   ObjectiveWe report the prevalence and extent of hypothermia during spine
   deformity surgeries at our institution and evaluate the effect of the
   introduction of preoperative warming.
   MethodsWe performed a retrospective audit of temperature data in
   children who underwent spine deformity surgeries during two-seven-month
   periods: November 2011 to June 2012 and 2years prior to this period
   (before preoperative warming implementation). Specifically, the
   following data were obtained: (i) case duration; (ii) first measured
   temperature; (iii) last measured temperature; (iv) percentage of case
   spent hypothermic; (v) number of hypothermic episodes per case, and (vi)
   delay between case start and time of first temperature measured. Data
   were compared visually and using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Confidence
   intervals (CI) were obtained using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.
   ResultsPreoperative warming reduced the percentage of case duration
   spent hypothermic by a median of 111.1min (P<0.001, 95\% CI
   77.1-139.9min). Additionally, it increased the first measured
   temperature by a median of 0.5 degrees C (P<0.001, 95\% CI 0.3-0.7
   degrees C). The last temperature at the end of the case remained
   unchanged (P=0.57, 95\% CI -0.2-0.1 degrees C).
   ConclusionPreoperative warming of children undergoing spine deformity
   surgery significantly reduces the percentage of case spent hypothermic,
   thereby potentially reducing risk of perioperative complications.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Normal estimation is an essential task for scanned point clouds in
   various CAD/CAM applications. Many existing methods are unable to
   reliably estimate normals for points around sharp features since the
   neighborhood employed for the normal estimation would enclose points
   belonging to different surface patches across the sharp feature. To
   address this challenging issue, a robust normal estimation method is
   developed in order to effectively establish a proper neighborhood for
   each point in the scanned point cloud. In particular, for a point near
   sharp features, an anisotropic neighborhood is formed to only enclose
   neighboring points located on the same surface patch as the point.
   Neighboring points on the other surface patches are discarded. The
   developed method has been demonstrated to be robust towards noise and
   outliers in the scanned point cloud and capable of dealing with sparse
   point clouds. Some parameters are involved in the developed method. An
   automatic procedure is devised to adaptively evaluate the values of
   these parameters according to the varying local geometry. Numerous case
   studies using both synthetic and measured point cloud data have been
   carried out to compare the reliability and robustness of the proposed
   method against various existing methods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ion transport membranes (ITMs) offer promising technology for high
   purity oxygen production (up to 99\%) without adversely affecting the
   efficiency of the oxy-fired plants. The permeation rate of such ITMs can
   be increased by replacing the conventional inert sweep gas with a
   reactant/diluent mixture (e.g. CO2, CH4) as this reduces the permeate
   partial pressure on the permeate side of the membrane, which, along with
   the temperature, governs the permeation flux. The significant limitation
   of this approach is that an uncontrolled, exothermic consumption of the
   permeated specie, can lead to membrane damage, and thus limits the
   potential of ITMs using reactive sweep gases (i.e. ITM reactors). By
   using a multichannel ITM reactor (isothermal reactor), it is proposed to
   operate the ITM reactor at, or near to isothermal conditions (i.e a
   spatially uniform temperature). This may be achieved by introducing a
   reactant into the permeate stream uniformly across the entire ITM
   reactor length from an adjacent channel with porous walls. The present
   work is aimed at modeling a nearly isothermal reactor using an ITM and a
   porous membrane to achieve uniform stoichiometric ratio of fuel/O-2 in
   order to have a uniform combustion all along the length of the membrane.
   A two-dimensional, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is solved to
   study the characteristics. The simulations are based on the numerical
   solution of the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and species
   transport equations of two dimensional flows. For the CFD calculations,
   the commercial solver FLUENT has been used. The models used have been
   validated against the experimental results found in the literature and
   are found to be in good agreement. The influence on the performance of
   oxygen separation through the ITM has been studied by varying the flow
   conditions at the permeate side. Results show that an approximate
   uniform combustion can be achieved along with effective thermal
   management of the ITM using the present isothermal reactor. It is also
   observed that for a constant mass flow rate of fuel mixture, the
   permeation rate of oxygen through ITM increases with the increase in
   CH4/CO2 ratio. The results indicate that the oxygen permeation flux
   increases by approximately 3 times for reactive case compared to
   separation only case. Moreover it is shown that using the present
   reactor model the reaction zone can be controlled. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The solution method presented in this paper is of Trefftz type which
   uses exponential basis functions (EBFs) to solve composite plate

   2012;94:2263-68), here we aim to apply the method to higher order shear
   deformation theories. In this paper we demonstrate the way that one can
   generally evaluate the EBFs for a laminated plate using a Zig-Zag
   theory. We present explicit relations for three-layer sandwich plates
   which have a wide range of applications in structural/mechanical
   engineering fields. The results of our numerical experiments on the
   bending analysis of composites with different boundary conditions and
   different configurations are provided and compared with those available
   in the literature. For further sudies we present some results for
   sandwich composite plates, including those with soft cores, as new

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates an automated safety diagnosis approach for
   evaluating vehicle-bicycle conflicts using video analysis. The use of
   traffic conflicts for safety diagnosis is gaining acceptance as a
   surrogate for collision data analysis. Traffic conflicts can provide
   insight into the failure mechanism that leads to road collisions and do
   not require long observation periods. In the approach presented in this
   paper, traffic conflicts are automatically detected and their severity
   ranked using the Time to collision (TTC) safety indicator. As well,
   vehicle violations such as failure to respect yield signs are
   automatically identified. The safety diagnosis is also supplemented with
   automated classification and count of vehicles and bicycles. A case
   study is presented for diagnosing safety issues at a busy intersection
   downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. Vehicle-bicycle conflicts as well
   as vehicle rear-end and merging conflicts were identified and examined.
   The results showed a high exposure of cyclists to traffic conflicts and
   a significant driver noncompliance rate. Several countermeasures to
   mitigate the safety issues were presented and evaluated. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The performance of biohydrogen production in an anaerobic sequencing
   batch reactor (ASBR) was evaluated with respect to variations in the key
   operational parameters pH, hydraulic retention time HRT, and organic
   loading rate OLR using sugar refinery wastewater as substrate. Analysis
   of variance (ANOVA) indicated HRT had less significant influence on
   hydrogen content and yield in comparison to pH and OLR, whereas OLR has
   much impact on hydrogen production rate. Taxonomic analysis results
   showed that diverse bacterial species contributed to hydrogen production
   and the dominant species in the bioreactor were governed by all
   operational parameters. Even without pretreatment of the seed sludge, a
   high proportion of Clostridium spp. over the other bacterial species was
   observed at pH 5.5, and this is compatible with the high hydrogen
   productivity. Consequently, pH 5.5, HRT 10 h, and OLR 15 kg/m(3) d were
   delineated as the optimal operational conditions for an ASBR fed with

Abstract = {{Integrated Microwave photonics (IMWP) signal processing using Photonic
   Integrated Circuits (PICs) has attracted a great deal of attention in
   recent years as an enabling technology for a number of functionalities
   not attainable by purely microwave solutions. In this context,
   integrated waveguide Bragg grating (WBG) devices constitute a
   particularly attractive approach thanks to their compactness and
   flexibility in producing arbitrarily defined amplitude and phase
   responses, by directly acting on coupling coefficient and perturbations
   of the grating profile. In this article, we review recent advances in
   the field of integrated WBGs applied to MWP, analyzing the advantages
   leveraged by an integrated realization. We provide a perspective on the
   exciting possibilities offered by the silicon photonics platform in the
   field of MWP, potentially enabling integration of highly-complex active
   and passive functionalities with high yield on a single chip, with a
   particular focus on the use of WBGs as basic building blocks for linear
   filtering operations. We demonstrate the versatility of WBG-based
   devices by proposing and experimentally demonstrating a novel,
   continuously-tunable, integrated true-time-delay (TTD) line based on a
   very simple dual phase-shifted WBG (DPS-WBG). (C) 2013 Optical Society

Abstract = {{This work studies in detail the effect of femtosecond laser irradiation
   process parameters (fluence and scanning speed) on the hydrophobicity of
   the resulting micro/nano-patterned morphologies on stainless steel.
   Depending on the laser parameters, four distinctly different
   nano-patterns were produced, namely nano-rippled, parabolic-pillared,
   elongated sinusoidal-pillared and triple roughness nano-structures. All
   of the produced structures were classified according to a newly defined
   parameter, the laser intensity factor (LIF); by increasing the LIF, the
   ablation rate and periodicity of the asperities increase. In order to
   decrease the surface energy, all of the surfaces were coated with a
   fluoroalkylsilane agent. Analysis of the wettability revealed enhanced
   superhydrophobicity for most of these structures, particularly those
   possessing the triple roughness pattern that also exhibited low contact
   angle hysteresis. The high permanent superhydrophobicity of this pattern
   is due to the special micro/nano-structure of the surface that

Abstract = {{A composite mixture of NaBH4 and Mg2NiH4 (4:5, M/M) was prepared by
   high-energy ball milling and was investigated for solid-state storage of
   hydrogen. Addition of Mg2NiH4 to NaBH4 leads to formation of the stable
   ternary boride phase MgNi2.5B2 and lowers the enthalpy of hydrogen
   desorption for NaBH4 from 110 to 76 +/- 5 kJ mol(H2)(-1). As a
   consequence of this addition, the onset temperature of hydrogen
   desorption decreases from about 500 degrees C in NaBH4 to 360 degrees C
   in the NaBH4/Mg2NiH4 composite mixture. Furthermore, the system shows
   reversibility and is able to store 2.5 wt \% hydrogen for a number of
   cycles. The impact of the ball milling time, the hydrogen desorption
   back-pressure, and cycling on the hydrogen desorption/absorption
   properties and crystallographic phases is discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a PCA (principal component analysis)-based
   diagnostic approach, combining the principal component scores with the
   principal component loadings, to determine the fault location of sensors
   in a pilot-scale SBR (sequencing batch reactor activated sludge process)

   with the historical normal data, and the determination of fault location
   of sensors in wastewater treatment process is further achieved through
   the combination of the scores with the loadings of principal components.
   The study results reveal that PCA model can be used to detect faults;
   the loadings of principal components can well represent the
   contributions of variables to the principal components; and the scores
   of principal components give a clear indication of the faulty samples.
   The feasibility and effectiveness of the application of the combination
   of score plots with loading plots for sensor fault diagnosis in the
   wastewater treatment process are well demonstrated in the study. (C)

Abstract = {{Anodic oxide films (AOFs) were potentiostatically formed on commercially
   pure titanium in 0.5 M sulfuric acid solutions at various anodizing
   voltages (up to 80V) at room temperature. The subject of this study was
   the corrosion resistance of the AOFs in synthetic copper sulfide
   leaching solutions containing 30 g L-1 sulfuric acid as well as 12 g L-1
   Cl-, 15 g L-1 Cu2+ and 1 g L-1 Fe3+. Open circuit potential (OCP)
   measurement, linear polarization resistance (LPR) and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the corrosion response
   of the AOFs in copper sulfide leaching solutions up to 85 degrees C.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the
   morphology of the AOFs before and after 12 h of immersion at 85 degrees
   C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the
   surface chemistry of the AOFs after immersion. OCP measurements showed
   that the final failure of the AOFs occurred in 2 h in de-aerated 30 g
   L-1 H2SO4 and 12 g L-1 Cl- solutions at 85 degrees C. Both LPR and EIS
   results showed a significant increase in the corrosion resistance of the
   anodized titanium versus that of freshly polished titanium.
   Electrochemical results were confirmed by SEM analysis, where the AOF
   formed at 80V lead to the best improvement in corrosion resistance. XPS
   measurements revealed that Cu2+ was reduced to Cu or Cu+ within the
   titanium oxide film. It was further confirmed that the presence of
   leaching oxidants would inhibit the reduction of Cu2+ on titanium
   dioxide in chloride containing copper sulfide leaching solutions. (c)

Abstract = {{The catalytic kinetics of oxygen surface exchange and fuel oxidation for
   a perovskite membrane is investigated in terms of the thermodynamic
   state in the immediate vicinity of or on the membrane surface.
   Perovskite membranes have been shown to exhibit both oxygen
   perm-selectivity and catalytic activity for hydrocarbon conversion. A
   fundamental description of their catalytic surface reactions is needed.
   In this study, we infer the kinetic parameters for heterogeneous oxygen
   surface exchange and catalytic fuel conversion reactions, based on
   permeation rate measurements and a spatially resolved physical model
   that incorporates detailed chemical kinetics and transport in the
   gas-phase. The conservation equations for surface and bulk species are
   coupled with those of the gas-phase species through the species
   production rates from surface reactions. It is shown that oxygen surface
   exchange is limited by dissociative/associative adsorption/desorption of
   oxygen molecules onto/from the membrane surface. On the sweep side,
   while the catalytic conversion of methane to methyl radical governs the
   overall surface reactions at high temperature, carbon monoxide oxidation
   on the membrane surface is dominant at low temperature. Given the sweep
   side conditions considered in ITM reactor experiments, gas-phase
   reactions also play an important role, indicating the significance of
   investigating both homogeneous and heterogeneous chemistry and their
   coupling when examining the results. We show that the local
   thermodynamic state at the membrane surface should be considered when
   constructing and examining models of oxygen permeation and heterogeneous
   chemistry. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In engineering alloys strengthened by a combination of solid solution,
   precipitation and work hardening, plasticity is controlled by the
   interaction between dislocations and different sets of obstacles on the

   obstacles to predict yield stresses and work hardening is an important
   question. To answer this question, a 2D areal glide model based on the
   method of Nogaret and Rodney that simulates the glide of a single
   dislocation through an array of randomly distributed point obstacles was
   used. The effect of one, two and three sets of obstacles was studied
   with their strengths varying from weak (Phi(c) = 180 degrees) to strong
   (Phi(c) = 0 degrees). The results of these simulations were used for the
   first time to develop a mathematical expression for the exponent of the
   addition law tau(q) = tau(q)(1) + tau(q)(2). An extension of this
   addition law to three sets of obstacles was also derived. These new laws
   were then applied to predict the work hardening response of an Al-Mg-Sc
   alloy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Column failure is the primary cause of collapse during earthquakes for
   many existing reinforced concrete buildings. The main objective of this
   article is to develop a macro model to reproduce the lateral
   load-deformation response of reinforced concrete columns with limited
   ductility due to degradation of shear resistance. This model will
   eventually be used to perform probabilistic assessments of collapse risk
   for existing reinforced concrete frame structures, and hence must be
   computationally efficient. Current modeling approaches for reinforced
   concrete components provide a reasonably accurate prediction of flexural
   and longitudinal bar slip response, while shear deformations and, in
   particular, post-peak shear behavior needs further development. The
   shear response introduced in this article is based on a mechanical
   approach for pre-peak, point of shear failure, and post-peak behavior of
   reinforced concrete columns. Flexural, shear, and longitudinal bar slip
   responses are simulated by individual springs in series. These springs
   are combined to obtain the total lateral response of the column. The
   column model has been implemented in OpenSees and validated using data
   from column tests representing a broad range of design parameters
   typical of older reinforced concrete frames.}},

Abstract = {{Digital watermarking and data hiding are important tools for digital
   rights protection of media data. Spread spectrum (SS)-based watermarking
   and data-hiding approaches are popular due to their outstanding
   robustness, but their security might not be sufficient. To improve the
   security of SS, a SS-based image data-hiding approach is proposed by
   encrypting the discrete cosine transform coefficients of the host image
   with the piecewise linear chaotic map, before the operation of watermark
   embedding. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach,
   simulations and analyses of its robustness and security are carried out.
   The average bit-error-rate values on 100 real images from the Berkeley
   segmentation dataset under the JPEG compression, additive Gaussian
   noise, salt and pepper noise, and cropping attacks are reported.
   Experimental results show that the proposed approach can maintain the
   high robustness of traditional SS schemes and, meanwhile, also improve
   the security. The proposed approach can extend the key space of
   traditional SS schemes from 1019 to 1047 and thus can resist brute-force
   attack and unauthorized detection watermark attack. (C) 2013 SPIE and

Abstract = {{Primary refined softwood was subjected to high-consistency (HC) or
   low-consistency (LC) secondary refining, and the nature of the
   development of the internal and external fiber microstructure and
   ultrastructure has been compared. The primary refining of mixed softwood
   as a raw material was performed in pilot scale by the advanced
   thermomechanical pulp process. The study was aiming at the comparative
   characterization of LC and HC pulps at the fiber level when produced
   with similar and well-characterized handsheet properties. The formerly
   described Simons' staining method was applied. A significant degree of
   fiber wall delamination/internal fibrillation (D/IF) was observed during
   both LC and HC refining. Both the energy input and the refining
   consistency had a significant impact on elevating the degree of fiber
   wall D/IF. The statistical evaluation of internal fiber development
   indicated that the fiber populations in LC- and HC-refined pulps had a
   similar degree of fiber wall D/IF despite having a large difference in
   refining energy input (420 kW h odt(-1)), confirming that D/IF was
   promoted more energy-efficiently in LC than in HC refining. The
   characteristic of the external fiber development from HC and LC refining
   was very different. Secondary LC refining promoted fiber surfaces with
   ribbons of thin hairlike threads arising from the inner secondary S2
   layer that occasionally developed along the whole fiber length. Broad
   sheet- and lamellae-type external fibrillation from the S2 was typical
   for HC refining, and these characteristics were rarely observed in the
   LC pulps. The mechanisms for LC and HC fiber development are proposed.
   The cell wall characteristics (internal and external) of the pulp fibers
   appear to govern most of the physical and optical properties in
   handsheets.}},

Abstract = {{The cell cycle is a series of integrated and coordinated physiological
   events that results in cell growth and replication. Besides observing
   the event of cell division it is not feasible to determine the cell
   cycle phase Without fatal and/or perturbing invasive procedures such as
   cell staining, fixing, and/or dissociation. Raman microspectroscopy
   (RMS) is a chemical imaging technique that exploits molecular vibrations
   as a contrast mechanism; it can be applied to single living cells
   noninvasively to allow unperturbed analysis over time. We used RMS to
   determine the cell cycle phase based on integrating the composite 783
   cm(-1) nucleic acid band intensities across individual cell nuclei.
   After correcting for RNA contributions using the RNA 811 cm(-1) band,
   the measured intensities essentially reflected DNA content. When
   quantifying Raman images from single cells in a population of
   methanol-fixed human embryonic stem cells, the histogram of corrected
   783 cm(-1) band intensities exhibited a profile analogous to that
   obtained using flow-cytometry with nuclear stains. The two population
   peaks in the histogram occur at Raman intensities corresponding to a
   1-fold and 2-fold diploid DNA complement per cell, consistent with a
   distribution of cells with a population peak due to cells at the end of
   G1 phase (1-fold) and a peak due to cells entering M phase (2-fold).
   When treated with EdU to label the replicating DNA and block cell
   division: cells with higher EdU-related fluorescence generally had
   higher integrated Raman intensities. This provides proof-of-principle of
   an analytical method for label-free RMS determination in situ of cell
   cycle phase in adherent monolayers or even single adherent cells.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The present research is on understanding the storage, nutritional and
   sensory characteristics of high-fat fish (khoira) and rice flour
   coextrudates at storage temperature of 30C. The extruder processing
   conditions used are barrel temperature (200C), screw speed (109rpm),
   fish content of feed (44\%) and feed moisture content (39\%). Sorption
   isotherm data indicated that the safe a(w) level was about 0.4-0.7.
   Guggenheim -Anderson -de Boer model described the sorption data
   adequately with an r(2) value of 0.99. During the initial 15 days of
   storage, there was a loss of vitamin A and total tocopherols by 64.4 and
   20.6\%, and an increase in peroxides and free fatty acid content by
   about 116mg/kg and 21.7\%. The nonlinear mathematical model developed
   has adequately described the changes in nutritional and storage
   properties. Sensory attributes indicated that the product fried for 15s
   was most acceptable.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSNovel extruded product from underutilized species
   of high fat fish and rice flour are gaining importance in developing
   countries. Storage, nutritional and sensory properties of these products
   are important for designing the storage conditions and in producing
   products which are nutritionally acceptable from consumer's point of
   view. Mathematical models to predict the changes in storage and
   nutritional properties with respect to storage environment and time can
   be a great value to understand the stability and storability for human
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The need for transparent conductors (TCs) that are capable of
   withstanding high mechanical deformation in comparison to the brittle
   indium tin oxide (ITO) films is paramount for roll-to-roll production of
   flexible and stretchable displays, signage systems, lighting devices and
   solar panels with stringent weatherability requirements. This paper
   reports a highly stretchable TC comprising of a web of core-shell
   nanofibers, which mimics the fibrous structure of natural systems such
   as veins of a leaf or nerve systems. The TC web demonstrates high
   transparency, low sheet resistance, and unprecedented stretchability and
   stability over repeated stretching. The nanofiber TC web can be
   transferred to different substrates, which is manifested by the transfer
   onto an organic solar cell, demonstrating a photovoltaic performance
   comparable to that of a device with an ITO electrode. This work presents
   a technological platform, scalable for the manufacturing of large area
   transparent conductors for flexible and stretchable displays,
   electronics and solar cells on unconventional substrates such as rubber,
   fabric and paper.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of
   temperature and relative humidity on the sorption characteristics and
   the drying rate of woody biomass, and to develop a sorption isotherm
   model. Experiments using Trembling Aspen (Populus tremuloides) as
   materials were conducted in a controlled environment chamber. Results
   showed that low temperature and high relative humidity of ambient air
   led to higher equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for both desorption and
   adsorption processes. At higher temperature, the EMC was reached over a
   shorter drying time indicating a higher sorption rate; relative humidity
   was also positively correlated with the adsorption rate. The Modified
   Oswin model that relates equilibrium relative humidity to temperature
   and EMC was found to provide the best fit to the experimental data. The
   trend of drying rate constant versus temperature followed the Arrhenius
   equation, and Page's model was appropriate for predicting the drying
   characteristics of Aspen. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A comparison of collision-based and conflict-based safety evaluations:
   The case of right-turn smart channels}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of a collision-based full Bayes (FB)
   before after (BA) safety evaluation of a newly proposed design for
   channelized right-turn lanes. The design which is termed ``Smart
   Channels{''} decreases the angle of the channelized right-turn to
   approximately 70 degrees. Its implementation is usually advocated to
   afford drivers a better view of the traffic stream they are to merge
   with and to allow also for safer pedestrian crossing. The evaluation
   used data for three treatment intersections and several comparison sites
   in the city of Penticton, British Columbia. The evaluation utilized FB
   univariate and multivariate linear intervention models with multiple
   regression links representing time, treatment, and interaction effects
   as well as the traffic volumes effects. As well, the models were
   extended to incorporate random parameters to account for the correlation
   between sites within comparison-treatment pairs. The results showed that
   the implementation of the right-turn treatment has resulted in a
   considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of collisions.
   Another objective of the paper was to compare the results of the
   collision-based evaluation with the results of a traffic conflict-based
   evaluation of the same treatment intersections. The comparison showed
   remarkable similarity between the overall and the location specific
   reductions in conflicts and collisions which provides support for using
   traffic conflicts in BA studies. The results also provide positive
   empirical evidence that can support the validity of traffic conflict
   techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an erasure multi-way relay channel (EMWRC) in which several
   users share their data through a relay over erasure links. Assuming no
   feedback channel between the users and the relay, we first identify the
   challenges for designing a data sharing scheme over an EMWRC. Then, to
   overcome these challenges, we propose practical low-latency and
   low-complexity data sharing schemes based on fountain coding. Later, we
   introduce the notion of end-to-end erasure rate (EEER) and analytically
   derive it for the proposed schemes. EEER is then used to calculate the
   achievable rate and transmission overhead of the proposed schemes. Using
   EEER and computer simulations, the achievable rates and transmission
   overhead of our proposed schemes are compared with the ones of one-way
   relaying. This comparison implies that when the number of users and the
   channel erasure rates are not large, our proposed schemes outperform
   one-way relaying. We also find an upper bound on the achievable rates of
   EMWRC and observe that depending on the number of users and channel
   erasure rates, our proposed solutions can perform very close to this
   bound.}},

Title = {{Robust Design of Widely Linear Pre-Equalization Filters for Pre-Rake UWB

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Pre-rake ultra-wideband (UWB) systems are appealing for UWB
   communications applications which include devices with different
   processing capabilities so that signal processing complexity need to be
   shifted from the receiver of one or more devices to the transmitter of
   another. Recently, basic pre-rake schemes have been extended to include
   full pre-equalization, multiple-antenna, and multi-user interference
   processing. All these design approaches for pre-rake UWB systems have
   relied on the availability of accurate channel state information (CSI)
   at the transmitter. However, uncertainties in the acquisition of CSI can
   drastically affect the overall system performance. Therefore, in this
   paper, we present robust design methods for pre-equalization filters
   (PEFs) for pre-rake UWB systems that take CSI uncertainties into
   account. We treat the general case of a broadcast (i.e., multiuser)
   pre-rake UWB system, which includes single-user communication often
   considered in literature as a special case. For this general setting, we
   derive new PEF designs that improve system performance with imperfect
   CSI. Similar to the literature on robust filter designs for
   multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems, we consider two
   uncertainty models, namely stochastic and bounded uncertainty, which
   correspond to different performance optimization paradigms, and we
   adjust these according to channel estimation of UWB channels. As most of
   previous work on (pre-rake) UWB, we focus on binary transmission. We
   argue that widely linear filter design should be applied in this case
   and thus extend the robust filter design methodology accordingly. Our
   numerical results for typically UWB test channels demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed design procedures to achieve reliable
   communication in multiuser pre-rake UWB systems.}},

Abstract = {{Data security, which is concerned with the confidentiality, integrity
   and availability of data, is still challenging the application of
   wireless mesh networks (WMNs). In this paper, we focus on a special type
   of denial-of-service attack, called selective forwarding or grey hole
   attack. When this attack is launched at the gateways of a WMN where data
   tend to aggregate, it could lead to severe damages due to loss of
   sensitive data. Most existing proposals that focus on detecting
   stand-alone attackers via channel overhearing are ineffective against
   collusive attackers. In this paper, we propose a forwarding assessment
   based detection (FADE) scheme to mitigate collaborative grey hole
   attacks. Specifically, FADE detects sophisticated attacks by means of
   forwarding assessments aided by two-hop acknowledgement monitoring.
   Moreover, FADE can coexist with contemporary link security techniques.
   We analyze the optimal detection threshold that minimizes the sum of
   false positive rate and false negative rate of FADE, considering the
   network dynamics due to degraded channel quality or medium access
   collisions. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate
   the adaptability of FADE to network dynamics and its effectiveness in
   detecting collaborative grey hole attacks.}},

Abstract = {{MoS2 catalysts used in slurry-phase hydroconversion of bitumen
   deactivate when the solid coke catalyst recovered from the product is
   recycled in a semi-batch reactor operated at high residue conversion
   (445 degrees C and 13.8 MPa H-2). The catalyst deactivation, manifested
   by an increasing coke yield, is dependent upon the MoS2 concentration in
   the recycled coke catalyst and the age of the coke in the reactor.
   Characterization data show significant changes in the chemical and
   physical properties of the coke when recycled under hydroconversion
   conditions. In particular, with increased recycling, the coke becomes
   more graphitic with a decreased H/C ratio and an increased
   aromatic/aliphatic carbon ratio. Model ex situ coke aging experiments,
   conducted in He at 700 degrees C for 15 h, were used to confirm that
   changes in the chemical properties of the recovered coke determined the
   extent of catalyst deactivation, whereas morphological changes were less
   important. On the basis of these results, a model of the catalyst
   deactivation mechanism during recycling is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Social media tools that connect patients, caregivers, and health
   providers offer great potential for helping people access health advice,
   receive and give social support, manage or cope with chronic conditions,
   and make day-to-day health decisions. These systems have seen widespread
   adoption, but often fail to support the goals as fully as designers and
   users would like. Through Ackerman's lens of the ``sociotechnical
   gap{''} and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) as a science of
   the artificial, we review contemporary sociotechnical challenges and
   progress for using social media to support health. These challenges
   include a tension between privacy and sharing, policy information
   credibility, accessibility, and tailoring in social spaces. Those
   studying, building, deploying, and using social media systems to further
   health goals will benefit from approaching this work by borrowing from
   Ackerman's framing of CSCW. In particular, this requires acknowledgment
   that technical systems will not fully meet our social goals, and then
   adopting design and educational approaches that are appropriate to fill
   this gap, building less-nuanced systems as partial solutions and tools
   for advancing our understanding, and by working with the CSCW research
   community to develop and pursue key lines of inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation into the effect of surrounding air
   pressure on liquid jet impingement on a moving substrate was performed.
   The study was carried out with Newtonian liquids impacting dry
   substrates. A variety of jet speeds, substrate speeds, and liquid
   viscosities were studied. It was observed that, as is the case for
   Newtonian droplet impact, the surrounding air pressure plays a crucial
   role in the splashing behaviour of jet impingement. There exists a
   threshold pressure below which splash does not occur. It is proposed
   that for certain impingement conditions lamella detachment from the
   substrate occurs due to aerodynamic forces acting on the leading edge of
   the lamella, which destabilizes the balance between surface tension and
   fluid pressure forces. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Trace Metal Contamination Due to Acid Rock Drainage and Its Impacts on
   the Fish-Bearing Pennask Creek Watershed, British Columbia}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{224}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Pennask Creek watershed in British Columbia (BC), Canada has been
   contaminated with acid rock drainage (ARD) and associated metal leaching
   (ML) as a result of highway construction. By combining existing and
   newly gathered information, this study determined the extent of metal
   contamination of the water and sediments, the potential biological
   impacts of this contamination, the influence of local geology, and
   estimated the potential risk to aquatic organisms. Surface water and
   sediment samples from the watershed were analyzed for general chemical
   parameters and trace metals. Rock samples were analyzed for mineralogy
   and chemical composition. Metal concentrations in water and sediments
   downstream of the ARD/ML source were higher than elsewhere in the
   watershed. Metals of concern include aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and
   zinc (Zn). Analysis of historical water quality data indicated that the
   concentrations of these metals have decreased markedly since 2004, due
   to remediation efforts. Rock samples collected from the streambeds and
   banks were not found to be potentially acid generating, but did contain
   significant levels of metals. Al, Cu, and Zn levels consistently
   exceeded BC water and sediment quality guidelines for the protection of
   aquatic life, indicating that adverse biological effects are probable at
   stations downstream of the ARD/ML source. Benthic invertebrate
   monitoring over a 10-year period showed low abundance and diversity and
   a complete absence of sensitive taxa at downstream stations. Risk
   quotients indicated a likelihood of adverse biological effects for
   aquatic organisms, including rainbow trout, due to metal contamination
   in the watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of the spinal column from computed tomography (CT) images
   is a preprocessing step for a range of image-guided interventions. One
   intervention that would benefit from accurate segmentation is spinal
   needle injection. Previous spinal segmentation techniques have primarily
   focused on identification and separate segmentation of each vertebra.
   Recently, statistical multi-object shape models have been introduced to
   extract common statistical characteristics between several anatomies.
   These models can be used for segmentation purposes because they are
   robust, accurate, and computationally tractable. In this paper, we
   develop a statistical multi-vertebrae shape+pose model and propose a
   novel registration-based technique to segment the CT images of spine.
   The multi-vertebrae statistical model captures the variations in shape
   and pose simultaneously, which reduces the number of registration
   parameters. We validate our technique in terms of accuracy and
   robustness of multi-vertebrae segmentation of CT images acquired from
   lumbar vertebrae of 32 subjects. The mean error of the proposed
   technique is below 2 mm, which is sufficient for many spinal needle
   injection procedures, such as facet joint injections.}},

Abstract = {{Safety-critical applications form the main motivation for intelligent
   transportation systems (ITSs). Studying the major concerns in such
   applications, i.e., delay and reliability, through mathematical analysis
   is extremely beneficial because it enables us to design optimized
   schemes. Such analysis is, however, challenging due to the dynamics of
   such a network. In this paper, we present a mathematical model to study
   delay and reliability of emergency message dissemination in vehicular
   networks. First, a basic model is presented using simplified assumptions
   about the channel. Then, we enhance the model using Rician distribution
   as a realistic fading model for vehicular environment. We make some
   interesting observations from the presented model. First, the end-to-end
   reliability has a fairly fast transition over time, which we formally
   prove in this observation. The second observation from the analytical
   model confirms the fact that using the vehicle density on the road is a
   good metric for setting the right forwarding probability in vehicles. We
   exploit this conclusion and propose a completely distributed forwarding
   strategy. Simulation studies indicate that our model does capture the
   delay characteristics of vehicular networks. It also affirms the
   effectiveness of our warning dissemination scheme in terms of delay and
   single-hop reliability in comparison with other well-known routing
   methods. We believe that this is a promising step toward accurate
   characterization of communication delay and reliability in vehicular
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors review recent applications of an integrated
   numerical modeling approach based on the analysis of the mechanical
   behavior of discrete systems. The numerical analysis includes both a
   more realistic representation of fracture networks and the simulation of
   rock mass behavior as a combination of failure through intact rock and
   displacement/rotation along predefined discontinuities. Selected
   examples are presented with respect to a variety of engineering
   problems, including shear testing, failure of hard-rock pillars, slope
   stability, and block/panel cave mining. The results clearly illustrate
   the importance of including natural jointing to better capture rock mass
   behavior in response to loading and unloading. Particular emphasis is
   given to modeling cave development and surface subsidence, and the
   proposed numerical method is shown to capture fully the complex rock
   mass response to caving associated with multi lift extraction. Whereas
   the use of relatively complex numerical models is progressively becoming
   widespread in industry, this paper also reviews how numerical
   simulations of rock mass behavior strongly depends on the geological
   assumptions used to build the underlying discrete fracture network model
   and the mechanical properties of the natural discontinuities.
   Accordingly, a correct balance among engineering judgment, field
   characterization, and numerical modeling should always be maintained to
   reduce model uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{As steel structures become larger, taller, and longer, the demand for
   high-strength steel increases. High-strength steels exhibit different
   mechanical characteristics and hysteretic behavior for dynamic
   deformation than for quasi-static deformation. This is attributable to
   the strain rate and temperature dependence of steel materials when
   nonuniformly deformed in the plastic region. Therefore, to analyze and
   design structures using high-strength steels under dynamic cyclic
   loading, such as earthquake loading, it is necessary to consider the
   special dynamic hysteresis model of high-strength steels. In particular,
   when using finite-element (FE) analysis programs one should use the
   proper material characteristics for those steels. In this paper, dynamic
   hysteresis models for standard high-strength steels, with tensile
   strengths of 600 and 800 MPa, are formulated based on results of tensile
   tests and low-cycle fatigue tests over a range of strain rates from
   10-4-10 s-1. A three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite-element analysis
   program using a newly formulated dynamic hysteresis model is developed
   by the writers. Accuracy and validity of the developed finite-element
   analysis program is verified by correlation of the analytical and
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, simulations are performed in order to study a
   turbulent premixed flame stabilised behind a bluff body burner.
   Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is the combustion model adopted
   for this purpose and it is coupled with a trajectory gene- rated
   low-dimensional manifold method for chemistry reduction:
   conditional-averaged chemical source terms are closed by
   conditional-averaged scalars, which are obtained by inverting an
   integral equation. Two regularisation methods are implemented. The
   optimal regularisation parameter is determined and a sensitivity
   analysis is performed related to the effect of the value of the
   regularisation parameter. In the present study, only small differences
   in the conditional and unconditional averages are noticed for values of
   the regularisation parameter located in the optimal range determined by
   the L-curve. Two-equation k-epsilon and Shear Stress Transport (SST)
   turbulence models are used to solve the flow field in either the
   reactive or non-reactive case. Different values of the C-epsilon 1
   constant in the standard k-epsilon model and of Y-2 in the SST k-omega
   model are tested. Mean axial velocity and progress variable profiles are
   compared with experimental data. It is found that SST k-omega gives
   better results for the velocity profile in both the reactive and
   non-reactive cases. A value of Y-2 equal to 0.65 provides best
   predictions in the reactive case. The progress variable prediction
   exhibits similar profiles in the case of CSE and the flamelet combustion
   model approach. Very good agreement is achieved between the CSE
   predictions and experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) derived in {[}1] provides a
   bound on the mean square error (MSE) obtained with any nonlinear state
   filter. Computing the PCRLB involves solving complex, multi-dimensional
   expectations, which do not lend themselves to an easy analytical
   solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical or
   simulation-based approaches require a priori access to the true states,
   which may not be available, except in simulations or in carefully
   designed experiments. To allow recursive approximation of the PCRLB when
   the states are hidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential
   Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filters (PFs) is proposed. The approach
   uses SMC methods to estimate the hidden states using a sequence of the
   available sensor measurements. The developed method is general and can
   be used to approximate the PCRLB in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian
   state and sensor noise. The efficacy of the developed method is
   illustrated on two simulation examples, including a practical problem of
   ballistic target tracking at reentry phase.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable effort over the last four decades, research has
   failed to translate into consistently effective treatment options for
   spinal cord injury (SCI). This is partly attributed to differences
   between the injury response of humans and rodent models. Some of this
   difference could be because the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) layer of the
   human spine is relatively large, while that of the rodents is extremely
   thin. We sought to characterize the fluid impulse induced in the CSF by
   experimental SCIs of moderate and high human-like severity, and to
   compare this with previous studies in which fluid impulse has been
   associated with neural tissue injury. We used a new in vivo pig model (n
   = 6 per injury group, mean age 124.5 days, 20.9 kg) incorporating four
   miniature pressure transducers that were implanted in pairs in the
   subarachnoid space, cranial, and caudal to the injury at 30 mm and 100
   mm. Tissue sparing was assessed with Eriochrome Cyanine and Neutral Red
   staining. The median peak pressures near the injury were 522.5 and 868.8
   mmHg (range 96.7-1430.0) and far from the injury were 7.6 and 36.3 mmHg
   (range 3.8-83.7), for the moderate and high injury severities,
   respectively. Pressure impulse (mmHg.ms), apparent wave speed, and
   apparent attenuation factor were also evaluated. The data indicates that
   the fluid pressure wave may be sufficient to affect the severity and
   extent of primary tissue damage close to the injury site. However, the
   CSF pressure was close to normal physiologic values at 100 mm from the
   injury. The high injury severity animals had less tissue sparing than
   the moderate injury severity animals; this difference was statistically
   significant only within 1.6 mm of the epicenter. These results indicate
   that future research seeking to elucidate the mechanical origins of
   primary tissue damage in SCI should consider the effects of CSF. This
   pig model provides advantages for basic and preclinical SCI research due
   to its similarities to human scale, including the existence of a
   human-like CSF fluid layer.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, for the first time, the conduction-based model is
   extended, and then combined with Genetic Algorithm to estimate the
   design parameters of a MFC treating dairy wastewater. The optimized
   parameters are, then, validated. The estimated half-saturation potential
   of -0.13 V (vs. SHE) is in good agreement while the biofilm conductivity
   of 8.76 x 10(-4) mS cm(-1) is three orders of magnitude lower than that
   previously-reported for pure-culture biofilm. Simulations show that the
   ohmic and concentration overpotentials contribute almost equally in
   dropping cell voltage in which the concentration film and biofilm
   conductivity comprise the main resistances, respectively. Thus,
   polarization analysis and determining the controlling steps will be
   possible through that developed extension. This study introduces a
   reliable method to estimate the design parameters of a particular MFC
   and to characterize it. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study examined the impact of transportation
   infrastructure at intersection and non-intersection locations on
   bicycling injury risk.
   Methods In Vancouver and Toronto, we studied adult cyclists who were
   injured and treated at a hospital emergency department. A case-crossover
   design compared the infrastructure of injury and control sites within
   each injured bicyclist's route. Intersection injury sites (N=210) were
   compared to randomly selected intersection control sites (N=272).
   Non-intersection injury sites (N=478) were compared to randomly selected
   non-intersection control sites (N=801).
   Results At intersections, the types of routes meeting and the
   intersection design influenced safety. Intersections of two local
   streets (no demarcated traffic lanes) had approximately one-fifth the
   risk (adjusted OR 0.19, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.66) of intersections of two
   major streets (more than two traffic lanes). Motor vehicle speeds less
   than 30km/h also reduced risk (adjusted OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.92).
   Traffic circles (small roundabouts) on local streets increased the risk
   of these otherwise safe intersections (adjusted OR 7.98, 95\% CI 1.79 to
   35.6). At non-intersection locations, very low risks were found for
   cycle tracks (bike lanes physically separated from motor vehicle
   traffic; adjusted OR 0.05, 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.59) and local streets with
   diverters that reduce motor vehicle traffic (adjusted OR 0.04, 95\% CI
   0.003 to 0.60). Downhill grades increased risks at both intersections
   and non-intersections.
   Conclusions These results provide guidance for transportation planners
   and engineers: at local street intersections, traditional stops are
   safer than traffic circles, and at non-intersections, cycle tracks
   alongside major streets and traffic diversion from local streets are
   safer than no bicycle infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the fragility-based seismic vulnerability
   assessment of retrofitted multicolumn bridge bents. Fragility curves are
   developed to assess the relative performance of various retrofit methods
   under both near-fault and far-field ground motions. A probabilistic
   seismic demand model (PSDM) is used in generating the fragility
   functions. Through nonlinear dynamic analysis, fragility curves are
   developed for multicolumn bridge bents retrofitted with four different
   retrofit techniques, specifically carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   jacketing, steel jacketing, concrete jacketing, and engineered
   cementitious composite (ECC) jacketing. Following the performance-based
   evaluation approach, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of
   different retrofitting methods to minimize the overall seismic
   vulnerability of deficient bridge bents. To investigate the seismic
   responses of the retrofitted bridge bents, a total of 40 earthquake
   excitations, of which 20 are near-fault and 20 are far-field ground
   motions, are utilized to evaluate the likelihood of exceeding the
   seismic capacity of the retrofitted bridge bents. The use of fragility
   curves for retrofitted bridge bents will aid in expressing the potential
   impact of retrofit on the bridge bent vulnerability. The results
   obtained from this study indicate that the bridge bents retrofitted with
   ECC and CFRP jacketing possess less vulnerability at different damage
   states under both near-fault and far-field earthquakes.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{247}},
Pages = {{197-203}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A back-propagation neural network (BP-neural network) model was
   developed to predict the minimum spouting velocity (Urns) in spouted
   beds. Five dimensionless variables involving seven key geometric and
   operating parameters of spouted beds, i.e. column diameter, spout nozzle
   diameter, base angle, static bed height, particle diameter, particle
   density and gas density, were constructed as model inputs. An adaptive
   genetic algorithm was used to determine the nuclear parameters in a
   BP-neural network. 164 experimental data from the published literature
   were divided into two equal groups, for training and validating the
   neural network model, respectively. Comparisons of predictions by the
   BP-neural network and existing empirical equations with experimental
   data showed that Urns values predicted by the BP-neural network were in
   good agreement with experimental values, with a mean relative error of
   12.9\%, somewhat better than calculations by existing empirical
   equations. This indicates that an artificial neural network is a useful
   and promising way to predict U-ms, as an alternative to empirical
   equations, especially when the relationship of geometric and operating
   parameters to U-ms is complex and difficult to describe. (C) 2013

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{The natural frequencies and vibration mode shapes of flat plates are
   simultaneously measured using ESPI. The method involves measuring the
   surface shape of a vibrating plate at high frame rate using a modified
   Michelson interferometer and high-speed camera. The vibration is excited
   here by impact; white (random) noise could alternatively be used.
   Fourier analysis of the acquired data gives the natural frequencies and
   associated mode shapes. The analytical procedure used has the advantage
   that it simultaneously identifies full-field quantitative images of all
   vibration modes with frequencies up to half the sampling frequency. In
   comparison, the ESPI time-averaging and the traditional Chladni methods
   both require that the plate be excited at each natural frequency to
   allow separate qualitative measurements of the associated mode shapes.
   The Instrumented Hammer method and Laser Doppler Vibrometry give
   quantitative measurements but require sequential sampling of individual
   points on the test surface to provide full-field results. Example ESPI
   measurements are presented to illustrate the use and capabilities of the
   proposed plate natural frequency and mode shape measurement method.}},

   couplers is their small bandwidth, as compared to co-directional
   couplers that do not have gratings. The simulation results show that
   this device provides numerous performance advantages compared to
   cascaded racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect without
   contra-directional grating couplers. Specifically, we eliminate the free
   spectral range (FSR, i.e., in both the drop port and the through port)
   and show substantial improvement in the interstitial peak suppression
   and the through port insertion loss for the cascaded racetrack resonator
   with gratings, as compared to the case without gratings. In addition,
   experimental results are presented, which show an interstitial peak
   suppression of 29.3 dB, as well as the elimination of the FSR in the
   drop port and the through port.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of hot tearing during the industrial direct chill (DC)
   casting process results in significant quality issues and a reduction in
   productivity. In order to investigate their occurrence, a new semisolid
   constitutive law (Phillion et al.) for AA5182 that takes into account
   cooling rate, grain size, and porosity has been incorporated within a DC
   casting finite element process model for round billets. A hot tearing
   index was calculated from the semisolid strain predictions from the
   model. This hot tearing index, along with semisolid stress-strain
   predictions from the model, was used to perform a sensitivity analysis
   on the relative effects of microstructural features (e.g., grain size,
   coalescence temperature) as well as process parameters (e.g., casting
   speed) on hot tearing. It was found that grain refinement plays an
   important role in the formation of hot cracks. In addition, the
   combination of slow casting speeds and a low temperature for mechanical
   coalescence was found to improve hot tearing resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian construction industry generates 30\% of the total municipal
   solid waste deposited in landfills. Ample evidence can be found in the
   published literature about rework and waste generation due to ambiguity
   and errors in contract documents. Also, the literature quotes that
   disclaimer clauses in contract documents are included in the contractual
   agreements to prevent contractor claims, which often cause rework. Our
   professional practice has also noted that there are several disclaimer
   clauses in standard contract documents which have the potential to cause
   rework (and associated waste). This article illustrates a comparative
   study of standard contractual documents and their potential to create
   rework (and associated waste) in different regions of the world. The
   objectives of this study are (1) to analyse standard contractual
   documents in Canada, the USA and Australia in terms of their potential
   to generate rework and waste, and (2) to propose changes/amendments to
   the existing standard contract documents to minimise/avoid rework. In
   terms of construction waste management, all the reviewed standard
   contract documents have deficiencies. The parties that produce the
   contract documents include exculpatory clauses to avoid the other
   party's claims. This approach tends to result in rework and construction
   waste. The contractual agreements/contract documents should be free from
   errors, deficiencies, ambiguity and unfair risk transfers to
   minimise/avoid potential to generate rework and waste.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of chlorine dosage and the number of booster locations
   is an important aspect of water quality management in distribution
   networks. Booster chlorination helps to maintain uniformity and adequacy
   of free residual chlorine concentration, essential for safeguarding
   against microbiological contamination. Higher chlorine dosages increase
   free residual chlorine concentration but generate harmful by-products,
   in addition to taste and odor complaints. It is possible to address
   these microbial, chemical, and aesthetic water quality issues through
   free residual chlorine concentration. Estimating a water quality index
   (WQI) based on regulatory chlorine thresholds for microbial, chemical,
   and aesthetics criteria can help engineers make intelligent decisions.
   An innovative scheme for maintaining adequate residual chlorine with
   optimal chlorine dosages and numbers of booster locations was
   established based on a proposed WQI. The City of Kelowna (BC, Canada)
   water distribution network served to demonstrate the application of the
   proposed scheme. Temporal free residual chlorine concentration predicted
   with EPANET software was used to estimate the WQI, later coupled with an
   optimization scheme. Preliminary temporal and spatial analyses
   identified critical zones (relatively poor water quality) in the
   distribution network. The model may also prove useful for small or rural
   communities where free residual chlorine is considered as the only water
   quality criterion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to node activation control
   in parameter estimation via diffusion least mean squares (LMS). Nodes
   cooperate by exchanging estimates over links characterized by the
   connectivity graph of the network. The energy-aware activation control
   is formulated as a noncooperative repeated game where nodes autonomously
   decide when to activate based on a utility function that captures the
   trade-off between individual node's contribution and energy expenditure.
   The diffusion LMS stochastic approximation is combined with a
   game-theoretic learning algorithm such that the overall energy-aware
   diffusion LMS has two timescales: the fast timescale corresponds to the
   game-theoretic activation mechanism, whereby nodes distributively learn
   their optimal activation strategies, whereas the slow timescale
   corresponds to the diffusion LMS. The convergence analysis shows that
   the parameter estimates weakly converge to the true parameter across the
   network, yet the global activation behavior along the way tracks the set
   of correlated equilibria of the underlying activation control game.}},

   algorithm and agents independently follow this algorithm, their
   collective behavior is agile in tracking the time-varying convex

Abstract = {{The integrity and robustness of Pd-based composite membranes depend
   heavily on the quality of the metallic substrate. This paper presents an
   improved method for pre-treating the substrate. Detailed pre-treatment
   steps of these porous stainless steel substrates included washing,
   polishing, etching, coating the first alumina layer, calcining the first
   alumina layer, coating the second alumina layer, calcining the second
   alumina layer and repair. The repair cycle was the most helpful step,
   greatly improving the membrane reproducibility and stability. Repeat
   coating with dilute suspensions of alumina particles of 0.3 mu m mean
   diameter can repair defects on the top alumina layer. The hydrogen
   permeation flux was 268x10(-4)Nm(3)/(m(2)hPa) after one repair cycle,
   decreasing by 14\% after an additional repair cycle. The hydrogen
   permeation flux of the pre-treated porous stainless steel substrate was
   thus maintained at a level comparable with previous work. Surface
   topography revealed that the average roughness was reduced from 1.15 to
   0.47 mu m, and the surface Maximum Peak to Valley decreased from 17.5 to
   6.0 mu m/mm(2) as a result of the pre-treatment.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the fabrication and performance of an all-polymer, flexural
   plate wave gravimetric sensor using flexible, piezoelectric
   Polyvinylidene fluoride as the substrate and an inkjet-printed
   interdigital transducer (IDT) employing conductive poly(3,
   4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) to excite Lamb waves
   within the film. Lamb waves are measured both electronically, using a
   second IDT, and mapped directly using a scanning laser Doppler
   vibrometer. Pulsed wave excitation is utilized to isolate the weak
   acoustic signal from the electromagnetic crosstalk, enabling the
   measurement of relative changes in the resonant frequency, Delta f/f(0),
   in response to added mass, Delta m, to the sensing area. A gravimetric
   mass sensitivity equivalent to Delta f/(f(0)Delta m) = -153 cm(2)/g is
   measured by mass loading the sensor with printed polymer layers. It is
   found that the low stiffness of the substrate contributes significantly
   to the response of the sensor, yielding a measured overall sensitivity
   of Delta f/(f(0)Delta m) = -83 cm(2)/g.}},

Abstract = {{A novel wavelet transform cardiorespiratory coherence (WTCRC) algorithm
   has been developed to measure the autonomic state. WTCRC may be used as
   a nociception index, ranging from 0 (no nociception, strong coherence)
   to 100 (strong nociception, low coherence). The aim of this study is to
   estimate the sensitivity of the algorithm to nociception (dental dam
   insertions) and antinociception (bolus doses of anesthetic drugs).
   WTCRC's sensitivity is compared to mean heart rate (HRmean) and mean
   non-invasive blood pressure (NIBPmean), which are commonly used clinical
   signs. Data were collected from 48 children receiving general anesthesia
   during dental surgery. The times of dental dam insertion and anesthetic
   bolus events were noted in real-time during surgeries. 42 dental dam
   insertion and 57 anesthetic bolus events were analyzed. The change in
   average WTCRC, HRmean, and NIBPmean was calculated between a baseline
   period before each event and a response period after. A Wilcoxon
   rank-sum test was used to compare changes. Dental dam insertion changed
   the WTCRC nociception index by an average of 14 (82 \%) {[}95 \% CI from
   7.4 to 19], HRmean by 7.3 beats/min (8.1 \%) {[}5.6-9.6], and NIBPmean
   by 8.3 mmHg (12 \%) {[}4.9-13]. A bolus dose of anesthetics changed the
   WTCRC by -15 (-50 \%) {[}-21 to -9.3], HRmean by -4.8 beats/min (4.6 \%)
   {[}-6.6 to -2.9], and NIBPmean by -2.6 mmHg (3.4 \%) {[}-4.7 to -0.50].
   A nociception index based on cardiorespiratory coherence is more
   sensitive to nociception and antinociception than are HRmean or
   NIBPmean. The WTCRC algorithm shows promise for noninvasively monitoring
   nociception during general anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation mechanisms and hot corrosion behavior of weld overlay alloy
   625 were studied. Phase structure, morphology, thermal behavior, and
   chemical composition of deposited salt mixture on the weld overlay were
   characterized utilizing XRD, SEM/EDX, DTA, and ICP/OES, respectively.
   Dilution level of Fe in the weldment, dendritic structure, and
   degradation mechanisms of the weld were investigated. A molten phase
   formed on the weld layer at the operating temperature range of the
   boiler, which led to the hot corrosion attack in the water wall and the
   ultimate failure. Open circuit potential and weight-loss measurements
   and potentiodynamic polarization were carried out to study the hot
   corrosion behavior of the weld in the simulated molten salt medium at
   873 K, 973 K, and 1073 K (600 A degrees C, 700 A degrees C, and 800 A
   degrees C). Internal oxidation and sulfidation plus pitting corrosion
   were identified as the main hot corrosion mechanisms in the weld and
   boiler tubes. The presence of a significant amount of Fe made the
   dendritic structure of the weld susceptible to preferential corrosion.
   Preferentially corroded (Mo, Nb)-depleted dendrite cores acted as
   potential sites for crack initiation from the surface layer. The
   penetration of the molten phase into the cracks accelerated the cracks'
   propagation mainly through the dendrite cores and further crack
   branching/widening. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and

Abstract = {{Wireless mesh networking (WMN) is an emerging technology for future
   broadband wireless access. The proliferation of the mobile computing
   devices that are equipped with cameras and ad hoc communication mode
   creates the possibility of exchanging real-time data between mobile
   users in wireless mesh networks. In this paper, we argue for a
   ring-based multicast routing topology with support from infrastructure
   nodes for group communications in WMNs. We study the performance of
   multicast communication over a ring routing topology when 802.11 with
   RTS/CTS scheme is used at the MAC layer to enable reliable multicast
   services in WMNs. We propose an algorithm to enhance the IP multicast
   routing on the ring topology. We show that when mesh routers on a ring
   topology support group communications by employing our proposed
   algorithms, a significant performance enhancement is realized. We
   analytically compute the end-to-end delay on a ring multicast routing
   topology. Our results show that the end-to-end delay is reduced about 33
   \%, and the capacity of multicast network (i.e., maximum group size that
   the ring can serve with QoS guarantees) is increased about 50 \% as
   compared to conventional schemes. We also use our analytical results to
   develop heuristic algorithms for constructing an efficient ring-based
   multicast routing topology with QoS guarantees. The proposed algorithms
   take into account all possible traffic interference when constructing
   the multicast ring topology. Thus, the constructed ring topology
   provides QoS guarantees for the multicast traffic and minimizes the cost
   of group communications in WMNs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the analysis and design of a vibration-based
   energy harvester for rotary motion applications. The energy harvester
   consists of a cantilever beam with a tip mass and a piezoelectric
   ceramic attached along the beam that is mounted on a rotating shaft.
   Using this system, mechanical vibration energy is induced in the
   flexible beam due to the gravitational force applied to the tip mass
   while the hub is rotating. The piezoelectric transducer is used to
   convert the induced mechanical vibration energy into electricity. The
   equations of motion of the flexible structure are utilized along with
   the physical characteristics of the piezoelectric transducer to derive
   expressions for the electrical power. Furthermore, expressions for the
   optimum load resistance and maximum output power are obtained and
   validated experimentally using PVDF and PZT transducers. The results
   indicate that a maximum power of 6.4 mW at a shaft speed of 138 rad/s
   can be extracted by using a PZT transducer with dimensions 50.8 mm x
   38.1 mm x 0.13 mm. This amount of power is sufficient to provide power

Abstract = {{Continuous operation of pipeline systems involves significant
   expenditures in inspection and maintenance activities. The
   cost-effective safety management of such systems involves allocating the
   optimal amount of resources to inspection and maintenance activities, in
   order to control risks (expected costs of failure). In this context,
   this article addresses the optimal inspection planning for onshore
   pipelines subject to external corrosion. The investigation addresses a
   challenging problem of practical relevance, and strives for using the
   best available models to describe random corrosion growth and the
   relevant limit state functions. A single pipeline segment is considered
   in this paper. Expected numbers of failures and repairs are evaluated by
   Monte Carlo sampling, and a novel procedure is employed to evaluate
   sensitivities of the objective function with respect to design
   parameters. This procedure is shown to be accurate and more efficient
   than finite differences. The optimum inspection interval is found for an
   example problem, and the robustness of this optimum to the assumed
   inspection and failure costs is investigated. It is shown that optimum
   total expected costs found herein are not highly sensitive to the
   assumed costs of inspection and failure. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The mainstream technology for leaching gold from gold ore is still
   leaching in aqueous alkaline cyanide solution. However, when copper
   minerals are present in the gold ore, high levels of free cyanide must
   be maintained during leaching because many common copper minerals react
   with cyanide, forming copper cyanide complexes that deplete the solution
   of free cyanide. This results in a significant economical penalty
   through excessive cyanide consumption and loss of valuable copper in
   tails. Environmental constraints controlling the discharge of cyanide
   from mining industry are being tightened by local governments worldwide.
   The solution chemistry of copper in cyanide solution and various
   technologies for the recovery of copper and cyanide from barren gold
   cyanide solutions were reviewed in the paper. Direct recovery methods
   are mainly based on the acidificationvolatilizationreneutralization
   (AVR) process or its modifications. These processes are not very
   efficient for treating low cyanide solutions and high metal cyanide
   solutions due to their substantial operational cost. Indirect recovery
   technologies by activated carbon, ion-exchange resins (IX) and solvent
   extraction (SX) have been extensively studied. The basic principle of
   these technologies is to pre-concentrate copper (and part of cyanide)
   into a small volume of eluant or stripping solution. The copper and
   cyanide in the resulted solutions can be further recovered by AVR or
   similar processes or by the electrowinning process. Activated carbon is
   only suitable for use as a polishing process to remove cyanide to lower
   levels from those cyanide solutions where the cyanide content is already
   low. Compared to activated carbon, ion exchange resins are less easily
   poisoned by organic matter and can usually be eluted at room
   temperature, and selectivity for particular metals can be achieved by
   the choice of the functional group incorporated into the bead or by the
   selective elution process. Solvent extraction process developed base on
   guanidine and modified quaternary amines exhibit relative fast
   extraction kinetics and can be operated in a continuous manner. It will
   be necessary to thicken and wash the solids in order to produce a
   clarified feed solution while treating the slurry from operations using
   carbon-in-pulp (CIP) for the recovery of gold. Other copper and cyanide
   recovery technologies such as biosorption or direct electrowinning were
   also proposed, but they have still not found their way to practical
   application.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of activated carbon on the electrochemical dissolution of
   enargite was studied in solutions of different acid and ferric sulphate
   concentration. The dissolution of enargite was studied by OCP
   measurement, EIS and Mott-Schottky techniques and the results were
   interpreted in terms of mixed-potential theory. Activated carbon
   increased the dissolution current density of enargite by more than two
   orders of magnitude in iron-free solutions and by factors of about 30 in
   iron-containing solutions. It was shown that the catalytic effect of
   carbon on the dissolution of enargite is more complex than simply acting
   as an extended surface area for the reduction of O-2 or Fe3+ but may
   also be a consequence of changes in the semiconducting properties of the
   enargite. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic wood fibers and mineral fillers (calcium carbonate,
   talc, or clay) were used to prepare paper samples (handsheets), which
   were then subjected to a fluorocarbon plasma treatment. The plasma
   treatment was performed in two steps: first using oxygen plasma to
   create nanoscale roughness on the surface of the handsheet, and second
   fluorocarbon deposition plasma to add a layer of low surface energy
   material. The wetting behavior of the resulting fiber/mineral network
   (handsheet) was determined. It was found the samples that were subjected
   to oxygen plasma etching prior to fluorocarbon deposition exhibit
   superhydrophobicity with low contact angle hysteresis. On the other
   hand, those that were only treated by fluorocarbon plasma resulted in
   ``sticky{''} hydrophobicity behavior. Moreover, as the mineral content
   in the handsheet increases, the hydrophobicity after plasma treatment
   decreases. Finally, it was found that although the plasma-treated
   handsheets show excellent water repellency they are not good water vapor
   barriers.}},

Title = {{The curvature of the nanotube sidewall and its effect on the electronic
   and optical properties of zigzag nanotubes}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1020}},
Pages = {{32-37}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we employ the density functional theory to perform a
   thorough study of the impact of the nanotube sidewall curvature on the
   optical properties by investigating several effects arising from this
   curvature, such as sigma-pi orbital rehybridization, the carbon-carbon
   bond length, and the mixing of d and p orbitals. Separating these and
   studying their effects independently, provides insight into the reasons
   behind the different values obtained for optical transition energies in
   experiments and in tight-binding/zonefolding calculations, where the
   curvature of the nanotube sidewall is neglected. As well, it is useful
   in the understanding of how and to what extent each of these effects are
   responsible for the accurate prediction of the electronic and optical
   properties of carbon nanotubes. Although the sigma-pi rehybridization is
   known as the main curvature effect in the literature, we show that the
   effect of bond length is quite significant as well and needs to be
   properly taken into account. For example, the first transition energy
   (E-11) of a (4,0) nanotube is decreased by similar to 64\% and similar
   to 46\% due to sigma-pi rehybridization and bond length effect,
   respectively. Another important observation is that the overall effect
   of sigma-pi rehybridization and bond length does not have a monotonous
   diameter dependence. Rather, our study suggests a dependence on the
   nanotube index, n, since zigzag nanotubes with n(mod)3 = 1 show a
   different behavior compared to the ones with n(mod)3 = 2. We also show
   that for some of the nanotubes, the effect of including the d orbitals
   on the optical transition energies can be as significant as the effect
   of sigma-pi orbital rehybridization and bond length. Due to the
   importance of the bond length effect, we also investigate several
   methods of geometry optimization for nanotubes. It appears that the
   HSEH1PBE functional might lead to the most accurate prediction of the
   nanotube geometry compared to the other functionals tested. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Fate and removal of 16 steroidal (estrogenic, androgenic and
   progestogenic) hormones were studied during advanced anaerobic digestion
   of sludge cake using microwave (MW) pretreatment. Effect of pretreatment
   temperature (80, 120, 160 degrees C), operating temperature (mesophilic
   at 35 +/- 2 degrees C, thermophilic at 55 +/- 2 degrees C) and sludge
   retention time (SRT: 20, 10, 5 days) were studied employing eight
   lab-scale semi-continuously fed digesters. To determine the potential
   effect of MW hydrolysis, hormones were quantified in total (sorbed +
   soluble) and supernatant (soluble) phases of the digester influent and
   effluent streams. Seven of 16 hormones were above the method reporting
   limit (RL) in one or more of the samples. Hormone concentrations in
   total phase of un-pretreated (control) and pretreated digester feeds
   ranged in <157-2491 ng/L and <157-749 ng/L, respectively. The three
   studied factors were found to be statistically significant (95\%
   confidence level) in removal of one or more hormones from soluble and/or
   total phase. MW hydrolysis of the influent resulted in both release
   (from sludge matrix) and attenuation of hormones in the soluble phase.
   Accumulation of estrone (E1) as well as progesterone (Pr) and
   androstenedione (Ad) in most of the digesters indicated possible
   microbial transformations among the hormones. Compared to controls, all
   pretreated digesters had lower total hormone concentrations in their
   influent streams. At 20 days SET, highest total removal (E1+E2+Ad+Pr)
   was observed for the thermophilic control digester (56\%), followed by
   pretreated mesophilic digesters at 120 degrees C and 160 degrees C with
   around 48\% efficiency. In terms of conventional performance parameters,
   relative (to control) improvements of MW pretreated digesters at a 5-d
   SET ranged in 98-163\% and 57-121\%, for volatile solids removal and

Abstract = {{Microwave (2.45 GHz, 1200 W) and conventional heating (custom pressure
   vessel) pretreatments were applied to dewatered municipal waste sludge
   (18\% total solids) using identical heating profiles that span a wide
   range of temperatures (80-160 degrees C) Fourteen lab-scale
   semi-continuous digesters were set up to optimize the energy (methane)
   output and sludge retention time (SRT) requirements of untreated
   (control) and thermally pretreated anaerobic digesters operated under
   mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. Both pretreatment methods
   indicated that in the pretreatment range of 80-160 degrees C,
   temperature was a statistically significant factor ( p-value < 0.05) for
   increasing solubilization of chemical oxygen demand and biopolymers
   (proteins, sugars, humic acids) of the waste sludge. However, the type
   of pretreatment method, i.e. microwave versus conventional heating, had
   no statistically significant effect ( p-value >0.05) on sludge
   solubilization. With the exception of the control digesters at a 5-d
   SRT, all control and pretreated digesters achieved steady state at all
   three SRTs, corresponding to volumetric organic loading rates of
   1.74-6.96 g chemical oxygen demand/L/d. At an SRT of 5 d, both
   mesophilic and then mophilic controls stopped producing biogas after 20
   d of operation with total volatile fatty acids concentrations exceeding
   1818 mg/L at pH <5.64 for mesophilic and 2853 mg/L at pH <7.02 for
   thermophilic controls, while the pretreated digesters continued
   producing biogas. Furthermore, relative (to control) organic removal
   efficiencies dramatically increased as SRT was shortened from 20 to 10
   and then 5 d, indicating that the control digesters were challenged as
   the organic loading rate was increased. Energy analysis showed that, at
   an elevated temperature of 160 degrees C, the amount of methane
   recovered was not enough to compensate for the energy input. Among the
   digesters with positive net energy productions, control and pretreated
   digesters at 80 degrees C were more favorable at an SRT of 10 d. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work, iron speciation in electrocoagulation (EC) was studied to
   determine the impact of operating parameters on natural organic matter
   (NOM) removal from natural water. Two electrochemical EC parameters,
   current density (i) and charge loading rate (CLR), were investigated.
   Variation of these parameters led to a near unity current efficiency
   (phi = 0.957 +/- 0.03), at any combination of i in a range of 1-25
   mA/cm(2) and CLR in a range of 12-300 C/L/min. Higher i and CLR led to a
   higher bulk pH and limited the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) reduced
   at the cathode surface due to mass transfer limitations. A low i (1
   mA/cm(2)) and intermediate CLR (60 C/L/min) resulted in low bulk DO
   (<2.5 mg/L), where green rust (GR) was identified by in-situ Raman
   spectroscopy as the primary crystalline electrochemical product. Longer
   electrolysis times at higher i led to magnetite (Fe3O4) formation. Both
   higher (300 C/L/min) and lower (12 C/L/min) CLR values led to increased
   DO and/or increased pH, with lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) as the only
   crystalline species observed. The NOM removal of the three identified
   species was compared, with conditions leading to GR formation showing
   the greatest dissolved organic carbon removal, and highest removal of
   the low apparent molecular weight (<550 Da) chromophoric NOM fraction,
   determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography. (C) 2013

Title = {{Assessing the effects of sodium hypochlorite exposure on the
   characteristics of PVDF based membranes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{5392-5399}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used as a cleaning agent to remove
   adsorbed foulants from PVDF based micro/ultra filtration membranes in
   water and wastewater treatment applications. Although effective for
   fouling control, extended sodium hypochlorite exposure can affect the
   physical/chemical characteristics and hinder the treatment performance
   of these membranes. To assess these effects, PVDF based membranes were
   exposed to sodium hypochlorite at different concentrations for varying
   periods of time, and the physical/chemical characteristics of the virgin
   and sodium hypochlorite exposed membranes were compared. The membranes
   were characterized based on chemical composition (FTIR and NMR),
   mechanical strength (yield strength), surface hydrophilicity (contact
   angle), pore size and porosity (scanning electron microscopy and
   challenge test), and membrane resistance (clean water permeation test).
   The results indicated that exposure dose and concentration of the sodium
   hypochlorite used have significant influence on the membrane
   characteristics. The impact of sodium hypochlorite exposure on the
   parameters investigated could be most accurately and consistently
   correlated to an exposure dose relationship of the form C(n)t (where, C
   = concentration and t = exposure time) rather than the Ct relationship
   commonly used to define the extent of exposure to cleaning agents. For
   all the parameters investigated, the power coefficient n was less than 1
   indicating that time had a greater impact on the changes than did the
   concentration of the sodium hypochlorite. The results suggest that the
   use of sodium hypochlorite for chemical cleaning, at concentrations that
   are higher than those typically used for chemical cleaning would have
   less of an effect on the characteristics of the membrane materials.
   Changes in the characteristics were attributed to the oxidation of the
   hydrophilic additives (HA) present in blended PVDF membranes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, a fluorescein solution is injected into the gas diffusion
   layer (GDL) of a PEM fuel cell to simulate water flow through the porous
   medium under flooding conditions. The effect of the GDL hydrophobic
   treatment is studied by analyzing the images obtained from fluorescence
   microscopy. The intensity of images is correlated to the liquid water
   content in the medium. As a result, three distinguishable patterns are
   recognized between the treated and untreated GDL samples. These patterns
   include: (1) initial invasion, (2) progression and (3) pore filling.
   Based on the flow characteristics, a pore-network model is developed and
   applied to unique network geometry with different hydrophobic fractions
   to study the effect of hydrophobicity on the flow configuration. It is
   shown that the model predicts the flow configurations which are
   qualitatively in agreement with the experimental observation. The model
   is then used to obtain saturation for samples with different hydrophobic
   fractions. The trend is in agreement with the results reported in the
   past. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The one-step predictive dead-time control circuit proposed in this paper
   consists of a dead-time detection circuit and an analog optimization
   circuit. The detection circuit, which can be manufactured on the same

   accurate detection signal that indicates body diode conduction. The
   proposed dead-time optimization circuit is an analog circuit, which uses
   the body diode detection signal and eliminates the shortcomings of
   digital dead-time detection circuits. Operation of the circuit is
   verified using PSIM. The results of the simulation show that the circuit
   reduces the body diode conduction time of the synchronous MOSFET to less
   than 4 ns at 20-A load, 12-V input, 1.2-V output, and 500-kHz switching
   frequency. As a result, the buck converter conduction losses can be

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets (NSs) with high active site density were

   obtained at 550 degrees C reveals the best HER performance with a
   relatively small Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec. Both the exposed surface area
   and active site density are very important for providing a large amount

Abstract = {{Periodic composites such as acoustic metamaterials use local resonance
   phenomenon in designing low frequency sub-Bragg bandgaps. These bandgaps
   emerge from a resonant scattering interaction between a propagating wave
   and periodically arranged resonators. This paper develops a receptance
   coupling technique to combine the dynamics of the resonator with the
   unit cell dynamics of the background medium to analyze flexural wave
   transmission in a periodic structure, involving a single degree of
   freedom coupling between the medium and the resonator. Receptance
   techniques allow for a straightforward extension to higher dimensional
   systems with multiple degrees of freedom coupling and for easier
   experimental measurements. Closed-form expressions for the location and
   width of sub-Bragg bandgaps are obtained. Rigid body modes of the unit
   cell of the background medium are shown to set the bounding frequencies
   for local resonance bandgaps. Results from the receptance analysis
   compare well with Bloch wave analysis and experiments performed on a
   finite structural beam with periodic masses and resonators. Stronger
   coupling and inertia of the resonator increase the local resonance
   bandgap width. Two-fold periodicity widens the Bragg bandgap, narrowed
   by local resonators, thus expanding the design space and highlighting
   the advantages of hierarchical periodicity. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society

Abstract = {{Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) process was used to fabricate a novel
   Al-SiC master alloy for AZ91E magnesium alloys. The master alloy enabled
   homogeneous distribution of SiC particles in the alloy matrix. With an
   addition of 0.1 wt.\% Al-SiC master alloy, the mean grain size decreased
   by 15 \%. It is proposed that binary Mg-C carbides possibly provided
   heterogeneous nucleation sites for grain refinement. However, further
   additions of Al-SiC caused grain coarsening, where formation of the MgC
   carbides was inhibited by precipitation of undesirable AlCMn3
   intermetallic particles. The grain refining and coarsening mechanisms
   were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy

Title = {{High precision control of gap height for enhancing principal digital

Abstract = {{A variable gap size actuation (VGSA) mechanism is integrated into the
   digital microfluidic (DMF) system. The VGSA mechanism serves to optimize
   the aspect ratio during performing different microfluidic operations by
   changing the gap height between the top and bottom plates. This in
   effect will have a direct impact on the four main DMF operations
   including droplet transport, splitting, dispensing and merging as they
   are greatly affected by changing the aspect ratio. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the VGSA mechanism significantly enhances the principal
   DMF operations by retaining the appropriate gap height for each
   operation which is also dependent on droplets volumes when using fixed
   electrode size. Specifically, varying the gap height precisely between
   the two plates will enable us to transport the droplets more reliably,
   control the volume of the dispensed droplet, carry out splitting and
   merging more effectively, facilitate motion of residual droplets
   resulting from splitting or partial evaporation, enhance mixing at
   faster rates, achieve accurate positioning of droplets regardless of
   their volume, and minimize evaporation without complicating the DMF
   system with the use of a filler medium. The proposed mechanism is
   realized by accurate positioning of the top plate over the fixed bottom
   plate, instead of maintaining a fixed gap height during the operation.
   In this work, an experimental setup is constructed for the proof of
   concept to meet precise alignment requirements of the two parallel
   plates using a feedback-controlled positioning system. Three different
   methods viz., visual, capacitance-based and encoder values, are used to
   measure the gap height between the two plates precisely. For practical
   lab-on-chip devices, micro-actuators in conjunction with capacitance
   measurement feedback can be used to position the top plate during the
   operation. In this way, the proposed VGSA mechanism will introduce a
   mean for optimizing the parameters controlling the DMF operations. (C)

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Modeling, identification (experimental modeling), and design of dynamic
   systems and the associated problem of controller design are common
   problems in the field of mechatronics. A typical mechatronic problem
   entails finding the best topology as well as parameter values of the
   desired solution. In view of dynamic interactions in a mechatronic
   system, which involves more than one domain, it is desirable to use
   concurrent and integrated methodology in the solution. The powerful
   search ability of genetic programming (GP) along with the domain
   independence and the open architecture of bond graph (BG) modeling can
   be integrated to develop an evolutionary mechatronic tool for
   identification of a complex mechatronic system. This paper extends this
   integrated approach to nonlinear mechatronic problems and develops a
   software tool for this purpose. It is illustrated how the developed
   technique and the corresponding software tool can be used in the
   automated synthesis and identification of a nonlinear mechatronic
   system. The performance of the software tool is validated by applying it
   to a nonlinear electrohydraulic manipulator, which falls into the class
   of multidomain systems. The results obtained from the application are
   quite encouraging, and form a rationale for the extension of the tool
   for concurrent and optimal design of mechatronic systems.}},

Pages = {{4376-4391}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a joint transceiver design for single-carrier
   frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) based multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems. To this end, we first derive the
   optimal minimum mean-squared error linear and decision-feedback
   frequency-domain equalization filters at the destination along with the
   corresponding error covariance matrices at the output of the equalizer.
   Subsequently, we formulate the source and relay precoding matrix design
   problem as the minimization of a family of Schur-convex and
   Schur-concave functions of the mean-squared errors at the output of the
   equalizer under separate power constraints for the source and the relay.
   By exploiting properties of the error covariance matrix and results from
   majorization theory, we derive the optimal structures of the source and
   relay precoding matrices, which allows us to transform the matrix
   optimization problem into a scalar power optimization problem. Adopting
   a high signal-to-noise ratio approximation for the objective function,
   we obtain the global optimal solution for the power allocation
   variables. We illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed
   system and compare it to that of conventional orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing MIMO relay systems based on computer
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the latest developments of a constitutive
   modelling framework, CODAM (COmposite DAmage Model), for predicting the
   non-linear in-plane response of composite laminates using continuum
   damage mechanics. The methodology is best suited for non-linear
   structural analysis of large-scale laminated composites whose boundaries
   do not interfere/interact with the damage zone that develops and grows
   within the structure. The new development presented here, CODAM2,
   addresses the deficiencies in both the numerical and material
   objectivity of the original version of CODAM. While the previous CODAM
   formulation was essentially a local smeared crack model that was
   augmented with crack band scaling to overcome one aspect of the
   numerical objectivity, namely the mesh-sensitivity, CODAM2 introduces a
   non-local regularisation scheme to alleviate both the spurious mesh
   dependency and mesh orientation problems that plague all local
   strain-softening models. Two of the 13 test cases, provided in the
   third-world wide failure exercise, which were related to the in-plane
   tensile and compressive loading of open hole specimens, were used in
   order to demonstrate the effectiveness of CODAM2 in predicting the
   damage development and the corresponding overall response in such
   structural loading configurations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a vision-based localization system using
   mobile augmented reality (MAR) and mobile audio augmented reality (MAAR)
   techniques, applicable to both humans and humanoid robots navigation in
   indoor environments. In the first stage, we propose a system that
   recognizes the location of a user from the image sequence of an indoor
   environment using its onboard camera. The location information is added
   to the user's view in the form of 3D objects and audio sounds with
   location information and navigation instruction content via augmented
   reality (AR). The location is recognized by using the prior knowledge
   about the layout of the environment and the location of the AR markers.
   The image sequence can be obtained using a smart phone's camera and the
   marker detection, 3D object placement and audio augmentation will be
   performed by the phone's operating processor and graphical/audio
   modules. Using this system will majorly reduce the hardware complexity
   of such navigation systems, as it replaces a system consisting of a
   mobile PC, wireless camera, head-mounted displays (HMD) and a remote PC
   with a smart phone with camera. In the second stage, the same algorithm
   is employed as a novel vision-based autonomous humanoid robot
   localization and navigation approach. The proposed technique is
   implemented on a humanoid robot NAO and improves the robot's navigation
   and localization performance previously done using an extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) by presenting location-based information to the robot
   through different AR markers placed in the robot environment.}},

   are also presented. Our asymptotic analyses show that the diversity
   order of the studied system depends only on the effective number of
   small-scale cells of the scattering process in the atmosphere. Our
   performance analyses confirm that the repetition code outperforms OSTBC
   for subcarrier PSK-based systems over the Gamma-Gamma channels. The

Abstract = {{As the number of cores and threads in throughput accelerators such as
   Graphics Processing Units (GPU) increases, so does the importance of
   on-chip interconnection network design. This article explores
   throughput-effective Network-on-Chips (NoC) for future compute
   accelerators that employ Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) programming
   models such as CUDA and OpenCL. A hardware optimization is ``throughput
   effective{''} if it improves parallel application-level performance per
   unit chip area. We evaluate performance of future looking workloads
   using detailed closed-loop simulations modeling compute nodes, NoC, and
   the DRAM memory system. We start from a mesh design with bisection
   bandwidth balanced to off-chip demand. Accelerator workloads tend to
   demand high off-chip memory bandwidth which results in a many-to-few
   traffic pattern when coupled with expected technology constraints of
   slow growth in pins-per-chip. Leveraging these observations we reduce
   NoC area by proposing a ``checkerboard{''} NoC which alternates between
   conventional full routers and half routers with limited connectivity.
   Next, we show that increasing network terminal bandwidth at the nodes
   connected to DRAM controllers alleviates a significant fraction of the
   remaining imbalance resulting from the many-to-few traffic pattern.
   Furthermore, we propose a ``double checkerboard inverted{''} NoC
   organization which takes advantage of channel slicing to reduce area
   while maintaining the performance improvements of the aforementioned
   techniques. This organization also has a simpler routing mechanism and
   improves average application throughput per unit area by 24.3\%.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3084-3097}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a greedy user selection with swap (GUSS)
   algorithm based on zero-forcing beamforming for multiuser
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink channels. Existing user
   selection algorithms such as zero forcing with selection (ZFS) have the
   flaws of ``redundant users{''} and ``local optimum,{''} which compromise
   the achieved sum rate. GUSS improves the performance by adding the
   ``delete{''} and ``swap{''} operations to the user selection procedure
   of ZFS to eliminate ``redundant users{''} and escape from ``local
   optimum,{''} respectively. In addition, an
   effective-channel-vector-based effective-channel-gain-updating scheme is
   proposed to reduce the complexity of GUSS. With the help of this
   updating scheme, GUSS has the same order of complexity as ZFS with only
   a linear increment. Simulation results indicate that over the range of
   transmit signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) considered, on average, the sum
   rate of GUSS reaches 99.3\% of the upper bound that is achieved by
   exhaustive search, with only 1.51 to 2.29 times the complexity of ZFS.}},

Title = {{A weighted residual method for two-layer non-Newtonian channel flows:
   steady-state results and their stability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{731}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We study buoyant displacement flows in a plane channel with two fluids
   in the long-wavelength limit in a stratified configuration. Weak
   inertial effects are accounted for by developing a weighted residual
   method. This gives a first-order approximation to the interface height
   and flux functions in each layer. As the fluids are shear-thinning and
   have a yield stress, to retain a formulation that can be resolved
   analytically requires the development of a system of special functions
   for the weight functions and various integrals related to the base flow.
   For displacement flows, the addition of inertia can either slightly
   increase or decrease the speed of the leading displacement front, which
   governs the displacement efficiency. A more subtle effect is that a
   wider range of interface heights are stretched between advancing fronts
   than without inertia. We study stability of these systems via both a
   linear temporal analysis and a numerical spatiotemporal method. To start
   with, the Orr-Sommerfeld equations are first derived for two generalized
   non-Newtonian fluids satisfying the Herschel-Bulkley model, and
   analytical expressions for growth rate and wave speed are obtained for
   the long-wavelength limit. The predictions of linear analysis based on
   the weighted residual method shows excellent agreement with the
   Orr-Sommerfeld approach. For displacement flows in unstable parameter
   ranges we do observe growth of interfacial waves that saturate
   nonlinearly and disperse. The observed waves have similar
   characteristics to those observed experimentally in pipe flow
   displacements. Although the focus in this study is on displacement
   flows, the formulation laid out can be easily used for similar two-layer
   flows, e.g. co-extrusion flows.}},

   Comparative optical and electrochemical studies demonstrate a

   reveal that the thiophene-substituted TTA structure consists of slipped
   -stacks with several close intrastack - interactions; no close contacts
   are observed for the benzene derivative due to twisting of the thiophene
   ligands out of plane. Consequently, the molecules in the benzene
   analogue are isolated from their neighbours. The thiophene and
   bithiophene functionalised TTA compounds were fabricated into OTFT

Abstract = {{Nacre tablets from the shell of Pinctada maxima were studied with SEM,
   TEM and STEM. The systematic nanolath morphology on the (001) surface of
   nacre tablets was observed after acidic etching and mechanical
   polishing. The nanolaths were along the {[}100] crystallographic
   orientation of aragonite crystal. The (010) and (100) cross section
   surfaces of the nacre tablets showed nanolath and nanograin
   morphologies, respectively, which was consistent with {[}100]
   crystallographic orientation of nanolath on the (001) surface.
   Sheet-like defects with low mass density were observed on the (001)
   plane inside nacre tablets and were considered to be the cause of
   nanolath morphology revealed on the surfaces by acidic etching and
   mechanical polishing. On the other hand, large block {[}110] twins that

Abstract = {{Classical meso-scale models for dislocation-obstacle interactions have,
   by and large, assumed a random distribution of obstacles on the glide
   plane. While a good approximation in many situations, this does not
   represent materials where obstacles are clustered on the glide plane. In
   this work, we have investigated the statistical problem of a dislocation
   sampling a set of clustered point obstacles in the glide plane using a
   modified areal-glide model. The results of these simulations show two
   clear regimes. For weak obstacles, the spatial distribution does not
   matter and the critically resolved shear stress is found to be
   independent of the degree of clustering. In contrast, above a critical
   obstacle strength determined by the degree of clustering, the critical
   resolved shear strength becomes constant. It is shown that this
   behaviour can be explained semi-analytically by considering the
   probability of interaction between the dislocation line and obstacles at
   a given level of stress. The consequences for alloys exhibiting solute
   clustering are discussed.}},

Title = {{Mass balance evaluation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in landfill
   leachate and potential for transfer from e-waste}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{461}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) has largely focussed on their
   concentrations in the environment and their adverse effects on human
   health. This paper explores their transfer from waste streams to water
   and soil. A comprehensive mass balance model is developed to track
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), originating from e-waste and
   non-e-waste solids leaching from a landfill. Stepwise debromination is
   assumed to occur in three sub-systems (e-waste, aqueous leachate phase,
   and non-e-waste solids). Analysis of landfill samples and laboratory
   results from a solid-liquid contacting chamber are used to estimate
   model parameters to simulate an urban landfill system, for past and
   future scenarios. Sensitivity tests to key model parameters were
   conducted. Lower BDEs require more time to disappear than high-molecular
   weight PBDEs, since debromination takes place in a stepwise manner,
   according to the simplified reaction scheme. Interphase mass transfer
   causes the decay pattern to be similar in all three sub-systems. The
   aqueous phase is predicted to be the first sub-system to eliminate PBDEs
   if their input to the landfill were to be stopped. The non-e-waste
   solids would be next, followed by the e-waste sub-system. The model
   shows that mass transfer is not rate-limiting, but the evolution over
   time depends on the kinetic degradation parameters. Experimental scatter
   makes model testing difficult. Nevertheless, the model provides
   qualitative understanding of the influence of key variables. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Rheological properties of pelletizing steam-treated Douglas fir at four
   different severities were investigated. Steam-treated wood pellets
   exhibited three compression regions that became more distinct with
   increasing treatment severity. Hydrolysis of hemicelluloses and
   condensations of lignin led to an increase in elasticity of pellets made
   from steam treated feedstock. The increased treatment duration improved
   the dimensional stability of pellets. The increase in particle surface
   roughness and concentration of mono-sugars and extractives contributed
   to the increase in required energy for extruding steam treated pellets
   from the die. The maximum breaking force, Meyer hardness and the
   hardness modulus increased with steam treatment. The increased hardness
   and dimensional stability of steam-treated pellets can be attributed to
   the binding role of mono-sugars released from Douglas fir during steam
   treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-scale multimodal microscopy is a very useful technique by
   providing multiple imaging contrasts with adjustable field of views and
   spatial resolutions. Here, we present a tri-modal microscope combining
   multiphoton microscopy (MPM), optical coherence microscopy (OCM) and
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) for subsurface visualization of
   biological tissues. The advantages of the tri-modal system are
   demonstrated on various biological samples. It enables the visualization
   of multiple intrinsic contrasts including scattering, two-photon
   excitation fluorescence (TPEF), and second harmonic generation (SHG). It
   also enables a rapid scanning over a large tissue area and a high
   resolution zoom-in for cellular-level structures on regions of interest.
   The tri-modal microscope can be important for label-free imaging to
   obtain a sufficient set of parameters for reliable sample analysis. (C)

Abstract = {{A semi-blind method that estimates the quality of a video distorted by
   H.264/AVC compression/decompression is introduced. The method embeds
   pseudo-random binary watermarks in the I-frames of the original
   undistorted video. To assess the quality of a segment of a distorted
   watermarked video, the watermark bits are extracted and the quality is
   estimated based on the similarity between the embedded and the extracted
   watermarks. To enable quality assessment for a large range of
   distortions, the derivative vectors of different scaled versions of each
   I-frame of the original video are obtained, using wavelet transform. The
   watermark bits that are embedded in the small wavelet scales are used to
   estimate the small distortions, while the bits embedded in the large
   wavelet scales are used to estimate large distortions. This is because
   the latter bits are more robust (to distortions) than those bits
   embedded in the small wavelet scales. The proposed method was tested on
   different video sequences which were distorted by
   compression/decompression using H.264/AVC with different quality
   factors. The simulation results show that the proposed method can
   accurately estimate the quality of a video and its frames in terms of
   the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity
   (SSIM) quality measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shear wave velocities are obtained from bender-element tests on
   laboratory specimens by analyzing the trigger and response signals. The
   response signal is a highly distorted translation of the trigger signal,
   obscuring the identification of the shear wave arrival. This has led to
   the publication of many criteria to guide subjective decisions on the
   selection of trigger waveform and frequency and of applicable
   interpretation methods. Current methods of interpretation result in
   determination of either the group or phase velocity. As soil and
   bender-element responses are dispersive, and as the group velocity is
   only valid in non-dispersive systems, the phase velocity should be
   measured. A combined time and frequency domain method is presented to
   allow interpretation of the phase velocity, minimizing subjective input
   to the interpretation. The method is first demonstrated using simplified
   synthetic signals and is then applied to laboratory test data. The
   reproducibility of the results is demonstrated from measurements on ten
   triaxial specimens of saturated Fraser River sand. The group velocities
   are shown to be very sensitive to dispersion, not reproducible, and
   contingent on the selected frequency window, whereas the phase
   velocities are considerably more repeatable. The combined time and
   frequency domain method results in the interpretation of a phase
   velocity using only measured parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Although on initial inspection, the aluminum alloy automotive wheel
   seems to be a relatively simple component to cast based on its shape,
   further insight reveals that this is not the case. Automotive wheels are
   in a select group of cast components that have strict specifications for
   both mechanical and aesthetic characteristics due to their important
   structural requirements and their visibility on a vehicle. The modern
   aluminum alloy automotive wheel continues to experience tightened
   tolerances relating to defects to improve mechanical performance and/or
   the physical appearance. Automotive aluminum alloy wheels are assessed
   against three main criteria: wheel cosmetics, mechanical performance,
   and air tightness. Failure to achieve the required standards in any one
   of these categories will lead to the wheel either requiring costly
   repair or being rejected and remelted. Manufacturers are becoming more
   reliant on computational process modeling as a design tool for the wheel
   casting process. This article discusses and details examples of the use
   of computational process modeling as a predictive tool to optimize the
   casting process from the standpoint of defect minimization with the
   emphasis on those defects that lead to failure of aluminum automotive
   wheels, namely, macroporosity, microporosity, and oxide films. The
   current state of applied computational process modeling and its
   limitations with regard to wheel casting are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled hydromechanical granular model aimed at predicting hot tear
   formation and stress-strain behavior in metallic alloys during
   solidification is applied to the semicontinuous direct chill casting of
   aluminum alloy round billets. This granular model consists of four
   separate three-dimensional (3D) modules: (I) a solidification module
   that is used for generating the solid-liquid geometry at a given solid
   fraction, (II) a fluid flow module that is used to calculate the
   solidification shrinkage and deformation-induced pressure drop within
   the intergranular liquid, (III) a semisolid deformation module that is
   based on a combined finite element/discrete element method and simulates
   the rheological behavior of the granular structure, and (IV) a failure
   module that simulates crack initiation and propagation. To investigate
   hot tearing, the granular model has been applied to a representative
   volume within the direct chill cast billet that is located at the bottom
   of the liquid sump, and it reveals that semisolid deformations imposed
   on the mushy zone open the liquid channels due to localization of the
   deformation at grains boundaries. At a low casting speed, only
   individual pores are able to form in the widest channels because liquid
   feeding remains efficient. However, as the casting speed increases, the
   flow of liquid required to compensate for solidification shrinkage also
   increases and as a result the pores propagate and coalesce to form a
   centerline crack.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fines on the hydrodynamics of a gas-solid fluidized bed
   and ozone decomposition reaction was investigated using high-density
   iron-silicon (FeSi) particles with a particle density of 6690 kg/m(3).
   The addition of fines decreased the bubble size, dense phase voidage and
   reactor performance. The bubble size decrease is in accordance with
   reported literature; while, increase in dense phase voidage and reactor
   performance was found in the literature on less dense catalyst. The
   reactor performance was quantified using an apparent overall mass
   transfer parameter derived from fitting a two-phase model to the
   experimental data. The method allowed for reactor performance comparison
   despite the fluctuation in FeSi particle activity. Model fitting results
   suggest that smaller bubbles should improve mass transfer in addition to
   reactor performance. However, the decreased dense phase voidage with
   addition of fines counteracted the effects of smaller bubbles. Higher
   entrainment rate of the bed with fines was noted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Closed-loop control of anesthesia is expected to decrease drug dosage
   and wake up time while increasing patient safety and decreasing the work
   load of the anesthesiologist. The potential of closed-loop control in
   anesthesia has been demonstrated in several clinical studies. One of the
   challenges in the development of a closed-loop system that can be widely
   accepted by clinicians and regulatory authorities is the effect of
   interpatient variability in drug sensitivity. This system uncertainty
   may lead to unacceptable performance, or even instability of the
   closed-loop system for some individuals. The development of reliable
   models of the effect of anesthetic drugs and characterization of the
   uncertainty is, therefore, an important step in the development of a
   closed-loop system. Model identification from clinical data is
   challenging due to limited excitation and the lack of validation data.
   In this paper, approximate models are validated for controller design by
   evaluating the predictive accuracy of the closed-loop behavior. A set of
   47 validated models that describe the interpatient variability in the
   response to propofol in children is presented. This model set can be
   used for robust linear controller design provided that the experimental
   conditions are similar to the conditions during data collection.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an augmented reality system to identify lumbar vertebral
   levels to assist in spinal needle insertion for epidural anesthesia.
   These procedures require careful placement of a needle to ensure
   effective delivery of anesthetics and to avoid damaging sensitive tissue
   such as nerves. In this system, a trinocular camera tracks an ultrasound
   transducer during the acquisition of a sequence of B-mode images. The
   system generates an ultrasound panorama image of the lumbar spine,
   automatically identifies the lumbar levels in the panorama image, and
   overlays the identified levels on a live camera view of the patient's
   back. Validation is performed to test the accuracy of panorama
   generation, lumbar level identification, overall system accuracy, and
   the effect of changes in the curvature of the spine during the
   examination. The results from 17 subjects demonstrate the feasibility
   and capability of achieving an error within clinically acceptable range
   for epidural anaesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) using the da
   Vinci surgical system is the current state-of-the-art treatment option
   for clinically confined prostate cancer. Given the limited field of view
   of the surgical site in RALRP, several groups have proposed the
   integration of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in the surgical
   workflow to assist with accurate resection of the prostate and the
   sparing of the neurovascular bundles (NVBs). We previously introduced a
   robotic TRUS manipulator and a method for automatically tracking da
   Vinci surgical instruments with the TRUS imaging plane, in order to
   facilitate the integration of intraoperative TRUS in RALRP. Rapid and
   automatic registration of the kinematic frames of the da Vinci surgical
   system and the robotic TRUS probe manipulator is a critical component of
   the instrument tracking system. In this paper, we propose a fully
   automatic registration technique based on automatic 3-D TRUS
   localization of robot instrument tips pressed against the air-tissue
   boundary anterior to the prostate. The detection approach uses a
   multiscale filtering technique to identify and localize surgical
   instrument tips in the TRUS volume, and could also be used to detect
   other surface fiducials in 3-D ultrasound. Experiments have been
   performed using a tissue phantom and two ex vivo tissue samples to show
   the feasibility of the proposed methods. Also, an initial in vivo
   evaluation of the system has been carried out on a live anaesthetized
   dog with a da Vinci Si surgical system and a target registration error
   (defined as the root mean square distance of corresponding points after
   registration) of 2.68 mm has been achieved. Results show this method's
   accuracy and consistency for automatic registration of TRUS images to
   the da Vinci surgical system.}},

   the durability of mortar exposed to sulfate attack, the expansion of
   standard mortar bars immersed in 5 \% sodium sulfate Na2SO4 and
   magnesium sulfate MgSO4 solutions for up to 15 weeks was determined.
   Moreover, FESEM micrograph and EDS analysis were carried out. The
   results of 28 days compressive strength of two concretes containing POFA
   showed higher compressive strength than that of plain Portland cement

Abstract = {{A building information model (BIM) provides a rich representation of a
   building's design. However, there are many challenges in receiving
   construction-specific information from a BIM, limiting the usability of
   BIMs for construction and other downstream processes. This paper
   describes a novel approach that utilizes ontology-based feature
   modeling, automatic feature extraction based on a well-established AEC
   XML standard schema, and query processing to extract information
   relevant to construction practitioners from a given BIM. The feature
   ontology generically represents construction-specific information that
   is useful for a broad range of construction management functions. The
   software prototype uses the ontology to transform the designer-focused
   BIM into a construction-specific feature-based model (FBM). The formal
   query methods operate on the FBM to further help construction users to
   quickly extract the necessary information from a BIM. The tests
   demonstrate that this approach provides a richer representation of
   construction-specific information than existing BIM tools. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A systematic molecular dynamics simulation study is performed to assess
   the effects of temperature and free edges on the ultimate tensile
   strength and Young's modulus of a single-layer graphene sheet. It is
   observed that graphene sheets at higher temperatures fail at lower
   strains, due to the high kinetic energy of atoms. A numerical model,
   based on kinetic analysis, is used to predict the ultimate strength of
   the graphene under various temperatures and strain rates. As the width
   of a graphene reduces, the excess edge energy associated with free edge
   atoms induces an initial strain on the relaxed configuration of the
   sheets. This initial strain has a greater influence on the Young's
   modulus of the zigzag sheet compared with that of the armchair sheets.
   The simulations reveal that the carbon-carbon bond length and amplitude
   of intrinsic ripples of the graphene increases with temperature. The
   initial out-of-plane displacement of carbon atoms is necessary to
   simulate the physical behaviour of a graphene when the Nose-Hoover or
   Berendsen thermostat is used.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for chemical H-2 storage on liquid organic hydrogen
   carriers (LOHCs) has focused attention on the catalytic reactions needed
   to store and release H-2 from the LOHCs. Herein we review our recent
   studies on the use of N-ethylcarbazole and carbazole as LOHCs.
   Experimental data show that the hydrogenation reactions are relatively
   facile, although N-ethylcarbazole hydrogenates 10x's faster than
   carbazole on a 5wt\% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at 150 degrees C. Dehydrogenation
   of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole is more difficult than hydrogenation and
   is structure sensitive on Pd catalysts. Maximum activity and 100\%
   selectivity to the completely dehydrogenated product, N-ethylcarbazole,
   was achieved over a 4wt\% Pd/SiO2 catalyst with d(Pd)approximate to 9nm.
   The dehydrogenation TOF of dodecahydrocarbazole and dodecahydrofluorene
   were much lower than dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole. DFT was used to
   identify the dehydrogenation mechanism and explain the experimental
   observations. Both theoretical and experimental results lead to the
   conclusion that dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole is a better H(2)storage
   candidate than dodecahydrocarbazole.}},

Volume = {{180}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Physicochemical properties of PBDE congeners are important for modeling
   their transport, but data are often missing. The quantitative
   structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach is utilized to fill this
   gap. Individual research groups often report piecemeal properties
   through experimental measurements or estimation techniques, but these
   data seldom satisfy fundamental thermodynamic relationships because of
   errors. The data then lack internal consistency and cannot be used
   directly in environmental modeling. This paper critically reviews
   published experimental data to select the best QSPR models, which are
   then extended to all 209 PBDE congeners. Properties include aqueous
   solubility, vapor pressure, Henry's law constant, octanol-water
   partition coefficient and octanol-air partition coefficient. Their
   values are next adjusted to satisfy fundamental thermodynamic equations.
   The resulting values then take advantage of all measurements and provide
   quick references for modeling and PBDE-contaminated site assessment and
   remediation. PCBs are also compared with respect to their properties and
   estimation methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{2331-2341}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results in the literature indicate notable
   non-repeatabilities during mechanical testing of woven fabrics, even
   under the same loading conditions, which may be linked to the presence
   of defects and uncertainties at meso or micro levels in yarns. Sources
   of such uncertainties can include both yarn dimensional tolerances and
   variations in the fiber/matrix material properties. The aim of this
   article is to conduct a systematic sensitivity analysis on the
   meso-level uncertainty factors in a typical woven fabric and identify
   the most significant factors and their interactions under a trellising
   mode. A finite element model capable of capturing behavior of dry yarns,
   along with a two-level full-factorial design approach has been employed.
   Factorial designs are split into two categories of the geometrical and
   material factors. It is shown how the obtained range of variations from
   the above statistical designs may be used to capture non-repeatability
   in some trellising tests.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic Models for Structural Performance of Rounded Dovetail
   Joints}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1478-1488}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents probabilistic models for the structural performance
   of rounded dovetail joints. The models are developed with a Bayesian
   technique, which implies that the model uncertainty is explicitly
   characterized by random variables. The Bayesian approach also promotes
   model updating when new test results become available in the future.
   Practical insight is gained from the modeling process, which includes a
   novel search for influential parameters, and from the subsequent
   probabilistic analysis with the models. The models are based on 80 tests
   of single and double dovetail joints with varying geometric parameters,
   specifically the flange angle and the dovetail height. A significant
   effort was made to record variables that conceivably influence the
   performance of this type of joint, including a series of material
   parameters: tension strength perpendicular to grain, shear strength
   parallel to grain, moisture content, density, growth ring density, and
   growth ring orientation. This paper explores the significance of each
   parameter and proposes models that include the most significant
   parameters while retaining a measure of the model uncertainty. In
   contrast to most models used in structural design, the probabilistic
   models presented herein are unbiased and suitable for future
   reliability-based calibration of code equations.}},

Abstract = {{Excess journey time (EJT), the difference between actual passenger
   journey times and journey times implied by the published timetable,
   strikes a useful balance between the passenger's and operator's
   perspectives of public transport service quality. Using smartcard data,
   this paper tried to characterize transit service quality with EJT under
   heterogeneous incidence behavior (arrival at boarding stations). A
   rigorous framework was established for analyzing EJT, in particular for
   reasoning about passenger' journey time standards as implied by varying
   incidence behavior. It was found that although the wrong assumption
   about passenger incidence behavior and journey time standards could
   result in a biased estimate of EJT for individual passenger journeys,
   the unified estimator of EJT proposed in this paper is unbiased at the
   aggregate level regardless of the passenger incidence behavior (random
   incidence, scheduled incidence, or a mixture of both). A case study
   based on the London Overground network (with a tap-in-and-tap-out
   smartcard system) was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the
   proposed method. EJT was estimated using the smartcard (Oyster) data at
   various levels of spatial and temporal aggregation in order to measure
   and evaluate the service quality. Aggregate EJT was found to vary
   substantially across the different London Overground lines and across
   time periods of weekday service. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
