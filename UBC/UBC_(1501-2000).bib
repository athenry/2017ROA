Abstract = {{The tremendous growth of machine-to-machine (M2M) applications has been
   a great attractor to cellular network operators to provide machine-type
   communication services. One of the important challenges for cellular
   systems supporting M2M terminals is coverage, because terminals can be
   located in spaces in buildings and structures suffering from significant
   penetration losses. Since these terminals are also often stationary,
   they are permanently without cellular coverage. To address this critical
   issue, the third generation partnership project (3GPP), and in
   particular its radio access network technical specification group,
   commenced work on coverage enhancement (CE) for long-term evolution
   (LTE) systems in June 2013. This article reviews the CE objectives
   defined for LTE machine-type communication and presents CE methods for
   LTE downlink and uplink channels discussed in this group. The presented
   methods achieve CE in a spectrally efficient manner and without notably
   affecting performance for legacy (non-M2M) devices.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study evaluating two respiratory rate estimation algorithms
   using videos obtained from placing a finger on the camera lens of
   amobile phone. The two algorithms, based on Smart Fusion and empirical
   mode decomposition (EMD), consist of previously developed signal
   processing methods to detect features and extract respiratory induced
   variations in photoplethysmographic signals to estimate respiratory
   rate. With custom-built software on an Android phone,
   photoplethysmographic imaging videos were recorded from 19 healthy
   adults while breathing spontaneously at respiratory rates between 6 to
   32 breaths/min. Signals from two pulse oximeters were simultaneously
   recorded to compare the algorithms' performance using mobile phone data
   and clinical data. Capnometry was recorded to obtain reference
   respiratory rates. Two hundred seventy-two recordings were analyzed. The
   Smart Fusion algorithm reported 39 recordings with insufficient
   respiratory information from the photoplethysmographic imaging data. Of
   the 232 remaining recordings, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6
   breaths/min was obtained. The RMSE for the pulse oximeter datawas lower
   at 2.3 breaths/min. RMSEfor the EMDmethod was higher throughout all data
   sources as, unlike the Smart Fusion, the EMD method did not screen for
   inconsistent results. The study showed that it is feasible to estimate
   respiratory rates by placing a finger on a mobile phone camera, but that
   it becomes increasingly challenging at respiratory rates greater than 20
   breaths/min, independent of data source or algorithm tested.}},

Abstract = {{This letter provides an analytical model that describes the viscous flow
   separation in a drying thin polymer solution film. While conventional
   flow separation occurs due to an adverse pressure gradient opposing
   fluid inertia, here we show that flow separation can also be caused by
   the Marangoni effect in an evaporation-driven creeping flow. The flow
   separation behavior strongly depends on the surface tension distribution
   and the interface profile. Viscous flow separation adds to the current
   understanding of flow physics during the drying of thin films, in
   addition to the well-known capillary transport and the Marangoni effect.

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{For multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh channels, it has been
   shown that transmitter correlations always degrade the performance of
   general space-time codes (STCs) in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   regimes. In this correspondence, however, we show that when MIMO
   channels experience single-keyhole conditions, the effect of spatial
   correlations between transmission antennas is more sophisticated for
   general STCs: When M > N (i.e., the number of transmission antennas is
   greater than the number of receiving antennas), depending on how the
   correlation matrix P beamforms the codeword difference matrix Delta, the
   pairwise error probability performance of general STCs can be either
   degraded or improved in high-SNR regimes. We provide a new measure,
   which is based on the eigenvalues of Delta and the numbers of
   transmission and receiving antennas, to examine if there exist certain
   correlation matrices that can improve the performance of general STCs in
   high-SNR regimes. Previous studies on the effect of spatial correlations
   over single-keyhole channels only concentrated on orthogonal STCs,
   whereas our study here is for general STCs and can also be used to
   explain previous findings for orthogonal STCs. Simulations also show
   that the results are applicable with imperfect channel knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the transmission of orthogonal space-time block codes

   CSI, by ignoring higher order noise terms, in Rayleigh fading. Using the
   derived m.g.f. expression, we obtain the analytical symbol error rate

Abstract = {{Wide energy gap semiconductors are broadly recognized as promising
   materials for novel electronic and optoelectronic device applications.
   As informed device design requires a firm grasp of the material
   properties of the underlying electronic materials, the electron
   transport that occurs within the wide energy gap semiconductors has been
   the focus of considerable study over the years. In an effort to provide
   some perspective on this rapidly evolving and burgeoning field of
   research, we review analyzes of the electron transport within some wide
   energy gap semiconductors of current interest in this paper. In order to
   narrow the scope of this review, we will primarily focus on the electron
   transport that occurs within the wurtzite phases of gallium nitride,
   aluminum nitride, indium nitride, and zinc oxide in this review, these
   materials being of great current interest to the wide energy gap
   semiconductor community; indium nitride, while not a wide energy gap
   semiconductor in of itself, is included as it is often alloyed with
   other wide energy gap semiconductors, the resultant alloys being wide
   energy gap semiconductors themselves. The electron transport that occurs
   within zinc-blende gallium arsenide is also considered, albeit primarily
   for bench-marking purposes. Most of our discussion will focus on results
   obtained from our ensemble semi-classical three-valley Monte Carlo
   simulations of the electron transport within these materials, our
   results conforming with state-of-the-art wide energy gap semiconductor
   orthodoxy. A brief tutorial on the Monte Carlo electron transport
   simulation approach, this approach being used to generate the results
   presented herein, is also provided. Steady-state and transient electron
   transport results are presented. The evolution of the field, and a
   survey of the current literature, are also featured. We conclude our
   review by presenting some recent developments on the electron transport
   within these materials.}},

Abstract = {{Thermionic conversion involves the direct conversion of heat, including
   light-induced heat, from a heat source, e.g., solar energy, to
   electricity. Although the concept is almost a hundred years old, the
   progress of thermionic convertors has been limited by issues such as the
   space-charge effect and availability of materials with desirable
   mechanical and electrical properties, while maintaining a low work
   function. Nanotechnology could help address some of the main challenges
   that thermionic convertors face. However, existing models, which were
   developed for macroscopic convertors, are not capable of describing all
   aspects of nanostructured devices. We present a method to evaluate the
   output characteristics of thermionic convertors with a higher precision
   than the existing models and the ability to simulate a broader range of
   parameters, including temperatures, active surface areas, interelectrode
   distances, and work functions. These features are crucial for the
   characterization of emergent devices due to the unknowns involved in
   their internal parameters; the model's high numerical precision and
   flexibility allows one to solve the reverse problem and to evaluate the
   internal parameters of the device from a set of simple experimental
   data. As an experimental case, a carbon nanotube forest was used as the
   emitter and locally heated to thermionic emission temperatures using a
   50-mW-focused laser beam. The current-voltage characteristics were
   measured and used to solve the reverse problem to obtain the internal
   parameters of the device, which were shown to be consistent with the
   values obtained using other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) provides a basis for classical
   computation without transistors. Many simulations of QCA rely upon the
   so-called intercellular Hartree approximation (ICHA), which neglects the
   possibility of entanglement between cells. The ICHA was originally
   proposed as a solution to the problem of exponential scaling in the
   computational cost of fully quantum mechanical treatments. However, in
   some cases, the ICHA predicted errors in QCA operation, and quantum
   correlations were required for circuits to operate correctly. While
   quantum correlations can remedy certain problems that present themselves
   in ICHA calculations, here we present simulations that show that quantum
   correlations may in fact be problematic in other situations, such as
   clocked QCA. Small groups of QCA cells are modelled with a Hamiltonian
   analogous to a quantum mechanical Ising-like spin chain in a transverse
   field, including the effects of intercellular entanglement completely.
   When energy relaxation is included in the model, we find that
   intercellular entanglement changes the qualitative behavior of the
   system, and new features appear. In clocked QCA, isolated groups of
   active cells have a tendency to oscillate between polarization states as
   information propagates. Additionally, energy relaxation tends to bring
   groups of cells to an unpolarized steady state. This contrasts with the
   results of previous simulations, which employed the ICHA. The ICHA may
   in fact be a good approximation in the limit of very low tunneling
   rates, which can be realized in lithographically defined quantum dots.
   However, in molecular and atomic implementations of QCA, entanglement
   will play a greater role. The degree to which intercellular correlations
   pose a problem for memory, and clocking depends upon
   implementation-specific details of the interaction of the system with
   its environment, as well as the system's internal dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the spectral efficiency of an uplink radio
   frequency (RF)-powered macrocell network considering
   harvest-then-transmit protocol such that the macrocell users transmit in
   the uplink while replenishing the energy from their serving base station
   (BS) in the downlink. Using the theory of order statistics, a tractable
   mathematical framework is developed to derive the uplink spectral
   efficiency and the downlink power consumption resulting due to wireless
   energy transfer. The framework captures the impact of the locations of
   the users that are selected for uplink transmission, their channel
   statistics for information and energy transfer, and different user
   selection schemes. We first analyze the performance of state-of-the-art
   greedy and round-robin scheduling schemes in RF-powered cellular
   networks. Closed-form expressions for the minimum power outage
   probability (i.e., the probability that the selected user is unable to
   harvest sufficient power for uplink transmission) are also derived. We
   then develop modified versions of the conventional user selection
   schemes that improve the spectral efficiency on a given uplink
   transmission channel with zero power outage probability (i.e.,
   probability of outage due to insufficient amount of harvested power).
   The developed schemes are shown to outperform the conventional user
   scheduling schemes in terms of the throughput and energy harvesting time
   with a trade-off in fairness among users. The accuracy of the
   expressions is validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results
   highlight the trade-offs associated with the various user selection
   schemes as a function of network parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The large-ion-accessible surface area of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and
   graphene sheets formed as yarns, forests, and films enables miniature
   high-performance supercapacitors with power densities exceeding those of
   electrolytics while achieving energy densities equaling those of
   batteries.1-7 Capacitance and energy density can be enhanced by
   depositing highly pseudocapacitive materials such as conductive polymers
   on them.3,8-15 Yarns formed from carbon nanotubes are proposed for use
   in wearable supercapacitors.3,16 In this work, we show that high power,
   energy density, and capacitance in yarn form are not unique to carbon
   materials, and we introduce niobium nanowires as an alternative. These
   yarns show higher capacitance and energy per volume and are stronger and
   100 times more conductive than similarly spun carbon multiwalled
   nanotube (MWNT) and graphene yarns.6,17-22 The long niobium nanowires,
   formed by repeated extrusion and drawing,17 achieve device volumetric
   peak power and energy densities of 55 MW.m(-3) (55 W.cm(-3)) and 25
   MJ.m(-3) (7 mWh.cm(-3)), 2 and 5 times higher than that for
   state-of-the-art CNT yarns, respectively.3 The capacitance per volume of
   Nb nanowire yarn is lower than the 158 MF.m(-3) (158 F.cm(-3)) reported
   for carbon-based materials such as reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and CNT
   wet-spun yarns,5 but the peak power and energy densities are 200 and 2
   times higher, respectively.5 Achieving high power in long yarns is made
   possible by the high conductivity of the metal, and achievement of high
   energy density is possible thanks to the high internal surface area. No
   additional metal backing is needed, unlike for CNT yarns and
   supercapacitors in general, saving substantial space. As the yarn is
   infiltrated with pseudocapacitive materials such as
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), the energy density is further
   increased to 10 MJ.m(-3) (2.8 mWh.cm(-3)). Similar to CNT yarns, niobium
   nanowire yarns are highly flexible and show potential for weaving into
   textiles and use in wearable devices.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a numerical simulation of the stall and surge in a
   centrifugal compressor and presents a description of the stall
   development in two different cases. The first case is for a compressor
   with vaneless diffuser and the second is for a compressor with vaned
   diffuser of the vane island shape. The main aim of this study is to
   compare the flow characteristics and behavior for the two compressors
   near the surge operating condition and provide further understanding of
   the diffuser role when back flow occurs at surge. Results showed that
   for a location near the diffuser entrance, the amplitude of the static
   pressure fluctuations for the vaneless diffuser case is higher than that
   for the vaned diffuser case near surge condition. These pressure
   fluctuations in the case of the vaneless diffuser appear with a gradual
   decrease of the mean pressure value as a part of the surge cycle. While
   for the case of the vaned diffuser, the pressure drop during surge
   occurs faster than the case of the vaneless diffuser. Also, results
   indicated that during surge in the case of vaneless diffuser, there is a
   region with low velocity and back flow that appears as a layer
   connecting all impeller passages near shroud surface and this layer
   develops in size with time. On the other hand, for the case of vaned
   diffuser during surge, the low velocity regions appear in random
   locations in some passages and these regions expand with time towards
   the shroud surface. Results showed that during stall, the impeller
   passages are exposed to identical impact from stall cells in the case of
   vaneless diffuser while the stall effect varies from passage to another
   in the case of the vaned diffuser.}},

Title = {{A hybrid approach for cost-effective media streaming based on prediction

Journal = {{TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Media streaming applications have recently attracted large number of
   users in the Internet. This large demand creates a burden on existing
   infrastructure to sustain the QoS guarantees. The huge capacity
   resources and power consumption are the main aspects that hinder the
   evolution of media streaming applications in the Internet. This
   motivates us to explore new approaches in collaborative media streaming
   in community networks (e.g., college and office campuses) residing in a
   larger network of the access connection provider such as Internet
   Service Provider (ISP). The proposed approaches are aimed at exploiting
   the redundancy and abundantly available network ``micro-resources{''} in
   a community network to create an aggregate virtual ``macroresource{''}.
   Specifically, the ISP can leverage its control over a large amount of
   under-utilized micro-resources in a community network to replicate into
   caches of thosemicro-resources files that are desired in that community.
   In this paper, we characterize the evolution of demand in a community
   network. By using this demand-awareness model (i.e., future prediction
   of the demand in a community network), micro-resources in the community
   network can be optimally utilized. We show analytically and using
   simulations that this approach mitigates the cost of media streaming on
   both the Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and ISPs. By allocating
   microresources to manage the demand in a community network on a per-need
   basis, much of the network and computing capacities at the edge-servers
   can be alleviated. This reduces the cost on the CDN in terms of both
   purchase and maintenance. Moreover, ISPs can reduce the bandwidth and
   power consumption in their networks by pushing the media content closer
   to users in the community network.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of recovering multi-channel EEG signals from their randomly
   under-sampled measurements is addressed. The objective is to reduce the
   energy consumed by sensing, processing and transmission in an EEG
   wireless body area network. Our work is based on the Blind Compressed
   Sensing (BCS) framework, however instead of exploiting only the sparsity
   of the multi-channel ensemble in a learned basis, we also make use of
   the ensembles' approximate rank deficiency. Our proposed formulation
   requires solving new optimization problems. To solve these problems, we
   derive algorithms based on the Split Bregman approach. The resulting
   recovery results are considerably better than those of previous
   techniques, in terms of the quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract = {{The active nature of next generation distribution systems requires a
   highly accurate real-time monitoring for state estimation and
   situational awareness. This paper considers the problem of robust
   placement of a limited number of voltage magnitude meters and phasor
   measurement units for state estimation in an active distribution system
   comprising topological reconfigurations. The trace of the inverse of the
   Fisher information matrix is chosen as criterion for the estimation
   accuracy. For meter placement in a single configuration distribution
   system, the greedy approach provides a near-optimal solution as well as
   a theoretical approximation guarantee. However, for meter placement in
   an active distribution system, a robust approach is required to optimize
   the worst case estimation accuracy among all possible configurations of
   the system. In this paper, a simple robust algorithm, called submodular
   saturation algorithm, for meter placement in active distribution systems
   is proposed. Numerical results on three different active distribution
   systems show that the submodular saturation algorithm outperforms the
   greedy algorithm and the genetic algorithm in most cases, and provides
   competitive results in other cases.}},

Abstract = {{The main features of the flow generated by three axial flow impellers
   installed on the side of cylindrical tanks filled with pseudoplastic
   solutions exhibiting yield stress were exposed using computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD). The numerical results were evaluated using velocity
   vector maps obtained from particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments.
   The models were able to predict macroscale flow structures and global
   mixing parameters under different operating conditions. However,
   limitations of the model to predict the symmetric flow observed during
   the experiments were identified at high rotational speeds. The operating
   conditions included angular speeds from 327 rpm to 684 rpm, and yield
   stresses and viscosity levels provided by three carbopol solutions
   (0.075, 0.09 and 0.1 w/w\%). These conditions create mainly laminar flow
   inside the mixing domain. The results indicated that the operating
   conditions and the blade angle establish the structure of the impeller
   discharge, which in turn defines the shear rate distribution, some
   physical cavern properties, and the formation of segregated regions. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper presents the results of a new approach for
   selection of RF time series features based on joint independent
   component analysis for in vivo characterization of prostate cancer.
   Methods: We project three sets of RF time series features extracted from
   the spectrum, fractal dimension, and the wavelet transform of the
   ultrasound RF data on a space spanned by five joint independent
   components. Then, we demonstrate that the obtained mixing coefficients
   from a group of patients can be used to train a classifier, which can be
   applied to characterize cancerous regions of a test patient. Results: In
   a leave-one-patient-out cross validation, an area under receiver
   operating characteristic curve of 0.93 and classification accuracy of
   84\% are achieved. Conclusion: Ultrasound RF time series can be used to
   accurately characterize prostate cancer, in vivo without the need for
   exhaustive search in the feature space. Significance: We use joint
   independent component analysis for systematic fusion of multiple sets of
   RF time series features, within a machine learning framework, to
   characterize PCa in an in vivo study.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, power flow equations are used for distribution systems

   flow (LCF) equations are derived for DS. This formulation is then used
   within the network reconfiguration problem for loss minimization. A
   mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation,
   together with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, are
   proposed in this paper and assessed through simulations. In these
   comparisons, the MILP formulation shows computational advantages over
   the MIQCP version and the preceding literature. The proposed methods are

Abstract = {{Shearography and other applications of Electronic Speckle Pattern
   Interferometry (ESPI) are typically done using a single monochromatic

   deformation quantity is to be measured, then the associated optical
   arrangement must be used sequentially. Here, an alternative approach is
   described where multiple interferometric measurements are simultaneously
   made using a color camera imaging monochromatic light sources of
   different wavelengths. The Red-Green-Blue (RGB) sensors of a
   conventional Bayer type camera can be read separately, thereby providing
   three independent color signals and independent ESPI phase maps. This

Abstract = {{Recently, much research has proposed to integrate mobile cloud computing
   (MCC) with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) so that powerful cloud
   computing can be exploited to process the data gathered by ubiquitous
   WSNs and share the results with mobile users. However, all current
   MCC-WSN integration schemes ignore the following two observations: 1)
   the specific data mobile users request usually depend on the current
   locations of mobile users 2) most sensors are usually equipped with
   non-rechargeable batteries with limited energy. In this paper, motivated
   by these two observations, two novel collaborative location-based sleep
   scheduling (CLSS) schemes are proposed for WSNs integrated with MCC.
   Based on the locations of mobile users, CLSS dynamically determines the
   awake or asleep status of each sensor node to reduce energy consumption
   of the integrated WSN. Particularly, CLSS1 focuses on maximizing the
   energy consumption saving of the integrated WSN while CLSS2 considers
   also the scalability and robustness of the integrated WSN. Theoretical
   and simulation results show that for WSNs integrated with MCC, both
   CLSS1 and CLSS2 can prolong the WSN lifetime while still satisfying the
   data requests of mobile users.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical investigation of the optimization of the stall control
   efficiency for a high speed centrifugal compressor using air injection
   is presented. External air was injected close to the diffuser entrance
   at the shroud surface of the vaneless region. Injection was applied with
   mass flow rates of 0.7\%, 1\%, and 1.5\% of the design inlet mass flow
   rate with six different angles of 0 deg, 10 deg, 20 deg, 30 deg, 40 deg,
   and 180 deg measured from the positive tangential direction at the
   vaneless region. Detailed comparisons were made between the case without
   using air injection and the different air injection cases by comparing
   velocity, pressure, and force fluctuations with time. Results showed
   that as the injection mass flow rate increases, the number of diffuser
   passages with reversed flow decreases for all cases of injection except
   for the case of reverse tangent injection. Results indicated that using
   angle of injection of 30 deg minimized the stall area and provided the
   least force fluctuations with no reversed flow compared to other
   injection angles. Finally, it was found that injecting air with mass
   flow rate of 1.5\% of the inlet mass flow rate at an angle of 30 deg
   resulted in shifting of stall onset to a mass flow rate corresponding to
   3.8 kg/s instead of 4 kg/s for a compressor without using air injection

Abstract = {{This paper reports a low-cost silicon wafer dicing technique using a
   commercial craft cutter. The 4-inch silicon wafers were scribed using a
   crafter cutter with a mounted diamond blade. The pre-programmed
   automated process can reach a minimum die feature of 3 mm by 3 mm. We
   performed this scribing process on the top polished surface of a silicon
   wafer; we also created a scribing method for the back-unpolished surface
   in order to protect the structures on the wafer during scribing.
   Compared with other wafer dicing methods, our proposed dicing technique
   is extremely low cost (lower than \$1,000), and suitable for silicon
   wafer dicing in microelectromechanical or microfluidic fields, which
   usually have a relatively large die dimension. The proposed dicing
   technique is also usable for dicing multiple project wafers, a process
   where dies of different dimensions are diced on the same wafer.}},

Abstract = {{Described here is a novel approach to needle localization in 3-D
   ultrasound based on automatic detection of small changes in appearance
   on movement of the needle stylus. By stylus oscillation, including its
   full insertion into the cannula to the tip, the image processing
   techniques can localize the needle trajectory and the tip in the 3-D
   ultrasound volume. The 3-D needle localization task is reduced to two
   2-D localizations using orthogonal projections. To evaluate our method,
   we tested it on three different ex vivo tissue types, and the
   preliminary results indicated that the method accuracy lies within
   clinical acceptance, with average error ranges of 0.9 degrees-1.4
   degrees in needle trajectory and 0.8-1.1 mm in needle tip. Results also
   indicate that method performance is independent of the echogenicity of
   the tissue. This technique is a safe way of producing ultrasonic
   intensity changes and appears to introduce negligible risk to the
   patient, as the outer cannula remains fixed. (C) 2015 World Federation

Abstract = {{Efforts to promote women in science, technology, engineering, and math
   (STEM) require a clearer understanding of the experience of social
   identity threat outside academic contexts. Although social identity
   threat has been widely studied among students, very little research has
   examined how the phenomenon occurs naturalistically among working
   professionals in ways that could undermine productivity and well-being.
   The present research employed daily diary methodology to examine
   conversations with colleagues as triggers of social identity threat
   among a sample of 44 male and 52 female working engineers. Results of
   multilevel modeling revealed that (1) women (but not men) reported
   greater daily experiences of social identity threat on days when their
   conversations with male (but not female) colleagues cued feelings of
   incompetence and a lack of acceptance, and (2) these daily fluctuations
   of social identity threat predicted daily levels of mental exhaustion
   and psychological burnout. The implications for social identity threat
   in working professionals are discussed.}},

Title = {{An examination of the factors influencing the melting of solid titanium
   in liquid titanium}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{The melting behavior of a solid in liquid titanium has been investigated
   with the aid of an Electron Beam Button Furnace (EBBF) to understand the
   phenomena contributing to the melting of exogenous solids introduced
   into liquid titanium during melt processing and casting. In this work,
   cylindrical rods of commercial purity (CP) titanium were dipped into a
   molten CP titanium pool for various periods of time to investigate the
   melting behavior in the absence of compositional effects. The dimensions
   of the dipped rods were measured before and after various immersion
   times allowing for quantification of the evolution of the solid/liquid
   interface and melting rate. The temperature within the dipped rod was
   also monitored during immersion to provide additional quantitative data
   on heat transport for analysis. The results show that the liquid
   titanium initially freezes onto the cold rod sample when it was
   immersed, resulting in the formation of a solid/solid interface between
   the immersed rod and the frozen titanium. It was found that the
   solid/solid interface exerts a significant resistance for heat transfer.
   After a short period of time, the frozen titanium melted followed by
   melting of the rod. A numerical model has been developed to describe the
   experimental process, the results of which are shown to correlate well
   with the experimental observations and measurements. Analysis with the
   model has confirmed that thermally induced buoyancy and, in particular,
   thermally induced Marangoni forces have a considerable impact on the
   transport of heat and momentum, and consequently on the melting
   kinetics. For the convenience of use in practical industrial-scale
   applications, effective interfacial heat transfer coefficients (EIHTCs)
   have been calculated based on the numerical model results. In addition,
   EIHTCs were also solved from the similarity solution after simplifying
   the problem description, showing that they can correlate satisfactorily
   if an appropriate reference temperature is selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new analytic method based on the microstructural path method with
   nucleation rate and growth rate as descriptors is proposed, which
   provides a link between the nonhomogeneous distribution of stored energy
   in plastically deformed materials and the recrystallization rate. The
   proposed approach uses easily measured recrystallization rates to
   provide information about the deformation history and the inhomogeneity
   of stored energy. The theory was evaluated by comparing direct
   differential scanning calorimetry measurements of inhomogeneity factor,
   m, on deformed samples of pure Cu at 498 K (225 A degrees C), to those
   extracted from hardness measurements. Excellent agreement between the
   model and the experiment was found. In addition, it is shown how any
   given probability function describing the initial distribution of stored
   energy can be used to predict the evolution of the residual stored
   energy as recrystallization proceeds.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the fundamental corrosion and passivation
   processes occurring on API-X100 pipeline steels before, during, and
   after passive layer formation in bicarbonate-based simulated soil
   solutions of pH 6.7 to 8.9. Free corrosion potentials decrease
   exponentially with bicarbonate (and pH), owing to increased water and
   bicarbonate reduction in more alkaline conditions and the coupled iron
   oxidation reaction. Active corrosion rates at potentials slightly above
   open circuit potential increase with bicarbonate, until a concentration
   of 1.68 g L-1 sodium bicarbonate (plus dilute amounts of
   chlorides/sulfate) at which first signs of film formation appear.
   Thereon, increased bicarbonate concentration generally decreases current
   densities and resists ferrous-oxide product formations due to improved
   iron carbonate formation conditions precipitating more durable passive
   layers. Potentiodynamic polarization in the anodic regime reveals
   varying electrochemical processes involving interactions between
   hydroxide, carbonate, and oxide complexes with ferrous, with diverse pH
   and potential dependencies. The products of corrosion reactions were

Abstract = {{We consider a mobile, autonomous searcher that aims to find the source
   of a broadcast message in a network of location-agnostic wireless sensor
   nodes. In certain types of networks, the hop count of the broadcast
   message, given the distance from the source node, is well approximated
   by a simple parametric distribution. The mobile searcher can interrogate
   a nearby node to obtain, with a given success probability, the hop count
   of the broadcast message. The search is modeled as an infinite horizon,
   undiscounted cost, and partially observable Markov decision process. A
   computationally efficient approximate online solution is obtained
   through policy rollout using a novel heuristic. Simulation results show
   that our rollout approach outperforms commonly used search methods based
   on a mutual information utility. We quantify the loss due to the use of
   an approximate hop count observation model and study the effect of
   statistical dependence between observations. Furthermore, we discuss how
   to account for this dependence by adapting an integer autoregressive
   model for the hop count.}},

   pressure-sealed vessel which could simulate MW pretreatment under
   identical heating/cooling profiles was used for CH pretreatment. No
   statistically significant difference was proven between MW and CH
   pretreatments in terms of sludge solubilization, anaerobic biogas yield
   and organics biodegradation rate (p-value > 0.05), while statistically
   significant effects of temperature and heating rate were observed
   (p-value < 0.05). These results explain the contradictory results of
   previous studies in which only the final temperature (not

Abstract = {{The complex microstructure of ferrous martensite is reflected in its
   complex mechanical response. In an attempt to highlight how carbon
   redistribution during quenching and/or low temperature tempering can
   affect mechanical response, a set of controlled experiments were
   performed. By rapidly quenching samples it was possible to limit
   autotempering allowing the evolution of mechanical response and
   microstructure to be followed with low temperature tempering. This was
   compared to a situation where the material was more slowly quenched,
   leading to a highly autotempered state. The gradual transition from
   elastic to plastic deformation is interpreted based on possible sources
   of microstructural heterogeneity. Lath-to-lath variations of dislocation
   density are discussed as a contributor to the development of
   microstructural heterogeneity during tempering. These results shed light
   on the possible origins of the continuous-composite like mechanical
   response of lath martensite proposed in recent work. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{A problem that impedes the progress in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
   research is the difficulty in reproducing the results of different
   papers. Comparing different algorithms at present is very difficult.
   Some improvements have been made by the use of standard datasets to
   evaluate different algorithms. However, the lack of a comparison
   framework still exists. In this paper, we construct a new general
   comparison framework to compare different algorithms on several standard
   datasets. All these datasets correspond to sensory motor BCIs, and are
   obtained from 21 subjects during their operation of synchronous BCIs and
   8 subjects using self-paced BCIs. Other researchers can use our
   framework to compare their own algorithms on their own datasets. We have
   compared the performance of different popular classification algorithms
   over these 29 subjects and performed statistical tests to validate our
   results. Our findings suggest that, for a given subject, the choice of
   the classifier for a BCI system depends on the feature extraction method
   used in that BCI system. This is in contrary to most of publications in
   the field that have used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as the
   classifier of choice for BCI systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics in a gas-solid fluidized bed reactor were studied based on
   differential pressure signals measured over several height intervals at
   different temperatures. Structure density function analysis was utilized
   to study the dynamics of multi-scale structures. An amplitude division
   method based on the Gaussian distribution and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
   test was developed to divide the structure density distribution of
   pressure signals into three characteristic regions linked to: I.
   line-scale structures, II. small-scale structures, and III. large-scale
   structures. The frequency of large voids and the uniformity of
   multi-scale flow structures were quantitatively characterized by
   parameters SDFb,II, and K-SDF, respectively. K-SDF reached a maximum
   when large bubbles or slugs dominated the flow, then decreased until it
   remained almost constant in the turbulent flow regime. Structure density
   function analysis showed that increasing the operating temperature
   enhanced he transition of flow regimes, while the transition direction
   was determined by the superficial gas velocity. Increased gas velocity
   and decreased minimum fluidization velocity at higher temperature were
   major factors promoting earlier flow regime transitions. The frequency
   of large-scale structures decreased at higher temperature for the same
   flow regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-body vibration has been identified as a potential stressor to
   spinal cord injury (SCI) patients during pre-hospital transportation.
   However, the effect that such vibration has on the acutely injured
   spinal cord is largely unknown, particularly in the frequency domain of
   5 Hz in which resonance of the spine occurs. The objective of the study
   was to investigate the consequences of resonance vibration on the
   injured spinal cord. Using our previously characterized porcine model of
   SCI, we subjected animals to resonance vibration (5.7 +/- 0.46 Hz) or no
   vibration for a period of 1.5 or 3.0 h. Locomotor function was assessed
   weekly and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected to assess
   different inflammatory and injury severity markers. Spinal cords were
   evaluated histologically to quantify preserved white and gray matter. No
   significant differences were found between groups for CSF levels of
   monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Glial
   fibrillary acidic protein levels were lower in the resonance vibration
   group, compared with the non-vibrated control group. Spared white matter
   tissue was increased within the vibrated group at 7 d post-injury but
   this difference was not apparent at the 12-week time-point. No
   significant difference was observed in locomotor recovery following
   resonance vibration of the spine. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to
   resonance vibration for 1.5 or 3 h following SCI in our porcine model is
   not detrimental to the functional or histological outcomes. Our
   observation that a 3.0-h period of vibration at resonance frequency
   induces modest histological improvement at one week post-injury warrants
   further study.}},

Abstract = {{High aspect ratio Co nanowire arrays are fabricated through the ac
   electrodeposition method using anodic aluminum oxide templates. The
   effect of electrolytic bath acidity (pH) as well as applied external
   magnetic field during the electrodeposition process together with the
   effect of annealing process after sample preparation on the crystal
   structure and magnetic properties of nanowires are investigated. The
   experimental results show that the pH value of electrolyte affects the
   magnetic properties of the nanowire arrays due to modification of the
   microstructure and quality of electrodeposition. The Co nanowires form
   in fcc, a mixture of fcc and hcp, and hcp crystal structure at pH = 2.5,
   pH = 3.5, and pH = 5, 6, respectively. The experimental results also
   reveal that applying appropriate external magnetic field parallel to the
   nanowire axis improves the magnetic properties of deposited Co NWs
   probably due to increase in mass transport in the diffusion layer by
   applied external magnetic field, which results in lowering the porosity
   generated due to formation of hydroxide at high pH value. Our studies
   show that appropriate annealing process can also enhance the crystal
   texture in the hcp phase and therefore significantly improve the
   magnetic properties of NW arrays deposited at either high pH regime or
   under external magnetic field. Moreover, it is shown that although each
   factor individually affects the magnetic properties of the Co NW arrays,
   the combination of annealing process, external magnetic field and
   electrolyte acidity allows the control of the quality of samples and
   enhance the magnetic properties of Co nanowire arrays. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The impedance characteristics of the activation and mass transport
   overpotentials in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell are determined
   analytically using a process model. The anode and cathode electrodes are
   studied separately. The governing equations are solved analytically and
   the resultant impedances and hence the equivalent circuits are
   extracted. The results show an excellent agreement between the
   analytical model and different measured impedances reported in the
   literature for various operating conditions and anode/cathode feedings.
   It is shown that the high frequency arc is the result of the anode
   impedance and is not a function of the current density. On the other
   hand, the mid-frequency arc consisting of two convoluted depressed
   semi-circles is the result of the cathode impedance. The solution
   clarifies the reason for an initial decrease followed by an increase in
   the diameter of the mid-frequency arc as the current density increases.
   The results also show that cathode starvation can be studied clearly
   from the mid frequency arc. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Solute segregation kinetics and dislocation depinning in a binary alloy}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Static strain aging, a phenomenon caused by diffusion of solute atoms to
   dislocations, is an important contributor to the strength of
   substitutional alloys. Accurate modeling of this complex process
   requires both atomic spatial resolution and diffusional time scales,
   which is very challenging to achieve with commonly used atomistic
   computational methods. In this paper, we use the recently developed
   ``diffusive molecular dynamics{''} (DMD) method that is capable of
   describing the kinetics of the solute segregation process at the atomic
   level while operating on diffusive time scales in a computationally
   efficient way. We study static strain aging in the Al-Mg system and
   calculate the depinning shear stress between edge and screw dislocations
   and their solute atmospheres formed for various waiting times with
   different solute content and for a range of temperatures. A simple
   phenomenological model is also proposed that describes the observed
   behavior of the critical shear stress as a function of segregation
   level.}},

Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{A coupled diffusion and segregation model was derived, where the
   contributions from diffusion and segregation to dopant flux are
   explicitly shown. The model is generic to coupled diffusion and
   segregation in inhomogeneous alloys, and provides a new approach in
   segregation coefficient extraction, which is especially helpful for
   heterostructures with lattice mismatch strains. Experiments of coupled P
   diffusion and segregation were performed with graded SiGe layers for Ge
   molar fractions up to 0.18, which are relevant to pnp SiGe
   heterojunction bipolar transistors. The model was shown to describe both
   diffusion and segregation behavior well. The diffusion-segregation model
   for P in SiGe alloys was calibrated and E-seg = 0: 5 eV is suggested for
   the temperature range from 800 degrees C to 950 degrees C. (C) 2015 AIP

   effect on hydrate growth}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamic simulations are performed to study the conditions for
   methane nano-bubble formation during methane hydrate dissociation in the
   presence of water and a methane gas reservoir. Hydrate dissociation
   leads to the quick release of methane into the liquid phase which can
   cause methane supersaturation. If the diffusion of methane molecules out
   of the liquid phase is not fast enough, the methane molecules
   agglomerate and form bubbles. Under the conditions of our simulations,
   the methane-rich quasi-spherical bubbles grow to become cylindrical with
   a radius of similar to 11 angstrom. The nano-bubbles remain stable for
   about 35 ns until they are gradually and homogeneously dispersed in the
   liquid phase and finally enter the gas phase reservoirs initially set up
   in the simulation box. We determined that the minimum mole fraction for
   the dissolved methane in water to form nano-bubbles is 0.044,
   corresponding to about 30\% of hydrate phase composition (0.148). The
   importance of nano-bubble formation to the mechanism of methane hydrate
   formation, growth, and dissociation is discussed. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{The effects of cyclic duration and pH on biological hydrogen production
   were investigated in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor. Experiments
   were conducted using cyclic duration of (4, 8, and 12h) in combination
   with pH (4, 5, and 6) in a 3 x 3 factorial design, while hydraulic
   retention time and organic loading rate were maintained at 24h and 10.3g
   COD L-1.d(-1), respectively. At pH 4, the effect of cyclic duration on
   hydrogen production was found to be insignificant. However, in runs with
   pH 5 and 6, a shorter cyclic duration of 4h led to lower hydrogen
   productivity. The operational condition (pH 6, cyclic duration 12h)
   induced higher hydrogen production rate of 2.3 +/- 0.6 L H-2/L
   reactor.d, whereas higher hydrogen yield of 2.2 +/- 0.4mol H-2/mol
   sucrose was achieved at pH 5 and the same 12h cyclic duration. The
   differences in hydrogen production were not statistically significant
   between 8h and 12h cyclic duration. Higher hydrogen production rates
   were associated with biomass (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids)
   concentration ranging from 8-13g L-1, but further increase in biomass
   growth was not accompanied by increased hydrogen production.
   Furthermore, a food-to-microorganism ratio of 0.84 was found to result

Abstract = {{Safety and serviceability of highway bridges, during and after an
   earthquake, is a prerequisite to ensure continuous transport facilities,
   emergency and evacuation routes. Recently, fragility curves have emerged
   as important decision support tools to identify the potential seismic
   risk and consequences during and after an earthquake. There has been a
   substantial increase in interest among researchers in the topic of
   seismic fragility assessment of highway bridges as evidenced by the
   growing number of published literature. Advanced computational
   techniques and available resources have led to the development of
   different methodologies for fragility assessment. This study presents a
   review of the different methodologies developed for seismic fragility
   assessment of highway bridges along with their features, limitations and
   applications. This study presents a review of available methodologies
   and identifies opportunities for future development. This study mainly
   focuses on the key features of different methods and applications rather
   than penetrating down to a critique of the associated analysis procedure
   or mathematical framework. It synthesises the existing information on
   fragility analysis, presents it in concise and useful tables, and
   explains different applications for different purposes, which would
   motivate decision-makers and stake holders to extend the application of
   fragility curves for more informed decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from stain-guard
   treated carpets in landfills continue to be released into the
   environment. To understand the leaching of PFASs from carpets to
   landfill leachate as a function of environmental factors, leaching
   concentrations of ten perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and four
   perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids were quantified for different pHs, contact
   times, mixing speeds, and temperatures. Partitioning from carpet to
   leachate and distilled water at different pHs showed negligible
   differences. The total concentration of leaching PFASs in distilled
   water was approximately 1 ng L-1 higher than in landfill leachate,
   indicating that the presence of multivalent cations in leachate could
   have a negative effect on leaching of PFASs. For all PFASs monitored,
   leaching increased with increasing contact time and temperature.
   Perfluorohexanoic and perfluoroheptanoic acids experienced the largest
   increases with contact time and temperature. Gibbs free energy (Delta G
   > 0), enthalpy (Delta H > 0), and entropy energy (Delta S < 0) indicated
   that PFAS leaching from carpet was dominantly controlled by
   entropy-driven processes and did not differ significantly among
   individual PFASs. PFAS concentrations in leachate with rotation of an
   end-over-end contactor were higher than under static conditions, but
   otherwise, varying the rotation speed had negligible influence. The
   results provide useful information for management of discarded
   stain-guard carpets in landfills.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous small cell networks have attracted much attention for
   satisfying users' explosive data traffic requirements. The heterogeneous
   cloud small cell network (HCSNet), which combines cloud computing and a
   heterogeneous small cell network, will likely play an important role in
   5G mobile communication networks. However, with massive deployment of
   small cells, co-channel interference and handover management are two
   important problems in an HCSNet, especially for cell edge users. In this
   article, we examine the problems of cooperative interference mitigation
   and handover management in an HCSNet. A network architecture is
   described to combine cloud radio access network with small cells. An
   effective CoMP clustering scheme using affinity propagation is adopted
   to mitigate cell edge users' interference. A low-complexity handover
   management scheme is presented, and its signaling procedure is analyzed
   in an HCSNet. Numerical results show that with the proposed network
   architecture, CoMP clustering and handover management schemes can
   significantly increase the capacity of HCSNet while maintaining users'
   quality of service.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty and extreme large scale of cloud resources make task
   scheduling very difficult which affects the user quality of experience
   and probably result in a waste of cloud resources and energy
   consumption. Moreover, some resources stay in an unusable state for
   extended time. To take into account these problems a cloud resource
   evaluation model is proposed, termed Entropy Optimization Evaluation and
   ant colony clustering Model (EOEACCM). The model releases long-term
   unavailable resources to save energy. First, by mean of the entropy
   increasing minimum principle, the proposed model can maximize the system
   utilization and balance profits of both cloud resource providers and
   users. As a consequence, it can shorten task completion time. Secondly,
   the model narrows the task scheduling size and achieves optimal
   scheduling by clustering. To make the model more suitable for the
   dynamics of cloud resources, the model design improves pheromone update
   policies by fixing total path length in each function cycle when
   clustering by the ant colony algorithm. Evaluation of results using
   EOEACCM demonstrate that it may be applicable for resource management
   strategies for migration and release, an application which can
   effectively save energy. The proposed model was evaluated by simulation.
   Experiment results showed the positive effect of user satisfaction from
   entropy optimization, as well as scheduling time from clustering.
   Moreover, when the scale of tasks was large, this clustering algorithm
   performed much better than others. The clustering model also
   demonstrated better adaptability when some cloud resources were joined
   or terminated.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of H2O on the activity and deactivation of Pd catalysts used for
   the oxidation of unburned CH4 present in the exhaust gas of natural-gas
   vehicles (NGVs) are reviewed. CH4 oxidation in a catalytic converter is
   limited by low exhaust gas temperatures (500-550 degrees C) and low
   concentrations of CH4 (400-1500 ppmv) that must be reacted in the
   presence of large quantities of H2O (10-15\%) and CO2 (15\%), under
   transient exhaust gas flows, temperatures, and compositions. Although Pd
   catalysts have the highest known activity for CH4 oxidation,
   water-induced sintering and reaction inhibition by H2O deactivate these
   catalysts. Recent studies have shown the reversible inhibition by H2O
   adsorption causes a significant drop in catalyst activity at lower
   reaction temperatures (below 450 degrees C), but its effect decreases
   (water adsorption becomes more reversible) with increasing reaction
   temperature. Thus above 500 degrees C H2O inhibition is negligible,
   while Pd sintering and occlusion by support species become more
   important. H2O inhibition is postulated to occur by either formation of
   relatively stable Pd(OH)(2) and/or partial blocking by OH groups of the
   O exchange between the support and Pd active sites thereby suppressing
   catalytic activity. Evidence from FTIR and isotopic labeling favors the
   latter route. Pd catalyst design, including incorporation of a second
   noble metal (Rh or Pt) and supports high O mobility (e.g., CeO2) are
   known to improve catalyst activity and stability. Kinetic studies of CH4
   oxidation at conditions relevant to natural gas vehicles have quantified
   the thermodynamics and kinetics of competitive H2O adsorption and
   Pd(OH)(2) formation, but none have addressed effects of H2O on O
   mobility.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a catalyst of hollow PdCu alloy nanocubes supported on
   nitrogen-doped graphene support (H-PdCu/ppy-NG) is successfully

   nanocubes supported on the reduced graphene oxide support (H-PdCu/RGO)

   It is found that, among these three catalyst materials, H-PdCu/ppy-NG
   gives the highest electrochemical active area and both the most
   uniformity and dispersibility of H-PdCu particles. Electrochemical tests
   show that the H-PdCu/ppy-NG catalyst can give the best electrocatalytic
   activity and stability towards the ethanol electrooxidation when

Title = {{Cartilage health in high tibial osteotomy using dGEMRIC: Relationships
   with joint kinematics}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aims of this study are to determine how opening-wedge high
   tibial osteotomy (HTO) affects cartilage health in the tibiofemoral (TF)
   joint and patella, and to explore relationships between TF and
   patellofemoral (PF) joint kinematics and cartilage health in HTO.
   Methods: 14 knees (13 subjects) with medial TF osteoarthritis (OA) were
   examined before HTO and 6 and 12 months after HTO using delayed
   gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) to evaluate cartilage
   health at the TF joint and patella. They were also examined using a
   validated 3D MR knee kinematics measurement to obtain 11 rotations and
   translations at both TF and PF joints.
   Results: No statistically significant differences in overall TF or
   patellar dGEMRIC score were found at 6 or 12 months after HTO. However
   three subjects had large decreases (mean 105 ms) in TF dGEMRIC at 6
   months that recovered at 12 months. Kinematics for these subjects were
   compared to subjects who did not have decreases in TF dGEMRIC at 6
   months (n = 5). Differences were observed between groups with HTO in
   anterior and proximal tibial translation (mean differences 3.05 mm and
   1.35 mm), and patellar flexion (mean difference 3.65). These changes
   were consistent between 6 and 12 months, despite recovery of TF dGEMRIC
   values.
   Conclusions: We did not find significant differences in TF or patellar
   dGEMRIC before and after HTO with all subjects, however there were
   differences in kinematics between subjects who had a decrease in TF
   dGEMRIC at 6 months and those who did not. This suggests a link between
   joint kinematics and cartilage health in HTO.
   Clinical relevance: The effect of opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy on
   cartilage GAG concentration may be linked to specific changes in knee
   kinematics following surgery (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential of pristine and acid-treated
   olivine as a substrate for CO2 capture using a vacuum swing adsorption
   (VSA) process from the gas-solid phase. The experiments tested the
   isotherm of pure CO2 adsorption with partial pressure from 10(-5) to 1
   bar at ambient temperature. The CO2 adsorption capacity and actual
   expected working capacity (EWC) curves of pristine and acid-treated
   olivine were determined. Isotherm studies predict that physisorption
   dominates chemisorptions at ambient temperatures. The adsorption
   capacity enhances with the increase of specific surface area, pore
   volume, and the appearance of Mg complexed on the mineral's surface.
   Actual EWC studies showed that acid-treated olivine is an adsorbent
   choice for the VSA process, due to enhanced CO2 adsorption capacities
   compared to olivine and the potential for 100\% recovery of CO2 during
   the regeneration process. Pristine olivine is not suitable for the VSA
   process because of bad regenerability, but it can be used in capturing
   and sequestering dilute CO2 in process streams. Our research reveals
   excellent viability for the application of VSA in the area of CO2
   capture using pristine olivine and acid-treated olivine.}},

Title = {{A model-based approach to stability analysis of autonomic-cardiac
   regulation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{119-126}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a model-based approach to analyze the stability of
   autonomic-cardiac regulation. In the proposed approach, a low-order
   lumped parameter model of autonomic-cardiac regulation is used to derive
   the system equilibria based on the measurements of heart rate and blood
   pressure, and then the stability margin associated with the equilibria
   is quantified via the Lyapunov's stability analysis method. A unique
   strength of the proposed approach is that it provides a quantitative
   measure of autonomic-cardiac stability via a computationally efficient
   analysis. Therefore, by integrating it with system identification
   techniques to derive autonomic-cardiac regulation model tuned to each
   individual, the proposed approach is able to assess subject-specific
   autonomic-cardiac stability. Indeed, our initial in-silico investigation
   showed that the proposed approach could estimate the system equilibria
   accurately, and the associated stability margin behaved consistently
   with widely accepted physiologic knowledge. The proposed approach may be
   useful in identifying physiological conditions that can lead to
   instability in autonomic-cardiac regulation, quantifying the margin of
   stability and distance to instability related to autonomic-cardiac
   regulation, and developing interventions to prevent autonomic-cardiac
   instability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the construction and predictive models of three novel
   measurement platforms: (i) a Pore Formation Measurement Platform (PFMP)
   for detecting the presence of pore forming proteins and peptides, (ii)
   the Ion Channel Switch (ICS) biosensor for detecting the presence of
   analyte molecules in a fluid chamber, and (iii) an Electroporation
   Measurement Platform (EMP) that provides reliable measurements of the
   electroporation phenomenon. Common to all three measurement platforms is
   that they are comprised of an engineered tethered membrane that is
   formed via a rapid solvent exchange technique allowing the platform to
   have a lifetime of several months. The membrane is tethered to a gold
   electrode bioelectronic interface that includes an ionic reservoir
   separating the membrane and gold surface, allowing the membrane to mimic
   the physiological response of natural cell membranes. The electrical
   response of the PFMP, ICS, and EMP are predicted using continuum
   theories for electrodiffusive flow coupled with boundary conditions for
   modelling chemical reactions and electrical double layers present at the
   bioelectronic interface. Experimental measurements are used to validate
   the predictive accuracy of the dynamic models. These include using the
   PFMP for measuring the pore formation dynamics of the antimicrobial
   peptide PGLa and the protein toxin Staphylococcal -Hemolysin; the ICS
   biosensor for measuring nano-molar concentrations of streptavidin,
   ferritin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic
   gonadotropin (pregnancy hormone hCG); and the EMP for measuring
   electroporation of membranes with different tethering densities, and

Abstract = {{Currently, proper vehicle head restraint (HR) positioning requires
   manual adjustment and knowledge on the part of the occupant. By removing
   the requirement for manual adjustment, an HR positioning system that
   autonomously moves and adapts the HR position properly to any seated
   occupant could serve to reduce the social and personal costs of whiplash
   injuries, as compared with existing manual systems. To achieve this,
   quantification of the occupant's head position relative to the HR is
   required. In a previous paper, a rectangular capacitive
   proximity-sensing array for the purpose of occupant head position
   quantification was studied. Here, a range-maximized sensor was first
   designed to reduce electrostatic and environmental disturbances. To
   achieve this, numerical modeling and laboratory experiments were
   conducted, and then, a design process for an interdigitated comb-shaped
   sensor geometry was proposed to maximize the sensing range of the
   sensor. The effects of temperature and humidity on the sensor were also
   evaluated and compensated. A novel capacitive proximity-sensing array
   was then designed, which had the minimum number of the aforementioned
   comb-shaped sensors necessary for accurately estimating the 3-D position
   of an occupant's head in near real time. This estimation was carried out
   using a nonparametric neural network. The above capacitive array was
   then integrated and fully contained in a customized HR as part of a
   vehicle seat safety system. The system was tested and demonstrated that
   such a head position sensing methodology would be capable of
   autonomously positioning an HR to meet the guidelines of the Insurance
   Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).}},

Abstract = {{Femtocell networks have the potential to satisfy the increasing demand
   of mobile data usage. The recently proposed concept of cognitive
   femtocell network provides an effective way to further improve the
   spectrum spatial and frequency reuse. In this paper, we study the
   subchannel allocation problem for orthogonal frequency division multiple
   access (OFDMA)-based hybrid overlay/underlay cognitive femtocell
   networks. While most of the previous related studies did not fully
   exploit the potential of spatial and frequency reuse of the network, we
   propose a hybrid overlay and underlay spectrum access mechanism to
   further improve the performance of cognitive femtocell networks. We
   formulate the subchannel allocation problem as a coalition formation
   game among femtocell users under the hybrid access scheme, and analyze
   the stability of the coalition structure. We propose an efficient
   algorithm based on the solution concept of recursive core, and achieve a
   stable and efficient allocation. Simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm achieves an improvement in aggregate network
   throughput up to 72\% comparing to the overlay only scheme, 35\%
   comparing to the underlay only scheme, and 18\% comparing to a recently
   proposed coalition formation algorithm in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive small cell networks have been envisioned as a promising
   technique for meeting the exponentially increasing mobile traffic
   demand. Recently, many technological issues pertaining to cognitive
   small cell networks have been studied, including resource allocation and
   interference mitigation, but most studies assume non-cooperative schemes
   or perfect channel state information (CSI). Different from the existing
   works, we investigate the joint uplink subchannel and power allocation
   problem in cognitive small cells using cooperative Nash bargaining game
   theory, where the cross-tier interference mitigation, minimum outage
   probability requirement, imperfect CSI and fairness in terms of minimum
   rate requirement are considered. A unified analytical framework is
   proposed for the optimization problem, where the near optimal
   cooperative bargaining resource allocation strategy is derived based on
   Lagrangian dual decomposition by introducing time-sharing variables and
   recalling the Lambert-W function. The existence, uniqueness, and
   fairness of the solution to this game model are proved. A cooperative
   Nash bargaining resource allocation algorithm is developed, and is shown
   to converge to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium for the cooperative game.
   Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed cooperative game algorithm for efficient and fair resource
   allocation in cognitive small cell networks.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and
   mode of ProFile Vortex and Vortex Blue instrument defects after clinical
   use in a graduate endodontic program and to examine the impact of
   clinical use on the instruments' metallurgical properties. Methods: A
   total of 330 ProFile Vortex and 1136 Vortex Blue instruments from the
   graduate program were collected after each had been used in 3 teeth. The
   incidence and type of instrument defects were analyzed. The lateral
   surfaces and fracture surfaces of the fractured files were examined by
   using scanning electron microscopy. Unused and used instruments were
   examined by full and partial differential scanning calorimetry. Results:
   No fractures were observed in the 330 ProFile Vortex instruments,
   whereas 20 (6.1\%) revealed bent or blunt defects. Only 2 of the 1136
   Vortex Blue files fractured during clinical use. The cause of fracture
   was shear stress. The fractures occurred at the tip end of the spirals.
   Only 1.8\% (21 of 1136) of the Vortex Blue files had blunt tips.
   Austenite-finish temperatures were very similar for unused and used
   ProFile Vortex files and were all greater than 50 degrees C. The
   austenite-finish temperatures of used and unused Vortex Blue files (38.5
   degrees C) were lower than those in ProFile Vortex instruments (P <
   .001). However, the transformation behavior of Vortex Blue files had an
   obvious 2-stage transformation, martensite-to-R phase and R-to-austenite
   phase. The trends of differential scanning calorimetry plots of unused
   Vortex. Blue instruments and clinically used instruments were very
   similar. Conclusions: The risk of ProFile Vortex and Vortex Blue
   instrument fracture is very low when instruments are discarded after
   clinical use in the graduate endodontic program. The Vortex Blue files
   have metallurgical behavior different from ProFile Vortex instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Dropwise condensation can be enhanced by superhydrophobic surfaces on
   which the condensate drops spontaneously jump upon coalescence. However,
   the self-propelled jumping in prior reports is mostly perpendicular to
   the substrate. Here, we propose a substrate design with regularly spaced
   micropillars. Coalescence on the sidewalls of the micropillars leads to
   self-propelled jumping in a direction nearly orthogonal to the pillars
   and therefore parallel to the substrate. This in-plane motion in turn
   produces sweeping removal of multiple neighboring drops. The spontaneous
   sweeping mechanism may greatly enhance dropwise condensation in a
   self-sustained manner. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based design in earthquake engineering is a structural
   optimization problem that has, as the objective, the determination of
   design parameters for the minimization of total costs, while at the same
   time satisfying minimum reliability levels for the specified performance
   criteria. Total costs include those for construction and structural
   damage repairs, those associated with non-structural components and the
   social costs of economic losses, injuries and fatalities. This paper
   presents a general framework to approach this problem, using a numerical
   optimization strategy and incorporating the use of neural networks for
   the evaluation of dynamic responses and the reliability levels achieved
   for a given set of design parameters. The strategy is applied to an
   example of a three-story office building. The results show the
   importance of considering the social costs, and the optimum failure
   probabilities when minimum reliability constraints are not taken into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate fundamental performance limits of
   cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) in downlink
   cellular networks. CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that
   can assign different time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy
   different channel access ratio (CAR) requirements of users while
   exploiting multiuser diversity. We first mathematically analyze the
   throughput characteristics of CS in arbitrary fading statistics and data
   rate functions. It is shown that the throughput gain of CS increases as
   the CAR of a user decreases or the number of users in a cell increases.
   For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the average throughput in
   closed form and investigate the effects of the average signal-to-noise
   ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput performance.
   In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback
   technique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR
   requirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of
   the proposed technique is upper-bounded by -ln p, where is the
   probability that no user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell.
   Finally, we adopt a novel fairness criterion, called qualitative
   fairness, which considers not only the quantity of the allocated
   resources to users, but also the quality of the resources. It is
   observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than other
   scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless energy harvesting (WEH) is becoming one of the key techniques
   in energy harvesting in wireless networks. On the other hand,
   interference alignment (IA) is a promising solution for interference
   management in wireless networks. Although plenty of effort has been
   conducted on WEH and IA, these two important areas have been addressed
   separately in most of the existing literature. In this article we
   provide an overview of WEH in IA networks, and present a unified
   framework to jointly study WEH and IA. To simultaneously optimize both
   information transmission (IT) and WEH performance in IA networks, we
   propose a power splitting optimization (PSO) algorithm. In addition, we
   study the power allocation problem in the proposed PSO algorithm.
   Simulation results are presented to compare the performance of the
   proposed schemes for WEH in IA networks. Some interesting research
   challenges are also presented for the WEH in IA networks.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging computing concept that
   describes a structure in which everyday physical objects, each provided

   components for realization of such a complex network, and entail
   energy-aware devices that are potentially capable of harvesting their
   required energy from ambient sources. Among different energy harvesting
   methods, such as vibration, light, and thermal energy extraction,
   wireless energy harvesting (WEH) has proven to be one of the most
   promising solutions by virtue of its simplicity, ease of implementation,
   and availability. In this article, we present an overview of enabling
   technologies for efficient WEH, analyze the lifetime of WEH-enabled IoT
   devices, and briefly study the future trends in the design of efficient
   WEH systems and research challenges that lie ahead.}},

Abstract = {{The near-surface stress distribution around Cu through-silicon vias
   (TSVs) was studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy along with finite-element
   analysis from room temperature to 100 degrees C. Temperature-dependent
   measurements, along with simulations, revealed that the stresses near
   TSVs can have two components: 1) the preexisting stress before copper
   filling; and 2) the coefficients of thermal expansion
   (CTE)-mismatch-induced stress. The CTE-mismatch-induced stress resulted
   in a mobility change, and a keep-out zone (KOZ) at elevated temperatures
   was also estimated, where the KOZ was defined as the region with a
   mobility change larger than or equal to 10\%. Higher temperatures were
   shown to reduce the CTE-mismatch-induced stress component and resulted
   in the shrinkage of KOZs in Si. The preexisting stress was shown to be
   significant in a region equal to or larger than the KOZs induced by the
   CTE-mismatch-induced stress only and should be characterized and
   considered in the KOZ determination and the circuit design.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a detailed computational study of the flow of a Bingham fluid
   along a narrow channel, with one locally uneven wall. This uneven
   section of the channel represents a washed out section of an oil well
   about to be cemented. By studying a wide range of different washout
   geometries, of differing shape characterized by dimensionless height h
   and length L, we discover that the flows exhibit a type of
   self-similarity in the limit of large h and B. More specifically, in
   this limit we find that regardless of the washout geometry, the area of
   the channel that contains moving fluid is the same for each L.
   Essentially, uneven and distant parts of the washout become full of
   static fluid, below the yield stress, while the flow self-selects its
   own unique geometry. The washout geometry with the largest flowing
   region within the washout, appears to be the square wave. We show how a
   simple correction can be calculated that allows one to predict the
   flowing area for other washout geometries. Lastly, we examine the effect
   on the pressure drop of different washout geometries. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-throughput information extraction from large numbers of Raman
   spectra is becoming an increasingly taxing problem due to the
   proliferation of new applications enabled using advances in
   instrumentation. Fortunately, in many of these applications, the entire
   process can be automated, yielding reproducibly good results with
   significant time and cost savings. Information extraction consists of
   two stages, preprocessing and analysis. We focus here on the
   preprocessing stage, which typically involves several steps, such as
   calibration, background subtraction, baseline flattening, artifact
   removal, smoothing, and so on, before the resulting spectra can be
   further analyzed. Because the results of some of these steps can affect
   the performance of subsequent ones, attention must be given to the
   sequencing of steps, the compatibility of these sequences, and the
   propensity of each step to generate spectral distortions. We outline
   here important considerations to effect full automation of Raman
   spectral preprocessing; what is considered full automation; putative
   general principles to effect full automation; the proper sequencing of
   processing and analysis steps; conflicts and circularities arising from
   sequencing; and the need for, and approaches to, preprocessing quality
   control. These considerations are discussed and illustrated with
   biological and biomedical examples reflecting both successful and faulty
   preprocessing.}},

Title = {{Numerical study of the evolution of cohesion and internal friction in

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Rock strength is generally divided into the components of cohesion and
   internal friction. These components are two important parameters for
   estimating the damaged or disturbed zone around an excavation and its
   corresponding support design. However, the cohesive and frictional
   strength components at the same strain increment before peak strength
   are difficult to separate from each other. In addition, the
   misperception of their mutual evolution has been in existence for a long
   time. A numerical code, Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA2D), based on
   the finite element method was used in this study to clarify this
   misperception. The RFPA2D approach can account for rock heterogeneity
   and capture the entire rock failure process without prior assumptions
   regarding where and how microcracks and fracturing develop. Numerical
   models of rock were copied and reused in uniaxial and biaxial tests to
   create identical heterogeneous models for use under different confining
   stress conditions. Forty-five numerical tests (5 homogeneity indexesx9
   confining pressures) were used to calculate the results of the principal
   stresses (sigma(1) and sigma(3)) at specified increments of axial
   strain. The intercept and the slope of a linear line fitting to the
   principal stresses at the same strain before peak strength were obtained
   in the principal stress space. The intercept is related to the cohesive
   strength component of the shear resistance, and the slope of the linear
   line is a pseudo-internal friction coefficient. Through the analysis of
   the linear fitting results, it has been found that the cohesive strength
   component increases while the pseudo-internal friction coefficient
   decreases with increasing homogeneity index of the numerical rock
   models. The values of cohesion and internal friction vary as a function
   of the strain state, and they are immediately activated with a strain
   increment before peak strength. The research results strengthen the
   understanding of the mobilization of the load-bearing capacity of rock
   mass surrounding an opening and can improve the design of practical
   support systems.}},

Title = {{A microneedle-based method for the characterization of diffusion in skin
   tissue using doxorubicin as a model drug}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Hollow microneedles can overcome the stratum corneum (SC) barrier and
   deposit a compound directly into the viable epidermis or the dermis,
   unlike adhesive patches that rely on drug diffusion across the SC. The
   traditional one-dimensional methods used to study the diffusivity of
   drugs across the skin layers are not very accurate for hollow
   microneedles, since the ejection of compounds out of microneedle lumens
   resembles a point-source spreading in all directions and is highly
   dependent on injection depth. This paper presents a technique that is
   useful for studying drug injection using hollow microneedles at various
   depths below the SC. This technique uses confocal microscopy to image
   the distribution of a fluorescent compound in the skin after injection.
   The fluorescence distribution in the skin is observed over time and
   applied to a spherical Gaussian diffusion model for limited source
   diffusion to determine the diffusion coefficient of the compound in the
   skin. Applied to freshly excised pig skin, the diffusion coefficient for
   the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin was measured as 4.61 x 10(-9) cm(2)/s,
   while the diffusion coefficient in previously refrigerated or frozen pig
   skin was 1.31 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s and 4.21 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s, respectively.
   Our data suggests that skin storage conditions can substantially alter
   the diffusion of drugs. The use of refrigerated and, even more so,
   previously frozen skin should be avoided for quantitative transdermal
   drug delivery studies.}},

Abstract = {{Disregard of triple bottom line (TBL) of sustainability is one of the
   major drawbacks of current construction procurement practices.
   Sustainable procurement is an emergent concept that can improve
   procurement practices and enhance the sustainability performance of the
   construction industry as a whole. Presently, sustainable procurement is
   still not fully utilized in the Canadian construction industry. A
   comprehensive literature review showed that the construction industry is
   still not fully aware about the benefits of using sustainable
   procurement or ways of implementing the same. This study evaluates
   challenges encountered in implementing sustainable procurement in the
   Canadian construction industry. In addition, this study investigates
   perceptions of construction professionals on the benefits of using
   sustainable procurement for construction projects. A country wide
   questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted to
   collect required data. A statistical analysis was performed to rank the
   challenges and benefits of sustainable procurement. Findings from
   semi-structured interviews were used to validate the results observed in
   the statistical analysis. This study revealed that lack of funding is
   the main challenge for implementing sustainable procurement, while
   reducing harmful emissions and waste generation was identified as the
   main benefit. It was concluded that the leadership and commitment of the
   project owners is the key to fully establish sustainable procurement in
   the Canadian construction industry.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrian scramble phasing is usually implemented to reduce
   pedestrian-vehicle conflicts and therefore increase the safety of the
   intersection. However, to adequately determine the benefits of scramble
   phasing, it is necessary to understand how pedestrians react to such an
   unconventional design. This study investigates changes in pedestrian
   crossing behavior following the implementation of a scramble phase by
   examining the spatiotemporal gait parameters (step length and step
   frequency). This detailed microscopic-level analysis provides insight
   into changes in pedestrian walking mechanisms as well as the effect of
   various pedestrian and intersection characteristics. The study uses
   video data collected at a scramble phase signalized intersection in
   Oakland, California. Gait parameters were found to be influenced by
   pedestrian gender, age, group size, crosswalk length, and pedestrian
   signal indications. Both average step length and walking speed were
   significantly higher for diagonally crossing pedestrians compared with
   pedestrians crossing on the conventional crosswalks. Pedestrians were
   found to have the tendency to increase their step length more than their
   step frequency to increase walking speed. It was also found that,
   compared with men, women generally increase their walking speed by
   increasing their step frequency more than step length. However, when in
   non-compliance with signal indications, women increase their walking
   speed by increasing their step length more than step frequency. It was
   also found that older pedestrians do not significantly change their
   walking behavior when in non-compliance with signal indications.

Abstract = {{Space-filling curves have been found useful for many applications in

   the space to the integer line. An algorithm is presented, which
   generates a large number of space-filling curves/spatial orders.
   Functions are derived such that the code of each location can be
   calculated from its coordinates and, conversely, a location code can be
   decoded to yield the coordinates. The algorithm first generates generate
   4x4 spatial orders; they subsequently may be scaled up to any desired
   domain of size 2r x 2r. The underlying theory of the algorithm, the

Abstract = {{In recent years, fusion of multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) with
   transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy has enabled targeted
   prostate biopsy with improved cancer yield. Target identification is
   solely based on information from mp-MRI, which is subsequently
   transferred to the subject coordinates through an image registration
   approach. mp-MRI has shown to be highly sensitive to detect higher-grade
   prostate cancer, but suffers from a high rate of false positives for
   lower-grade cancer, leading to unnecessary biopsies. This paper utilizes
   a machine-learning framework to further improve the sensitivity of
   targeted biopsy through analyzing temporal ultrasound data backscattered
   from the prostate tissue.
   Temporal ultrasound data were acquired during targeted fusion prostate
   biopsy from suspicious cancer foci identified in mp-MRI. Several
   spectral features, representing the signature of backscattered signal
   from the tissue, were extracted from the temporal ultrasound data. A
   supervised support vector machine classification model was trained to
   relate the features to the result of histopathology analysis of biopsy
   cores obtained from cancer foci. The model was used to predict the label
   of biopsy cores for mp-MRI-identified targets in an independent group of
   subjects.
   Training of the classier was performed on data obtained from 35 biopsy
   cores. A fivefold cross-validation strategy was utilized to examine the
   consistency of the selected features from temporal ultrasound data,
   where we achieved the classification accuracy and area under receiver
   operating characteristic curve of 94 \% and 0.98, respectively.
   Subsequently, an independent group of 25 biopsy cores was used for
   validation of the model, in which mp-MRI had identified suspicious
   cancer foci. Using the trained model, we predicted the tissue pathology
   using temporal ultrasound data: 16 out of 17 benign cores, as well as
   all three higher-grade cancer cores, were correctly identified.
   The results show that temporal analysis of ultrasound data is
   potentially an effective approach to complement mp-MRI-TRUS-guided
   prostate cancer biopsy, specially to reduce the number of unnecessary
   biopsies and to reliably identify higher-grade cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Epidural needle insertions and facet joint injections play an important
   role in spine anaesthesia. The main challenge of safe needle insertion
   is the deep location of the target, resulting in a narrow and small
   insertion channel close to sensitive anatomy. Recent approaches
   utilizing ultrasound (US) as a low-cost and widely available guiding
   modality are promising but have yet to become routinely used in clinical
   practice due to the difficulty in interpreting US images, their limited
   view of the internal anatomy of the spine, and/or inclusion of
   cost-intensive tracking hardware which impacts the clinical workflow.
   We propose a novel guidance system for spine anaesthesia. An efficient
   implementation allows us to continuously align and overlay a statistical
   model of the lumbar spine on the live 3D US stream without making use of
   additional tracking hardware. The system is evaluated in vivo on 12
   volunteers.
   The in vivo study showed that the anatomical features of the epidural
   space and the facet joints could be continuously located, at a volume
   rate of 0.5 Hz, within an accuracy of 3 and 7 mm, respectively.
   A novel guidance system for spine anaesthesia has been presented which
   augments a live 3D US stream with detailed anatomical information of the
   spine. Results from an in vivo study indicate that the proposed system
   has potential for assisting the physician in quickly finding the target
   structure and planning a safe insertion trajectory in the spine.}},

Abstract = {{Injection therapy is a commonly used solution for back pain management.
   This procedure typically involves percutaneous insertion of a needle
   between or around the vertebrae, to deliver anesthetics near nerve
   bundles. Most frequently, spinal injections are performed either blindly
   using palpation or under the guidance of fluoroscopy or computed
   tomography. Recently, due to the drawbacks of the ionizing radiation of
   such imaging modalities, there has been a growing interest in using
   ultrasound imaging as an alternative. However, the complex spinal
   anatomy with different wave-like structures, affected by speckle noise,
   makes the accurate identification of the appropriate injection plane
   difficult. The aim of this study was to propose an automated system that
   can identify the optimal plane for epidural steroid injections and facet
   joint injections.
   A multi-scale and multi-directional feature extraction system to provide
   automated identification of the appropriate plane is proposed. Local
   Hadamard coefficients are obtained using the sequency-ordered Hadamard
   transform at multiple scales. Directional features are extracted from
   local coefficients which correspond to different regions in the
   ultrasound images. An artificial neural network is trained based on the
   local directional Hadamard features for classification.
   The proposed method yields distinctive features for classification which
   successfully classified 1032 images out of 1090 for epidural steroid
   injection and 990 images out of 1052 for facet joint injection. In order
   to validate the proposed method, a leave-one-out cross-validation was
   performed. The average classification accuracy for leave-one-out
   validation was 94 \% for epidural and 90 \% for facet joint targets.
   Also, the feature extraction time for the proposed method was 20 ms for
   a native 2D ultrasound image.
   A real-time machine learning system based on the local directional
   Hadamard features extracted by the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform
   for detecting the laminae and facet joints in ultrasound images has been
   proposed. The system has the potential to assist the anesthesiologists
   in quickly finding the target plane for epidural steroid injections and
   facet joint injections.}},

Abstract = {{The scaphoid bone is the most frequently fractured bone in the wrist.
   When fracture fixation is indicated, a screw is inserted into the bone
   either in an open surgical procedure or percutaneously under
   fluoroscopic guidance. Due to the complex geometry of the wrist,
   fracture fixation is a challenging task. Fluoroscopic guidance exposes
   both the patient and the physician to ionizing radiation.
   Ultrasound-based guidance has been suggested as a real-time,
   radiation-free alternative. The main challenge of using ultrasound is
   the difficulty in interpreting the images due to the low contrast and
   noisy nature of the data.
   We propose a bone enhancement method that exploits local spectrum
   features of the ultrasound image. These features are utilized to design
   a set of quadrature band-pass filters and subsequently estimate the
   local phase symmetry, where high symmetry is expected at the bone
   locations. We incorporate the shadow information below the bone surfaces
   to further enhance the bone responses. The extracted bone surfaces are
   then used to register a statistical wrist model to ultrasound volumes,
   allowing the localization and interpretation of the scaphoid bone in the
   volumes.
   Feasibility experiments were performed using phantom and in vivo data.
   For phantoms, we obtain a surface distance error 1.08 mm and an angular
   deviation from the main axis of the scaphoid bone smaller than , which
   are better compared to previously presented approaches.
   The results are promising for further development of a surgical guidance
   system to enable accurate anatomy localization for guiding percutaneous
   scaphoid fracture fixations.}},

Title = {{Overview of the current issues in austenite to ferrite transformation
   and the role of migrating interfaces therein for low alloyed steels}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING R-REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{1-38}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Solid state phase transformations in metals, and more precisely the
   science of transformation interfaces, is a key point to understand the
   formation of nano/microstructure, and thus, as a result, many physical
   properties such as mechanical properties, conductivity, thermoelectric
   and magnetic properties of materials.
   Steels are by far the most widely used metallic alloys, and a deep
   understanding of their microstructure is essential to tailor their
   service properties. The transformation of high temperature parent
   austenite to ferrite is one of the main issues controlling the final
   microstructures, and for more than a century, this has driven
   metallurgists to investigate in detail this solid state transformation,
   and, particularly, the details of austenite to ferrite interface
   migration.
   In this paper, we review the evolution of the different concepts and
   experiments developed in the last century to investigate this
   transformation mechanism.
   After a brief introduction, most of the physical models developed, which
   reduce the alpha/gamma interface into a mathematical body with its own
   properties, are reviewed and discussed with regard to experimental data.
   The increased availability of highly sophisticated experimental and
   modelling tools in recent decades has considerably clarified the
   perceptions of transformation interfaces. These recent advances are
   presented, and their contribution to the field of migrating
   austenite-ferrite interfaces are highlighted in a third section. In the
   fourth section, the latest developments in experimental methods, which
   now allow the quasi atomistic direct characterization of the interface
   chemistry, are presented. The observed conditions at the interfaces can
   be compared with model predictions, which is believed to be a critical
   step for the refinement of the theoretical concepts guiding the
   understanding of the interface migration. Finally, in the concluding
   section, the present situation of the field is summarized, and some
   perspectives regarding the expected future developments are sketched.

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Using cloudlets in mobile networks mitigates the resource limitation of
   mobile devices to process the applications with rich media content and
   highly interaction. However, this approach changes the original traffic
   routing path of mobile networks and causes integration complexity that
   cannot be easily solved without modifying the current mobile network
   elements and routing policies over current IP transport network.
   OpenFlow based SDN architecture can use its centralized control plane to
   oversee its data paths and enable flexible traffic routing. Combining
   SDN to cloudlets creates possibilities to reduce this complexity. In
   this article, we propose a novel SDN based cloudlet approach that
   deploys cloudlets in a Mobile Telephone Switch Office, where a SDN based
   transport network that supports an enhanced OpenFlow 1.3 protocol is
   enabled. With this enhanced OpenFlow 1.3 protocol, each switch/ router
   and controller within this transport network can extract the source IP
   of a user packet encapsulated by a GTP header, so that the user packets
   from a particular remote mobile service front end can be identified and
   redirected to a local cloudlet without modifying the existing mobile
   network elements and routing paths. A proof-of-concept prototype is
   provided, and its functionality and performance is evaluated over a
   small test bed emulated by Mininet.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of individuals based on patterns of brain activity
   observed in functional MRI contrasts may be helpful for diagnosis of
   neurological disorders. Prior work for classification based on these
   patterns have primarily focused on using a single contrast, which does
   not take advantage of complementary information that may be available in
   multiple contrasts. Where multiple contrasts are used, the objective has
   been only to identify the joint, distinct brain activity patterns that
   differ between groups of subjects; not to use the information to
   classify individuals. Here, we use joint Independent Component Analysis
   (jICA) within a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, and
   take advantage of the relative contribution of activation patterns
   generated from multiple fMRI contrasts to improve classification
   accuracy. Young (age: 19-26) and older (age: 57-73) adults (16 each)
   were scanned while listening to noise alone and to speech degraded with
   noise, half of which contained meaningful context that could be used to
   enhance intelligibility. Functional contrasts based on these conditions
   (and a silent baseline condition) were used within jICA to generate
   spatially independent joint activation sources and their corresponding
   modulation profiles. Modulation profiles were used within a non-linear
   SVM framework to classify individuals as young or older. Results
   demonstrate that a combination of activation maps across the multiple
   contrasts yielded an area under ROC curve of 0.86, superior to
   classification resulting from individual contrasts. Moreover, class
   separability, measured by a divergence criterion, was substantially
   higher when using the combination of activation maps.}},

Abstract = {{Storage of wood pellets has resulted in deadly accidents in connection

   degree of mixing, residence time distribution of the tracer gas was also
   studied experimentally. Large deviations from plug flow suggested strong
   gas mixing for all superficial velocities. As the velocity increased,
   the system dispersion number became smaller, which indicated less degree
   of mixing with increased volume of the purging gas. One-dimensional
   modelling and numerical simulation of the off-gas concentration profile

   This paper extends the VBR representation to the rotor circuit and
   presents two new formulations that achieve direct constant-parameter
   interfacing of the rotor and stator terminals with arbitrary external
   networks. In the first model, the entire machine is represented by
   constant RL branches that have algebraic coupling among the circuit
   variables. In the second model, all damper windings are implemented in
   state-space form to increase the numerical efficiency, while the stator
   and field windings are provided as constant-parameter circuits. The
   proposed models are validated against the commonly used and some
   state-of-the-art alternative models using a single machine with a
   simplified ac excitation system. Computer studies demonstrate the

Abstract = {{Due to the repeated switching, the detailed switch-level models of
   electrical machines coupled with power-electronic converters are
   computationally expensive and hard to linearize for small-signal
   frequency-domain analysis. Average-value modeling (AVM) has become an
   effective tool for small-signal analysis of power electronic systems and
   time-domain transient studies where the details of switching are not
   important and can be neglected. Recently, a parametric AVM (PAVM)
   approach has been developed for machine/diode rectifier systems. This
   paper extends the parametric approach to the
   machine/thyristor-controlled-rectifier systems, where the thyristor
   firing may be referenced to either the line voltages or the rotor
   position. An analytical average model for this system is also developed
   based on the recently proposed constant-parameter
   voltage-behind-reactance synchronous machine model. The new PAVM is
   compared against the original switching system, as well as the
   analytical AVM. It is shown that the PAVM can accurately predict both
   small-signal characteristics and large-signal transients of the original
   switching system in light and heavy modes, which represents an advantage
   over the analytical models which are typically implicit.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the concepts of dynamic phasors and shifted-frequency analysis
   (SFA) have received renewed attention as a possible solution framework
   for the modeling of power system components and transients, as opposed
   to using instantaneous time-domain variables or conventional phasors. In
   this paper, a new voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) synchronous machine
   model based on SFA is presented. Using dynamic phasors, the proposed
   model permits the use of a much larger range of step sizes to
   efficiently simulate electromagnetic and electromechanical transients.
   Moreover, the proposed model has a constant-parameter (CP) stator
   interface, which is simple to implement and numerically more efficient
   compared with the prior state-of-the-art models with
   rotor-position-dependent stator inductance matrices. Rigorous transient
   case studies demonstrate that the new model requires significantly fewer
   time steps than the conventional time-domain models, and is more
   efficient than the previously established variable-parameter SFA model.}},

Abstract = {{Hot tearing in magnesium and aluminum alloys has been rigorously
   investigated in the past decades. To date, the interactions between the
   solidification parameters, microstructural development, and stress and
   strain at the onset of hot tearing in magnesium alloys remain unclear.
   In particular, the stress and strain conditions required to nucleate hot
   tears are unknown. In this research, ex situ neutron diffraction
   residual strain mapping was carried out on AZ91D magnesium alloy
   castings at the onset of hot tearing. The results indicate that tensile
   strain alone was not sufficient to nucleate a hot tear. A minimum
   threshold tensile stress of similar to 12 MPa was necessary to open
   interdendritic shrinkage pores into hot tears and enable their
   propagation. Further, deformation along (10 (1) over bar1)and (10 (1)
   over bar2) crystallographic planes played a dominant role on the
   high-temperature deformation and hot tearing in the AZ91D alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Smart lead rubber bearings (LRBs), in which a shape memory alloy (SMA)
   is used in the form of wires, are a new generation of elastomeric
   isolators with improved performance in terms of recentering capability
   and energy dissipation capacity. It is of great interest to implement
   SMA wire-based lead rubber bearings (SMA-LRBs) in bridges; however,
   currently there is no appropriate hysteresis model for accurately
   simulating the behavior of such isolators. A constitutive model for
   SMA-LRBs is proposed in this study. An LRB is equipped with a double
   cross configuration of SMA wires (DC-SMAW) and subjected to compression
   and unidirectional shear loadings. Due to the complexity of the shear
   behavior of the SMA-LRB, a hysteresis model is developed for the
   DC-SMAWs and then combined with the bilinear kinematic hardening model,
   which is assumed for the LRB. Comparing the hysteretic response of
   decoupled systems with that of the SMA-LRB shows that the high
   recentering capability of the DC-SMAW model with zero residual
   deformation could noticeably reduce the residual deformation of the LRB.
   The developed constitutive model for DC-SMAWs is characterized by three
   stiffnesses when the shear strain exceeds a starting limit at which the
   SMA wires are activated due to phase transformation. An important point
   is that the shear hysteresis of the DC-SMAW model looks different from
   the flag-shaped hysteresis of the SMA because of the specific
   arrangement of wires and its effect on the resultant forces transferred
   from the wires to the rubber bearing.}},

Abstract = {{The natural rivers in developing countries have not been meeting their
   desirable water quality objectives due to discharge of untreated
   wastewater from domestic and industrial sources for a long time; and
   thus need to implement rational water quality management (WQM) plans.
   Overall sustainability of proposed WQM options should not be overlooked
   during the planning phase due to lack or absence of data. In this
   research, a framework is proposed for the evaluation of different WQM
   options to meet the water quality objectives of natural rivers. Five
   main sustainability criteria (SSC) are considered, including cost
   (capital, land and operational), land requirements, operation and
   maintenance issues, environmental impacts, and socio-economic impacts.
   In addition, several sub-criteria (impacts) have also been included to
   rationally justify the assessment of SSC by the decision makers (DM).
   The values of cost and land requirement criteria are calculated;
   whereas, the other SSC are subjective in nature. However, both types
   possess uncertainties associated with calculation errors, inherent
   assumptions, and the differences in DM's opinions. Further, due to data
   limitations in developing countries, the ranking order of WQM options
   established by the DM should be preferred. To deal with such
   uncertainties and the DM preferences, the Fuzzy UTAS TAR multicriteria
   analysis method (based on linear programing) has been used for
   sustainability evaluation. To appraise the practicality of the proposed
   framework, it has been applied to the WQM of the Ravi River in Pakistan.
   The minimal difference between the DM's top ranked options affirms the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{Environment assessment is a complex multiple attribute decision-making

   Environmental indices (EI) are very useful for environmental

   is necessary to use a mathematical operator to aggregate various

   a new mathematic model of environmental indices based on fuzzy numbers

   different sources are modeled as fuzzy numbers. Secondly, a method to
   transform fuzzy variables into basic probability assignments is
   developed based on the similarity measure between generalized fuzzy
   numbers. Then conflict data is efficiently combined based on the power
   average operator. At last, a real application to determine water quality
   indices is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{171-180}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate the flow characteristics and
   mechanism of pressure letdown of a conveying facility at pressures up to
   3.0 MPa. The effects of operating parameters, particle size and diameter
   ratio on pressure drops across different sections of the pressure
   letdown system are examined. Results show that the pressure letdown
   causes a significant pressure drop in dense-phase pneumatic conveying.
   The effect of pressure letdown inlet velocity on the pressure drop
   through different sections is weak at constant solids mass flow rate.
   With increasing solidi mass flow rate, particle size or diameter ratio,
   the pressure drops for the convergent section and straight pipe section
   increase, while the pressure drop of a divergent section differs from
   that of the other sections. The pressure drop of the straight pipe
   section is responsible for over 70\% of the pressure drop through the
   pressure letdown system. Diameter ratio, length, mass flow rate and
   powder properties determine the letdown pressure drop. Empirical models,
   derived based on the Barth additive theory, show good agreement with
   experimental results, with relative deviations less than 15\%. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The effect of thermal treatment of PdO/SiO2 catalysts in air versus
   air/water at temperatures <973 K, is reported. PdO sinters during
   thermal aging in the presence of air (dry aging) and air/water
   (hydrothermal aging), but the growth and restructuring of the PdO
   crystallites is suppressed in the presence of added water, as observed
   in both continuous aging and cyclic aging experiments. The
   hydrothermally aged catalysts (PdO size 3 nm) showed significantly lower
   CH4 oxidation activity than the catalysts thermally aged in air (PdO
   size 14 nm). A significant decrease in the Pd/Si ratio as measured by
   XPS, compared to a small growth in PdO size after hydrothermal aging,
   suggests PdO occlusion and hence a significant loss in activity
   following hydrothermal aging. The PdO occlusion and suppressed PdO
   particle sintering is attributed to SiO2 overlayers on the PdO that are
   a consequence of hydroxyl mobility of the support, enhanced by the
   presence of added water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1451-1465}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Taylor-Couette instability of thixotropic fluids obeying Moore model is
   numerically investigated for the case in which the inner cylinder is
   rotating and the outer cylinder is fixed. A linear temporal stability
   analysis is invoked in which infinitesimally-small perturbations,
   represented by normal modes, are superimposed to the base flow and their
   time evolution is followed in order to detect the onset of instability.
   An eigenvalue problem is obtained which is solved numerically using
   finite-difference scheme coupled with the ``polyeig{''} function of the
   Matlab software. The neutral instability curve is plotted as a function
   of the thixotropic parameters of the Moore model for a broad range of
   parameters. Based on the results obtained in this work, it is concluded
   that the viscosity ratio in the Moore model has a destabilizing effect
   on circular Couette flow. On the other hand, an increase in the
   breakdown-to-buildup ratio in the Moore model is predicted to have a
   stabilizing or destabilizing effect on circular Couette flow depending
   on the gap size and also the magnitude of the thixotropy ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Grid-connected converters require advanced controllers in order to
   achieve high performance and meet country-specific anti-islanding
   standards. This paper presents a novel, high performance islanding
   search sequence (ISS) technique applied to four islanding detection
   methods. The salient aspects of the proposed determination technique
   reside in its fault-tolerant safety redundancy with rapid unintentional
   islanding detection integrated within: active-reactive power control,
   maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm, and phase-locked loop
   routine. The islanding detection search sequence method is successfully
   implemented within a voltage-oriented inverter controller using a
   synchronously rotating reference frame. The ISS structure is designed
   with an adaptive strategy to achieve system stability and minimum impact
   on power quality, and is applicable to grid-connected distributed power
   generators. The adaptive search sequence results in fast detection,
   robust operation, and most importantly, a reduced reactive and active
   power injection. The proposed control structure and detection methods
   performance are demonstrated through experimental results of a
   three-phase, 20-kVA three-level neutral-point-clamped transformerless
   inverter. The evaluation results on the grid-interactive inverter
   include the islanding detection method integrated in the MPPT used in
   renewable energy harvesting applications.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for electric vehicles has expanded rapidly for both
   industrial and transportation applications. In parallel, new battery
   technologies capable of deeply discharging and powering electric
   vehicles over long periods of time have been introduced and made
   available in the market. Due to the increasing complexity of charging
   algorithms, battery chargers are exposed to demanding operating
   requirements. Chargers should not only work under different loading
   conditions (from absolutely zero to maximum output power) but also
   regulate a wide output voltage range (from near zero to 1.5 times
   nominal voltage). In this paper, a multiresonant L3C2 resonant converter
   is introduced that can cover nearly all of the regions in the battery
   V-I plane, from near zero output voltage, zero output current to maximum
   output power. By adding one capacitor, the topology is able to extend
   the operating frequency beyond the LLC topology and achieve significant
   regulation improvements. Near free-ripple charging current for batteries
   charging is achieved in different states of charge without using burst
   mode operation, effectively increasing the battery life cycle. In
   addition, soft transitions are obtained for all the switches (MOSFETs
   and diodes) resulting in high efficiency, reliability, power density,
   and low-noise operation of the charger. A complete set of simulation and
   experimental results, extracted from a 96-VDC 950-W L3C2 resonant
   converter, demonstrates the characteristic features of the proposed
   topology for battery charger applications, while providing a comparative
   example with the LLC topology.}},

   systematic study on complexes of cyclodextrins with alkali metal cations}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE: To date, the quantification of binding affinities for
   non-covalent complexes between cyclodextrin (CD) and alkali cations
   including Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ has not been investigated in detail
   by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) due to the unknown
   ionization efficiencies of the different species. In this study, the
   binding constants of CD-Cs+ complexes were determined by an improved
   mass spectrometric titration methodology, which was based only on the
   peak intensities of equilibrium CD. Hence, the discrepancy of ionization
   efficiencies of CD, alkaline cation and their complex would not affect
   the measurement. Then the obtained lgK(a) values were provided as
   references for competitive ESI-MS. The binding constants for complexes
   of alpha-, beta-or gamma-CD with Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+ could be derived
   directly and quickly.
   METHODS: The lgK(a) values between alpha-, beta-or gamma-CD and Cs+ data
   were processed by curve fitting. These lgK(a) values were provided as
   references for competitive ESI-MS. In addition, linear fit equations for
   complexes of alpha-, beta-or gamma-CD with Cs+ were derived. Through the
   linear fit equations of competitive ESI-MS, the binding constants for
   complexes of Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+ with alpha-, beta-or gamma-CD were
   acquired.
   RESULTS: Results showed that the binding constant (lgK(a)) values for
   the complexes of Cs+ with alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins were
   3.94, 3.88 and 3.80, respectively, revealing that the binding strength
   decreased with the increase in diameter of cyclodextrins. The
   competitive ESI-MS results showed a clear trend of decreasing affinity
   for complexes of cyclodextrins in the order of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+.
   CONCLUSIONS: The binding constants of non-covalent cyclodextrin-alkali
   cation complexes have been systematically studied by an improved mass
   spectrometric titration and competitive ESI-MS. Also, the structural
   features of the complexes were discussed. Our results are valuable for
   better understanding of mechanisms driving inclusion chemistry under
   well-defined conditions. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of highly-selective resins for the removal of anions
   from contaminated drinking water has increased the demand for these
   resins and increased the waste generated during the treatment process.
   The proof of concept for the extension of the use of these resins by use
   of multi-cycle exhaustion/bioregeneration has been demonstrated
   previously. To fully develop a process for the commercialization of this
   technology it is important to determine the effect of the temperature
   and salt concentration on the nitrate desorption rates to model chemical
   and biological processes. Results show pseudo-second order kinetic
   analysis explains the experimental data very well. The initial
   desorption rates were significantly different in different salt
   concentrations and temperature; higher and lower value for 6\% and 2\%
   salt, higher and lower value at 35 degrees C and 12 degrees C. The mean
   value of the equilibrium concentration at 12 degrees C was significantly
   lower than 23 degrees C and 35 degrees C with no effect of salt
   concentration on the temperature means.
   The results of this research provide much needed data of the kinetics as
   well as the typical equilibrium as such is a significant contribution to
   the overall design of systems for the reuse of highly selective resin in
   multi-cycle ion exchange processes without any further disinfection or
   cleaning procedures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dominant feature selection for the fault diagnosis of rotary machines
   using modified genetic algorithm and empirical mode decomposition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{344}},
Pages = {{464-483}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops a novel dominant feature selection method using a
   genetic algorithm with a dynamic searching strategy. It is applied in
   the search for the most representative features in rotary mechanical
   fault diagnosis, and is shown to improve the classification performance
   with fewer features. First, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is
   employed to decompose a vibration signal into intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs) which represent the signal characteristic with sample oscillatory
   modes. Then, a modified genetic algorithm with variable-range encoding
   and dynamic searching strategy is used to establish relationships
   between optimized feature subsets and the classification performance.
   Next, a statistical model that uses receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) is developed to select dominant features. Finally, support vector
   machine (SVM) is used to classify different fault patterns. Two
   real-world problems, rotor-unbalance vibration and bearing corrosion,
   are employed to evaluate the proposed feature selection scheme and fault
   diagnosis system. Statistical results obtained by analyzing the two
   problems, and comparative studies with five well-known feature selection
   techniques, demonstrate that the method developed in this paper can
   achieve improvements in identification accuracy with lower feature
   dimensionality. In addition, the results indicate that the proposed
   method is a promising tool to select dominant features in rotary
   machinery fault diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Small and medium sized water utilities (SMWU) are facing serious
   operational problems, and show less participation in benchmarking.
   Existing performance indicator (PI) systems developed for large water
   utilities need to be re-evaluated for SMWU. 114 Potential PIs were
   obtained in water resources and environment, personnel, operational,
   physical, water quality, quality of service and financial categories
   using a checklist. These PIs were evaluated against applicability,
   understandability, measurability and comparability criteria using the
   Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) outranking method
   for multicriteria decision analysis. The criteria's weights and scoring
   of PIs were done through group decision making. The study results
   revealed that ELECTRE is a suitable method when the preferences between
   various alternatives based on small differences of evaluations cannot be
   established. The network maps based on outranking results provides an
   opportunity to the utility management to encompass the most suitable PIs
   based on data availability and specific needs of their utility.}},

Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, a particle focusing technique functioning based on
   the cumulative effects of gravity and negative dielectrophoresis (nDEP)
   is developed for digital microfluidic (DMF) systems. This technique
   works using the conventional electrodes used for droplet manipulation
   without a need for geometrical modification. Particle manipulation is
   performed by applying an AC voltage to the electrode above which there
   is the droplet containing the non-buoyant particles. The particles
   sediment due to the difference between the gravitational and the
   vertical component of the nDEP forces, while the horizontal component of
   the nDEP force concentrates them on the center of the electrode.
   Therefore, the magnitude of the voltage must be kept within an effective
   range to have simultaneous effects of sedimentation (dominated by
   gravity) and concentration (due to the horizontal component of the nDEP
   force). The physics of the phenomenon is explained using simulation. The
   effects of the magnitude of the applied voltage, the particle size and
   density, and the electrode size on the focusing behavior of the
   particles are studied. Finally, a potential application of the present
   technique is illustrated for particle concentration in DMF. (C) 2015 AIP

   Cooscillating seiches moved West Basin hypolimnetic water both westward

   water propagated eastward (similar to 1cm/s), introducing a persistent
   similar to 20m thick layer below the thermocline and an similar to 30m

Abstract = {{A central challenge for hydrogen generation via electrolytic water
   splitting is the identification of efficient oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER) catalysts; a key aspect of the challenge hinges on an ability to
   relate atomic-scale structure to observed activities. Amorphous
   iron-based oxide(hydroxides) prepared by photochemical metal organic
   decomposition (PMOD) are proven OER catalysts, but their atomistic
   structures have been elusive. Here, a combination of powder diffraction
   and pair distribution function (PDF) analyses enables the formulation of
   a set of structural characteristics that capture the salient features of
   amorphous iron oxide(hydroxide) (a-FeOx), a model compound for this
   class of materials. a-FeOx contains only octahedrally coordinated iron
   atoms, which form clusters of both edge- and corner-sharing octahedra. A
   degree of eutaxy with predominantly ABC-type anion stacking persists at
   length scales beyond the dimensions of cluster domainsconsistent with
   thermally induced crystallization into the defect spinel gamma-Fe2O3.
   Evidence for considerable octahedral irregularities suggests the
   presence of a large number of bridging and terminal hydroxyl or water
   ligands, which would provide a high concentration of potential active
   sites. The structural features of a-FeOx are reminiscent of other
   first-row transition metal oxyhydroxide OER catalysts that comprise
   layers of edge-sharing octahedral ions capable of electron transfer and
   ligand association/dissociation. In keeping with ABC anion stacking,
   however, the title compound more closely resembles a highly defective
   spinel lattice rather than a layered hydroxide.}},

Title = {{A scoping review of the proximal humerus fracture literature}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Proximal humerus fractures are a common fragility fracture
   that significantly affects the independence of older adults. The
   outcomes of these fractures are frequently disappointing and previous
   systematic reviews are unable to guide clinical practice. Through an
   integrated knowledge user collaboration, we sought to map the breadth of
   literature available to guide the management of proximal humerus
   fractures.
   Methods: We utilized a scoping review technique because of its novel
   ability to map research activity and identify knowledge gaps in fields
   with diverse treatments. Through multiple electronic database searches,
   we identified a comprehensive body of proximal humerus fracture
   literature that was classified into eight research themes. Meta-data
   from each study were abstracted and descriptive statistics were used to
   summarize the results.
   Results: 1,051 studies met our inclusion criteria with the majority of
   research being performed in Europe (64\%). The included literature
   consists primarily of surgical treatment studies (67\%) and
   biomechanical fracture models (10\%). Nearly half of all clinical
   studies are uncontrolled case series of a single treatment (48\%).
   Non-randomized comparative studies represented 12\% of the literature
   and only 3\% of the studies were randomized controlled trials. Finally,
   studies with a primary outcome examining the effectiveness of
   non-operative treatment or using a prognostic study design were also
   uncommon (4\% and 6\%, respectively).
   Conclusions: The current study provides a comprehensive summary of the
   existing proximal humerus fracture literature using a thematic framework
   developed by a multi-disciplinary collaboration. Several knowledge gaps
   have been identified and have generated a roadmap for future research
   priorities.}},

Title = {{Molecular weight effects in interactions of guar gum with talc}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{38-43}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Interactions between talc and four non-ionic guar gum samples of
   different molecular weights (from 160,000 to 1.40 million) were
   evaluated through adsorption, flotation, and stability measurements. It
   was found that the effect of molecular weight on adsorption was
   insignificant and all four guar gums produced similar adsorption
   densities on the talc particles. Turbidity data also showed that all
   four polymers were strong flocculants of fine talc particles. However,
   higher molecular weight samples were more powerful than lower molecular
   weight samples. Higher doses of the polymers led to steric re-dispersion
   of talc, and lower molecular weight polymers were more efficient in
   dispersing talc than higher molecular weight polymers. Finally, all four
   polymers were equally effective as depressants of talc flotation. Most
   interestingly, it was found that the strongest depression of talc
   flotation was accompanied by very strong flocculation of the fine talc
   particles. Implications of these phenomena to the entrainment of fine
   talc during the froth flotation process were also discussed. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic composite sheets were designed by using core-shell
   structured magnetic fillers instead of uncoated magnetic fillers to
   resolve concurrently the electromagnetic interference and thermal
   radiation problems. To predict the thermal conductivity of composite
   sheet, we calculated the thermal conductivity of the uncoated magnetic
   fillers and core-shell structured fillers. And then, the thermal
   conductivity of the magnetic composites sheet filled with core-shell
   structured magnetic fillers was calculated and compared with that of the
   uncoated magnetic fillers filled in composite sheet. The magnetic core
   and shell material are employed the typical Fe-Al-Si flake (60 mu m x 60
   mu m x 1 mu m) and 250nm-thick AlN with high thermal conductivity,
   respectively. The longitudinal thermal conductivity of the core-shell
   structured magnetic composite sheet (2.45W/m.K) enhanced about 33.4\% in
   comparison with that of uncoated magnetic fillers (1.83W/m.K) for the 50

Title = {{Direct vibro-elastography FEM inversion in Cartesian and cylindrical
   coordinate systems without the local homogeneity assumption}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},

Pages = {{3847-3868}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{To produce images of tissue elasticity, the vibro-elastography technique
   involves applying a steady-state multi-frequency vibration to tissue,
   estimating displacements from ultrasound echo data, and using the
   estimated displacements in an inverse elasticity problem with the shear
   modulus spatial distribution as the unknown. In order to fully solve the
   inverse problem, all three displacement components are required.
   However, using ultrasound, the axial component of the displacement is
   measured much more accurately than the other directions. Therefore,
   simplifying assumptions must be used in this case. Usually, the
   equations of motion are transformed into a Helmholtz equation by
   assuming tissue incompressibility and local homogeneity. The local
   homogeneity assumption causes significant imaging artifacts in areas of
   varying elasticity. In this paper, we remove the local homogeneity
   assumption. In particular we introduce a new finite element based direct
   inversion technique in which only the coupling terms in the equation of
   motion are ignored, so it can be used with only one component of the
   displacement. Both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems are
   considered. The use of multi-frequency excitation also allows us to
   obtain multiple measurements and reduce artifacts in areas where the
   displacement of one frequency is close to zero. The proposed method was
   tested in simulations and experiments against a conventional approach in
   which the local homogeneity is used. The results show significant
   improvements in elasticity imaging with the new method compared to
   previous methods that assumes local homogeneity. For example in
   simulations, the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) for the region with
   spherical inclusion increases from an average value of 1.5-17 after
   using the proposed method instead of the local inversion with
   homogeneity assumption, and similarly in the prostate phantom
   experiment, the CNR improved from an average value of 1.6 to about 20.}},

Volume = {{145}},

Abstract = {{An iterative hybrid performance improvement approach integrating
   artificial neural network modelling and Pareto genetic algorithm
   optimisation was developed and tested. The optimisation procedure, code
   named NNREGA, was tested for tuning pilot scale Continuous Variable
   Discharge Concentrator (CVD) in order to simultaneously maximise
   recovery and upgrade ratio of gold bearing sulphides from a polymetallic
   massive sulphide ore. For the tests the CVD was retrofitted during
   normal operation on the flotation tailings stream. On the basis of
   mineralogical data showing strong pyrite-gold association in the
   flotation tailings, iron assays were used as an indicator of CVD
   performance on recovery of gold bearing sulphides. Initially, 17 pilot
   scale statistically designed tests were conducted to assess
   metallurgical performance. The Matlab 2010a software was used to train
   and simulate back propagation ANNs on experimental results. Regression
   models developed from simulation data were used to formulate the
   objective functions used to optimise the CVD using the NSGA-II genetic
   algorithm. Results show that the NNREGA procedure provides an efficient
   way of exploring the design space to learn the relationship between
   interacting variables and outputs and is capable of generating the
   operating line, which is a non-dominated recovery/grade line. The paper
   forms a basis for future work aiming to model and scale up processing
   equipment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   (PEPT-non-invasive at University of Birmingham), optical fibre probes
   (invasive at UBC) and borescopic high speed particle image velocimetry
   (invasive at PSRl) carried out with FCC particles of mean diameter 107
   pm. All of the techniques provided similar trends with respect to
   time-average particle velocity profiles, but significant differences
   were observed in some cases. Analysis of the results, focusing on the
   physical principles of each measurement technique, provides valuable
   insights into the reasons for the observed discrepancies. The results

Abstract = {{Fouling in vacuum tower furnaces has been a great challenge in
   refineries. At the elevated temperatures of these units, coke deposition
   is common. For sour oils, iron sulfide also accumulates in the
   carbonaceous deposits, arising from iron dissolved in the feed or from
   corrosion of metal surfaces. In this work, the combined fouling
   mechanism is investigated using an atmospheric tower bottom stream which
   contains 4.1wt.\% sulfur, and 744 wppm dissolved iron. Isothermal
   deposition experiments running for 6-24hours have been carried out on a
   rotating cylinder in a 600-ml batch reactor, at bulk temperatures of
   380-410 degrees C and cylinder rotation speeds of 300rpm. A ring of
   either carbon steel or alloy is mounted in the cylinder to serve as a
   corroding or noncorroding surface, respectively. After each experiment,
   the thickness and weight of deposit on the metal ring are determined.
   The compositions of deposit are characterized. The rates of deposit
   formation on the ring and the deposit composition are reported as
   functions of temperature for a number of metal surfaces. Radial profiles
   of deposit composition are presented. The probable fouling mechanisms
   are discussed, based on the present results.}},

Abstract = {{In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are
   typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced
   diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but
   might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012
   in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4
   km(2), glaciarized area: 2\%), we observed a transition in the early
   season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal
   streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different
   cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within
   a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we
   observed an ice melt-dominated diurnal cycle during the entire season
   due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and
   evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening
   at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different
   shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially
   during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the
   evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the
   season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspiration-dominated diurnal
   streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow
   cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a
   method based on the identification of the active riparian area and
   measurement of evapotranspiration.}},

Abstract = {{Solid particle erosion of steel is a function of abrasive particle
   properties, target material, erodent velocity, abrasive feed rate,
   impact angle and the environment. Steel microstructure, which directly
   influences its hardness and ductility, plays an important role in
   determining the erosion rate. In this study, the effect of
   microstructure on the erosion of AISI 1018 (pearlite + ferrite) and AISI
   1080 (pearlite) steel is investigated. Particle velocities and impact
   angles employed were as follows: 36, 47, 56 and 81 m s(-1) at 30
   degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively.
   Nano-indentation was performed and it was found that hardness of the
   various microstructures has an inverse relationship to erosion rate. It
   was also found that, contrary to expectation, at low impact angle, AISI
   1018 steel exhibits higher erosion resistance than AISI 1080 steel.
   Surface and sub-surface examinations were conducted using scanning
   electron microscopy. Ploughing, metal cutting and delamination are
   identified as dominant mechanisms during erosion of AISI 1018 and AISI
   1080 steel. It was observed that pearlitic and ferritic microstructures
   respond differently to erosion and that the orientation of pearlite
   plates with respect to the impinging particle affects the extent of
   metal removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric leaching of chalcopyrite in sulfuric acid solutions is a
   slow process due to its passivation. Silver ions have been shown to
   catalyze this process and increase the oxidation rate. In this study the
   interaction between silver ions and chalcopyrite has been investigated
   in silver-containing sulfuric acid solutions. The silver concentration
   of the test solutions was between 0 and 10 ppm. In situ Mott-Schottky
   analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were respectively
   applied to study chalcopyrite's semiconductor properties and silver
   diffusion into the chalcopyrite passive film. Results of the
   Mott-Schottky experiments showed that the addition of silver to the
   solution increases the apparent capacitance of the chalcopyrite passive
   film owing to changes in the semiconductor properties of the film. The
   measured capacitance was shown to be time dependent for the first 15 min
   of the experiment (i.e. sample immersion in solution) and after this
   elapsed time the capacitance stayed constant. XPS results showed that
   silver atoms diffuse about 18 nm below the chalcopyrite surface.
   A model is proposed for silver ion catalyzed chalcopyrite
   electro-dissolution. In this model it is assumed that silver cations
   adsorb to the electrode surface and form Ag2S. The formation of each
   Ag2S molecule on the surface requires the creation of a sulfur vacancy
   and a pair of holes in the passive film. The effect of both the sulfur
   vacancy and the pair of holes is an increase in the dissolution kinetics
   of chalcopyrite. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{To simplify imaging focusing and calibration tasks, a laser-scanning
   microscope needs to scan at a moderate frame rate. The inertia of a
   galvanometric scanner leads to time delays when following external
   commands, which subsequently introduces image distortions that
   deteriorate as scan frequency increases. Sinusoidal and triangular
   waveforms were examined as fast axis driving patterns. The interplay
   among driving pattern, frequency, sampling rate, phase shift, linear
   scanning range, and their effect on reconstructed images was discussed.
   Utilizing position feedback from the linear galvo scanners, the effect
   of response time could be automatically compensated in real time.
   Precompensated triangular driving waveform offered the least amount of
   image distortion. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

   bearing will be reduced as the temperature rises. The horizontal damping
   ratio of the bearing will be reduced as the temperature increases, but
   such a trend will not be obvious when the temperature is higher than 23
   degrees C. By using the classical regression analysis, estimation of the

Abstract = {{Virtual shunt describes the overall loss of O-2 content between the
   alveolar gas and arterial blood. Clinicians indirectly estimate the
   magnitude of the virtual shunt by monitoring peripheral blood oxygen
   saturation (SpO(2)) using noninvasive pulse oximetry. An inherent
   limitation of this method is the variable precision of pulse oximeters
   and the non-linear relationship between virtual shunt and SpO(2) which
   is rarely depicted.
   We propose a model using a combination of basic physiological equations
   to analyze the estimation of virtual shunt from inspired oxygen (FiO(2))
   and SpO(2). The model emphasizes the effect of the non-linearity of the
   Hb-O-2 dissociation curve. Furthermore, it accounts for the variability
   in SpO(2) measurements due to the precision of pulse oximeters.
   The model was validated with experiments conducted on healthy subjects
   in a normobaric hypoxia chamber comparing the simultaneous readings from
   two different commercial pulse oximeters at FiO(2) = 21\% and 17\%.
   SpO(2) probability distributions calculated from the model were
   estimated. Although a variable bias (1.2-2.1\%) in SpO(2) between the
   pulse oximeter brands was observed, the tested pulse oximeters were both
   within tolerance specified by the manufacturers and matched the
   probability distributions from the model.
   The theoretical and experimental findings show that the estimation of
   virtual shunt is challenging with a single SpO(2) measurement using
   pulse oximeters with tolerances of 2\%. Clinical decisions must be based
   on an appreciation of these limitations.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis in this paper shows that L-1 adaptive state feedback
   control approximates an implementable LTI controller because: (1) the
   addition of a low-pass filter in the controller structure leads to an
   internal loop in the controller and (2) high gain feedback within this
   loop leads to inversion of the linear reference model and cancellation
   of non-linear characteristics of the adaptation law. This result holds
   for a variety of adaptation laws and the achieved performance does not
   depend on the exact formulation of this law. (C) 2015 European Control

Abstract = {{With the increase of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for home and
   industrial electronic applications, planar spiral winding design
   techniques are gaining attention due to their low profile,
   reproducibility, and manufacturability. The major design goal for
   windings in WPT systems is a high quality factor (Q) for a given
   inductance. This paper establishes a new method to improve and analyze Q
   by using a nonunity track-width-ratio geometrical arrangement. The
   results are applicable for a variety of planar spiral winding families
   and make full use of the ability to change the width of the traces to
   improve Q for wireless powered applications. In order to simplify the
   analysis and provide generality, a unified dimensional system framework
   is also proposed, covering the racetrack geometry and its
   derivatives-circular, rectangular, generalized octagonal, and
   traditional racetrack windings. The resulting dimensional system
   provides an accurate geometrical description of the windings to obtain
   high Q and a simple set of manufacturing specifications. Details and
   derivations of this new method to calculate inductance, dc resistance,
   and ac resistance estimation to obtain improved Q are presented. A
   comprehensive set of experimental measurements confirms the validity of
   the dimensional system and the improvements in Q for wireless powered
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Mutation testing is an effective test adequacy assessment technique.
   However, there is a high computational cost in executing the test suite
   against a potentially large pool of generated mutants. Moreover, there
   is much effort involved in filtering out equivalent mutants. Prior work
   has mainly focused on detecting equivalent mutants after the mutation
   generation phase, which is computationally expensive and has limited
   efficiency. We propose an algorithm to select variables and branches for
   mutation as well as a metric, called Function Rank, to rank functions
   according to their relative importance from the application's behaviour
   point of view. We present a technique that leverages static and dynamic
   analysis to guide the mutation generation process towards parts of the
   code that are more likely to influence the program's output. Further, we
   focus on the JavaScript language, and propose a set of mutation
   operators that are specific to web applications. We implement our
   approach in a tool called MUTANDIS. The results of our empirical
   evaluation show that (1) more than 93 percent of generated mutants are
   non-equivalent, and (2) more than 75 percent of the surviving
   non-equivalent mutants are in the top 30 percent of the ranked
   functions.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A multiple-input multiple-output backscatter radio frequency
   identification (RFID) system consists of three operational ends: the
   query end (with M reader transmitting antennas), the tag end (with L tag
   antennas), and the receiving end (with N reader receiving antennas).
   Such an M x L x N setting in RFID can bring spatial diversity and has
   been studied with the use of space-time code (STC) at the tag end.
   Current research generally has ignored query signaling as a means to
   improve performance. Here we propose a novel unitary query scheme, which
   creates time diversity within the channel coherent time and can yield
   significant performance improvements. To overcome the difficulty of
   evaluating the performance when unitary query is employed at the query
   end and STC is employed at the tag end, we derive a new measure based on
   the ranks of certain carefully constructed matrices to show that unitary
   query has superior performance. Simulations show that unitary query can
   bring 5-10 dB gain in mid signal-to-noise ratio regimes. In addition,
   different from the conventional uniform query case, unitary query can
   also improve the performance of single-antenna tags significantly,
   enabling single-antenna tags with low complexity and small size to be
   used for high performance.}},

Abstract = {{The variation in microstructure, macrosegregation, and solidification

   differential scanning calorimetry were employed to study the grain size
   evolution, distribution of alloying elements, and solidification
   sequence across the cross section of DC cast AA5182 aluminum alloy. The
   results show that (1) grain size increases from the surface to center of
   the ingot, corresponding to a decrease in the heat extraction rate; (2)
   there is a considerable macrosegregation of Mg, Mn, and Cr, with Mg
   showing negative segregation at the center and positive segregation at
   the surface, Mn showing negative segregation both at center and surface
   and positive segregation elsewhere, and Cr showing positive segregation
   at the center and negative segregation at the surface; (3) the solidus
   and the reaction temperatures vary as a function of position due to the
   local chemical composition and cooling rate. These findings, which show
   the interconnectivity of grain size, segregation, and solidification
   sequence, are useful in further analysis of the DC casting process and
   in predicting casting-related defects, specifically hot tear formation.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a thermoresponsive micro circuit breaker for
   biomedical applications specifically targeted at electronic intelligent
   implants. The circuit breaker is micromachined to have a
   shape-memory-alloy cantilever actuator as a normally closed
   temperature-sensitive switch to protect the device of interest from
   overheating, a critical safety feature for smart implants including
   those that are electrothermally driven with wireless micro heaters. The
   device is fabricated in a size of 1.5 x 2.0 x 0.46 mm(3) using
   biocompatible materials and a chip-based titanium package, exhibiting a
   nominal cold-state resistance of 14 Omega. The breaker rapidly enters
   the full open condition when the chip temperature exceeds 63 degrees C,
   temporarily breaking the circuit of interest to lower its temperature
   until chip temperature drops to 51 degrees C, at which the breaker
   closes the circuit to allow current to flow through it again, physically
   limiting the maximum temperature of the circuit. This functionality is
   tested in combination with a wireless resonant heater powered by
   radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation, demonstrating self-regulation
   of heater temperature. The developed circuit-breaker chip operates in a
   fully passive manner that removes the need for active sensor and
   circuitry to achieve temperature regulation in a target device,
   contributing to the miniaturization of biomedical microsystems including
   electronic smart implants where thermal management is essential.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a new fabrication method is presented for digital
   microfluidic (DMF) devices in which the electrodes are generated using
   the screen printing technique. This method is applicable to both rigid
   and flexible substrates. The proposed screen printing approach, as a
   batch printing technique, is advantageous to the widely reported DMF
   fabrication methods in terms of fabrication time, cost and capability of
   mass production. Screen printing provides an effective means for
   printing different types of conductive materials on a variety of
   substrates. Specifically, screen printing of conductive silver and
   carbon based inks is performed on paper, glass and wax paper. As a
   result, the fabricated DMF devices are characterized by being flexible,
   disposable and incinerable. Hence, the main advantage of screen printing
   carbon based inks on paper substrates is more pronounced for
   point-of-care applications that require a large number of low cost DMF
   chips, and laboratory setups that lack sophisticated microfabrication
   facilities. The resolution of the printed DMF electrodes generated by
   this technique is examined for proof of concept using manual screen
   printing, but higher resolution screens and automated machines are
   available off-the-shelf, if needed. Another contribution of this
   research is the improved actuation techniques that facilitate droplet
   transport in electrode configurations with relatively large electrode
   spacing to alleviate the disadvantage of lower resolution screens. Thus,
   we were able to reduce the cost of fabrication significantly without
   compromising the DMF performance. The paper-based devices have already
   shown to be effective in continuous microfluidics domain, so the
   investigation of their applicability in DMF systems is worthwhile. With
   this in mind, successful integration of a paper-based microchannel with
   paper-based digital microfluidic chip is demonstrated in this work.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a zero current transition (ZCT) double-ended flyback

   presented to verify the theoretical predictions. Moreover, the conducted
   electromagnetic emissions of the proposed ZCT double-ended flyback
   converter are measured to show another merit of the proposed converter
   in addition to providing soft switching conditions. The measured
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) of the proposed converter
   demonstrates that its EMI is lower than the conventional double-ended
   flyback converter. Furthermore, two simple and cost effective EMI
   reduction methods are applied to satisfy the EMC standard.}},

Abstract = {{Procurement is a key process in a construction project that creates and
   manages contacts. Procurement activities span from identification of
   requirements to project closeout, making it a perfect mode for
   integrating organizational strategic directions. Lately, the strategic
   importance of procurement has been widely acknowledged by academics as
   well as industry professionals. Construction procurement is a complex
   process with a large number of available options and directions. Ad hoc
   statistics show that modern initiatives such as sustainability,
   life-cycle costing, and standardization are getting integrated with
   procurement. However, there is no unified view in the construction
   industry on procurement as a project process. This paper presents a
   comprehensive review of traditional and emerging procurement practices
   in the construction industry. The current procurement practices are
   analyzed by separating into three segments; processes, methods, and
   policies. Furthermore, strengths and weaknesses of the traditional
   procurement methods are reviewed in detail. As the final section,
   contemporary developments in construction procurement are investigated.
   This article consolidates detailed knowledge of construction procurement
   that is identified as a knowledge gap in the literature.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Proper control of phytosterols in pulp mill effluents is necessary
   before disposal into receiving environments because they have been
   suspected to be hormonally active to aquatic life. This study provides
   an insight into the adsorptive behavior of sterols and the role of

   kinetics of sterol adsorption, extent of sterol adsorption onto
   inactivated secondary solids, adsorptive capacity of secondary solids,
   and the relative contribution of the adsorption mechanism in the overall
   removal of sterols during secondary treatment have been investigated in
   this study. Isotherm modeling revealed two different adsorption regimes
   for each sterol. The results show that adsorption plays a major role in
   the secondary treatment of pulp mill effluents and that secondary sludge
   serves as an efficient adsorbent to remove phytosterols. The obtained
   information is important to improve system design and optimize the
   operation of pulp mill effluent treatment facilities.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{885-901}},

Abstract = {{The slip behavior of several high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs) is
   studied as a function of molecular weight (MW) and its distribution for
   a broad range of MW distributions. The slip velocity increases with
   decrease of MW, which is the case for several other linear polymers
   including monodisperse polybutadienes (PBDs), polystyrenes (PSs), and
   polylactides reported in the literature. For such polymers, the slip
   velocity, Vs, scales with weight or number average MW (due to
   monodispersity) as V-S alpha M-w(beta), where beta is about -2 for PBDs
   and -3.2 for PSs. For polydisperse HDPEs concepts from double reptation
   theory is used to develop an expression to relate slip velocity with MW
   and its distribution. Moreover, the slip velocity of linear polymers
   scales nonlinearly with the wall shear stress, namely, V-S alpha
   sigma(m)(W). Using de Gennes' theory for slip, the values of m reported
   in the literature are explained on a theoretical basis and they are
   found to be equal to 1/n, where n is the local slope of the flow curve
   of the corresponding polymer, n  log(sigma(w))/log((gamma) over dot(w)),
   which changes from 1 (Newtonian flow regime) to a constant value in the
   power-law flow regime. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{Investigating the accuracy of Bayesian techniques for before-after
   safety studies: The case of a ``no treatment{''} evaluation}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{138-145}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The main challenge in conducting observational before-after (BA) studies
   of road safety measures is to use a methodology that accounts for many
   potential confounding factors. However, it is usually difficult to
   evaluate and decide on the accuracy of the different safety evaluation
   techniques available in literature. This is mainly because the outcome
   of the comparison has no specific target (i.e., the effect of a specific
   treatment on safety is not precisely known).
   The objective of this paper is to compare the accuracy of some of the
   commonly used Bayesian methodologies for BA safety studies by applying
   them to locations where no safety treatment has been implemented (making
   the target result to be no effect). This goal was pursued within the
   setting of a specific case study where a recent set of collision data
   was available for urban signalized intersections in British Colombia
   (Canada) with no safety treatments implemented during the time frame
   considered. An assessment of the temporal stability of the data set was
   undertaken to exclude the presence of significant BA changes as
   explanation of the results reported in this paper.
   Both the well-known empirical Bayes and the full Bayes method with
   non-linear intervention models were explored for comparison. Two types
   of selection of the hypothetical treatment sites were used in the
   analysis: random, to minimize the selection bias effect, and non-random,
   by selecting sites with abnormal collision frequency (hotspots). Several
   criteria were used for comparisons including variability among the index
   of effectiveness for individual treatment locations, the stability of
   the outcome in terms of the consistency of the results of several
   experiments and the overall treatment effectiveness.
   The results showed that when sites are selected randomly for treatment,
   all methodologies including the simple (naive) BA study provide
   reasonable results (small statistically non-significant change in
   collision frequency). However, when sites are selected for treatment
   because of high collision occurrence, the estimated index of treatment
   effectiveness can potentially be biased by values up to 10\%. This
   finding can have significant impact on estimating safety benefits of
   treatments, especially on those that have low collision reductions. As
   well, the FB method seems to perform better than other evaluation
   techniques including the most commonly used EB method. In particular,
   the FB method provides higher consistency in the estimated collision
   reduction among treatment sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The concentration and speciation of Cu, Pb and Zn in soil samples
   collected around the lead-zinc smelting plant of Baoji, NW China, were
   determined using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and the modified
   European Community Bureau of Reference sequential extraction procedure.
   The single pollution index (PI) and the integrated pollution index (IPI)
   were calculated to evaluate the contamination levels of Cu, Pb and Zn in
   the soil. The mean concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in the topsoil
   samples are 31.8, 41.3 and 102.6 mg kg(-1), respectively, higher than
   their concentrations in the control sample. The concentrations of Cu, Pb
   and Zn decreased significantly with depth from 0 to 35 cm, while they
   were relatively constant for depths between 35 and 100 cm. The
   concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in topsoil north of the lead-zinc
   smelting plant decreased exponentially with distance from the plant. Cu
   and Zn in the soil are mainly associated with the residual fraction,
   while Pb is dominated by the reducible and residual forms. The mobile
   fractions of Cu, Pb and Zn in topsoil are Pb (60.1 \%) > Cu (20.1 \%)
   approximate to Zn (20.6 \%). The PI for Cu, Pb and Zn varies from 1.1 to
   1.4, 1.0 to 2.5 and 1.1 to 2.0, with means of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.4,
   respectively, indicating that Cu, Pb and Zn are all moderately polluted

Abstract = {{This paper considers radio resource allocation (RRA) in the downlink of
   an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDM)-based
   spectrum-sharing network. The objective of RRA is to maximize the
   average achievable throughput subject to the primary service
   interference threshold and the secondary service transmit power
   constraint. RRA is usually implemented based on a time window T over
   which system parameters are averaged and checked against resource
   constraints. We use short-term (T = 1 time slot) and long-term (T >> 1
   slots) averaging as approximations to instantaneous and average
   constraints, respectively. RRA is also investigated for this system with
   long-term interference threshold and short-term interference threshold
   constraints. RRA optimization is a nonconvex optimization problem in
   which the duality principle is adopted to obtain approximate solutions.
   The duality gap indicates the degree of approximation in the
   thus-obtained solution. We prove that the duality gap corresponding to
   each resource allocation asymptotically decays at least with an
   exponential rate of T. We further show that OFDMA is, asymptotically,
   the optimal subcarrier assignment. We also propose a practically
   implementable online power and subcarrier allocation with on-the-fly
   channel state information measurement. An extensive simulation study has
   been conducted to verify the theoretically predicted duality gap
   behavior and to investigate the impact of different system parameters on
   the secondary service performance. The developed algorithms are also
   validated to be robust in practical settings and converge fast to
   theoretical bounds, and thus practically implementable.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of cognitive radio (CR) systems can be enhanced
   significantly by deploying relay nodes to exploit the spatial diversity.
   However, the inevitable imperfect sensing in CR has vital effects on the
   policy of relay selection, channel access, and power allocation that
   play pivotal roles in the system capacity. The increase in transmission
   power can improve the system capacity, but results in high energy
   consumption, which incurs the increase of carbon emission and network
   operational cost. Most of the existing schemes for CR systems have not
   jointly considered the imperfect sensing scenario and the tradeoff
   between the system capacity and energy consumption. To fill in this gap,
   this paper proposes an energy-aware centralized relay selection scheme
   that takes into account the relay selection, channel access, and power
   allocation jointly in CR with imperfect sensing. Specifically, the CR
   system is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process
   (POMDP) to achieve the goal of balancing the system capacity and energy
   consumption as well as maximizing the system reward. The optimal policy
   for relay selection, channel access, and power allocation is then
   derived by virtue of a dynamic programming approach. A dimension
   reduction strategy is further applied to reduce its high computation
   complexity. Extensive simulation experiments and results are presented
   and analysed to demonstrate the significant performance improvement
   compared to the existing schemes. The performance results show that the
   received reward increases more than 50\% and the network lifetime
   increases more than 35\%, but the system capacity is reduced less than
   6\% only.}},

Abstract = {{Over a home area network, between smart appliances and the smart meter,
   and over an 802.15.4g smart utility network, from a smart meter toward
   the utility center, IEEE 802.15.4 assists with advanced metering
   infrastructure components in a smart grid. Adopting the synchronous
   beacon-enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a slotted
   framework for low-power, real-time collection, and distribution of power
   information. However, the shared nature of the industrial, scientific,
   and medical (ISM) band introduces the beacon corruption issue, and
   confronts the 802.15.4-based network with service interruptions and
   large delays. This paper, experimentally and analytically, studies how
   interference from collocated networks affects the beaconing functionally
   and, consequently, network performance. Investigations indicate that
   beaconing contributes in low-power and low-delay communications over an
   802.15.4 network only when its proper operation is guaranteed over a
   coexistent environment like ISM band; otherwise, the application delay
   is significantly compromised. In this regard, a standard-conforming
   enhancement, called the beacon corruption recovery scheme (BCRS), is
   proposed to mitigate effects of coexistence on beaconing performance by
   migration of the network to a cleaner channel. Simulation results show
   that by applying the BCRS, an 802.15.4 network experiences a less
   fragmented accesses to the medium and better fulfills real-time
   bidirectional flow of monitoring information.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of leveraging the data provided by smart meters to
   understand the load characteristics is studied in this paper. The loads
   are modeled as voltage-dependent elements to increase the accuracy of
   volt-VAR optimization (VVO) techniques for distribution systems. VVO
   techniques are part of the distribution management system and may be
   used for purposes such as loss reduction, voltage profile improvement,
   and conservation voltage reduction. A deterministic framework is
   proposed that formulates the VVO problem as a mixed-integer
   quadratically constrained programming problem, which is solved
   efficiently using advanced branch-and-cut techniques. The proposed
   framework is capable of optimally controlling capacitor banks, voltage
   regulators, and under-load tap changers (ULTCs) for day-ahead operation
   planning. The results indicate that loss reductions of up to 40\% and a
   total demand reduction of up to 4.8\% are achievable under some loading
   conditions in a radial test system. The effect of the load voltage
   dependence is also demonstrated through analytical simulations.}},

   the employment of various (NN)-N-boolean AND ligands attached with
   surface-adsorbing groups including vinyl, formyl, cyano, and pyridyl,
   the photocatalytic hydrogen-generation duration is significantly
   extended. This might be related to the fast quenching of the reduced
   state (Ir-PS-) resulting from the enhanced interaction between the
   Ir-PSs and the Pt catalyst. In photocatalytic reactions at relatively

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, in the Piura region, north of Peru, 10,000 artisanal miners and
   more that 160 processing plants were dispersed in 158,000 ha applying
   extremely primitive techniques to extract gold using 5 to 10 t of
   mercury to amalgamate the whole ore. The US Department of State and the
   University of British Columbia established a project to train miners
   from 2010 to 2013 on mining and processing methods. A demonstration
   plant in Portovelo, Ecuador was used to train 46 Peruvian, 50 Colombian
   and 115 Ecuadorian small miners and processors on methods to reduce and
   eliminate mercury increasing gold recovery by gravity concentration,
   flotation and cyanidation. Miners had the opportunity to learn unit
   operations of mining engineering and they realized that their
   rudimentary processes were very inefficient to extract and recover gold
   from complex sulphide ores. Ore buyers in the Piura region provide a
   better deal for the miners who are currently selling their ores for 50\%
   of the gold content analyzed by local chemical labs. By selling to ore
   buyers, miners have in their hands, at the end of one day, more money
   than if they had amalgamated the ores. Due to this fact and through
   education, mercury levels in the region were reduced at least by 50\%
   from the 2010 levels. A pre-feasibility study of a small processing
   plant operating with gravity concentration, flotation and cyanidation of
   the concentrates revealed that with Au grade equal or above 10 g/t, even
   with 50\% of gold recovery and at USD 1300/oz of Au, a 10 t/day plant is
   still profitable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluates the passivation process, in relation to the
   anodic and cathodic reactions, in deoxygenated solutions of different
   bicarbonate concentrations. Two types of API-X100 steel microstructures
   were examined. They are similar to near fusion heat affected zones
   (HAZs) which were produced by special thermal cycles. By monitoring the
   open circuit potentials, the passivation process exhibited
   electrochemical signs that it forms faster with higher bicarbonate
   concentration. During cyclic voltammetry, bicarbonate in concentrations
   less than 0.1M impedes the passivation, by catalysing the anodic
   dissolution. In higher concentrations, bicarbonate seemed more
   protective in facilitating the development of thicker passive films,
   from an electrochemical perspective that encourages corresponding
   physicochemical investigations in the future. The transpassivation
   seemed to depend more on the chemistry of the passive film than on the
   formation of FeCO3. Cooling down the HAZs at high rates could make them
   more corrosion resistant, but probably of less protective corrosion
   products.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports of a micromachined shape-memory-alloy (SMA) actuator
   in the shape of a rectangular spiral coil that is designed to perform
   cantilever-like actuation. The SMA-coil actuator itself forms a passive
   resonant circuit that functions as a wireless heat source activated
   using external radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields for
   frequency-selective control of the actuation. The SiO2 stress layers are
   selectively patterned on the actuator structure of nickel-titanium SMA,
   or Nitinol, to manipulate the cantilever profile at the nominal cold
   state. RF radiation with varying field frequencies shows strong
   frequency dependence of wireless heating, actuation displacement, and
   force generation by microfabricated actuators with resonant frequencies
   of 170-245 MHz. The actuators excited at resonance exhibit maximum
   out-of-plane displacement and force of 215 mu m and 71 mN, respectively.
   The developed wireless SMA actuator not only provides >2x the force and
   2x more power-efficient response compared to the preceding design with
   similar self-heating mechanism but also offers broader potential
   applications brought by its commonly adopted cantilever-based actuation.

   different mass ratio by varying ZNWs from 0\% to 100\% and serviced as
   photoanodic film of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) via spin coating.
   The efficiency of these DSSCs reached a maximum of 2.6\% at 20 wt\%
   ZNWs. In order to improve the photovoltaic properties of ZNWs/ZNPs
   hybrid photoanodic film, the ZNWs/ZNPs hybrid film was modified by the
   incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into ZnO matrix
   including both ZNPs and ZNWs combined with TiCl4 post-treatment. As a
   result, the efficiency of DSSCs increased from 2.6\% to 3.8\%, which is
   mainly attributed to the increased dye loading, faster electron
   transport, and less electron loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The prediction of chatter stability diagrams in milling requires
   accurate frequency response functions (FRF) at the tool - workpiece
   contact zone. Traditionally, the most accurate FRFs are best obtained
   through the experimental modal testing of each tool, which is costly.
   This paper presents analytical modeling and coupling procedures for
   spindle-holder-tool assemblies with asymmetric tools. Tools and holders
   are analytically modeled with continuous Timoshenko beams, while
   considering variation of the cross section geometry of the fluted
   sections and helix angle. While each solid part segments with varying
   geometry are assembled with rigid receptance coupling, the
   holder-spindle and tool-holder are coupled using contact stiffness and
   damping. The asymmetric cross sections of the helical end mills cause
   the variation of FRF as a function of the spindle's angular position. It
   is experimentally proven that the proposed method can predict the FRFs
   as the asymmetric tools rotate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study aims to compare the seismic performance of two 42-story
   reinforced concrete buildings located in Los Angeles, California: a
   coupled core wall building and a similar core wall building with
   perimeter moment resisting frames (i.e. dual system). The buildings were
   designed using two different approaches. The first approach followed the
   traditional code prescriptive design approach as outlined in the
   International Building Code (2006), whereas the other approach followed
   a performance-based design approach outlined in the seismic design
   guideline published by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research
   Center. Detailed finite element models were developed for both systems
   with the different design approaches. The models were used to evaluate
   the seismic performance of the prototype model at five different
   earthquake shaking intensities. Detailed comparisons of the design
   approaches, seismic responses, and initial and annualized repair costs
   of these buildings are presented. Analysis results show that both
   structural systems generally achieved excellent performance, whereas the
   dual system performed slightly better (smaller inter-story drifts and
   lower core wall stresses). Although repair costs were lower in the dual
   system building (which is attributed to lesser degree of damage), total
   costs were higher than the core wall building due to the higher initial
   costs. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The collection and treatment of waste poses a major challenge to modern
   urban planning, particularly to smart cities. To cope with this problem,
   a cost-effective alternative to conventional methods is the use of
   Automated Vacuum Waste Collection (AVWC) systems, using air suction on a
   closed network of underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off
   points scattered throughout the city to a central collection point. This
   paper describes and empirically evaluates a novel approach to defining
   daily operation plans for AVWC systems to improve quality of service,
   and reduce energy consumption, which represents about 60\% of the total
   operation cost. We model a daily AVWC operation as a Markov decision
   process, and use Approximate Dynamic Programming techniques (ADP) to
   obtain optimal operation plans. The experiments, comparing our approach
   with the current approach implemented in some real-world AVWC systems,
   show that ADP techniques significantly improve the quality of AVWC
   operation plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of microfractures within rock is commonly observed as rock
   is strained. The presence of these microfractures constitutes damage to
   the rock, and this damage can reduce the rock's strength. This paper
   explores the evolution of rock strength as microfractures within a rock
   accumulate. Two approaches involving different laboratory tests are used
   to study how cohesion and internal friction evolve during progressive
   damage to rock. The mobilized cohesion and friction angle are measured
   for intact and damaged rock specimens. Intact rock specimens tested
   under compression were used to determine the peak values of cohesion and
   friction angle for two types of rock. Specimens of rock with varying
   amounts of accumulated microfracture damage were tested under direct
   shear or multi-stage triaxial compression to measure the Coulomb
   strength parameters for damaged rock. The laboratory testing shows that
   cohesion decreases with strain as the rock accumulates internal damage
   caused by microfracturing before the peak strength. The frictional
   component of the rock strength starts to be mobilized as strain causes
   internal microfractures. The mobilized internal friction angle increases
   up to and slightly beyond the peak strength. A small amount of post-peak
   strain is required to initiate macroscopic slip surfaces, and until
   these are created, high frictional resistance is mobilized between the
   many interacting and interlocked pieces of rock in the test specimen.
   With further post-peak strain, the friction angle decreases as the
   macroscopic slip surfaces in the rock become well established.}},

Title = {{Outlier detection for scanned point clouds using majority voting}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{31-43}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{When scanning an object using a 3D laser scanner, the collected scanned
   point cloud is usually contaminated by numerous measurement outliers.
   These outliers can be sparse outliers, isolated or non-isolated outlier
   clusters. The non-isolated outlier clusters pose a great challenge to
   the development of an automatic outlier detection method since such
   outliers are attached to the scanned data points from the object surface
   and difficult to be distinguished from these valid surface measurement
   points. This paper presents an effective outlier detection method based
   on the principle of majority voting. The method is able to detect
   non-isolated outlier clusters as well as the other types of outliers in
   a scanned point cloud. The key component is a majority voting scheme
   that can cut the connection between non-isolated outlier clusters and
   the scanned surface so that non-isolated outliers become isolated. An
   expandable boundary criterion is also proposed to remove isolated
   outliers and preserve valid point clusters more reliably than a simple
   cluster size threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed method has
   been validated by comparing with several existing methods using a
   variety of scanned point clouds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Western Red Cedar (WRC) is one of the abundant softwood species, which
   is considered as a good source of biofuel. This paper aims at
   quantifying gas emissions from stored WRC woodchips and studying the
   potential health impact during storage and transportation. Experiments
   were conducted using lab-scale reactors for a range of temperatures
   under both non-aerobic and aerobic conditions depending on oxygen level.
   Results from tests using non-aerobic reactors showed that the highest
   carbon dioxide emission factor of 2.8 g/kg dry matter (DM) was observed
   at 20 A degrees C for a storage period of 2 months. Although the carbon
   monoxide emission factor was much lower at 0.03 g/kg DM, it increased
   with increasing temperatures due to chemical oxidation. Carbon dioxide
   and carbon monoxide emissions from the aerobic reactors exhibited
   similar trends as the non-aerobic reactors with respect to the effect of
   temperature. Total gas emissions were higher from the aerobic reactors
   compared with those from non-aerobic reactors. Results from the
   qualitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated a
   range of volatile organic compounds was emitted from the stored WRC
   woodchips. Some of these volatile organic compounds might be associated
   with the characteristic pungent smell of WRC which could cause odor
   nuisance to the neighboring community. The total volatile organic
   compounds concentration was found to be positively correlated with
   temperature. At the end of the storage period, percent DM loss was below
   1 \% for both the non-aerobic and aerobic reactors, reaffirming the
   decay-resistance characteristics of WRC.}},

Abstract = {{The solidification kinetics of a high strength B206 aluminum casting
   alloy as a function of cooling rates between 1 and 15 K/min has been
   characterized through a combination of differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy. Three
   different peaks were detected in the DSC analysis, which corresponded to
   the nucleation of an alpha-Al solid solution, an Al-Cu-Fe intermetallic,
   and the eutectic phases. The presence of these phases was confirmed
   using a coupled SEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis. The
   alpha-Al nucleation temperature was found to be independent of cooling
   rate while the eutectic and the intermetallic formation temperatures
   were depressed by up to 20 K (20 degrees C). The evolution of the
   fraction solid, particularly during the solidification of alpha-Al was
   also affected by the cooling rate in such a way that slower cooling was
   accompanied by a higher fraction solid at a given temperature.
   Concurrently, microscopy was used in order to quantify the variation in
   secondary dendrite arm spacing with cooling rate for use in numerical
   simulations of casting processes. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{This paper deals with online water quality monitoring in distribution
   networks based on surrogate water quality parameters (WQPs). The present
   strategy is based on multi-level information fusion using hierarchical
   belief rule-based (BRB) systems. Networked fuzzy belief rule-based
   (NF-BRB) and high-level BRB systems are introduced for information
   fusion at the feature level. Primary and secondary features are
   extracted from online WQP signals. Primary features are analyzed using
   the NF-BRB system that is built through knowledge elicitation from
   experts. Secondary features are interpreted through the high-level BRB
   system that employs a fuzzy partitioning on the feature sets and a
   hybrid learning strategy for its rule base construction. Finally, the
   dynamic fuzzy evidential fusion is introduced to aggregate the local and
   spatial assessments in each analysis window. As an important
   contribution of this paper, we propose a new validation method for event
   detection in the water distribution network (WDN) based on adaptive
   projection of the signal patterns attributed to anomaly events, obtained
   through contamination experiments in a pilot facility, to the real WQP
   signals measured across the WDN. Single and composite contamination
   events based on several biological and chemical contaminants are
   simulated to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in event
   detection. The proposed multi-level information fusion framework obtains
   a high detection rate and a reduced number of false negative and
   positive results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Below the temperature of maximum density (TMD) in freshwater lakes,
   heating at the lateral margins produces gravity currents along the
   bottom slope, akin to katabatic winds in the atmosphere and currents on
   continental shelves. We describe axisymmetric basin-scale circulation
   driven by heat flux at the shorelines in polar Lake Kilpisjarvi. A dense
   underflow originating near the shore converges toward the lake center,
   where it produces warm upwelling and return flow across the bulk of lake
   water column. The return flow, being subject to Coriolis force, creates
   a lake-wide anticyclonic gyre with velocities of 2-4cms(-1). While warm
   underflows are common on ice-covered lakes, the key finding is the
   basin-scale anticyclonic gyre with warm upwelling in the core. This
   circulation mechanism provides a key to understanding transport
   processes in (semi) enclosed basins subject to negative buoyancy flux
   due to heating (or cooling at temperatures above TMD) at their lateral
   boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Computer models of the human face have the potential to be used as
   powerful tools in surgery simulation and animation development
   applications. While existing models accurately represent various
   anatomical features of the face, the representation of the skin and soft
   tissues is very simplified. A computer model of the face is proposed in
   which the skin is represented by an orthotropic hyperelastic
   constitutive model. The in vivo tension inherent in skin is also
   represented in the model. The model was tested by simulating several
   facial expressions by activating appropriate orofacial and jaw muscles.
   Previous experiments calculated the change in orientation of the long
   axis of elliptical wounds on patients' faces for wide opening of the
   mouth and an open-mouth smile (both 30(o)). These results were compared
   with the average change of maximum principal stress direction in the
   skin calculated in the face model for wide opening of the mouth (18(o))
   and an open-mouth smile (25(o)). The displacements of landmarks on the
   face for four facial expressions were compared with experimental
   measurements in the literature. The corner of the mouth in the model
   experienced the largest displacement for each facial expression (similar
   to 11-14mm). The simulated landmark displacements were within a standard
   deviation of the measured displacements. Increasing the skin stiffness
   and skin tension generally resulted in a reduction in landmark
   displacements upon facial expression.}},

   in harvestable plant biomass. Harvesting, drying and incineration of the
   biomass generates a high-grade bio-ore. We propose that ``agromining{''}
   (a variant of phytomining) could provide local communities with an
   alternative type of agriculture on degraded lands; farming not for food
   crops, but for metals such as nickel (Ni). However, two decades after
   its inception and numerous successful experiments, commercial
   phytomining has not yet become a reality. To build the case for the
   minerals industry, a large-scale demonstration is needed to identify
   operational risks and provide ``real-life{''} evidence for
   profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of a gold electrode modified with a mixed
   self-assembled monolayer composed of ssDNA and mercaptohexanol is
   described using in-situ fluorescence microscopy with particular focus on
   the study on the homogeneity of the surface in terms of its response to
   potential perturbation. A change in DNA orientation is driven by the
   charge on the gold surface, and the extent and the rate of orientation
   change can be determined using fluorophore modified DNA and
   fluorescence. Characterization of the surface is typically performed
   using techniques that determine the average characteristics of the
   surface. We show that significant differences in the response of various
   regions of the electrode surface can be observed. These differences can
   characterized by potential step-imaging measurements or by frequency
   response analysis of the fluorescence - potential transfer function.
   Important for high frequency measurements in these low ionic strength
   electrolytes is the use of a fourth electrode and shunt capacitor which
   was found to influence the electrochemical impedance results as well as
   the optical results. The magnitude of the transfer function was found to
   vary significantly for different regions on the electrode. We
   demonstrate this for two 95 mu m regions that are on either side of a
   grain boundary. The phase of the transfer function was found to be more
   sensitive to variations in the rate of reorientation between these two
   regions compared to considering only the magnitude. The variation in the
   response over the electrode surface is an important consideration for
   the DNA-based biosensing devices based on modified electrode interfaces.

Abstract = {{We present a process calibration method for designing
   silicon-on-insulator ( SOI) contra-directional grating couplers
   (contra-DCs). Our method involves determining the coupling coefficients
   of fabricated contra-DCs by using their full-width-at-half-maximum
   (FWHM) bandwidths. As compared to the null method that uses the
   bandwidth measured at the first nulls, our FWHM method obtains more
   consistent results since the FWHM bandwidth is more easily determined.
   We also extract the coupling coefficients using curve-fitting which
   provide values that are in general agreement with the values obtained
   using our method. However, as compared to the curve-fitting method, our
   method does not require knowledge of the insertion loss and is easier to
   implement. Our method can be used to predict the FWHM bandwidths, the
   maximum power coupling factors, the minimum power transmission factors,
   and the through port group delays and dispersions of subsequent,
   fabricated devices, which is useful in designing filters. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{As a continuation of our previous study, this work focuses on the
   determination and modeling of phase equilibria for the mixed-solvent
   electrolyte system containing glycine, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl),
   methanol, and water. This electrolyte is used in the monochloroacetic
   acid (MCA) process for glycine production. The solubilities for the
   NH4Cl-methanol-water and glycine-NH4Cl-methanol-water systems were
   determined from 283.15 to 323.15 K. The MSE model embedded in the OLI
   platform was modified by regressing experimental data through adjustment
   of the UNIQUAC and the middle-range interaction parameters. With the new
   model parameters, solubilities in the quaternary system were predicted
   with excellent agreement. The average absolute deviations between the
   prediction and the experimental solubility are 3.46 and 0.54\% for
   glycine and NH4Cl, respectively. OLI Stream Analyzer 9.1 was used with
   this new MSE model to investigate the effect of the methanol composition
   and temperature on the yield of glycine crystallization in the MCA
   process. It was found that a methanol mole fraction of 0.65-0.70 at
   ambient temperatures was optimal for enhancing the theoretical yield of
   glycine to 96.5\% while minimizing the methanol consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Preparation of liquefaction hazard map of prone areas has high
   importance for decision makers or site planners to reduce loss of lives.
   In this study, liquefaction hazard map of Dhaka City was prepared using
   liquefaction potential index (LPI) and cumulative frequency distribution
   of LPI of surface geological units, which is an excellent approach to
   evaluate the liquefaction hazard quantitatively and spatially. LPI
   values were calculated using Simplified Procedure of liquefaction
   potential assessment for 53 Standard Penetration Test (SPT) profiles
   conducted in different surface geological units of the city. The LPI
   values of the city varied from 0 to 19.33 having very low to very high
   liquefaction hazard. The hazard of each unit was also defined by
   cumulative frequency at LPI = 5 which may be evaluated as the threshold
   for observation effects of liquefaction on surface. The geological units
   of the city were grouped into three liquefaction hazard zones, i.e.,
   Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3 based on cumulative frequency. The hazard map
   indicates that 8\%, 50\% and 72\% of Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3,
   respectively, will show surface manifestation of liquefaction for an
   earthquake scenario having a magnitude of 7.0 (M-w) and a peak ground
   acceleration of 0.15g. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the use of music as a tool through which to teach
   social and environmental aspects to mining engineering students. Mining
   engineering students are often exposed to a highly technical learning
   environment. As a tool, music can facilitate open dialogue between peers
   about the impacts of the industry. This methodology has been used for
   more than 15 years at the Department of Mining Engineering at the
   University of British Colombia, and has provided a benchmark in the
   education of future mining leaders. The faculty's Mining and
   Environment, and Mining and Society courses cover social and
   environmental issues related to mining that range from detailed aquatic
   chemistry, to concepts of sustainable development and poverty
   alleviation in developing countries. A different song is introduced
   every week to highlight the lessons of that week to students. This paper
   covers five songs that discuss current issues in mining, and the ways in
   which perception is shaped around these topics. The mining industry
   needs to respond to these issues, and to do so, students must be aware
   that focusing on technical aspects alone is not the most well-rounded or
   efficient way to go about changing perceptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Visualization of High Speed Liquid Jet Impaction on a Moving Surface}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{98}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Two apparatuses for examining liquid jet impingement on a high-speed
   moving surface are described: an air cannon device (for examining
   surface speeds between 0 and 25 m/sec) and a spinning disk device (for
   examining surface speeds between 15 and 100 m/sec). The air cannon
   linear traverse is a pneumatic energy-powered system that is designed to
   accelerate a metal rail surface mounted on top of a wooden projectile. A
   pressurized cylinder fitted with a solenoid valve rapidly releases
   pressurized air into the barrel, forcing the projectile down the cannon
   barrel. The projectile travels beneath a spray nozzle, which impinges a
   liquid jet onto its metal upper surface, and the projectile then hits a
   stopping mechanism. A camera records the jet impingement, and a pressure
   transducer records the spray nozzle backpressure. The spinning disk
   setup consists of a steel disk that reaches speeds of 500 to 3,000 rpm
   via a variable frequency drive (VFD) motor. A spray system similar to
   that of the air cannon generates a liquid jet that impinges onto the
   spinning disc, and cameras placed at several optical access points
   record the jet impingement. Video recordings of jet impingement
   processes are recorded and examined to determine whether the outcome of
   impingement is splash, splatter, or deposition. The apparatuses are the
   first that involve the high speed impingement of low-Reynolds-number
   liquid jets on high speed moving surfaces. In addition to its rail
   industry applications, the described technique may be used for technical
   and industrial purposes such as steelmaking and may be relevant to
   high-speed 3D printing.}},

Title = {{Usability and Feasibility of PIERS on the Move: An mHealth App for
   Pre-Eclampsia Triage}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal death
   and morbidity in low-resource countries due to delays in case
   identification and a shortage of health workers trained to manage the
   disorder. Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimate of RiSk (PIERS) on the Move
   (PotM) is a low cost, easy-to-use, mobile health (mHealth) platform that
   has been created to aid health workers in making decisions around the
   management of hypertensive pregnant women. PotM combines two previously
   successful innovations into a mHealth app: the miniPIERS risk assessment
   model and the Phone Oximeter.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the usability of PotM
   (with mid-level health workers) for iteratively refining the system.
   Methods: Development of the PotM user interface involved usability
   testing with target end-users in South Africa. Users were asked to
   complete clinical scenario tasks, speaking aloud to give feedback on the
   interface and then complete a questionnaire. The tool was then evaluated
   in a pilot clinical evaluation in Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town.
   Results: After ethical approval and informed consent, 37 nurses and
   midwives evaluated the tool. During Study 1, major issues in the
   functionality of the touch-screen keyboard and date scroll wheels were
   identified (total errors n=212); during Study 2 major improvements in
   navigation of the app were suggested (total errors n=144). Overall,
   users felt the app was usable using the Computer Systems Usability
   Questionnaire; median (range) values for Study 1 =2 (1-6) and Study 2 =1
   (1-7). To demonstrate feasibility, PotM was used by one research nurse
   for the pilot clinical study. In total, more than 500 evaluations were
   performed on more than 200 patients. The median (interquartile range)
   time to complete an evaluation was 4 min 55 sec (3 min 25 sec to 6 min
   56 sec).
   Conclusions: By including target end-users in the design and evaluation
   of PotM, we have developed an app that can be easily integrated into
   health care settings in low-and middle-income countries. Usability
   problems were often related to mobile phone features (eg, scroll wheels,
   touch screen use). Larger scale evaluation of the clinical impact of
   this tool is underway.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The majority of children in North America are not meeting
   current physical activity guidelines. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the impact of a mobile phone game ({''}MobileKids Monster
   Manor{''}) as a tool to promote voluntary physical activity among
   children.
   Materials and Methods: The game integrates data from an
   accelerometer-based activity monitor (Tractivity (R); Kineteks Corp.,
   Vancouver, BC, Canada) wirelessly connected to a phone and was developed
   with the involvement of a team of young advisors (KidsCan Initiative:
   Involving Youth as Ambassadors for Research). Fifty-four children 8-13
   years old completed a week of baseline data collection by wearing an
   accelerometer but receiving no feedback about their activity levels. The
   54 children were then sequentially assigned to two groups: One group
   played ``MobileKids Monster Manor,{''} and the other received daily
   activity feedback (steps and active minutes) via an online program. The
   physical activity (baseline and intervention weeks) was measured using
   the activity monitor and compared using two-way repeated-measures
   analysis of variance (intervention X time).
   Results: Forty-seven children with a body mass index (BMI) z-score of
   0.35 +/- 1.18 successfully completed the study. Significant (P = 0.01)
   increases in physical activity were observed during the intervention
   week in both the game and feedback groups (1191 and 796 steps/day,
   respectively). In the game group, greater physical activity was
   demonstrated in children with higher BMI z-score, showing 964 steps/day
   more per BMI z-score unit (P = 0.03; 95 percent confidence interval of
   98 to 1829).
   Conclusions: Further investigation is required to confirm that our game
   design promotes physical activity.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate morphological alternation in corneal stroma induced by
   collagen cross-linking (CXL) treatment, polarization-sensitive optical
   coherence tomography (PS-OCT) capable of providing scattering, phase
   retardation, and degree of polarization uniformity (DOPU) images were
   employed on fresh bovine cornea. Significant corneal thickness reduction
   was observed after the CXL procedure, and its variation was
   quantitatively analyzed. From the scattering contrast, a hyperscattering
   region was observed in the anterior of the cornea immediately after the
   CXL procedure and its range increased with time. Within the scattering
   region, a slow increase was observed in the phase retardation image, and
   a discriminable characteristic was found in the DOPU image. A global
   threshold value was empirically determined from the averaged DOPU depth
   profile in order to locate the effective cross-linking depth. In
   addition to the standard protocol, an accelerated CXL procedure
   shortening the treatment time with higher intensity of ultraviolet-A
   (UV-) A power was also performed. From the measurement results after the
   two different CXL protocols, different cross-linking aspects were found
   and their difference was discussed in terms of the effectiveness of
   cross-linking. Based on this study, we believe that PS-OCT could be a
   promising optical imaging modality to evaluate the progression and
   effectiveness of the riboflavin/UV-A induced corneal collagen
   cross-linking. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Combining the photoelectric and thermionic mechanisms to generate free
   electrons has been of great interest since the early days of quantum
   physics as exemplified by the Fowler-DuBridge theory, and recently
   proposed for highly efficient solar conversion. We present experimental
   evidence of this combined effect over the entire range spanning
   room-temperature photoemission to thermionic emission. Remarkably, the
   optical stimulus alone is responsible for both heating and photoemission
   at the same time. Moreover, the current depends on optical intensity
   quadratically, indicating two-photon photoemission, for intensities of
   Ca. 1-50 W/cm(2), which are orders of magnitude below the intensities
   required for two-photon photoemission from bulk metals. This surprising
   behavior appears to be enabled by the internal nanostructure of the
   carbon nanotube forest, which captures photons effectively, yet allows
   electrons to escape easily.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{259-267}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Pressure screens are used to fractionate fibers on the basis of aspect
   ratio to obtain high value long-fiber rejects and less desirable
   fines-rich accepts. Fiber fractionation is more practical and of maximum
   economic and commercial benefits when a mill can make use of all
   obtained fractions. We have demonstrated the potential of upgrading the
   reject fraction through a multistage fractionation process of a northern
   bleached softwood kraft pulp while isolating the remaining low-value
   pulp to be used as a raw material for a novel fiber-based product. The
   optimum operating conditions such as volumetric reject ratio, R-v;
   aperture velocity, V-s; and screen aperture size to carry out efficient
   fractionation were determined for the screens with 0.5-mm, 0.8-mm, and
   1.0-mm apertures. This work shows that a high fines percentage in the
   accept fraction and increased fiber length in the reject fraction can be
   obtained when operating the pressure screen at a higher R-v and lower
   V-s using the screen cylinder with the small aperture size (0.5 mm).
   Feed and fractionated streams of pulp were used to study the effects on
   the physical properties of paper. Handsheets were made for strength
   properties of the unfractionated and fractionated pulps for comparisons.
   Significant improvements in the physical properties were observed after
   the removal of fines.}},

Abstract = {{Addressing recent environmental regulations on fossil fuel power systems
   and both biomass fuel supply and coal greenhouse gas issues,
   biomass/coal co-gasification could provide a feasible transition
   solution for power plants. In the quest for an even more sustainable
   process, steam co-gasification of switchgrass and coal was integrated
   with in-situ CO2 capture, with limestone as the bed material and
   sorbent. Five gasification/carbonation (at <700 degrees C) and
   calcination (at >850 degrees C) cycles were performed in an atmospheric
   pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Hydrogen production was
   enhanced significantly (similar to 22\%) due to partial adsorption of
   CO2 by the CaO sorbent, shifting the gasification reactions forward,
   consistent with Le Chatelier's principle. Tar yield measurements showed
   that reducing the gasification temperature could be achieved without
   experiencing higher tar yield, indicating that the lime has a catalytic
   effect. The sorbent particles decayed and lost their calcium utilization
   efficiency in the course of cycling due to sintering. The co-existence
   of three types of solids (biomass, coal, lime) with different particle
   properties led to bed segregation. An equilibrium model was found to be
   useful in design of lime-enhanced gasification systems. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Fouling initiated by nonspecific protein adsorption is a great challenge
   in biomedical applications, including biosensors, bioanalytical devices,
   and implants. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), a popular material with
   many attractive properties for device fabrication in the biomedical
   field, suffers serious fouling problems from protein adsorption due to
   its hydrophobic nature, which limits the practical use of PDMS-based
   devices. Effort has been made to develop biocompatible materials for
   anti-fouling coatings of PDMS. In this review, typical nonfouling
   materials for PDMS coatings are introduced and the associated basic
   anti-fouling mechanisms, including the steric repulsion mechanism and
   the hydration layer mechanism, are described. Understanding the
   relationships between the characteristics of coating materials and the
   accompanying anti-fouling mechanisms is critical for preparing PDMS
   coatings with desirable anti-fouling properties.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a strategy for detecting possible dysfunction of
   organs such as the liver, pancreas, muscles and adipose tissues in a
   group of type II diabetic patients. Several in silico clinical trials
   are performed on a previously developed type II diabetes model. Since
   the pancreatic insulin secretion rate and glucose metabolic rates of
   different organs represent the functional behavior of the corresponding
   organs, calculated values of these rates are analyzed and compared with
   the corresponding rates calculated from a healthy subject's model to
   detect possible abnormalities. These rates are calculated from estimated
   values of glucose and insulin concentrations inside the corresponding
   organs/tissues from the physiological model. Estimation of the
   concentrations in body organs/tissues is carried out using a sequential
   Monte Carlo filtering method called particle filters. The results show
   that the proposed strategy is capable of detecting deficiencies in
   hepatic and peripheral glucose disposal, hepatic glucose production and
   pancreatic insulin secretion. The information provided by this strategy
   can potentially be used to tailor patient dietary requirements and/or
   select appropriate medications for the patients.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Sewer systems, over their life cycle, suffer deterioration due to aging,
   aggressive environmental factors, increased demand, inadequate design,
   third party intervention, and improper operation and maintenance
   activities. As a result, their state and overall long-term performance
   can be affected, which often requires costly and extensive maintenance,
   repair, and rehabilitation. Furthermore, these pressures can enhance the
   risk of failures (e.g., sewer leakage) which in turn can have serious
   impacts on the environment, public safety and health, economics, and the
   remaining service life of these assets. Effective asset management plans
   must be implemented to address long-term sustainability principles,
   i.e., economic growth, human health and safety, and environmental
   protection, simultaneously. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and
   compare four typical sewer pipe materials {[}i.e., concrete, polyvinyl
   chloride (PVC), vitrified clay, and ductile iron] and identify
   sustainable solutions. Two comprehensive life cycle sustainability
   assessment (LCSA) frameworks were applied. The first LCSA framework was
   based on the integration of emergy synthesis, life cycle assessment
   (LCA), and life cycle costing (LCC). In this framework, emergy synthesis
   has been applied to integrate the results from environmental analysis
   (i.e., LCA) and economic analysis (i.e., LCC) to an equivalent form of
   solar energy: a solar emergy joule. The second LCSA framework was based
   on a conventional, multi-criteria decision-making technique, i.e., the
   analytical hierarchy process, to integrate the results from
   environmental analysis (i.e., LCA) and economic analysis (i.e., LCC) and
   find the most sustainable solution over the sewer pipe life cycle. The
   results demonstrate that PVC pipe is the most sustainable option from
   both environmental and economic view points and can ensure a more
   sustainable sewer system.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic implants have been developed to address potential adjacent level
   effects due to rigid instrumentation. Rates of revision surgeries may be
   reduced by using improved implants in the primary surgery. Prior to
   clinical use, implants should be rigorously tested ex vivo. The
   objective of our study was to characterize the load-sharing and
   kinematic behavior of a novel low-stiffness spinal implant.
   A human cadaveric model of degenerative spondylolisthesis was tested in
   shear. Lumbar functional spinal units (N = 15) were tested under a
   static 300 N axial compression force and a cyclic anterior shear force
   (5-250 N). Translation was tracked with a motion capture system. A novel
   implant was compared to three standard implants with shear stiffness
   ranging from low to high. All implants were instrumented with strain
   gauges to measure the supported shear force. Each implant was affixed to
   each specimen, and the specimens were tested intact and in two
   progressively destabilized states.
   Specimen condition and implant type affected implant load-sharing and
   specimen translation (p < 0.0001). Implant load-sharing increased across
   all degeneration-simulating specimen conditions and decreased across the
   three standard implants (high- to low-stiffness). Translation increased
   with the three standard implants (trend). The novel implant behaved
   similarly to the medium-stiffness implant (p > 0.2).
   The novel implant behaved similarly to the medium-stiffness implant in
   both load-sharing and translation despite having a different design and
   stiffness. Complex implant design and specimen-implant interaction
   necessitate pre-clinical testing of novel implants. Further in vitro
   testing in axial rotation and flexion-extension is recommended as they
   are highly relevant loading directions for non-rigid implants.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless local area networking technologies are widely used in
   communication-based train control (CBTC) systems, where handoff latency
   is the key factor affecting the transmission performance. A
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-assisted handoff (MAHO) scheme for
   CBTC systems is proposed in this paper to reduce handoff latency. During
   the handoff procedure, the mobile station (MS) communicates with the
   serving access point (AP) and the candidate AP concurrently with handoff
   signaling transmitted by one antenna and data packets transmitted by
   another one so that the station can handoff from one to the other
   without interrupting data transmission. The interference is canceled by
   a zero-forcing algorithm in the uplink (UL) and by space-time block code
   (STBC) interference cancelation algorithms in the downlink. The handoff
   performance, including transmission delay of train-control-related
   information due to handoff, the frame error rate (FER) of the handoff
   signaling, the error-free period, and the required intersite distance,
   are analyzed and compared with traditional break-before-make schemes.
   The results show that the MAHO scheme can significantly reduce the
   handoff latency of CBTC services and that the FER of the handoff
   signaling is lower than traditional schemes when the data rates are no
   more than 13 Mb/s.}},

Abstract = {{A single-contact voltage sensor designed for accurate measurements of ac
   voltages across a pair of conductors is described. The sensor design is
   motivated by remote monitoring applications where accurate voltage
   measurement of high-voltage transmission lines is required. The body of
   the sensor is electrically and mechanically attached to a single
   conductor: either the neutral or high-voltage conductor. A capacitive
   sensing plate attached to the sensor creates a capacitive voltage
   divider by using the stray capacitance to the noncontacted line. A very
   high-impedance buffer is used to measure the voltage across the divider
   output and estimate the line voltage. An important part of this paper
   includes a method of calibrating the sensor such that blind voltage
   measurements can be made without knowing the exact geometry of the
   conductors. Other important aspects of the design include a two-stage
   voltage divider for retaining accuracy and increasing the voltage range
   of the sensor. The work is supported by extensive numerical simulation
   models which were used to determine the optimum design for the sensing
   plate and to evaluate the sensitivity to different configurations
   including conductor spacing and the height above ground. For calibration
   values which are accurate to 1\%, the line voltage can be measured with
   an accuracy of 10\%. The paper describes the theory, design, and
   experimental verification of the sensor up to a line voltage of 7.5
   kVrms.}},

Abstract = {{An energy efficient collaborative spectrum sensing (EE-CSS) protocol,
   based on trust management, is proposed. The protocol achieves energy
   efficiency by reducing the total number of sensing reports exchanged
   between the honest secondary users (HSUs) and the secondary user base
   station (SUBS) in a traditional collaborative spectrum sensing (T-CSS)
   protocol. It is shown that the minimum total number of sensing reports
   required to satisfy a target global false alarm (FA) and missed
   detection (MD) probabilities in T-CSS is higher than that in EE-CSS.
   Expressions for the steady-state average SU trust value (tau) over bar
   and total number (N) over bar of SU sensing reports transmitted are
   derived, as is an expression for the energy consumption, in EE-CSS and
   T-CSS. The global FA and detection probabilities Q(f) and Q(d) are
   obtained for a commonly used decision fusion technique. The impact of
   link outages on t, N, Qf, and Qd is also analyzed. The results show that
   the energy consumption in EE-CSS can be much lower compared to that in
   T-CSS for long range communications where the transmit energy is
   dominant.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   various degrees of cyclic fatigue on torsional failure and torsional
   preloading on the cyclic fatigue life of heat-treated K3XF
   nickel-titanium (NiTi) instruments (SybronEndo, Orange, CA). Methods:
   The mean number of cycles until failure (N-f) of K3XF and K3 NiTi
   instruments was examined in a 3-point bending apparatus with a 7-mm
   radius and 45 curve. Torque and distortion angles at failure of new
   instruments and instruments stressed to 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of the N-f
   were measured according to ISO 3630-1. Other new files were preloaded at
   25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of the mean distortion angles before the fatigue
   test. After torsional preloading, the N-f was examined. The fracture
   surface of each fragment was examined with a scanning electron
   microscope. Results: The fatigue resistance of K3XF instruments was 2
   times higher than that of K3 instruments (P < .05). The torque and angle
   of rotation at fracture of K3XF instruments were similar to those of K3
   instruments. The 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% torsional preloading significantly
   lowered the N-f of both K3 and K3XF instruments (P < .05). In the
   fatigue prestressed groups, K3 instruments with 75\% preloading had
   significantly lower torque and distortion angles than unused K3
   instruments (P < .05). The fractographic patterns corresponded to the
   pattern defined by the last stage test. Conclusions: A low amount of
   torsional preloading reduced the fatigue resistance of K3 and K3XF
   instruments. A high amount of precycling fatigue ignificantly reduced
   the torsional resistance of K3 instruments. The torsional resistance of
   K3XF instruments was less affected by previous load cycling even after
   extensive precycling.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Previous studies have shown the difficulty in removing
   calcium hydroxide (Ca{[}OH](2)) paste from the root canals before root
   filling. Methods: Mesial and distal canals of 30 mandibular molars were
   prepared with the Wave One Primary (25/.08) and Large file (40/.08)
   (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Tulsa, OK), respectively. All canals
   were then filled with Ca(OH)(2). The teeth were divided into the
   following 3 treatment groups (each with n = 10): (1) instrumentation
   with needle irrigation, (2) instrumentation with irrigation and passive
   ultrasonic activation (PUI), and (3) the GentleWave system (Sonendo,
   Inc, Laguna Hills, CA) without instrumentation. The irrigation time in
   each group was 7.5 minutes. To further test the efficiency of the
   GentleWave system, shorter times of 90 seconds were tested using water
   alone. Reconstructed micro computed tomographic scans were used to
   measure the volume of the canals and Ca(OH)(2) after instrumentation,
   initial filling of Ca(OH)(2), and after its removal. The percentage of
   Ca(OH)(2) remaining in the canals was calculated. Results: None of the
   10 teeth (30 canals) in the conventional irrigation and PUI groups were
   completely cleaned of Ca(OH)(2) in 7.5 minutes. In the apical third of
   mesial and distal canals, respectively, conventional irrigation removed
   47.82\% 16.36\% and 77.68\% 12.82\%, PUI removed 61.66\% 25.54\% and
   88.85 12.06\%, and the G.entleWave system removed significantly more
   Ca(OH)(2) (P < .05) with 100\% and 98.78\% 3.84\%. Additional
   experiments in 10 teeth, using only water as the irrigant, revealed that
   the GentleWave system removed 99.85\% and 99.97\% of Ca(OH)(2) within 90
   seconds without the use of any instruments in the mesial and distal
   canals, respectively. Conclusions: The study confirms the difficulty to
   remove Ca(OH)(2) from root canals using conventional methods. The
   GentleWave system removed the paste within 90 seconds using water
   irrigation alone.}},

Abstract = {{Flocculation time is conventionally believed to be proportional to the
   flocculation efficiency of a cylindrical fluidized bed flocculator.
   However, in a single-stage velocity gradient situation, the flocculation
   efficiency decreases when the optimal flocculation time is exceeded. A
   multi-stage velocity gradient was established in a cylindrical fluidized
   bed flocculator, based on the hydraulic classification theory. This
   multi-stage velocity gradient fluidized bed flocculator (MGF) created a
   more suitable environment for floc growth and protection, which was
   confirmed by the size distribution of flocs along the bed height.
   Correspondingly, the abatement efficiencies for Kaolin slurry and dyed
   wastewater treatment in the MGF were enhanced by 5-10\%, and by 7-20\%,
   respectively, compared with those in the single-stage velocity gradient
   fluidized bed flocculators (SGFs). The initial bed height distribution
   ratio along the velocity gradients was an important factor for MGF
   optimization. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese

Abstract = {{Calibration is essential in freehand 3-D ultrasound to find the spatial
   transformation from the image coordinates to the sensor coordinate
   system. Ease of use, simplicity, precision and accuracy are among the
   most important factors in ultrasound calibration, especially when aiming
   to make calibration more reliable for day-to- day clinical use. We
   introduce a new mathematical framework for the simple and popular
   single-wall calibration phantom with a plane equation pre-determination
   step and the use of differential measurements to obtain accurate
   measurements. The proposed method provides a novel solution for
   ultrasound calibration that is accurate and easy to perform. This method
   is applicable to both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode data, and both
   linear and curvilinear transducers. For a linear L14-5 transducer, the
   point reconstruction accuracy (PRA) of reconstructing 370 points is 0.73
   +/- 0.23 mm using 100 RF images, whereas the triple N-wire PRA is 0.67
   +/- 0.20 mm using 100 B-mode images. For a curvilinear C5-2 transducer,
   the PRA using the proposed method is 0.86 +/- 0.28 mm on 400 points
   using 100 RF images, whereas N-wire calibration gives a PRA of 0.80 +/-
   0.46 mm using 100 B-mode images. Therefore, the accuracy of the proposed
   variation of the single-wall method using RF data is practically similar
   to the N-wire method while offering a simpler phantom with no need for
   accurate design and construction. (C) 2015 World Federation for

Abstract = {{The recent introduction of ground-based slope stability radar in
   open-pit mines to complement conventional geodetic monitoring programs
   provides near real-time deformation measurements over a broad coverage
   area; this allows geotechnical engineers to observe the spatial
   distribution of pit wall movements and their progression over time. This
   paper presents a newly proposed early warning time-of-failure (TOF)
   analysis procedure for use in real-time with ground-based radar
   measurements designed to be integrated in an open-pit mine's trigger
   action response plan (TARP). The inverse-velocity and slope gradient
   (SLO) TOF analysis methods are applied to radar displacement
   measurements using a new systematic multi-pixel selection technique
   termed the ``percent deformation method.{''} The utilization of the
   percent deformation method in the proposed real-time TOF analysis
   methodology gives more-reliable results than current practice by
   providing recommendations for pixel selections, data filtering, where
   and how to undertake TOF analyses, and presenting TOF results in real
   time. The addition of a more rigorous, methodical treatment of radar
   monitoring data when faced with critical slope instability will reduce
   uncertainty and increase confidence in any trigger action response
   decisions, helping to ensure a safer work environment.}},

Abstract = {{Although the adverse health effects of poor indoor air quality on
   occupants from mold and dampness in indoor environments are well
   described, there is no reliable empirical tool to evaluate indoor mold
   and dampness levels in the home for use by the medical profession and
   health safety regulatory bodies. The economic impact to society
   approaches \$40 billion a year in North America alone from the cost of
   health care and workplace lost productivity. Mobilizing corrective
   action necessitates an acceptable home environment evaluation method.
   This paper proposes a reliable empirical model and tool, the Holistic
   Environmental Assessment Lay Tool for Home Healthiness, and develops
   guidelines for its use as a tool to evaluate and rank mold and dampness
   related indoor environmental conditions associated with known
   respiratory health outcomes. HEALTH(2) was calibrated using theoretical
   homes and then validated using data from 269 home evaluations where
   occupant health and the home environment factors were collected. Results
   suggest the model can be used as an early detection tool to assist in
   determining indoor environment risk factors associated with respiratory
   illness from mold and dampness. Empirical modeling and this tool can
   assist environmental professionals in determining improvement scenarios
   beyond general industry prescription and assist regulatory bodies in
   setting home health guidelines. The HEALTH(2) model challenges the
   dominant view and suggests that damp and moldy environments are
   measurable and the impact to society is sufficient to necessitate prompt
   medical and regulatory action.}},

Abstract = {{Weather system is a relative complex dynamic system, the factors of the

   new method is proposed to quantify the influence on P M (2.5) by other

   figure out the direct relation matrix of 14 factors in P M (2.5). The
   decision making trial and evaluation laboratory(DEMATEL) is applied to
   calculate the causal relationship and extent to a mutual influence of 14
   factors in P M (2.5). According to the ranking results of our proposed
   method, the most important key factors is sulfur dioxide (SO (2)) and
   nitrogen oxides (NO (X) ). In addition, the other factors, the ambient
   maximum temperature (T (max)), concentration of P M (10), and wind
   direction (W (d i r) ), are important factors for P M (2.5). The

Abstract = {{Low-dose-rate brachytherapy is a radiation treatment method for
   localized prostate cancer. The standard of care for this treatment
   procedure is to acquire transrectal ultrasound images of the prostate in
   order to devise a plan to deliver sufficient radiation dose to the
   cancerous tissue. Brachytherapy planning involves delineation of
   contours in these images, which closely follow the prostate boundary,
   i.e., clinical target volume. This process is currently performed either
   manually or semi-automatically, which requires user interaction for
   landmark initialization. In this paper, we propose a multi-atlas fusion
   framework to automatically delineate the clinical target volume in
   ultrasound images. A dataset of a priori segmented ultrasound images,
   i.e., atlases, is registered to a target image. We introduce a pairwise
   atlas agreement factor that combines an image-similarity metric and
   similarity between a priori segmented contours. This factor is used in
   an atlas selection algorithm to prune the dataset before combining the
   atlas contours to produce a consensus segmentation. We evaluate the
   proposed segmentation approach on a set of 280 transrectal prostate
   volume studies. The proposed method produces segmentation results that
   are within the range of observer variability when compared to a
   semi-automatic segmentation technique that is routinely used in our
   cancer clinic.}},

Abstract = {{This letter reports the first micromachined rotor of highly oriented

   is levitated above a permanent magnet structure to allow for its

   to have four blades with 1-mm inner diameter disc and 2-mm outer
   diameter including the blades. The levitation height of 132 mu m
   measured for the rotor matches well with a simulation result. The
   revolution of the rotor is demonstrated by applying gas flow, showing
   stable continuous actuation with the maximum rate of 500 r/min. These
   promising results suggest potential applications of the mechanism toward
   frictionless microsensors and microactuators.}},

Abstract = {{Viscoplastic fluids do not flow unless they are sufficiently stressed.
   This property can be exploited in order to produce novel flow features.
   One example of such flows is viscoplastically lubricated (VPL) flow, in
   which a viscoplastic fluid is used to stabilize the interface in a
   multi-layer flow, far beyond what might be expected for a typical
   viscous viscous interface. Here we extend this idea by considering the
   encapsulation of droplets within a viscoplastic fluid, for the purpose
   of transportation, e.g. in pipelines. The main advantage of this method,
   compared to others that involve capillary forces is that significantly
   larger droplets may be stably encapsulated, governed by the length scale
   of the flow and yield stress of the encapsulating fluid. We explore this
   set-up both analytically and computationally. We show that sufficiently
   small droplets are held in the unyielded plug of a Poiseuille flow (pipe
   or plane channel). As the length or radius of the droplets increases,
   the carrier fluid eventually yields, potentially breaking the
   encapsulation. We study this process of breaking and give estimates for
   the limiting size of droplets that can be encapsulated.}},

Abstract = {{Many pathologies involving disc degeneration are treated with surgery
   and spinal implants. It is important to understand how the spine behaves
   mechanically as a function of disc degeneration. Shear loading is
   especially relevant in the natural and surgically stabilized lumbar
   spine. The objective of our study was to determine the effect of disc
   degeneration on anterior translation of the lumbar spine under shear
   loading. We tested 30 human cadaveric functional spinal units (L3-4 and
   L4-5) in anterior shear loading. First, the specimens were imaged in a
   1.5T magnetic resonance scanner. The discs were graded according to the
   Pfirrmann classification. The specimens were then loaded up to 250N in
   anterior shear with an axial compression force of 300N. Motion of the
   vertebrae was captured with an optoelectronic camera system. Inter- and
   intra-observer reliability for disc grading was determined (Cohen's and
   Fleiss' Kappa), and a non-parametric test was performed on the
   translation data to characterize the effect of disc degeneration on this
   parameter. We found fair to moderate agreement between and within
   observers for the disc grading. We found no significant effect of disc
   degeneration on anterior shear translation (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). Our
   results indicate that disc degeneration, as classified with the
   Pfirrmann scale, does not predict lumbar spinal motion in shear. (c)

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{PurposeIn conventional three-dimensional magnetic resonance
   elastography, motion encoding gradients (MEGs) synchronized to a
   mechanical excitation are applied separately in each direction to encode
   tissue displacement generated by the corresponding waves. This requires
   long acquisition times that introduce errors due to patient motion and
   may hinder clinical deployment of magnetic resonance elastography. In
   this article, a framework for MEGs sequence design is proposed to reduce
   scanning time and increase signal-to-noise ratio.
   Theory and MethodsThe approach is based on applying MEGs in all three
   directions simultaneously with varying parameters, and formulation of
   the problem as a linear estimation of the wave properties.
   Multidirectional MEGs sequences are derived by setting the problem in an
   experimental design framework. Such designs are implemented and
   evaluated on simulation and phantom data.
   ResultsEstimation error of the displacement using the proposed MEGs
   designs is reduced up to a factor of two in comparison with a
   unidirectional design with a same number of acquisitions. Alternatively,
   for the same error, scanning time is reduced up to a factor of three
   using the multidirectional designs.
   ConclusionThe proposed framework generalizes acquisition of magnetic
   resonance elastography, and allows quantification of design performance,
   and optimization-based derivation of designs. Magn Reson Med

Title = {{Depressing effect of flocculants on molybdenite flotation}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{13-19}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The quality of recycled process water is an important issue in the
   flotation of Cu-Mo ores. Processing of Cu-Mo ores includes two steps: a
   bulk flotation where molybdenite is recovered together with Cu sulfides,
   and a subsequent selective flotation step where molybdenite is separated
   from depressed copper sulfides. Flocculants are usually employed in the
   middling thickeners in the copper plant, and in the Cu-Mo bulk
   concentrate ahead of the molybdenite plant. However, the floatability of
   molybdenite, similarly to other naturally hydrophobic minerals, is
   highly sensitive to the presence of both natural and synthetic polymers.
   In this work flotation tests demonstrate that conventional flocculants,
   highmolecular weight anionic polyacrylamides (PAM), are strong
   molybdenite depressants. Low-molecular weight shear degraded
   polyacrylamides in spite of losing flocculation efficiency maintain
   depressing ability for molybdenite. Also a non-ionic flocculant,
   polyethylene oxide (PEO), has been studied in this project. Our results
   indicate that PEO is an efficient flocculant for molybdenite suspensions
   in a wide pH range. However, similarly to polyacrylamides, the PEO
   flocculant also depresses molybdenite flotation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Equation for thiosulphate yield during pyrite oxidation}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{105-111}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A pyrite concentrate with a grind size P-80 of 14 mu m was oxidized in
   an alkaline medium at an oxygen overpressure between 10 and 40 psig, at
   a temperature of 80 degrees C. Sodium hydroxide was used to neutralize
   the acid produced as a result of pyrite oxidation. When the pH was
   maintained above 12.5, there were three dominant sulphur oxyanions
   detected in the solution, thiosulphate, sulphite and sulphate. The focus
   of this study was the calculation of thiosulphate yield as a function of
   sulphide sulphur concentration of the pyrite in the feed. This
   calculation included the effect of other sulphur oxyanions on the
   thiosulphate yield since it is well known that thiosulphate oxidizes
   fairly rapidly to tetrathionate and trithionate and higher sulphur
   oxyanions under high alkalinity conditions. The transient formation of
   tetrathionate and trithionate can only be estimated when the mechanism
   of formation of these oxyanions is known. Various schemes involving
   branching of the reaction pathways can be found in the literature but
   unfortunately, no widely accepted mechanism has emerged from these
   studies. In the present study, the transformation mechanism is based on
   the least electron transfer principle and assumes that the
   transformation reactions occur in series. Based on this approach, linear
   equations were derived and used to set up a kinetic model of the system
   with respect to thiosulphate yield. In determining the kinetic
   constants, the presence of unseen and unmeasured intermediates was
   assumed and calculated based on the corresponding reaction
   stoichiometry. A single rate expression combining kinetic constants of
   all the metastable oxyanions was derived to predict the thiosulphate
   yield as a function of the known pyrite sulphide sulphur concentration
   under the experimental conditions that were adopted. dCs203/dt =

Title = {{Alginate core-shell beads for simplified three-dimensional tumor
   spheroid culture and drug screening}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that when using cell-laden core-shell hydrogel beads to
   support the generation of tumor spheroids, the shell structure reduces
   the out-of-bead and monolayer cell proliferation that occurs during
   long-term culture of tumor cells within core-only alginate beads. We
   fabricate core-shell beads in a two-step process using simple, one-layer
   microfluidic devices. Tumor cells encapsulated within the bead core will
   proliferate to form multicellular aggregates which can serve as
   three-dimensional (3-D) models of tumors in drug screening.
   Encapsulation in an alginate shell increased the time that cells could
   be maintained in three-dimensional culture for MCF-7 breast cancer cells
   prior to out-of-bead proliferation, permitting formation of spheroids
   over a period of 14 days without the need move the cell-laden beads to
   clean culture flasks to separate beads from underlying monolayers.
   Tamoxifen and docetaxel dose response shows decreased toxicity for
   multicellular aggregates in three-dimensional core-shell bead culture
   compared to monolayer. Using simple core-only beads gives mixed
   monolayer and 3-D culture during drug screening, and alters the
   treatment result compared to the 3-D core-shell or the 2-D monolayer
   groups, as measured by standard proliferation assay. By preventing the
   out-of-bead proliferation and subsequent monolayer formation that is
   observed with core-only beads, the core-shell structure can obviate the
   requirement to transfer the beads to a new culture flask during drug
   screening, an important consideration for cell-based drug screening and
   drugs which have high multicellular resistance index.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading diseases in the developed world.
   In order to better regulate blood glucose in a diabetic patient,
   improved modelling of insulin-glucose dynamics is a key factor in the
   treatment of diabetes mellitus. In the current work, the insulin-glucose
   dynamics in type II diabetes mellitus can be modelled by using a
   stochastic nonlinear state-space model. Estimating the parameters of
   such a model is difficult as only a few blood glucose and insulin
   measurements per day are available in a non-clinical setting. Therefore,
   developing a predictive model of the blood glucose of a person with type
   II diabetes mellitus is important when the glucose and insulin
   concentrations are only available at irregular intervals. To overcome
   these difficulties, we resort to online sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
   estimation of states and parameters of the state-space model for type II
   diabetic patients under various levels of randomly missing clinical
   data. Our results show that this method is efficient in monitoring and
   estimating the dynamics of the peripheral glucose, insulin and incretins
   concentration when 10, 25 and 50 \% of the simulated clinical data were
   randomly removed.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the effects of the major growth parameters for

   growth. Preliminary studies in shake flasks revealed that an
   optimization of components in BG-11 growth medium resulted in no
   significant improvements for the specific growth rate and biomass
   concentration. However, an optimal temperature of 33 degrees C and light
   intensity of 120E/m(2)s provided a maximum specific growth rate of
   0.052h(-1) and a maximum biomass concentration of 0.50g/L. Further
   studies of light intensity, CO2 concentration, and gas flow rate in a 1L
   airlift photobioreactor showed that air enriched with 5\% CO2 with a
   flow rate of 1L/min, temperature of 33 degrees C, and light intensity of
   6E/m(2)s achieved a maximum in biomass concentration of 1.07g/L with a
   specific growth rate of 0.026h(-1). The specific growth rate and biomass
   concentration diminished when CO2 concentration and light intensity
   increased above 5\% and 120E/m(2)s, respectively. CO2 absorption
   experiments also revealed that growth was significantly limited by CO2
   when supplied with air, whereas 10\% CO2 lowered the pH and consequently
   reduced the specific growth rate. Application of a 12:12 hour light-dark

Abstract = {{Traditional linear techniques are widely used for the control of basic
   dc-dc converters due to their simple implementation. However, due to the
   small-signal validity range of the models employed, the converters
   usually perform poorly under large transients, and the dynamic response
   can be improved only to a limited extent in order to ensure a stable
   behavior. On the other hand, faster dynamic response can be achieved
   with boundary controllers, which require faster sensors and more
   powerful processors. A novel control scheme that combines the advantages
   of fixed-frequency pulsewidth modulation with state-plane geometric
   analysis is introduced to obtain fast and reliable large-signal
   response. The natural evolution of the average state variables is
   described by a large-signal unified model, which provides the basis to
   develop a reliable nonlinear control scheme. The proposed technique is
   suitable for implementation in low-cost digital signal processors, using
   low-bandwidth sensing stages, and it features fast, sleek, and
   consistent dynamic response with constant switching frequency. Since the
   model developed accurately predicts the large-signal behavior, reliable
   and predictable responses can be obtained at any operating point. In
   this way, the transient response obtained shows reduced, consistent, and
   well-determined peaks in inductor current and capacitor voltage,
   avoiding magnetic saturation and system failures even during extremely
   large transients. Furthermore, the maximum rating specifications for the
   reactive components can be reduced, which, combined with the low
   requirements for sensors and processors, lowers the implementation cost
   and makes the controller a very appealing alternative for high-volume
   applications. The contributions made to the theoretical and applied
   field are valid for any combination of reactive components due to the
   normalized approach adopted. The theoretical concepts are supported by
   detailed mathematical procedures. The proposed theory and controller are
   validated by experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Media streaming applications have recently attracted a large number of
   users in the Internet. With the advent of these bandwidth-intensive
   applications, it is economically inefficient to provide streaming
   distribution with guaranteed QoS relying only on central resources at a
   media content provider. Cloud computing offers an elastic infrastructure
   that media content providers (e.g., Video on Demand (VoD) providers) can
   use to obtain streaming resources that match the demand. Media content
   providers are charged for the amount of resources allocated (reserved)
   in the cloud. Most of the existing cloud providers employ a pricing
   model for the reserved resources that is based on non-linear
   time-discount tariffs (e.g., Amazon CloudFront and Amazon EC2). Such a
   pricing scheme offers discount rates depending non-linearly on the
   period of time during which the resources are reserved in the cloud. In
   this case, an open problem is to decide on both the right amount of
   resources reserved in the cloud, and their reservation time such that
   the financial cost on the media content provider is minimized. We
   propose a simple-easy to implement-algorithm for resource reservation
   that maximally exploits discounted rates offered in the tariffs, while
   ensuring that sufficient resources are reserved in the cloud. Based on
   the prediction of demand for streaming capacity, our algorithm is
   carefully designed to reduce the risk of making wrong resource
   allocation decisions. The results of our numerical evaluations and
   simulations show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the
   monetary cost of resource allocations in the cloud as compared to other
   conventional schemes.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{AimTo investigate the microhardness and microstructural features of
   three tricalcium silicate materials: mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA),
   Endosequence Root Repair Material Putty (ERRM Putty) and Endosequence
   Root Repair Material Paste (ERRM Paste), after exposure to a range of
   acidic environments in comparison with intermediate restorative material
   (IRM).
   MethodologyEndosequence Root Repair Material Putty (Brasseler, Savannah,
   GA, USA), ERRM Paste (Brasseler, Savannah, GA, USA), MTA (ProRoot;
   Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Johnson City, TN, USA) and IRM (Dentsply Caulk,
   Milford, DE, USA) were set in cylindrical rubber moulds as four groups
   containing twenty specimens each. Fifteen specimens per each material
   were randomly distributed into three groups (n=5) to be exposed to
   butyric acid buffered at three different pH levels (5.4, 6.4 and 7.4)
   for 7days. The remaining five specimens were exposed to distilled water
   as a control group. The surface microhardness after exposure either to
   acid or to water was measured after 7-days at 37 degrees C. The
   morphology of the internal microstructure was observed using a scanning
   electron microscope (SEM). Two-way univariate analysis of variance
   (anova) was applied to evaluate the Vickers microhardness value (VHN).
   ResultsThe microhardness values of the materials were significantly
   higher in the neutral environment of butyric acid at pH 7.4 compared to
   those in the acidic condition of pH 5.4 for all groups (P<0.001). MTA,
   ERRM Putty and ERRM Paste had higher microhardness values than IRM at
   all pH levels (P<0.001). Specimens exposed to distilled water displayed
   significantly higher microhardness values than those values obtained in
   the presence of butyric acid buffered to all pH levels (P<0.001). A more
   porous microstructure was observed following exposure to butyric acid at
   pH 5.4 than at pH 7.4. Several types of crystalline structures were
   formed by recrystallization, especially at pH 7.4 in all groups except
   for IRM.
   ConclusionsThe microhardness values of ERRM Putty, ERRM Paste and MTA
   were reduced in an acidic environment, which resulted in these materials
   having more porous and less crystalline microstructures. MTA seems the
   most suitable material for application to an area of inflammation where
   a low pH value may exist.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo use micro-computed tomography (-CT) to evaluate the amount of
   calcium hydroxide {[}Ca(OH)(2)] remaining in the C-shaped root canals of
   mandibular second molars after attempting to remove it with passive
   ultrasonic and sonic irrigation.
   MethodologyThirty mandibular second molars, 15 in C1 and 15 in C2
   configurations as first identified by -CT, were divided into three
   groups (five C1 and five C2 in each group) for the three irrigation
   methods. All teeth were prepared to ProTaper Universal F2 and filled
   with Ca(OH)(2) paste. The Ca(OH)(2) was removed with F2 files and
   irrigation without agitation or with agitation using either
   EndoActivator or ultrasonics. -CT was used to measure the initial amount
   of Ca(OH)(2) present. After removal of Ca(OH)(2,) -CT imaging was used
   to assess the percentage of volume of residual Ca(OH)(2) in the canal.
   Data were analysed using one-way anova test.
   ResultsThere was no significant difference in the mean volume of the
   root canal systems after instrumentation amongst the three groups. The
   three irrigation techniques left 2-17\% of Ca(OH)(2) in the root canals
   after removal. The mean volume of the remaining Ca(OH)(2) was higher in
   the group without agitation than in the groups with sonic or ultrasonic
   agitation (P<0.05). In the apical third, 68\% of the canal space
   remained occupied by Ca(OH)(2) when no agitation was used, whereas 28\%
   and 31\% remained filled by Ca(OH)(2) in the EndoActivator and
   ultrasonic groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in
   the amount of residual Ca(OH)(2) between the EndoActivator and
   ultrasonic groups. The proportion of remaining Ca(OH)(2) in the apical
   canals was higher than in the middle and coronal canals in all groups
   (P<0.05).
   ConclusionsA considerable proportion of the apical canal space remained
   filled with Ca(OH)(2) in the C-shaped root canals after instrumentation
   and conventional needle irrigation. Although combining rotary
   instrumentation and irrigation with sonic or ultrasonic agitation
   reduced the amount of residual Ca(OH)(2) in the C-shaped root canals,
   the large amount of calcium hydroxide in the critical apical area
   remains a concern. Alternative strategies should be considered in
   medication of the apical canal in C-shaped teeth.}},

   This method is based on the well-known weighting properties approach

   suggested exponential function and its applicability to the material
   selection process is verified by examining two case studies in

   Extensible Pipes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The performance evaluation of buried extensible plastic pipelines, such
   as polyethylene pipes in the gas distribution industry, in areas prone
   to ground movement is a key consideration for many utility owners.
   Considering the relatively smaller deformation stiffness and nonlinear
   stress-strain response of these pipes compared with those of steel
   pipes, a good understanding of the basic soil-pipe interaction
   mechanisms forms a critical part in these evaluations. The increase in
   soil normal stress on the pipe attributable to soil dilation and gradual
   degradation of interface friction with axial pipe displacement was
   investigated. An analytical method was developed to estimate the pipe
   response when subject to axial frictional loads arising from soil
   movements, which accounts for these factors and the nonlinear
   stress-strain response of the pipe material. For a known relative axial
   soil displacement, the approach provides a convenient way to determine
   the axial force, strain, and length along which the friction is
   mobilized. The proposed analytical solution was used to model the
   response of five large-scale field pipe pullout tests. It is shown that
   the analytical solution is capable of effectively forming a framework to
   relate pipe displacement, pullout resistance, strain, and mobilized
   length. The findings also highlight the significance and need to account
   for soil dilation effects in describing the soil-pipe interaction in
   extensible plastic pipes. (c) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper free vibration of a Timoshenko beam with a tip payload,
   which is mounted on a cart (referred to as TBC) is studied. The cart
   (base) can only have lateral displacement and the tip payload has both
   mass and mass moment of inertia. The center of mass of the payload does
   not coincide with the point where the beam connects to the payload.
   Therefore, the tip of the beam is exposed to an extra bending moment due
   to the inertial force of the payload. By employing Hamilton's principle,
   the governing equations of motion and the associated boundary conditions
   for the TBC are first derived and then transferred into dimensionless
   forms. By using these governing equations and their associated boundary
   conditions, the closed-form frequency equation (characteristic equation)
   of the TBC is derived. This closed-form frequency equation is validated
   both analytically and numerically. The closed-form expressions for the
   mode shapes of the TBC and their orthogonality are also presented. By
   using the closed-form characteristic equation, a sensitivity study is
   performed and the changes in the natural frequencies versus changes in
   the physical parameters are investigated. The results presented in this
   paper are valuable for precise dynamic modeling and model-based control
   of flexible mobile manipulators; a flexible mobile manipulator is a
   flexible link manipulator with a moving base.}},

Abstract = {{A micro vibration energy harvester, based on diamagnetic levitation, is
   presented in this paper. It consists of a lifting permanent magnet, an
   upper pyrolytic graphite sheet, a floating permanent magnet, a lower
   pyrolytic graphite sheet and a copper coil on the two pyrolytic graphite
   sheets respectively. The gravity of the floating permanent magnet is
   balanced by the attractive force between the lifting magnet and the
   floating magnet. The diamagnetic force exerted on the floating permanent
   magnet by the two pyrolytic graphite sheets works as restoring force,
   which makes the floating permanent magnet return to its equilibrium
   position. By Ansoft Maxwell, comparative analysis between the attractive
   magnetic force and the diamagnetic force was carried out, so as to
   obtain appropriate key parameters of the structure. The maximum range of
   movement for the floating permanent magnet is 1.3 mm. The first resonant
   frequency is 11.3 Hz, at which the output voltage of the energy
   harvester is 98.18 mV. By eliminating mechanical contact during its
   movement, the energy harvester improves the efficiency of vibration
   energy harvesting, and it can provide sustainable power for
   micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS).}},

Title = {{A state-of-the-art review of biomass torrefaction, densification and

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a mild pyrolysis, which has been explored for the
   pretreatment of biomass to increase the heating value and
   hydrophobicity. Due to its potential applications for making torrefied
   pellets, which can be used as a high quality feedstock in gasification
   for high quality syngas production and as a substitute for coal in
   thermal power plants and metallurgical processes, torrefaction and
   densification have attracted great interest in recent years from both
   academia and bioenergy industry. This paper provides a comprehensive
   review of research progresses in this area, drawing on major
   contributions from two major research groups of the authors on
   torrefaction and densification at Canada and Taiwan as well as
   literatures. It is revealed that torrefaction of various biomass species
   and their major components, lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses have
   been extensively studied in thermogravimetric apparatus (TGA) under both
   inert (N-2) and oxidative (O-2, H2O) environments to elucidate the
   weight loss as a function of temperature, particle size and time. It was
   found that the higher heating value and saturated water uptake of
   torrefied biomass were a strong function of weight loss, which
   represents the degree of torrefaction. When torrefied sawdust is
   compressed into torrefied pellets, more mechanical energy is consumed
   and higher die temperature is required to make torrefied pellets of
   similar density and hardness as regular pellets. Simple economics
   analyses based on laboratory scale experimental data showed that because
   of the potential savings from pellets transport, handling and storage
   logistics, the overall cost for torrefied pellets can be lower than
   regular pellets in European market for both European and Canadian
   pellets. The gasification could be improved in terms of both energy
   efficiency and syngas quality because of the removal of oxygenated
   volatile compounds from torrefied biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Seismic isolation is one of the most used protective technologies for
   earthquake engineering. Many innovative devices have been researched and
   implemented. Selection of the different isolation devices is commonly
   based on engineering experience, where no detailed and systematic
   comparison has been provided. In this paper, the seismic performances of
   a three-story office building isolated using five different devices were
   evaluated. The isolation devices included the bilinear, flag-shaped I,
   flag-shaped II, crystallizing rubber (CR), and rigid-perfectly plastic
   (RPP) models. These isolation devices were designed to achieve an
   equivalent performance at the seismic shaking intensity of 2\%
   probability of exceedance in 50years. The evaluation was conducted using
   the state-of-the-art assessment procedure at 2\%, 10\%, and 50\%
   probability of exceedance in 50years (50/50, 10/50, and 2/50) hazard
   levels. The results indicated that all the isolators performed well by
   limiting the financial losses. At both the 50/50 and 10/50 shaking
   intensities, the building with CR isolators experienced no repair costs,
   while those with bilinear, flag-shaped I, flag-shaped II, and RPP
   isolators had minor repair costs contributed from the content
   performance groups. At the 2/50 shaking intensity, all isolators
   incurred minor damages in the content performance groups. The building
   with CR isolators had additional repair costs because of the interior
   drift sensitive nonstructural components, while the building with the
   RPP isolators had repair costs contributed from the interior drift and
   acceleration sensitive nonstructural components and the acceleration
   sensitive equipment at the roof. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Reliable, secure, private, and fast communication in vehicular networks
   is extremely challenging due to the highly mobile nature of these
   networks. Contact time between vehicles is very limited and topology is
   constantly changing. Trusted communication in vehicular networks is of
   crucial importance because without trust, all efforts for minimizing the
   delay or maximizing the reliability could be voided. In this paper, we
   propose a trust-based framework for a safe and reliable information
   dissemination in vehicular networks. The proposed framework consists of
   two modules such that the first one applies three security checks to
   make sure the message is trusted. It assigns a trust value to each road
   segment and one to each neighborhood, instead of each car. Thus, it
   scales up easily and is completely distributed. Once a message is
   evaluated and considered to be trustworthy, our method then in the
   second module looks for a safe path through which the message is
   forwarded. Our frameworks are application-centric; in particular, it is
   capable of preserving traffic requirements specified by each
   application. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework
   outperforms other well-known routing protocols since it routes the
   messages via trusted vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges influence single bubble shape and rise velocity,

   investigate the influence of electrostatic charges on bubbles in
   freely-bubbling fluidized beds, by simulating a two-dimensional column,
   with charged mono-sized glass beads supported by air. Simulation results
   are first compared with experiments in an uncharged system at two
   superficial gas velocities. The sensitivity of the results to frictional
   models is investigated, with the model chosen for the rest of the study
   which gives better predictions. In the second part of this work, the
   effect of electrostatics on hydrodynamics of freely-bubbling fluidized
   beds is investigated by comparing bubble diameter, distribution and
   time-average vertical solid velocities for uncharged and charged cases.
   The results predict that electrostatic charges decrease bubble size,
   modify bubble spatial distribution and influence time-average solid

Abstract = {{The use of an achromatic interferometer is explored as a means of doing
   in-plane ESPI measurements using a laser diode as the light source. This
   interferometer type, which uses a diffraction grating in place of the
   conventional beamsplitter, has two features that make it suitable for
   making ESPI measurements over extended areas, even when using a
   low-coherence laser diode source. First, the parallelogram optical
   geometry of the interferometer causes all rays passing through to have
   the same optical path lengths. Second, the interferometer is achromatic,
   whereby the piezo-actuated mirror that steps the illumination light does
   so by the same phase angle, independent of wavelength. This latter
   feature accommodates the spectral impurity of a laser diode source. A
   periodic variation of fringe visibility is observed in experiments,
   where narrow ranges of high visibility occur at regular spatial
   intervals. This behavior derives from the clustered discrete spectral
   character of laser diode light output. A method to ``tune{''} the
   interferometer by slightly rotating the diffraction grating is described
   so as to achieve consistent high fringe visibility throughout the
   measured images. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemically mediated exfoliation of graphite is a promising green
   and high throughput approach for production of graphene sheets (GNs).
   Previous research focused mostly on either anode or cathode exfoliation
   due to restrictions imposed by the investigated intercalating ions and
   insufficient consideration given to the design of the electrochemical
   cell. Consequently, in single graphite electrode studies, at the
   non-graphitic counter-electrode (e.g. Pt), unwanted electrode reactions
   such as gas evolution and electrolyte decomposition take place, leading
   to significant energy and chemical losses. Here, we report the
   simultaneous anodic and cathodic GN production in two types of
   electrochemical cells (undivided and divided) using aprotic electrolytes
   containing ionic liquids (ILs). We demonstrate a synergistic exfoliation
   effect when the iso-molded graphite anode and cathode are subjected to a
   constant cell potential, generating up to 3 times higher exfoliation
   yields compared to single-electrode studies on each side (similar to
   6-fold improvement in total). Thorough characterization of the products
   collected from both electrode compartments confirmed the production of
   ultrathin GNs (<5 layers). The cathodic exfoliates were almost
   exclusively composed of GNs; whereas among the anodic products, in
   addition to the majority GNs, we detected traces of other morphologies
   such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, and larger rolled sheets. (C) 2014

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{332}},
Pages = {{480-487}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of the present work was to develop a method to
   fabricate titanium oxide films with high corrosion resistance by
   controlled chemical oxidation with H2O2 solutions at 90 degrees C. The
   prepared chemically oxidized films (COFs) were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) measurements and found to be a mixture of anatase and
   rutile or pure rutile, depending mainly on the presence of Cl- and SO42-
   in H2O2 solutions. XRD results indicated that the addition of SO42- ions
   promoted the formation of anatase; while the addition of Cl- ions
   favored the formation of rutile. Linear polarization resistance and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were used to
   evaluate the corrosion resistance of the as grown COFs for
   hydrometallurgical applications. Results verified that chemical
   oxidation with H2O2 solutions is capable of improving the corrosion
   resistance of Ti for hydrometallurgical applications. Chemical oxidation
   with 2 M H2O2/0.1 M HCl solution led to the best improvement of the
   corrosion resistance of Ti. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Electron transport and electron energy distributions within the wurtzite

Abstract = {{Within the framework of an ensemble semi-classical three-valley Monte
   Carlo electron transport simulation approach, we critically contrast the
   nature of the electron transport that occurs within the wurtzite and
   zinc-blende phases of indium nitride in response to the application of a
   constant and uniform electric field. We use the electron energy
   distribution and its relationship with the electron transport
   characteristics in order to pursue this analysis. For the case of
   zinc-blende indium nitride, only a peak corresponding to the electrons
   within the lowest energy conduction band valley is observed, this peak
   being seen to broaden and shift to higher energies in response to
   increases in the applied electric field strength, negligible amounts of
   upper energy conduction band valley occupancy being observed. In
   contrast, for the case of wurtzite indium nitride, in addition to the
   aforementioned lowest energy conduction band valley peak in the electron
   energy distribution, and its broadening and shifting to higher energies
   in response to increases in the applied electric field strength, beyond
   a certain critical electric field strength, 30 kV/cm for the case of
   this particular material, upper energy conduction band valley occupancy
   is observed, this occupancy being further enhanced in response to
   further increases in the applied electric field strength. Reasons for
   these results are provided. The potential for device consequences is
   then commented upon. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral nematic mesoporous phenol-formaldehyde resins, which were
   prepared using cellulose nanocrystals as a template, can be used as a
   substrate to produce latent photonic images. These resins undergo
   swelling, which changes their reflected color. By writing on the films
   with chemical inks, the density of methylol groups in the resin changes,
   subsequently affecting their degree of swelling and, consequently, their
   color. Writing on the films gives latent images that are revealed only
   upon swelling of the films. Using inkjet printing, it is possible to
   make higher resolution photonic patterns both as text and images that
   can be visualized by swelling and erased by drying. This novel approach
   to printing photonic patterns in resin films may be applied to
   anti-counterfeit tags, signage, and decorative applications.}},

Title = {{Strategic optimization of forest residues to bioenergy and biofuel

Abstract = {{Forest residues are renewable materials for bioenergy conversion that
   have the potential to replace fossil fuels beyond electricity and heat
   generation. A challenge hindering the intensified use of forest residues
   for energy production is the high cost of their supply chain. Previous
   studies on optimal design of forest residue supply chains focused on
   biofuel or bioenergy production separately, mostly with a single time
   period approach. We present a multi-period mixed integer linear
   programming model that optimizes the supply chain of forest residues for
   the production of bioenergy and biofuels simultaneously. The model
   determines (i) the location, type and size of the technologies to
   install and the period to install them, (ii) the mix of biofuel and
   bioenergy products to generate, (iii) the type and amount of forest
   residues to acquire and the sourcing points, (iv) the amount of forest
   residues to transport from sources to facilities and (v) the amount of
   product to transport from facilities to markets. The objective of the
   model is to maximize the net present value of the supply chain over a
   20-year planning horizon with yearly time steps. We applied the model to
   a case study in British Columbia, Canada, to investigate the production
   of heat, electricity, pellets and pyrolysis bio-oil from available
   forest harvesting residues and sawmill wastes. Based on current energy
   generation costs in the region and the predicted operating costs of new
   conversion plants, the results of our model recommended the installation
   of small biomass boilers coupled with steam turbines for electricity
   production (0.5 and 5MW) and pyrolysis plants with a capacity of 200 and
   400odmtday(-1). We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the
   sensitivity of the optimal result to changes in the demand and price of
   products, as well as the availability and cost of forest residues.

Abstract = {{An optical wireless location (OWL) system is introduced for indoor
   positioning. The OWL system makes use of a mobile photoreceiver that
   facilitates triangulation by measuring angle-of-arrival (AOA) bearings
   from LEDs in an optical beacon grid. The photoreceiver has three
   photodiodes (PDs), arranged in a corner-cube, to facilitate differential
   photocurrent sensing of the incident light AOA, by way of azimuthal phi
   and polar theta angles. The AOA error for indoor positioning is
   characterized empirically. Optical AOA positioning is shown to have a
   fundamental advantage over known optical received signal strength (RSS)
   positioning, as AOA estimation is insensitive to power and alignment
   imbalances of the optical beacon grid. The OWL system is built, and a
   performance comparison is carried out between optical AOA and RSS
   positioning. It is shown that optical AOA positioning can achieve a mean
   3-D positioning error of only 5 cm. Experimental design and future
   prospects of optical AOA positioning are discussed. (c) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{Using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we show that
   two-exciton Auger recombination dominates carrier recombination and
   cooling dynamics in CdSe nanoplatelets, or colloidal quantum wells. The
   electron hole recombination rate depends only on the number of electron
   hole pairs present in each nanoplatelet, and is consistent with a
   two-exciton recombination process over a wide range of exciton
   densities. The carrier relaxation rate within the conduction and valence
   bands also depends only on the number of electron hole pairs present,
   apart from an initial rapid decay, and is consistent with the cooling
   rate being limited by reheating due to Auger recombination processes.
   These Auger limited recombination and relaxation dynamics are
   qualitatively different from the carrier dynamics in either colloidal
   quantum dots or epitaxial quantum wells.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Timber Hoist is a common building construction element in North America
   and Europe due to its availability and easiness of passing the service
   conduits and ducts through openings in the Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
   web of I-joists. However, in order to provide passageway for service
   conduits and ducts, cuts and notches in the flange of Hoist are
   frequently made during construction without considering the structural
   integrity of the system. Flange stiffness is very critical as it
   provides the flexural strength to the Hoist, hence it is prohibited to
   cut or notch the Hoist flanges. This study examined ten series of timber
   Hoists with single flange notch at different locations in two span
   lengths (12 and 20 ft) and compared with the uncut Hoists to understand
   the reduction in load capacity, stiffness and failure mechanism of the
   tested Hoists. A total of 100 Hoist specimens, which included uncut and
   flange notched Hoists, were tested in this experimental study. It was
   observed that with the increase in distance of the notch from the
   support, the load carrying capacity of notched Hoists can even decrease
   up to 80\% in comparison with the uncut Hoists. Moreover, the effects of
   notch location and notch size were also investigated, and it was found
   that these notches significantly affect the load carrying capacity of an
   Hoist. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The availability of advanced wireless sensor nodes enable us to use
   video processing techniques in a wireless sensor network (WSN) platform.
   Such paradigm can be used to implement video sensor networks (VSNs) that
   can serve as an alternative to existing video surveillance applications.
   However, video processing requires tremendous resources in terms of
   computation and transmission of the encoded video. As the most widely
   used video codec, H.264/AVC comes with a number of advanced encoding
   tools that can be tailored to suit a wide range of applications.
   Therefore, in order to get an optimal encoding performance for the VSN,
   it is essential to find the right encoding configuration and setting
   parameters for each VSN node based on the content being captured. In
   fact, the environment at which the VSN is deployed affects not only the
   content captured by the VSN node but also the node's performance in
   terms of power consumption and its life-time. The objective of this
   study is to maximize the lifetime of the VSN by exploiting the trade-off
   between encoding and communication on sensor nodes. In order to reduce
   VSNs' power consumption and obtain a more balanced energy consumption
   among VSN nodes, we use a branch and bound optimization techniques on a
   finite set of encoder configuration settings called configuration IDs
   (CIDs) and a fairness-based scheme. In our approach, the bitrate
   allocation in terms of fairness ratio per each node is obtained from the
   training sequences and is used to select appropriate encoder
   configuration settings for the test sequences. We use real life content
   of three different possible scenes of VSNs' implementation with
   different levels of complexity in our study. Performance evaluations
   show that the proposed optimization technique manages to balance VSN's
   power consumption per each node while the nodes' maximum power
   consumption is minimized. We show that by using that approach, the VSN's
   power consumption is reduced by around 7.58\% in average.}},

Abstract = {{The integrity and performance of Pd-based membranes depends heavily on
   the properties of the substrate. This study presents the development of
   a new planar Ni-based porous support for Pd composite membranes. Ni
   powder was mixed with a 0.1 wt\% of Ti and Cu, which have different
   melting temperatures, and was later uniaxially pressed in a metal mold
   to make substrate. The pressed substrates were heat treated at 1223 K in
   a hydrogen environment for 2 h. The pore size and its uniformity were
   determined using a mercury porosimeter. Adding 0.1 wt\% of Ti
   sufficiently prevents sintering of metal and results in a good pore size
   distribution. With the aid of a pretreatment, i.e., polishing, etching
   and alumina coating, and electroless plating, a 9.3-mu m-thick Pd
   membrane could be fabricated on the Ni-Ti substrate, exhibiting a H-2
   permeation flux of similar to 0.1445 mol m(-2) s(-1) with selectivity
   (H-2/He) of similar to 1600 at 723 K and a pressure difference of 100

Journal = {{3D RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Increasing the frame rate of a 3D video generally results in improved
   Quality of Experience (QoE). However, higher frame rates involve a
   higher degree of complexity in capturing, transmission, storage, and
   display. The question that arises here is what frame rate guarantees
   high viewing quality of experience given the existing/required 3D
   devices and technologies (3D cameras, 3D TVs, compression, transmission
   bandwidth, and storage capacity). This question has already been
   addressed for the case of 2D video, but not for 3D. The objective of
   this paper is to study the relationship between 3D quality and bitrate
   at different frame rates. Our performance evaluations show that
   increasing the frame rate of 3D videos beyond 60 fps may not be visually
   distinguishable. In addition, our experiments show that when the
   available bandwidth is reduced, the highest possible 3D quality of
   experience can be achieved by adjusting (decreasing) the frame rate
   instead of increasing the compression ratio. The results of our study
   are of particular interest to network providers for rate adaptation in
   variable bitrate channels.}},

Abstract = {{Today, cyber physical systems (CPS) are becoming popular in power
   networks, healthcare devices, transportation networks, industrial
   process and infrastructures. As cyber physical systems are used more and
   more extensively and thoroughly, security of cyber physical systems has
   become the utmost important concern in system design, implementation and
   research. Many kinds of attacks arise (e.g. the Stuxnet worm), causing
   heavy losses and serious potential security risks. For the past few
   years, researchers are focusing their researches on different aspects of
   security of cyber physical systems. In this paper, we propose a security
   framework assuring the security of cyber physical systems and analyze
   main universities and institutes studying CPS security and their
   relations in three levels: CPS security objectives, CPS security
   approaches and security in specific CPS applications. Finally, a
   conclusion of this article is given.}},

Abstract = {{A centrifugal particle mass analyzer and a modified differential
   mobility spectrometer were used to measure the mass and mobility of
   particulate matter emitted by CFM56-5B4/2P, CFM56-7B26/3, and PW4000-100
   gas turbine engine sources. The mass-mobility exponent of the
   particulate matter from the CFM56-5B4/2P engine ranged from 2.68 to
   2.82, whereas the effective particle densities varied from 600 to 1250
   kg/m(3), depending on the static engine thrust and sampling methodology
   used. The effective particle densities from the CFM56-7B26/3 and
   PW4000-100 engines also fell within this range. The sample was
   conditioned with or without a catalytic stripper and with or without
   dilution, which caused the effective density to change, indicating the
   presence of condensed semivolatile material on the particles.
   Variability of the determined effective densities across different
   engine thrusts, based on the scattering about the line of best fit, was
   lowest for the diluted samples and highest for the undiluted sample
   without a catalytic stripper. This variability indicates that the
   relative amount of semivolatile material produced was engine thrust
   dependent. It was found that the nonvolatile particulate matter,
   effective particle density (in kilograms per cubic meter) of the
   CFM56-5B4/2P engine at relative thrusts below 30\% could be approximated
   using the particle mobility diameter (d(me) in meters) with
   11.92d(me)((2.76-3)).}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effects of weather on harvested moisture content (MC)
   of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and energy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor),
   tracking of harvest progress on individual fields in the Integrated
   Biomass Supply and Logistics (IBSAL) model was modified to allow: i)
   rewetting of swathed material in the drying formulae; and ii) field
   queuing rules based on equipment availability and weather. Estimated
   crop yield and initial MC by harvest date, as observed in field trials,
   along with the modeling of different delays between mowing and harvest
   allowed estimation of harvested MC, annual tonnage processed and
   associated processing cost differences by crop and location over 10
   years. Extending the hours of annual equipment use had minor
   implications on cost of production. Energy sorghum proved difficult to
   dry in the field. Its higher yield, leading to shorter supply distance
   to the plant, may justify harvesting of energy sorghum early in the
   season with drier weather. Later harvest for lower-yielding switchgrass
   offers MC advantages.}},

Abstract = {{Creating multicellular tumor spheroids is critical for characterizing
   anticancer treatments since they may provide a better model of the tumor
   than conventional monolayer culture. Moreover, tumor cell interaction
   with the extracellular matrix can determine cell organization and
   behavior. In this work, a microfluidic system was used to form
   cell-laden core-shell beads which incorporate elements of the
   extracellular matrix and support the formation of multicellular
   spheroids. The bead core (comprising a mixture of alginate, collagen,
   and reconstituted basement membrane, with gelation by temperature
   control) and shell (comprising alginate hydrogel, with gelation by ionic
   crosslinking) were simultaneously formed through flow focusing using a
   cooled flow path into the microfluidic chip. During droplet gelation,
   the alginate acts as a fast-gelling shell which aids in preventing
   droplet coalescence and in maintaining spherical droplet geometry during
   the slower gelation of the collagen and reconstituted basement membrane
   components as the beads warm up. After droplet gelation, the
   encapsulated MCF-7 cells proliferated to form uniform spheroids when the
   beads contained all three components: alginate, collagen, and
   reconstituted basement membrane. The dose-dependent response of the
   MCF-7 cell tumor spheroids to two anticancer drugs, docetaxel and
   tamoxifen, was compared to conventional monolayer culture. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{In this study, the kinetics of selenium and tellurium reduction by
   cuprous ions were reviewed and a comprehensive model capable of
   predicting the rate constants for various Cu+2-H2SO4 compositions and
   temperatures is presented. The rate constant data were fitted to the
   relationship: In k(1) = (A+B/T) + (C + D x In {[}H2SO4]) + (E +
   F({[}Cu2+](0.5)/1+{[}Cu2+](0.5)) where k(1) is in M(-1)s(-1) and
   {[}Cu2+] and H2SO4 are in molar at temperature T (K), and A to F are
   empirical constants. The model was validated using different rate
   constant data points obtained during the reduction of Se-VI and Te-VI
   under different solution conditions. The rate constant k(1) given by the
   comprehensive model was within a +/- 3.3\% for Se-VI and +/- 5.1\% for
   Te-VI reduction reactions compared to the rate constant determined using
   the experimental data. The model was used to estimate the selenium and
   tellurium reduction reaction times under Vale's (Sudbury, Canada)
   Electrowinning Department (ED) plant conditions. As a result, potential
   factors that may affect the selenium and tellurium removal rate at the
   ED plant of Vale were proposed and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{The performance of Pb-MnO2 and Pb-Ag anodes in 2 Mn(II)-containing
   sulphuric acid electrolyte solutions}},

Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{134-144}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, electrochemical performances of the Pb-MnO2 composite
   anodes in sulphuric acid electrolyte containing different manganese
   concentrations were investigated. The anodic electrodeposited MnO2
   layers on the composite anodes were studied and their properties were
   compared with those of an industrial Pb-Ag anode. The electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiostatic polarizations were
   accompanied by chemical analysis of the electrolyte to investigate the
   Mn(II) oxidation and oxygen evolution rates on the fresh anodes. The
   long term effect of the deposited MnO2 on the electrocatalytic
   properties of the anodes was studied by galvanostatic polarizations. The
   results revealed that the Pb-MnO2 anodes operate at lower potentials
   than the Pb-Ag anodes in a Mn-free electrolyte, indicating higher
   electrocatalydc activity of the composite anode. The Mn(II) ``oxidation
   proceeded at different rates on the Pb-Ag and Pb-MnO2 anodes. The oxygen
   evolution reaction was depolarized in the presence of Mn(II) ions.
   However, formation of the MnO2 layers might lead to higher anodic
   potentials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectrometer (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to
   characterize the deposited MnO2 layers and also the corrosion product
   layers on the anodes. The MnO2 layers on the anodes were found to have
   different properties. While MnO2 layers on the composite anodes were
   uniform, compact and adhesive, the deposited layers on the Pb-Ag anodes
   were flaky, porous, and loosely adhered. These layers provided the
   anodes with different degree of protection against electrochemical
   oxidation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A powerful alternative means to study the hemodynamics of bileaflet
   mechanical heart valves is the computational fluid dynamics method. It
   is well recognized that computational fluid dynamics allows reliable
   physiological blood flow simulation and measurements of flow parameters.
   To date, in almost all of the modeling studies on the hemodynamics of
   bileaflet mechanical heart valves, a velocity (mass flow)-based boundary
   condition and an axisymmetric geometry for the aortic root have been
   assigned, which, to some extent, are erroneous. Also, there have been
   contradictory reports of the profile of velocity in downstream of
   leaflets, that is, in some studies, it is suggested that the maximum
   blood velocity occurs in the lateral orifice, and in some other studies,
   it is postulated that the maximum velocities in the main and lateral
   orifices are identical. The reported values for the peak velocities
   range from 1 to 3m/s, which highly depend on the model assumptions. The
   objective of this study is to demonstrate the importance of the exact
   anatomical model of the aortic root and the realistic boundary
   conditions in the hemodynamics of the bileaflet mechanical heart valves.
   The model considered in this study is based on the St Jude Medical valve
   in a novel modeling platform. Through a more realistic geometrical model
   for the aortic root and the St Jude Medical valve, we have developed a
   new set of boundary conditions in order to be used for the assessment of
   the hemodynamics of aortic bileaflet mechanical heart valves. The
   results of this study are significant for the design improvement of
   conventional bileaflet mechanical heart valves and for the design of the
   next generation of prosthetic valves.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Closeness centrality (CC) measure, as a well-known global measure, is
   widely applied in many complex networks. However, the classical CC
   presents many problems for flow networks since these networks are
   directed and weighted. To address these issues, we propose an effective
   distance based closeness centrality (EDCC), which uses effective
   distance to replace conventional geographic distance and binary distance
   obtained by Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The proposed EDCC
   considers not only the global structure of the network but also the
   local information of nodes. And it can be well applied in directed or
   undirected, weighted or unweighted networks. Susceptible-Infected model
   is utilized to evaluate the performance by using the spreading rate and
   the number of infected nodes. Numerical examples simulated on four real
   networks are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed EDCC. (C)

Abstract = {{With the development of 5G, the wireless world will be interconnected
   without barriers. This new technology will enable many challenging
   applications, and more personalized and interactive services are
   expected to be available with resource-limited mobile terminals.
   Fortunately, mobile cloud computing (MCC) emerging in the context of 5G
   has the potential to overcome this bottleneck, which enables many
   resource-intensive services for mobile users with the support of mobile
   big data delivery and cloud-assisted computing. In this article we
   propose a novel framework named EMC in the context of 5G, which offers
   personalized emotion-aware services by MCC and affective computing. With
   the proposed framework, the traditional MCC architecture is modified to
   achieve the required Quality of Experience in emotion-aware
   applications. Furthermore, we design a partitioning solution
   corresponding to the fundamental trade-off between the communication and
   computation in EMC. The framework would be helpful to provide
   personalized, human-centric, intelligent emotion-aware services in 5G.}},

   L-1 H2SO4 + 12 g L-1 Cl-solution at 150 degrees C measured by mass loss
   was higher than 62 mm y(-1). The corrosion rates of titanium under
   simulated pressure-leaching conditions determined by both mass loss and
   polarization resistance measurements were consistent, and also suggest
   that Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions are excellent corrosion inhibitors for titanium.
   Results from mass loss and electrochemical measurements all confirmed
   that the corrosion rate of titanium decreased remarkably with the
   addition of 1 g L-1 Fe3+ to the leaching solution at 150 degrees C, and
   that the presence of Fe3+ is the most important factor for the growth of
   titanium oxide films under pressure-leaching conditions. In addition,
   iso-corrosion diagrams, with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm y(-1) lines for titanium
   in H2SO4 solutions from room temperature to 175 degrees C, were
   constructed from mass loss data.}},

Abstract = {{As two major players in terrestrial wireless communications, Wi-Fi
   systems and cellular networks have different origins and have largely
   evolved separately. Motivated by the exponentially increasing wireless
   data demand, cellular networks are evolving towards a heterogeneous and
   small cell network architecture, wherein small cells are expected to
   provide very high capacity. However, due to the limited licensed
   spectrum for cellular networks, any effort to achieve capacity growth
   through network densification will face the challenge of severe
   inter-cell interference. In view of this, recent standardization
   developments have started to consider the opportunities for cellular
   networks to use the unlicensed spectrum bands, including the 2.4 GHz and
   5 GHz bands that are currently used by Wi-Fi, Zigbee and some other
   communication systems. In this article, we look into the coexistence of
   Wi-Fi and 4G cellular networks sharing the unlicensed spectrum. We
   introduce a network architecture where small cells use the same
   unlicensed spectrum that Wi-Fi systems operate in without affecting the
   performance of Wi-Fi systems. We present an almost blank sub-frame (ABS)
   scheme without priority to mitigate the co-channel interference from
   small cells to Wi-Fi systems, and propose an interference avoidance
   scheme based on small cells estimating the density of nearby Wi-Fi
   access points to facilitate their coexistence while sharing the same
   unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed network
   architecture and interference avoidance schemes can significantly
   increase the capacity of 4G heterogeneous cellular networks while
   maintaining the service quality of Wi-Fi systems.}},

Abstract = {{In existing wireless networks, supporting multimedia services are
   becoming more popular and important. In general, wireless multimedia
   networks should require energy efficiency and reliable transmission
   while keeping satisfactory quality of services. In this respect,
   cooperative communications have been considered as an efficient approach
   to address these demands by offering significant diversity gains over
   single-antenna systems without increasing requirements on radio
   resources. In this paper, we propose a power-allocation method to
   optimize the decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative transmission for source
   and relay nodes as ameans to reduce the total power consumption, while
   maintaining the required quality of services, and investigate
   fundamental characteristics of cooperative transmission in terms of
   power efficiency. Moreover, for a network with multiple cooperative
   nodes, we also propose an energy-efficient relay selection rule to offer
   fairness at each node and implement it into a practical routing
   protocol. Our performance analysis is supplemented by simulation results
   to illustrate significant energy savings of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider bidirectional relay networks in which two
   users exchange information only via a relay node, i.e., a direct link
   between both users is not present. We assume that channel state
   information at the transmitter is not available and/or only one coding
   and modulation scheme is used due to complexity constraints. Thus, the
   nodes transmit with a fixed predefined rate regardless of the channel
   state. In general, the nodes in the network can assume one of three
   possible states in each time slot, namely, the transmit, the receive,
   and the silent state. Most of the existing bidirectional relaying
   protocols assume a prefixed schedule for the sequence in which the
   states of the nodes are used. In this paper, we abandon the restriction
   of having a fixed and predefined schedule and consider the selection of
   the states of the nodes as a degree of freedom that can be exploited for
   performance optimization. To this end, the relay has to be equipped with
   two buffers for storage of the information received from the two users.
   In Part I of this paper, we propose a delay-unconstrained protocol that,
   based on the qualities of the involved links, selects the optimal states
   of the nodes in each time slot such that the sum throughput is
   maximized. In Part II, several delay-constrained protocols are proposed
   and analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed protocols
   significantly outperform the existing bidirectional relaying protocols
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second part of a two-part paper considering bidirectional
   relay networks with half-duplex nodes and block fading where the nodes
   transmit with a fixed transmission rate. In Part I, it was shown that a
   considerable gain in terms of sum throughput can be obtained by
   optimally selecting the transmission modes or, equivalently, the states
   of the nodes, i.e., the transmit, the receive, and the silent states,
   based on the qualities of the involved links. To enable adaptive
   transmission mode selection, the relay has to be equipped with two
   buffers for storage of the data received from the two users. The
   protocol proposed in Part I was delay unconstrained and provides an
   upper bound for the performance of practical delay-constrained
   protocols. In this paper, we propose two heuristic but efficient
   delay-constrained protocols, which can approach the performance upper
   bound reported in Part I, even in cases where only a small delay is
   permitted. The proposed protocols not only consider the instantaneous
   qualities of the involved links for adaptive mode selection but also
   take the states of the queues at the buffers into account, i.e., the
   number of packets in the queues. The average throughput and the average
   delay of the proposed delay-constrained protocols are evaluated by
   analyzing the Markov chain of the states of the queues. Numerical
   results show that the proposed protocols outperform existing
   bidirectional relaying protocols for delay-constrained transmission.}},

Abstract = {{To support the surge in wireless data traffic, the spectrum and energy
   efficiencies of cellular networks should be largely increased.
   Heterogeneous two-tier architecture has been identified as one key
   solution. However, small-cell deployment raises questions about the
   resulting energy efficiency and interference mitigation. Therefore, we
   propose an energy-efficient and cognitive spectrum sharing scheme
   between primary macrocell and secondary small cells. Specifically, the
   small cells allocate their transmission power to maximize their total
   energy efficiency while respecting some interference constraints imposed
   by macrocell users. We solve this centralized optimization in two steps.
   First, assuming that the small-cell transmissions are noninterfering,
   the solution of this nonconvex optimization is characterized using a
   convex parametric approach. Using this characterization, we derive an
   algorithm based on Newton method, which converges to a global optimal
   solution. Second, when the small-cell transmissions are not necessarily
   orthogonal, we derive an algorithm, which converges at least to a local
   optimum, using the minorization-maximization principle and Newton
   method. Through simulations, we validate the convergence of these
   algorithms and compare their performance with existing schemes. We also
   analyze the effects of the interference and of the number of users on
   the energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the cell association problem in the downlink of a
   multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), where base stations (BSs)
   have finite number of resource blocks (RBs) available to distribute
   among their associated users. Two problems are defined and treated in
   this paper: sum utility of long term rate maximization with long term
   rate quality of service (QoS) constraints and global outage probability
   minimization with outage QoS constraints. The first problem is
   well-suited for slow fading environments, while the second problem
   provides a framework to deal with environments with fast fading. The
   defined optimization problems in this paper are solved in two phases:
   cell association phase followed by the optional RB distribution phase.
   We show that the cell association phase of both problems have the same
   structure. Based on this similarity, we propose a unified distributed
   algorithm with low levels of message passing for the cell association
   phase. This distributed algorithm is derived by relaxing the association
   constraints and using Lagrange dual decomposition method. In the RB
   distribution phase, the remaining RBs after the cell association phase
   are distributed among the users. Simulation results show that our
   distributed cell association scheme outperforms schemes that are based
   on maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR).}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of different coordinate system definitions for the
   patella leads to difficulties in comparing kinematic results between
   studies. The purpose of this work was to establish the effect of using a
   range of coordinate system definitions to quantify patellar kinematics.
   Additionally, intra- and inter-investigator repeatabilides of the
   digitization of anatomic landmarks on the patella were determined.
   Methods: Four different patellar coordinate system definitions were
   applied using digitisations in two and three dimensions and a single
   femoral coordinate system was used for comparison. Intra-investigator
   variability was established by having one investigator digitize the
   patellar landmarks of three subjects on five separate occasions.
   Inter-investigator variability was quantified by having five
   participants digitize the same landmarks on the same three subjects.
   Patellofemoral kinematics were quantified for ten subjects, at six
   angles of tibiofemoral flexion, using MRI.
   Results: As a result of changes in the patellar coordinate system,
   differences of up to 11.5 degrees in flexion, 5.0 degrees in spin, and
   27.3 degrees in tilt were observed in the resultant rotations for the
   same motion, illustrating the importance of standardizing the coordinate
   system definition.
   Conclusions: To minimize errors due to variability while still
   maintaining physiologically sensible kinematic angles, a coordinate
   system based upon an intermediate flexion axis between the most medial
   and lateral points on the patella, and a superiorly-directed long axis
   located between the most proximal and distal points on the patella, with
   an origin at the centre of the most proximal, distal, medial, and
   lateral points on the patella is recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) is a technique to assess the
   potential social impacts of a product or service caused by its life
   cycle. The aim of this paper is to critically review the methodologies
   applied in S-LCIA and establish its current development status by
   highlighting areas for improvement. The UNEP/SETAC Guidelines published
   in 2009 provided general procedures for conducting S-LCA, but lack
   S-LCIA methods. Many new S-LCIA methods have been proposed but these are
   inherently different, indicating a scientific and well-accepted S-LCIA
   method is yet to be developed. Broadly, two types of S-LCIA methods,
   i.e. performance reference point and impact pathways methods are in use.
   A direction for future research could be the refinement of the social
   hotspots database and the social hotspot index calculation method.
   Moreover, the S-LCIA method could be developed by combining the
   performance reference point and impact pathways methods.}},

Abstract = {{Wood chips, torrefied wood chips, ground switchgrass, and wood pellets
   were tested for off-gas emissions during storage. Storage canisters with
   gas-collection ports were used to conduct experiments at room
   temperature of 20 degrees C and in a laboratory oven set at 40 degrees
   C. Commercially-produced wood pellets yielded the highest carbon
   monoxide (CO) emissions at both 20 and 40 degrees C (1600 and 13,000
   ppmv), whereas torrefied wood chips emitted the lowest of about <200 and
   <2000 ppmv. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wood pellets were 3000
   ppmv and 42,000 ppmv, whereas torrefied wood chips registered at about
   2000 and 25,000 ppmv, at 20 and 40 degrees C at the end of 11 days of
   storage. CO emission factors (milligrams per kilogram of biomass)
   calculated were lowest for ground switchgrass and torrefied wood chips
   (2.68 and 4.86 mg/kg) whereas wood pellets had the highest CO of about
   10.60 mg/kg, respectively, at 40 degrees C after 11 days of storage. In
   the case of CO2, wood pellets recorded the lowest value of 55.46 mg/kg,
   whereas switchgrass recorded the highest value of 318.72 mg/kg. This
   study concludes that CO emission factor is highest for wood pellets, CO2
   is highest for switchgrass and CH4 is negligible for all feedstocks
   except for wood pellets, which is about 0.374 mg/kg at the end of 11-day
   storage at 40 degrees C.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Significant economic advantage can be achieved by grading logs at the
   inlet of a sawmill so that they can be optimally processed to
   manufacture the highest possible value products from the available raw
   material. Computed Tomography (CT) scanning is of particular interest
   because it can identify the locations and sizes of internal
   quality-controlling features such as knots, heartwood/sapwood boundary,
   rot, splits and holes. Conventional CT scanning is based on
   medical-style equipment, which sets very high requirements on the
   measurement resolution and accuracy. This substantially increases the
   equipment complexity and cost, thus presenting substantial challenges
   for sawmill applications. Using an alternative approach, the authors
   have proposed the use of geometry-based CT log models. The research in
   this paper extends the previous work to include the use of cone-beam
   scanning geometry, area-based measurement and multi-slice density
   reconstruction. Experimental measurements are presented and demonstrate
   good correspondence with the results from single-slice scanning and
   conventional filtered-back-projection results.}},

Abstract = {{This article evaluates the potential gains a workflow-aware storage
   system can bring. Two observations make us believe such storage system
   is crucial to efficiently support workflow-based applications: First,
   workflows generate irregular and application-dependent data access
   patterns. These patterns render existing generic storage systems unable
   to harness all optimization opportunities as this often requires
   enabling conflicting optimizations or even conflicting design decisions
   at the storage system level. Second, most workflow runtime engines make
   suboptimal scheduling decisions as they lack the detailed data location
   information that is generally hidden by the storage system. This paper
   presents a limit study that evaluates the potential gains from building
   a workflow-aware storage system that supports per-file access
   optimizations and exposes data location. Our evaluation using synthetic
   benchmarks and real applications shows that a workflow-aware storage
   system can bring significant performance gains: up to 3x performance
   gains compared to a vanilla distributed storage system deployed on the
   same resources yet unaware of the possible file-level optimizations.}},

Abstract = {{Different architectures for vibration-based linear electromagnetic
   energy harvesters (EMEHs) have been developed and reported in the
   literature for applications in autonomous wireless sensor nodes. In the
   majority of the linear EMEHs the magnetic field over the coil is
   nonuniform. This paper presents the modeling and simulation for the
   electromechanical transduction of linear EMEHs with a nonuniform
   magnetic field configuration excited by harmonic vibrations. Models are
   developed based on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and the
   Lorentz force law. For a more accurate prediction of the performance of
   the EMEHs where the entire coil does not experience the same gradient of
   the normal component of the magnetic flux density, the analytical
   solution of the off-center magnetic flux density for a square magnet is
   used. The simulation results of the developed models show good agreement
   with the experimental results. Simulations of our previously developed
   EMEH show an improvement of load voltage and the power when the gap
   between the magnet and the coil is optimized. Moreover, maximizing the
   number of turns of the coil for the optimized gap, simulations of the
   optimized device predict a load voltage amplitude (90.2 mV) almost twice
   and a load power (40.7 mu W) almost four times the experimental results
   obtained for the current prototype.}},

   effectively used to tune the parameters of a controller to ensure its
   stability, a key design aspect related to the safety of the overall

Abstract = {{In this paper, the flow-induced crystallization (FIC) behavior of
   various polypropylenes with different molecular characteristics was
   investigated using a capillary rheometer. The Cogswell analysis was
   applied on the capillary data to obtain the apparent extensional strain
   rate and strain as well as the apparent extensional viscosity. The
   extensional viscosity obtained using this method was in good agreement
   with the zero shear viscosity obtained using a cone-and-plate rotational
   rheometer (Anton Paar MCR-502). Extensional flow parameters did not
   influence crystallization kinetics in the capillary die. FIC was found
   to depend strongly on the length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of the
   capillary die that is directly related to the residence time. It was
   also found that the crystallization kinetics were enhanced with
   increasing molecular weight, indicating the importance of high-end tail
   of molecular weight distribution (MWD) on FIC. Finally, temperature
   impacted the FIC behavior significantly since it alters the activation
   energy needed for the formation of macroscopic structures.}},

Title = {{Micro-PIV Measurement of Flow Upstream of Papermaking Forming Fabrics}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},

Pages = {{435-448}},

Abstract = {{In the flow through porous media such as screens the structure of the
   screen affects the upstream flow field. This is relevant for filtration
   and deposition processes where the local filtrate deposition rate
   depends on the upstream flow field, while deposition also alters this
   flow field over time. Here, we investigate the flow through forming
   fabrics that retain pulp fibers during the papermaking process, while
   the liquid phase passes through. The associated drainage velocity
   through the fabric has a significant impact on the quality of the
   finished product. Microparticle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) was used
   to measure the drainage velocity distribution upstream of two different
   fabrics. To make measurements at the scale of the forming fabric
   filaments, an experimental micro-PIV procedure was developed to permit
   velocity measurements several millimeters into the fluid stream with a
   depth of correlation of 28 mu m and an in-plane resolution of 40 mu m x
   40 mu m. For the single phase flow of water, the experiments show the
   existence of a highly variable drainage velocity field upstream of both
   fabrics. The normalized standard deviation (NSD) of the velocity fields
   decays exponentially with distance upstream of the fabric. The decay
   constant is on the order of one filament diameter at moderate Reynolds
   numbers (Re = 52-140). At a constant freestream velocity, the deposition
   of a small number of wood fibers onto a fabric results in a higher NSD
   than that of the bare fabric. This is believed to be due to partial
   obstruction of some holes in the fabric, which leads to higher
   velocities through unobstructed holes. Once about 5 g per square meter
   of fiber has been deposited onto the fabric, the velocity field above
   the fabric with adhering fiber mat becomes uncorrelated with the
   velocity field through the bare fabric.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a high-efficiency 60-GHz on-off keying (OOK)
   demodulator for high-speed short-range wireless communications such as
   wireless network-on-chip (WiNoC) applications. Targeting at data rates
   of beyond 16 Gb/s, the OOK demodulator consists of a wideband envelope
   detector (ED) and a single-stage baseband (BB) peaking amplifier. Novel
   dual gain-boosting techniques improve the gain, bandwidth, and
   out-of-band rejection of the ED. In addition, an actively-enhanced
   tunable inductor (AETI) load in the BB amplifier not only significantly
   reduces its area overhead, but also provides a tunable peaking level.
   Fabricated in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process, the OOK demodulator consumes
   only 4.6 mW from a 1-V supply, and occupies an active area of 0.043
   mm(2). A maximum data rate of 18.7 Gb/s with a bit-error rate less than
   is demonstrated through measurements, which translates to a bit-energy
   efficiency of 0.25 pJ/bit.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology
   scaling is causing significant concerns in the reliability of computer
   systems. Intermittent hardware errors are non-deterministic bursts of
   errors that occur in the same physical location. Recent studies have
   found that 40\% of the processor failures in real-world machines are due
   to intermittent hardware errors. A study of the effects of intermittent
   faults on programs is a critical step in building fault-tolerance
   techniques of reasonable accuracy and cost. In this work, we
   characterize the impact of intermittent hardware faults in programs
   using fault-injection campaigns in a microarchitectural processor
   simulator. We find that 80\% of the non-benign intermittent hardware
   errors activate a hardware trap in the processor, and the remaining 20\%
   cause silent data corruptions. We have also investigated the possibility
   of using the program state at failure time in software-based diagnosis
   techniques, and found that much of the erroneous data are intact and can
   be used to identify the source of the error.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the price competition among electric vehicle
   charging stations (EVCSs) with renewable power generators (RPGs). As
   electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, a competition among EVCSs
   to attract EVs is inevitable. Thereby, each EVCS sets its electricity
   price to maximize its revenue by taking into account the competition
   with neighboring EVCSs. We analyze the competitive interactions between
   EVCSs using game theory, where relevant physical constraints such as the
   transmission line capacity, the distance between EV and EVCS, and the
   number of charging outlets at the EVCSs are taken into account. We show
   that the game played by EVCSs is a supermodular game and there exists a
   unique pure Nash equilibrium for best response algorithms with arbitrary
   initial policy. The electricity price and the revenue of EVCSs are
   evaluated via simulations, which reveal the benefits of having RPGs at
   the EVCSs.}},

Abstract = {{To increase the reliability of the power grid and reduce the risk of
   power supply failure, demand-side management (DSM) is of central
   importance. In this paper, a nonparametric test is applied to detect if
   the demand behavior of consumers is consistent with time-of-day
   electricity tariff initiatives. The test is based on Afriat's theorem in
   economics and has the unique feature that it provides necessary and
   sufficient conditions to detect if the price-demand behavior is
   consistent with utility maximization (i.e., the test detects
   demand-responsive consumers) without prior knowledge of the consumer's
   utility function. For consumers that are responsive to time-of-day
   pricing initiatives, a nonparametric learning algorithm is used to
   forecast power demands for unobserved electricity tariffs. The
   nonparametric learning algorithm can be used in anticipatory control
   structures in a DSM framework to achieve power usage objectives.
   Real-world data from Ontario's power system and numerical examples
   illustrate the accuracy of the nonparametric test and nonparametric

Abstract = {{The development of techniques for manipulating particles and integrating
   them into the digital microfluidic (DMF) devices has been the subject of
   several studies in recent years. This paper presents a
   dielectrophoretic-based method that uses triangular traps to manipulate
   particles and purify a droplet in DMF platforms. Numerical and
   experimental studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed trap geometry which is also compatible with the other operators
   in the DMF platform. The triangular trap geometry is used to move the
   polystyrene particles to one side of the trap using negative
   dielectrophoresis (nDEP). The droplet is then split into two smaller
   droplets with very low and high concentrations of particles using the
   electrowetting on dielectric technique. The average velocity of the
   particles (as they move along the trap) as a function of the vertex
   angle of the triangular trap and the gap between the top and bottom
   plate is examined. It is observed that the vertex angle of the trap
   plays more important role on the motion of the particles than the gap.
   Thus, to enhance the motion of the particles and minimize the effect of
   splitting on the purification process, the vertex angle and the slope of
   the side arms of the triangular trap are modified based on the results
   of the numerical model simulating the dielectrophoretic force on the
   particle. The enhanced geometry is fabricated and tested experimentally
   to show the effectiveness and ease-of-use of the proposed technique in
   purifying (or concentrating) a droplet in DMF. The results show that
   using the proposed nDEP electrode geometry purification (or
   concentration) can be performed with the efficiency of 90 \%.}},

   This paper describes the investigation of the damage to buildings in
   quake-hit areas. By comparison with ``5.12{''} Wenchuan earthquake that
   occurred in the same region 5 years ago, the damage modes of the
   buildings have been analyzed. Public buildings, most of which were
   reconstructed after the Wenchuan earthquake, exhibited a good
   performance in regard to the main structures. However, severe damages
   were identified from non-structural elements. The performance of frame
   structures supported on rubber isolators was examined, and very few
   cracks from the infilled walls were observed, unlike the other frame
   structures. Rural housing suffered extensive damage during this
   earthquake, due to inadequate structural systems for horizontal-force
   resistance, lack of construction supervision, and insufficient ground
   treatment, all of which lead to the tragic destruction. Conclusions were
   given by presenting several suggestions to enhance the seismic behavior
   of rural housing.}},

Abstract = {{Recent boom of mobile applications has become a novel essential
   characteristic in wireless sensor networks. However, existing MAC
   protocols mainly focus on static network. To support mobility, some MAC
   protocols expedite or adjust the schedule frequency of neighbor
   discovery but suffer from increased latency and energy consumption since
   they are not adaptive in time. In this paper, we propose a
   mobile-supporting MAC protocols that the decision to update neighbors of
   the mobile node is made adaptively in advance. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the mechanism is efficient to avoid disconnection from
   mobile node to its neighbors and performs better in terms of main
   performance parameters: energy efficiency, delay and packet loss
   compared with the S-MAC, M-MAC and MS-MAC that are popular MAC protocols
   used in scenarios involving mobile nodes.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The effect of steam explosion pretreatment on the physical and
   mechanical properties of the pellets made from empty fruit bunch (EFB)
   and palm kernel shell (PKS) was investigated and compared to that of
   softwood Douglas fir (DF). It was found that the high heating value of
   the empty fruit bunch was increased by 21\% after steam explosion
   pretreatment. The pellet density of EFB and Douglas fir pellets did not
   change while the pellet density of PKS increased from 1.13 to 1.21
   g/cm(3) after steam explosion. That may be attributed to the rapid
   volatilization of high mass fraction extractives during high pressure
   steaming and lead to the shrinkage of micropores of the PKS fibers. The
   maximum brealdng strength of steam exploded EFB and PKS were increased
   by 63\% and 45\%, respectively. The required compaction energy for the
   steam exploded EFB pellet is 44.50 J/g while that of the untreated EFB
   pellet is 30.15 J/g. Similar to Douglas fir, the required extrusion
   energy for the steam exploded EFB pellet was about 6 times than that of
   the untreated EFB pellet. The increased extrusion energy is mainly
   contributed by the increase in mono-saccharides by auto-hydrolysis
   during steam explosion pretreatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The dynamic characteristics of a structure are commonly defined by its
   modal properties: modal frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes.
   Significant changes in modal properties of a structure after an extreme
   event, such as an earthquake, or during its service life can be strongly
   related to damage in the structures. This makes it crucial that the
   modal properties are accurately estimated and continuously tracked to
   detect any changes by the structural health monitoring (SHM) system.
   This paper introduces an algorithm and a MATLAB-based software that
   includes modules for real-time data processing, modal identification,
   damage detection, and stakeholder warnings for vibration-based SHM
   systems. The data processing and modal identification techniques used
   are based on the classical and stochastic techniques, and utilize
   running time windows to keep track of time variations in real-time data.
   The damage detection algorithm makes use of inter-story drifts to detect
   and locate damage. Since the calculation of inter-story drifts involves
   double integration and subtraction of acceleration signals, it is
   extremely hard to get accurate values of inter-story drifts in real-time
   monitoring. To improve the accuracy, inter-story drifts are calculated
   for each mode of the structure separately, and then combined
   synchronously. The displacements at non-instrumented floors are
   estimated by assuming that the mode shapes can be approximated as a
   linear combination of those of a shear beam and a bending beam. A
   software package, REC\_MIDS, is developed for this purpose, and it has
   been operating in a large number of different structures with SHM
   systems in Turkey (tall buildings, suspension bridges, mosques,
   museums), and in seven high-rise buildings in UAE.}},

Abstract = {{A 0.25m(3) laboratory repulper was built for the purpose of determining
   which variables (pulp type, rotor tip speed, pulp suspension
   temperature, rotor design, rotor to extraction plate clearance, power to
   vat volume ratio, and pulp suspension consistency) affect the specific
   energy (kW-h/ton) required for repulping. Scale replicas of 3 commercial
   repulper rotors were constructed to test the effect of rotor geometry on
   repulping specific energy. The pulp types used included kraft aspen,
   C-flute corrugated cardboard, office printing paper, and unbleached
   paper towel. The energy required for repulping was found to vary with
   pulp type, temperature, consistency, and rotor design. It was found that
   a given material at a given temperature and consistency requires a
   unique quantity of energy to be repulped independent of the rate of
   energy addition. It was also found that repulper rotors show Reynolds
   independence at rotor tip speeds greater than 12m/s. It was found that
   the specific energy consumption in a 0.25m(3) laboratory repulper was

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop a fast algorithm for computing myelin maps from
   multiecho T-2 relaxation data using parallel computation with multicore
   CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs).
   Materials and MethodsUsing an existing MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA)
   implementation with basic (nonalgorithm-specific) parallelism as a
   guide, we developed a new version to perform the same computations but
   using C++ to optimize the hybrid utilization of multicore CPUs and GPUs,
   based on experimentation to determine which algorithmic components would
   benefit from CPU versus GPU parallelization. Using 32-echo T-2 data of
   dimensions 256 x 256 x 7 from 17 multiple sclerosis patients and 18
   healthy subjects, we compared the two methods in terms of speed, myelin
   values, and the ability to distinguish between the two patient groups
   using Student's t-tests.
   ResultsThe new method was faster than the MATLAB implementation by 4.13
   times for computing a single map and 14.36 times for batch-processing 10
   scans. The two methods produced very similar myelin values, with small
   and explainable differences that did not impact the ability to
   distinguish the two patient groups.
   ConclusionThe proposed hybrid multicore approach represents a more
   efficient alternative to MATLAB, especially for large-scale batch
   processing. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:700-707. (c) 2014 Wiley

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Alkyl amines are widely used as cationic collectors in froth flotation.
   They are generally referred to as weak electrolyte collectors and
   frequently form solid insoluble precipitates. Much work has been done to
   measure the interfacial tension and contact angle regarding alkyl amine
   collectors. However, the role of these colloidal precipitates in
   adsorption phenomena and the kinetics involved in the adsorption have
   not been systematically studied and decoupled from those of soluble
   species in flotation. Using dodecyl amine (DDA) as the model surfactant,
   four sets of intimately linked measurements were made on the dynamic
   surface tension of amine true solutions and solutions containing
   precipitates to demonstrate the difference in the surface activity
   kinetics of colloidal precipitates and soluble species. The effects of
   the interfacial kinetics on the bubble size in a two-phase system and on
   the contact angle in a three-phase system were also studied to
   understand the migration of precipitates between different interfaces.
   The experimental data showed that kinetic effects existed whenever
   precipitates were involved, but were absent from true amine solutions. A
   three-stage mechanism (migration-adsorption-aggregation) was proposed
   and tested to explain the kinetic behavior associated with precipitates.
   The size of air bubbles generated in the true solutions was not affected
   by the surface age of bubbles, while bubble size was affected by the
   surface age in the presence of precipitates. The observed kinetics of
   contact angle evolution suggested that the migration of DDA species
   between air-water-interfaces occurred. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, PDAs, portable computers) and
   wireless routers (e.g., WiFi access points) nowadays are equipped with
   ad hoc transmission mode. In a dense environment such as a
   college/office campus, this creates the possibility of forming a
   wireless mesh network (WMN) in which mobile users communicate with each
   other through multiple wireless hops. This allows mobile users to
   exchange (share) files over the free access WMN rather than a carrier
   frequency such as 3G and WiMax. We consider a peer-to-peer (P2P) content
   sharing setting in a WMN, wherein the mesh network operator
   over-provision a number of mesh routers in the network with additional
   storage capacity and P2P-aware devices that are programmed to cache and
   store P2P content. Those mesh routers act as caches and participants in
   P2P content sharing. The aim of this setting is to both reduce the cost
   of communications between peers within the WMN (i.e., reduce bandwidth
   and energy that P2P traffic consumes in the network), and enhance the
   performance of P2P content sharing (i.e., reduce the average P2P content
   download delay). Our main contribution in this paper is an optimum P2P
   content replication strategy at the participating mesh routers. In
   particular, we determine the optimum number of replicas for every P2P
   file such that the average access cost of all files in the network is
   minimized. We propose a centralized algorithm that enables the
   participating mesh routers to implement the optimal strategy. We further
   propose a distributed (low cost) algorithm for P2P content replication
   at the participating mesh routers, and show that the distributed
   algorithm mimics the optimal strategy very well. The analytical and
   simulation results show that our replication strategy significantly
   reduces the average overall cost of accessing P2P files in the WMN as
   compared with other commonly used replication strategies. Copyright (c)

Title = {{Task-relevancy effects on movement-related gating are modulated by
   continuous theta-burst stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   and primary somatosensory cortex}},

Abstract = {{Movement-related gating ensures that decreased somatosensory information
   from external stimulation reaches the cortex during movement when
   compared to resting levels; however, gating may be influenced by
   task-relevant manipulations, such that increased sensory information
   ascends to the cortex when information is relevant to goal-based
   actions. These task-relevancy effects are hypothesized to be controlled
   by a network involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) based
   on this region's known role in selective attention, modulating the
   primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The purpose of the current study was
   first to verify task-relevancy influences on movement-related gating in
   the upper limb, and second to test the contribution of the DLPFC and the
   primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to these relevancy effects. Ten
   healthy participants received median nerve stimulation at the left wrist
   during three conditions: rest, task-irrelevant movement, and
   task-relevant movement. Cortical responses to median nerve stimulations
   were measured in the form of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). The
   three conditions were collected on a baseline day and on two separate
   days following continuous theta-burst (cTBS), which transiently reduces
   cortical excitability, over either the contralateral S1 or DLPFC.
   Results demonstrated a significant interaction between stimulation and
   condition, with a priori contrasts revealing that cTBS over either S1 or
   DLPFC diminished the relevancy-based modulation of SEP amplitudes;
   however, the degree of this effect was different. These results indicate
   that DLPFC influences over S1 are involved in the facilitation of
   relevant sensory information during movement.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDHigh cost and ohmic loss are two issues that microbial fuel
   cells (MFC) face before becoming economically viable. To address the
   high cost and ohmic loss issues, a flat-plate MFC (FPMFC) configuration
   applying a passive air-breathing cathode and a three-dimensional anode
   was introduced. Electricity generation was examined in the FPMFC through
   operation in the presence and absence of a proton exchange membrane
   (PEM), and in batch and continuous modes.
   RESULTSContinuous operation of the FPMFC in the presence of a PEM
   favored power generation, mainly due to elimination of oxygen and
   biomass in the anode. Peak power density of 18 Wm(-3) was produced in
   the presence of a PEM (ohmic resistance 40 cm(2)), which was more than
   5-fold higher than that with J-cloth. During batch operation, the power
   density increased and reached maximum in the third batch (18 W m(-3) at
   60 A m(-3)). Greater stability was observed during continuous operation
   resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in peak power density (44 W m(-3) at
   146 A m(-3)).
   CONCLUSIONThe passive air-breathing FPMFC showed promising performance,
   offering a more economically viable configuration than the conventional
   FPMFCs using active (air, ferricyanide, and ferric iron) cathodes. (c)

   seismic performance of beam-column connections incorporating shape
   memory alloy plates. Eight beam-column connection subassemblies with
   shape memory alloy plates in the plastic hinge of beam were analyzed
   under cyclic loading. Based on the numerical results, the recentering
   properties of superelastic shape memory alloy plates were found to be
   effective in reducing the residual drifts of a flange plate beam-column
   connection, while displaying an excellent ductility. In addition, shape
   memory alloy plates could prevent the occurrence of local buckling and
   damage in structural members. The new self-centering connections could

Abstract = {{Due to exceptional electronic properties of graphene (Gr) and nitrogen
   doped graphene (N-Gr), they are considered as superior supporting
   platforms for novel metal nanoparticle decorations. Here, we report, a
   novel one-step electrochemical method for synthesis of Nitrogen-doped
   graphene sheets uniformly decorated with platinum nanoparticles
   (Pt/N-Gr). A graphite rod and platinum wire are respectively used for
   graphene and platinum nanoparticles production. The potential is cycled
   from -3V to +3V in acetonitrile solution as a nitrogen dopant source. By
   increasing the number of cycles the nitrogen-doped graphene/platinum
   nanoparticles composite is generated. After heat-treating the composite
   is characterized with various techniques such as FTIR, Raman, XPS, SEM
   and TEM. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared composite toward
   the reduction of O-2 and the oxidation of usual anodic fuels such as
   methanol, ethanol, hydrazine and formic acid is investigated using
   cyclic voltammetry technique. In comparison to commercial
   platinum/carbon, the onset potentials and the current densities for both
   O-2 reduction and fuels oxidation are remarkably improved. Furthermore,
   the modified electrode by this composite shows good long-term stability
   and poisoning tolerance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A one-year sampling program covering twenty-five small municipal systems
   was carried out in two Canadian regions to improve our understanding of
   the variability of water quality in small systems from water source to
   the end of the distribution system (DS). The database obtained was used
   to develop a global portrait of physical, chemical and microbiological
   water quality parameters. More precisely, the temporal and the spatial
   variability of these parameters were investigated. We observed that the
   levels of natural organic matter (NOM) were variable during different
   seasons, with maxima in the fall for both provinces. In the regions
   under study, the highest trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA)
   levels were achieved in warmer seasons (summer, fall), as observed in
   previous studies involving large systems. Observed THM and HAA levels
   were three times higher in systems in the province of Newfoundland \&
   Labrador than in the province of Quebec. Taste and odor indicators were
   detected during the summer and fall, and higher heterotrophic plate
   count (HPC) levels were associated with lower free chlorine levels. To
   determine spatial variations, stepwise statistical analysis was used to
   identify parameters and locations in the DS that act as indicators of
   drinking water quality. As observed for medium and large systems, free
   chlorine consumption, THM and HAA levels were dependant on their
   location in the DS. We also observed that the degradation of HAAs is
   more important in small systems than in medium or large DS reported in
   the literature, and this degradation can occur from the beginning of the
   DS. The results of this research may contribute to providing precious
   information on drinking water quality to small system operators and pave
   the way for several opportunities to improve water quality management.

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation of mechanical response of infrastructure object,
   solids and structures, relies on the use of computational models to
   foretell the state of a physical system under conditions for which such
   computational model has not been validated. Verification and Validation
   (V\&V) procedures are the primary means of assessing accuracy, building
   confidence and credibility in modeling and computational simulations of
   behavior of those infrastructure objects. Validation is the process of
   determining a degree to which a model is an accurate representation of
   the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model.
   It is mainly a physics issue and provides evidence that the correct
   model is solved (Oberkampf et al. 2002). Our primary interest is in
   modeling and simulating behavior of porous particulate media that is
   fully saturated with pore fluid, including cyclic mobility and
   liquefaction. Fully saturated soils undergoing dynamic shaking fall in
   this category. Verification modeling and simulation of fully saturated
   porous soils is addressed in more detail by (Tasiopoulou et al. 2014),
   and in this paper we address validation. A set of centrifuge experiments
   is used for this purpose. Discussion is provided assessing the effects
   of scaling laws on centrifuge experiments and their influence on the
   validation. Available validation test are reviewed in view of first and
   second order phenomena and their importance to validation. For example,
   dynamics behavior of the system, following the dynamic time, and
   dissipation of the pore fluid pressures, following diffusion time, are
   not happening in the same time scale and those discrepancies are
   discussed. Laboratory tests, performed on soil that is used in
   centrifuge experiments, were used to calibrate material models that are
   then used in a validation process. Number of physical and numerical
   examples are used for validation and to illustrate presented discussion.
   In particular, it is shown that for the most part, numerical prediction
   of behavior, using laboratory test data to calibrate soil material
   model, prior to centrifuge experiments, can be validated using scaled
   tests. There are, of course, discrepancies, sources of which are
   analyzed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical prediction of dynamic behavior of fully coupled saturated
   porous media is of great importance in many engineering problems.
   Specifically, static and dynamic response of soils -porous media with
   pores filled with fluid, such as air, water, etc. -can only be modeled
   properly using fully coupled approaches. Modeling and simulation of
   static and dynamic behavior of soils require significant Verification
   and Validation (V\&V) procedures in order to build credibility and
   increase confidence in numerical results. By definition, Verification is
   essentially a mathematics issue and it provides evidence that the model
   is solved correctly, while Validation, being a physics issue, provides
   evidence that the right model is solved. This paper focuses on
   Verification procedure for fully coupled modeling and simulation of
   porous media. Therefore, a complete Solution Verification suite has been
   developed consisting of analytical solutions for both static and dynamic
   problems of porous media, in time domain. Verification for fully coupled
   modeling and simulation of porous media has been performed through
   comparison of the numerical solutions with the analytical ones. Modeling
   and simulation is based on the so called, u-p-U formulation. Of
   particular interest are numerical dispersion effects which determine the
   level of numerical accuracy. These effects are investigated in detail,
   in an effort to suggest a compromise between numerical error and
   computational cost.}},

Journal = {{PUBLIC TRANSPORT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-60}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Public transit agencies are constantly looking for ways to increase
   their ridership. While many studies have attempted to identify the
   factors affecting new customer attraction, the issue of transit user
   loyalty has been far less researched. In addition to being a good
   indicator of a transit agency's performance, customer loyalty provides
   several added benefits. Loyal customers are more likely to use the
   transit agency's services and recommend them to potential new users.
   Furthermore, attracting users usually involves additional customer
   acquisition costs (e.g. marketing) not required in order to retain
   existing loyal users. This study used data provided by a mixed Stated
   Preference/Revealed Preference survey to identify some of the factors
   that affect customer loyalty in the context of public transit. Factors
   examined include service attributes, trip characteristics, as well as
   socioeconomic and psychological attributes of the individual. The
   findings suggest that service quality attributes play a critical role in
   transit user loyalty, while initiatives such as the provision of
   real-time information panels or making park and ride facilities
   available have a less determinant effect on the customers' mode shifting
   decisions, irrespective of their emotional response to public transit.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous metal-based films lacking long-range atomic order have found
   utility in applications ranging from electronics applications to
   heterogeneous catalysis. Notwithstanding, there is a limited set of
   fabrication methods available formaking amorphous films, particularly in
   the absence of a conducting substrate. Weintroduce herein a scalable
   preparative method for accessing oxidized and reduced phases of
   amorphous films that involves the efficient decomposition of molecular
   precursors, including simple metal salts, by exposure to near-infrared
   (NIR) radiation. The NIR-driven decomposition process provides
   sufficient localized heating to trigger the liberation of the ligand
   from solution-deposited precursors on substrates, but insufficient
   thermal energy to form crystalline phases. This method provides access
   to state-of-the-art electrocatalyst films, as demonstrated herein for
   the electrolysis of water, and extends the scope of usable substrates to
   include nonconducting and temperature-sensitive platforms.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Topological reconfiguration of power distribution systems can result in
   operational savings by reducing the power losses in the network. In this
   paper, an efficient heuristic is proposed to find an initial solution
   for the minimum-loss reconfiguration problem with small optimality gap.
   Providing an initial solution for a mixed-integer programming (MIP)
   problem, known as ``warm-start'', allows for a significant speed up in
   the solution process. The network reconfiguration for loss reduction is
   mapped here into a problem of finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a
   graph, for which there are a number of efficient algorithms developed in
   the literature. The proposed method leads to very fast solutions (less
   than 1.4 s for systems up to 10 476 nodes). For the test systems
   considered, the solution provided by the proposed method lies within a
   relative optimality gap of about 2.2\% with respect to the optimal
   solution. The existing MST algorithms guarantee the scalability of the
   proposed routine for large-scale distribution systems. Sensitivity
   factors are also employed to refine the solution to a smaller optimality
   gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   cast Al-3\% Mg alloys, one with 0.4\% Sc and the other without Sc, were
   annealed at 300 and 400 degrees C. Hardness, tensile yield stress and
   electrical resistivity measurements were used to examine the evolution
   of microstructure and strength of the alloys. These results were then
   utilised to develop a yield stress-precipitation model to describe

Abstract = {{The traditional hinge axis theory for guiding clinical procedures in
   dentistry and dental articulators has been challenged by the concept of
   an instantaneous center of rotation (ICR), which is becoming more
   prevalent in modern explanations of mandibular movement. The purpose of
   this study was to analyze traditional hinge axis theory using
   three-dimensional computer simulations and to compare it with ICR.
   Three-dimensional computational models that reproduced the traditional
   pantograph tracing method were created to simulate the opening and
   closing movements of the jaw. Models of the bones, muscles and ligaments
   were combined to create a dynamic representation using ArtiSynth, a
   biomechanical simulation toolkit. The mandibular motion is constrained
   based on contact between the articular eminence and the mandibular
   condyle, and is limited by spring-like ligaments, as well as passive
   properties of the skeletal muscles. To estimate the center of rotation
   according to the traditional axis theory, markers on the pantograph were
   traced during mandibular opening and closing movement The ICR was
   computed at each time step throughout the simulation. To locate a single
   hinge axis in simulation, the point about which the mandible seems to
   rotate during early opening and terminal closing was determined. The
   estimated center of rotation was inconsistent with the ICR, yet motion
   was found to be well approximated by a pure rotation. The inconsistency
   suggests that the use of the ICR position for the clinical dental
   procedures has its limitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Standard silicon photonic strip waveguides offer a high intrinsic
   refractive index contrast; this permits strong light confinement,
   leading to compact bends, which in turn facilitates the fabrication of
   devices with small footprints. Sub-wavelength grating (SWG) based
   waveguides can allow the fabrication of low loss devices with specific,
   engineered optical properties. The combination of SWG waveguides with
   optical micro-resonators can offer the possibility of achieving
   resonators with properties different from the traditional SOI rings. One
   important property that SWG rings can offer is decreased light
   confinement in the waveguide core; this improves the resonator's
   sensitivity to changes in the cladding refractive index, making the
   rings ideal for refractive index sensing applications. In this paper, we
   present the design and experimental characterization of SWG based rings
   realized on SOI chips without upper cladding (permitting their use as
   sensors). The fabricated rings offer quality factors in the range of
   similar to 1k-6k, depending on SWG parameters. Based on the comparison
   of experimental and simulated data we expect sensitivities exceeding 383
   nm/RIU in water and 270 nm/RIU in air, showing excellent potential for
   use in sensing applications. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Facilitating guest transport in clathrate hydrates by tuning guest-host
   interactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{The understanding and eventual control of guest molecule transport in
   gas hydrates is of central importance for the efficient synthesis and
   processing of these materials for applications in the storage,
   separation, and sequestration of gases and natural gas production.
   Previously, some links have been established between dynamics of the
   host water molecules and guest-host hydrogen bonding interactions, but
   direct observation of transport in the form of cage-to-cage guest
   diffusion is still lacking. Recent calculations have suggested that
   pairs of different guest molecules in neighboring cages can affect
   guest-host hydrogen bonding and, therefore, defect injection and water
   lattice motions. We have chosen two sets of hydrate guest pairs,
   tetrahydrofuran (THF)-CO2 and isobutane-CO2, that are predicted to
   enhance or to diminish guest-host hydrogen bonding interactions as
   compared to those in pure CO2 hydrate and we have studied guest dynamics
   in each using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. In
   addition, we have obtained the crystal structure of the THF-CO2 sII
   hydrate using the combined single crystal X-ray diffraction and C-13 NMR
   powder pattern data and have performed molecular dynamics-simulation of
   the CO2 dynamics. The NMR powder line shape studies confirm the enhanced
   and delayed dynamics for the THF and isobutane containing hydrates,
   respectively, as compared to those in the CO2 hydrate. In addition, from
   line shape studies and 2D exchange spectroscopy NMR, we observe
   cage-to-cage exchange of CO2 molecules in the THF-CO2 hydrate, but not
   in the other hydrates studied. We conclude that the relatively rapid
   intercage guest dynamics are the result of synergistic guest A-host
   water-guest B interactions, thus allowing tuning of the guest transport
   properties in the hydrates by choice of the appropriate guest molecules.
   Our experimental value for inter-cage hopping is slower by a factor of
   10(6) than a published calculated value. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-valent iron nanoparticles (NP) generated electrochemically by
   Fe(0) electrocoagulation (EC) show promise for on-demand industrial and
   drinking water treatment in engineered systems. This work applies
   multiple characterization techniques (in situ Raman spectroscopy, XRD,
   SEM, and cryo-TEM) to investigate the formation and persistence of
   magnetite and green rust (GR) NP phases produced via the Fe(0) EC
   process. Current density and background electrolyte composition were
   examined in a controlled anaerobic system to determine the initial Fe
   phases generated as well as transformation products with aging. Fe
   phases were characterized in an aerobic EC system with both simple model
   electrolytes and real groundwater to investigate the formation and aging
   of Fe phases produced in a system representing treatment of
   arsenic-contaminated ground waters in South Asia. Two central pathways
   for magnetite production via Fe(0) EC were identified: (i) as a primary
   product (formation within seconds when DO absent, no intermediates
   detected) and (ii) as a transformation product of GR (from minutes to
   days depending on pH, electrolyte composition, and aging conditions).
   This study provides a better understanding of the formation conditions
   of magnetite, GR, and ferric (oxyhydr)oxides in Fe EC, which is
   essential for process optimization for varying source waters.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as the
   emergence of digital PCR (dPCR) and useful modified nucleotide
   chemistries, including locked nucleic acids (LNAs), have created the
   potential to improve and expand clinical applications of PCR through
   their ability to better quantify and differentiate amplification
   products, but fully realizing this potential will require robust methods
   for designing dual-labeled hydrolysis probes and predicting their
   hybridization thermodynamics as a function of their sequence, chemistry,
   and template complementarity. We present here a nearest-neighbor
   thermodynamic model that accurately predicts the melting thermodynamics
   of a short oligonucleotide duplexed either to its perfect complement or
   to a template containing mismatched base pairs. The model may be applied
   to pure-DNA duplexes or to duplexes for which one strand contains any
   number and pattern of LNA substitutions. Perturbations to duplex
   stability arising from mismatched DNA:DNA or LNA:DNA base pairs are
   treated at the Gibbs energy level to maintain statistical significance
   in the regressed model parameters. This approach, when combined with the
   models accounting of the temperature dependencies of the melting
   enthalpy and entropy, permits accurate prediction of T-m values for
   pure-DNA homoduplexes or LNA-substituted heteroduplexes containing one
   or two independent mismatched base pairs. Terms accounting for changes
   in solution conditions and terminal addition of fluorescent dyes and
   quenchers are then introduced so that the model may be used to
   accurately predict and thereby tailor the T-m of a pure-DNA or
   LNA-substituted hydrolysis probe when duplexed either to its
   perfect-match template or to a template harboring a noncomplementary
   base. The model, which builds on classic nearest-neighbor
   thermodynamics, should therefore be of use to clinicians and biologists
   who require probes that distinguish and quantify two closely related
   alleles in either a quantitative PCR or dPCR assay. This potential is
   demonstrated by using the model to design allele-specific probes that
   completely discriminate and quantify clinically relevant mutant alleles
   (BRAF V600E and KIT D816V) in a dPCR assay.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic control of the orientation of fluorophore-labeled DNA
   strands immobilized on an electrode surface has been shown to be an
   effective bioanalytical tool. Modulation techniques and later
   time-resolved measurements were used to evaluate the kinetics of the
   switching between lying and standing DNA conformations. These
   measurements, however, are the result of a convolution between the DNA
   switching response time and the other frequency limited responses in the
   measurement. In this work, a method for analyzing the response of a
   potential driven DNA sensor is presented by calculating the potential
   effectively dropped across the electrode interface (using
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) as opposed to the potential
   applied to the electrochemical cell. This effectively deconvolutes the
   effect of the charging time on the observed frequency response. The
   corrected response shows that DNA is able to switch conformation faster
   than previously reported using modulation techniques. This approach will
   ensure accurate measurements independent of the electrochemical system,
   removing the uncertainty in the analysis of the switching response,
   enabling comparison between samples and measurement systems.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of superficial gas velocity and temperature on particle
   entrainment and electrostatic charges in fluidized binary mixtures of

   flux and electrostatic charge inside the bed and freeboard region
   increased with increasing superficial gas velocity. Temperature had
   negligible died on the entrainment flux over the limited range studied.

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring hydroxyapatite, Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH) (HAP), is the main
   inorganic component of bone matrix, with synthetic analogues finding
   applications in bioceramics and catalysis. An interesting and valuable
   property of both natural and synthetic HAP is the ability to undergo
   cationic and anionic substitution. The lanthanides are well-suited for
   substitution for the Ca2+ sites within HAP, because of their
   similarities in ionic radii, donor atom requirements, and coordination
   geometries. We have used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to
   investigate the thermodynamics of ion exchange in HAP with a
   representative series of lanthanide ions, La3+, Sm3+, Gd3+, Ho3+, Yb3+
   and Lu3+, reporting the association constant (K-a), ion-exchange
   thermodynamic parameters (Delta H, Delta S, Delta G), and binding
   stoichiometry (n). We also probe the nature of the La3+:HAP interaction

Abstract = {{Recent environmental regulatory sharp curbs on fossil fuel power plants
   have obliged industries to incorporate alternative sources of fuels for
   energy production. Cost and recovery of synthetic catalysts are major
   challenges in carbonaceous materials catalytic gasification. Biomass
   rich in alkali metals can be added as fuel and also to provide
   inexpensive natural catalysts to boost fossil fuel gasification.
   Biomass/fossil fuel co-gasification could provide bridging energy
   production based on renewable and fossil fuels. In this work, CO2
   co-gasification of switchgrass and sawdust with coal and fluid coke was
   conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer. Gasification kinetics were
   inhibited or enhanced, depending on the potassium concentration in the
   mixture. For low K/Al and K/Si molar ratios, the coal ash sequestered
   the biomass potassium needed for KAlSiO4 formation, and thus, no
   catalytic effect was observed until the biomass-to-coal mass ratio
   reached 3:1, where the switchgrass ash supplied enough potassium to more
   than satisfy the minerals in the coal ash. For high K/Al and K/Si molar
   ratios, unreacted residual potassium acted as catalyst, enhancing coal
   gasification. Fluid coke contained much lower Al and Si than for the
   coal. Hence, the gasification kinetics of fluid coke were significantly
   augmented by blending the coke with switchgrass due to the abundance of
   potassium in the biomass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   based on design criteria, which are defined by stresses and member
   forces calculated from prescribed levels of applied lateral shear force.
   Traditional wood-frame buildings are known to perform well in
   earthquakes. However, with the development of new engineered wood
   products, such as CLT (cross-laminated timber) and more consideration to
   build higher than the existing six stories limit in wood-frame
   structures, highlights the need to use innovative hybrid techniques for
   buildings. Hybrid buildings with steel frame structures incorporated
   with CLT infill walls offer one possible solution to residential and
   commercial multi-level buildings to overcome the height limitation. In
   order to make such a structure applicable for an earthquake prone area,
   it is important to understand the structural performance of the
   connection between steel and CLT elements. In this research, six
   connection combinations have been tested and modeled in a finite element
   program. The load-displacement test results are assessed with two
   evaluation methods. The first method follows the American Society of
   Testing Method, where ductility ratio, elastic shear stiffness, and the
   EEEP-curve (equivalent energy elastic-plastic curve) are generated and
   assessed. The second method follows an energy-based accumulation
   principle, where the test results are used to calculate a damage index
   at each time step. Both methods are used to compare test and model
   results and assess the accuracy of the model as well as addressing the
   capability of each assessment method. Depending on the purpose of the
   model one or the other assessment method might be suitable. For an
   analysis of the overall ductility or elastic shear stiffness, applying
   the method provided by ASTM will give relatively accurate results to
   assess a hysteretic load-displacement model such as the SAWS model in
   this research. The assessment with a damage accumulation method is a
   great tool to capture more details of the hysteretic load-displacement
   curve. Energy dissipation is valuable indicator besides ductility and
   elastic shear stiffness to evaluate the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Surface shear stress induced by different air sparging regimes on a
   submerged hollow fiber ultrafiltration module with
   horizontally-oriented, densely packed fibers was characterized.
   Continuous and intermittent (cycling on and off) coarse bubbles
   (0.75-2.5 mL), as well as large pulse bubble (150 and 500 mL) sparging
   were considered for a range of air flow rates. The power required to
   induce surface shear stress on the surface of the hollow fibers was
   substantially lower when using large pulse bubble sparging compared to
   both continuous and intermittent coarse bubble sparging. Results
   indicated that the air flow required for pulse bubble sparging was more
   than 80\% lower than that required for coarse bubble sparging to induce
   comparable surface shear stress (and corresponding fouling control).
   This study demonstrates the potential value and efficiency of pulse
   bubble air sparging as a fouling control option in densely packed hollow
   fiber membrane systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical behavior of Pd(II) and Rh(III) in {[}EMIm]NTf2 ionic
   liquid has been studied on Pt working electrodes at 298 K by cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), polarization curve and galvanostatic transient
   techniques. Cyclic voltammogram of Pd(II) in {[}EMIm]NTf2 consists of
   two cathodic current peaks located at 1.37 V(E-pc2), corresponding to
   Pd2+/Pd+, and at 0.69 V (E-pc1) corresponding to Pd+/Pd. The transfer
   coefficient alpha was calculated by the Tafel extrapolation from the
   polarization curves to be 0.306, which is in agreement with the value
   reported in an aqueous solution system. For Rh(III) in {[}EMIrn]NTf2, a
   cathodic current peak (E-pc) was observed at -0.39 V, corresponding to
   Rh3+/Rh, and two oxidation peaks were observed at -0.13 V (E-pa1) and
   0.37 V (E-pa2) during the reverse scan. A significantly negative shift
   in the cathodic peak potential was observed with the increase of the
   scan rate, indicating that the reduction of PO(II) and Rh(III) on the Pt
   electrode involves kinetic complications. By using the galvanostatic
   transient technique, the diffusion coefficients of Pd(II) and Rh(III) in
   {[}EMIm]NTf2 ionic liquid solution were found to be similar to 10(-7)
   cm(2)/s. The potential difference between the reduction of Pd(II) to Pd
   and the reduction of Rh(III) to Rh obtained from the CV curves of the
   Pd(II) and Rh(III) co-existing {[}EMIm]NTf2 solution is found to be
   about 0.74 V, which makes it possible to electrodeposit Pd(II) and
   Rh(III) separately.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a parallel structure of a feedback controller for
   the ball-screw drive systems which have significant dynamic variations
   during operations. The controller consists of two controllers with two
   different objectives. One controller aims at moving the workpiece table
   so that its position tracks reference trajectories with high speed and
   high accuracy. The other controller is for suppressing the structural
   vibration caused by the cutting force disturbance around system's
   resonant frequencies. To take into account the resonant modes'
   variations which are peculiar to ball-screw drives, a gain-scheduled
   controller is utilized as the vibration suppression controller.
   Advantages of the proposed controller structure in the ball-screw drive
   control application are discussed. It is experimentally demonstrated
   that the controller with the parallel structure is effective in
   achieving high performance in both trajectory tracking and cutting force
   disturbance rejection.}},

Pages = {{17-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Exposure to airborne particles is a serious health concern worldwide and
   indoor air quality is a critical factor influencing exposure. This work
   investigates the impact of modified ventilation and filtration system
   designs to inform building designers, operators, and policy makers of
   relative effectiveness and costs. Indoor aerosol dynamics, filter cost,
   and epidemiological models were combined to compare size-resolved indoor
   particle concentrations, operation costs, and monetized health benefits
   to occupants within an office building. System airflow and filter
   efficiency were modified to compare the relative economic implications.
   Comparisons were made for a number of cities to examine the impact of
   variation in local air quality, electricity prices, and economic
   conditions.
   The operation cost of filtration systems was found to vary by a factor
   of 3 between cities. The monetized health benefits of filter
   installations outweigh the operation costs by up to a factor of 10. In
   the majority of scenarios investigated the net benefits of improved
   filtration were greatest for the highest efficiency filters. Adding or
   increasing recirculated and return air in the system provides a net
   financial benefit due to (indirect) societal health benefits outweighing
   (direct) operational costs for small increases in airflow but has
   diminishing returns for large increases. Though system changes are
   economically beneficial from a societal viewpoint, the costs and
   benefits are borne by disparate parties and policy changes may be
   required to ensure optimum design and operation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A new method is presented for the rapid dissolution of enargite enhanced
   by the addition of pyrite as catalyst in acidic ferric sulfate media. At
   atmospheric conditions the effects of the ratio of pyrite (FeS2) to
   enargite (Cu3AsS4), temperature, solution potential, iron concentration,
   sulfuric acid concentration, particle size, and pulp density were
   evaluated. The best conditions were found to be at 80 degrees C with a
   pyrite to enargite ratio (Py:En) of 4, which gave complete copper
   extraction within 24 hours. The dissolution rate appears to be
   insensitive to changes in iron and acid concentrations. Elemental sulfur
   formed a porous layer on the surface of enargite particles, while pyrite
   surfaces remained clean. Arsenic presented the same dissolution rate as
   copper and all of the arsenic reported to solution, predominantly in the
   form of As(III). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the reciprocal theorem has been shown to be a powerful tool
   to obtain the swimming velocity of bodies at low Reynolds number. The
   use of this method for lower-dimensional swimmers, such as cylinders and
   sheets, is more problematic because of the undefined or ill-posed
   resistance problems that arise in the rigid-body translation of these
   shapes. Here, we show that this issue can be simply circumvented and
   give concise formulas obtained via the reciprocal theorem for the
   self-propelled motion of deforming two-dimensional bodies. We also
   discuss the connection between these formulae and Faxen's laws. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A reduced-scale, planar, two-story by two-bay reinforced concrete frame
   with weak beam-column joints was subjected to earthquake simulations on
   a shaking table. The beam-column joints did not contain transverse
   reinforcement, as is typical in older construction designed without
   attention to detail for ductile response. A series of linear and
   nonlinear analytical models of the frame were developed in accordance
   with American Society of Civil Engineers standards and subjected to the
   input base motions. The goodness of fit between analytical and measured
   results depended on the details of the analytical model. Reasonably
   accurate reproduction of the measured response was obtained only by
   modeling the inelastic responses of both columns and beam-column joints.
   The results confirm the importance of modeling nonlinear joint behavior
   in older concrete buildings with deficient beam-column joints.}},

Abstract = {{Successful management of design changes is critical for the efficient
   delivery of construction projects. Building information modeling (BIM)
   is envisioned to play an important role in integrating design,
   construction and facility management processes through coordinated
   changes throughout the project life-cycle. BIM currently provides
   significant benefits in coordinating changes across different views in a
   single model, and identifying conflicts between different
   discipline-specific models. However, current BIM tools provide limited
   support in managing changes across several discipline-specific models.
   This paper describes an approach to represent, coordinate, and track
   changes within a collaborative multi-disciplinary BIM environment. This
   approach was informed by a detailed case study of a large, complex,
   fast-tracked BIM project where we investigated numerous design changes,
   analyzed change management processes, and evaluated existing BIM tools.
   Our approach characterizes design changes in an ontology to represent
   changed component attributes, dependencies between components, and
   change impacts. It explores different types of dependencies amongst
   different design changes and describes how a graph-based approach and
   dependency matrix could assist with automating the propagation and
   impact of changes in a BIM-based project delivery process.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Recent regulatory sharp curbs on coal power plants have compelled
   industries to adopt alternative sources of fuels. Biomass/fossil fuel
   co-gasification could be a pathway through more sustainable energy
   production technologies. As a basis for co-gasification study, the
   characteristics of single-fuel switchgrass and coal steam gasification
   in an atmospheric pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor were
   studied. Increasing the steam-to-fuel ratio at 860 degrees C caused a
   moderate increase in the Hy and CO2 concentrations and decreases in the
   CO and CH4 concentrations, due to more steam-CH4 reforming and
   water-gasification reaction of CO. With increasing reactor temperature,
   the Hy concentration increased, whereas the CO, CH4, and CO2
   concentrations fell slightly. Fall switchgrass gasification resulted in
   higher carbon, hydrogen and cold gas efficiencies than spring harvest
   gasification, possibly due to higher potassium concentration and hence,
   greater reactivity of the fall switchgrass. The equilibrium model was
   unable to predict the syngas composition properly. Adding an extra
   methanator stoichiometric reactor to produce methane based on the
   empirical CH4 concentration, and removing part of the carbon, hydrogen
   and steam before introducing the feed and gas agent streams to the
   reactor based on experimental carbon, hydrogen, and steam efficiencies,
   the kinetically modified model predicted the syngas composition
   accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at finding the k nodes with the highest readings among sensor
   nodes, top-k query is a very important and useful query in wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs). Current studies about top-k query in WSNs mainly
   focus on always-on WSNs (A-WSNs) where sensors always stay awake and
   little research pays attention to top-k query in duty-cycled WSNs
   (D-WSNs) in which sensors are dynamically awake and asleep to conserve
   energy. In this paper, we originally analyze the research issues when
   implementing top-k query in D-WSNs and then propose the DRC-WSNs
   {[}D-WSNs with data replication (DR) and connected k(c)-neighborhood
   (CKN)] scheme for performing top-k query. Extensive theoretical analysis
   and simulation results provide the following two new insights regarding
   top-k query in D-WSNs: 1) Implementing top-k query in DRC-WSNs can
   achieve the best tradeoff with respect to query data accessibility and
   query cost (total energy consumption and query response time), compared
   with implementing top-k query in DC-WSNs (D-WSNs with only CKN) and
   A-WSNs; and 2) the query data accessibility and the query cost of
   DRC-WSNs, DC-WSNs, and A-WSNs can be tuned by varying the number of
   neighbor nodes that the data are replicated to during DR, the k(c) in
   CKN, and the total sensor nodes number.}},

Abstract = {{We develop robust resource-allocation schemes for a cognitive radio
   network (CRN), where the secondary users (SUs) try to communicate with
   each other from different small cell primary user (PU) networks. User
   cooperation technique is considered for communication among the SUs
   since PUs are in close proximity and there are tight interference
   constraints on the PU bands. Power allocation and relay selection
   schemes are optimized with the provision of quality of service to each
   SU considering different channel uncertainty models. We incorporate the
   channel outage events that have resulted from the imperfect channel
   state information under slow-fading channels in our resource
   optimization algorithms. We maximize the system goodput of the CRN while
   satisfying the interference constraints of the PU bands both
   probabilistically and for the worst case scenario. The original
   probabilistic optimization problem is approximated and transformed into
   a convex deterministic form, and a closed-form analytical solution for
   power allocation is derived. The closed-form power allocation solution
   helps us to develop an efficient relay selection scheme based on
   Hungarian algorithm. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of our
   proposed schemes and the implications of ignoring the imperfectness
   among different channels when developing resource-allocation algorithms
   for CRNs.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) or low dosage hydrate inhibitors
   (LDHIs) are known as additives employed to delay the onset of gas
   hydrate nucleation time in hydrocarbon pipelines. It has been observed,
   however, that in laboratory experiments accelerated hydrate growth
   called catastrophic growth can occur. This may be a serious problem if
   it occurs in a field application of kinetic inhibitors. The mechanism of
   such accelerated hydrate growth in the presence of KHIs is still not
   understood. A high-pressure microdifferential scanning calorimeter was
   employed to study the accelerated hydrate growth in the presence of
   chemical and biological inhibitors. It is hypothesized that capillary
   action facilitates the transport of water molecules across the formed
   hydrate layer from the bulk of the liquid water phase to the gasliquid
   interface. This in turn might be the governing mechanism for
   catastrophic hydrate growth in the presence of KHIs. In addition, the
   hydrate catastrophic index is introduced in this work as a parameter to
   quantify the phenomenon based on the laboratory data and the type of
   experiment conducted. The HCI may then serve as a measure of the
   pipeline hydrate plugging potential.}},

Abstract = {{We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the ammonia and
   methanol-based clathrate hydrates with the emphasis on characterizing
   hydrogen-bonding interactions of these guest molecules with the water
   lattice. Systems studied include structure II (sII) binary clathrate
   hydrates of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (large cage, L) + NH3 (small cage, S)
   and THF (L) + CH3OH (S), the structure I (sI) pure NH3 (L), pure CH3OH
   (L), the binary NH3 (L) + CH4 (S), and binary CH3OH (L) + CH4 (S)
   clathrate hydrates. We simulated these clathrate hydrates with the
   transferable intermolecular potential with four point changes (TIP4P)
   water potential and the TIP4P/ice water potential to determine the
   effect of the water potential on the predicted hydrogen bonding of the
   guest molecules. Simulations show that, despite strongly hydrogen
   bonding with the framework water molecules, clathrate hydrate phases
   with NH3 and CH3OH can be stable within temperatures ranges up to 240 K.
   Indeed, a limited number of thermodynamic integration free energy
   calculations show that both NH3 and CH3OH molecules give more stable
   guesthost configurations in the large sI clathrate hydrate cages than
   methane guests. Predictions of hydrogen bonding from simulations with
   the two different water potentials used can differ substantially. To
   study the effect of proton transfer from water to the basic NH3 guests,
   simulations were performed on a binary NH3 + CH4 sI clathrate hydrate
   where less than 10 \% of the ammonia guests in the large cages were
   converted to NH4+ and a water molecule of the hydrate lattice in the
   same large cage was converted to OH-. The small percentage of proton
   transfer to ammonia guests in the large cages did not affect the
   stability of the resultant hydrate. The structural perturbations in the
   lattice that result from this proton transfer are characterized.}},

Abstract = {{Low energy consumption and wide operating temperature range of
   capacitors made them common in sensor designs, e.g., MEMS
   accelerometers, and hence increased the popularity of capacitive readout
   circuits. Their main challenges, in either discrete or integrated
   implementations, are sensitivity, noise, energy consumption, and
   parasitic components at the analog front end. Compared to conventional
   ``frequency-shift monitoring{''} which is one of the most accurate and
   common methods for capacitance measurements, weakly-coupled resonators
   (well-known in mechanical systems) can offer up to three orders of
   magnitude increase in sensitivity. Therefore, this concept has been
   recently applied to the design of micromechanical sensors, e.g., for
   sensitive mass sensing. This paper applies, for the first time in the
   electrical domain, the concept of monitoring the eigenstates variations
   in weakly-coupled resonators as a generic readout circuit technique for
   measuring very small capacitance changes. The outstanding sensitivity of
   this method is verified analytically and demonstrated using both
   extensive circuit simulations and experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the use of ultrasound radio frequency (RF) time series
   analysis as a method for ultrasound-based classification of malignant
   breast lesions. The RF time series method is versatile and requires only
   a few seconds of raw ultrasound data with no need for additional
   instrumentation. Using the RF time series features, and a machine
   learning framework, we have generated malignancy maps, from the
   estimated cancer likelihood, for decision support in biopsy
   recommendation. These maps depict the likelihood of malignancy for
   regions of size mm within the suspicious lesions. We report an area
   under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 0.84\%-0.90\%) using support vector machines and 0.81
   (95\% CI: 0.78-0.85) using Random Forests classification algorithms, on
   22 subjects with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Changing the
   classification method yielded consistent results which indicates the
   robustness of this tissue typing method. The findings of this report
   suggest that ultrasound RF time series, along with the developed machine
   learning framework, can help in differentiating malignant from benign
   breast lesions, subsequently reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies

   effect of gas flow rate (Q (G) ), oil concentration (C (oil) ),

   separate RSM models were developed for each experimental set. The oil
   concentration and TMP were found to be the most significant factors

   between these parameters was the most significant one. At low Q (G) ,
   the more the gas flow rate, the higher the permeate flux; however, in
   the high gas flow rate region, higher Q (G) did not necessarily improve
   the permeate flux. In the case of rejection, gas and liquid flow rates

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for modelling the cutting forces and
   chatter stability limits in drills with arbitrary lip geometry. The
   oblique cutting geometry at each point on the drill lip is modelled

   coefficients at different parts of the drill lip are identified
   empirically; the cutting force coefficients are identified from
   non-symmetric drilling tests, and the process damping coefficients are
   identified from chatter-free orthogonal turning tests. The presented
   approach provides a practical method for modelling the cutting forces
   and vibration stability without needing the detailed geometry of drill
   lips. The accuracy of presented model in predicting lateral and
   torsional-axial chatter stability limits is verified by conducting
   drilling tests using drills with various edge geometries. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress on brain connectivity modeling using
   neuroimaging data such as fMRI, most current approaches assume that
   brain connectivity networks have time-invariant topology/coefficients.
   This is clearly problematic as the brain is inherently nonstationary.
   Here, we present a time-varying model to investigate the temporal
   dynamics of brain connectivity networks. The proposed method allows for
   abrupt changes in network structure via a fused least absolute shrinkage
   and selection operator (LASSO) scheme, as well as recovery of
   time-varying networks with smoothly changing coefficients via a weighted
   regression technique. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
   yields improved accuracy on estimating time-dependent connectivity
   patterns when compared to a static sparse regression model or a weighted
   time-varying regression model. When applied to real resting-state fMRI
   datasets from Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects,
   significantly different temporal and spatial patterns were found to be
   associated with PD. Specifically, PD subjects demonstrated reduced
   network variability over time, which may be related to impaired
   cognitive flexibility previously reported in PD. The temporal dynamic
   properties of brain connectivity in PD subjects may provide insights
   into brain dynamics associated with PD and may serve as a potential
   biomarker in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a framework for distribution system optimization is
   proposed. In this framework, different control variables, such as
   switchable capacitors, voltage regulators, and system configuration can
   be optimally determined to satisfy objectives, such as loss minimization
   and voltage profile improvement. Linearized power-flow equations are
   used in the optimization, and the problem is formulated as mixed-integer
   quadratic programming (MIQP), which has a guaranteed optimal solution.
   Existing efficient solution algorithms developed for MIQP problems
   facilitate the application of the proposed framework. System operational
   constraints, such as feeder ampacities, voltage drops, radiality, and
   the number of switching actions are considered in the model. The
   performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a variety of
   distribution test systems.}},

Title = {{Shear deformation and fracture of human cortical bone}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{25-35}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bone can be viewed as a nano-fibrous composite with complex hierarchical
   structures. Its deformation and fracture behaviors depend on both the
   local structure and the type of stress applied. In contrast to the
   extensive studies on bone fracture under compression and tension, there
   is a lack of knowledge on the fracture process under shear, a stress
   state often exists in hip fracture. This study investigated the
   mechanical behavior of human cortical bone under shear, with the focus
   on the relation between the fracture pattern and the microstructure.
   losipescu shear tests were performed on notched rectangular bar
   specimens made from human cortical bone. They were prepared at different
   angles (i.e. 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees) with
   respect to the long axis of the femoral shaft. The results showed that
   human cortical bone behaved as an anisotropic material under shear with
   the highest shear strength (similar to 50 MPa) obtained when shearing
   perpendicular to the Haversian systems or secondary osteons. Digital
   image correlation (DIC) analysis found that shear strain concentration
   bands had a close association with long bone axis with an average
   deviation of 11.8 degrees to 18.5 degrees. The fracture pattern was also
   greatly affected by the structure with the crack path generally
   following the direction of the long axes of osteons. More importantly,
   we observed unique peripheral arc-shaped microcracks within osteons,
   using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). They were generally
   long cracks that developed within a lamella without crossing the
   boundaries. This microcracking pattern clearly differed from that
   created under either compressive or tensile stress: these arc-shaped
   microcracks tended to be located away from the Haversian canals in
   early-stage damaged osteons, with similar to 70\% developing in the
   outer third osteonal wall. Further study by second harmonic generation
   (SHG) and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy revealed
   a strong influence of the organization of collagen fibrils on shear
   microcracking. This study concluded that shear-induced microcracking of
   human cortical bone follows a unique pattern that is governed by the
   lamellar structure of the osteons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Seasonal variability in source water can lead to challenges for drinking
   water providers related to operational optimization and process control
   in treatment facilities. The objective of this study is to investigate
   seasonal variability of water quality in municipal small water systems
   (< 3000 residents) supplied by surface waters. Residual chlorine and
   trihalomethanes (THM) were measured over seven years (2003-2009).
   Comparisons are made within each system over time, as well as between
   systems according to the type of their treatment technologies. THM
   concentrations are generally higher in the summer and autumn. The
   seasonal variability was generally more pronounced in systems using
   chlorination plus additional treatment. Chloroform, total THM (TTHM) and
   residual chlorine concentrations were generally lower in systems using
   chlorination plus additional treatment. Conversely, brominated THM
   concentrations were higher in systems using additional treatment.
   Residual chlorine was highest in the winter and lowest in the spring and
   summer. Seasonal variations were most pronounced for residual chlorine
   in systems with additional treatment. There was generally poor
   correlation between THM concentrations and concentrations of residual
   chlorine. Further study with these data will be beneficial in finding
   determinants and indicators for both quantity and variability of
   disinfection byproducts and other water quality parameters.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The plate-load test (PLT) is widely performed at large dam sites to
   determine the rock mass deformability. Analytical relations based on the
   theory of elasticity, as suggested by the International Society for Rock
   Mechanics and the American Society for Testing and Materials test
   standards, are commonly used to interpret the test results and calculate
   the rock mass deformation modulus. However, because of inconsistency of
   the test gallery geometry with the half-space medium assumption embedded
   in the analytical relations, a systematic error occurs in the
   calculation of the deformation modulus. Furthermore, when the tests are
   conducted on jointed rock masses, the test results show a considerable
   scatter, mainly due to the anisotropy of the deformability of jointed
   rock masses. In this paper, numerical modeling is used to interpret the
   results of a series of PLTs conducted at the Bakhtiary dam site in
   southwest Iran. An equivalent continuum model, called JointedRock, is
   used to back-calculate the stiffness of bedding planes from the test
   results. Finally, the equivalent continuum deformation moduli of the
   rock mass are determined numerically for various directions of loading
   relative to the orientation of major joint sets. (C) 2014 American

Title = {{Analytical Decision Analysis for Construction Methodology Selection for
   a Water Transmission Main River Crossing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The decisions made during the preproject planning and design stages are
   very crucial for infrastructure and underground projects due to the
   inherent risks and uncertainties in such projects. In the selection of a
   crossing method, the owner has to consider various factors, including
   cost, environmental impact, serviceability and maintenance,
   constructability, and schedule. Unfortunately, this decision is complex
   due to the numerous variables that need to be considered. When choosing
   a crossing methodology, the project manager must balance the likely
   capital cost of the project with the risks inherent in the chosen
   construction method. Ideally, a project manager would investigate
   numerous alternatives to fully explore the merits of various
   construction methods, including the level of risk, before making the
   final decision. This paper presents the results of an actual project
   workshop with the objective of selecting the most optimum construction
   method for the construction of a water transmission main beneath the
   North Saskatchewan River, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The project used
   the analytical hierarchy process as a method to capture the risks,
   merits, and demerits of each construction method. Conventional open
   trench, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and
   conventional tunneling were the four methods considered for the project.
   The paper includes the background information, workshop setting,
   methodology of the selection criteria, and the results of the workshop
   considered in selecting the most optimum method for the specific project
   circumstances. A summary of the design based on the recommended
   methodology is also presented along with a summary of the crossing
   construction completed in 2007. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Developing advanced electrode materials that deliver high energy at
   ultra-fast charge and discharge rates are very crucial to meet an
   increasing large-scale market demand for high power lithium ion
   batteries (LIBs). A three-dimensional (3D) nanoflower structure is
   successfully developed in the large-scale synthesis of
   LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 material for the first time. The fast
   co-precipitation is the key technique to prepare the nanoflower
   structure in our method. After heat treatment, the obtained
   LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 nanoflowers (NL333) pronouncedly present a pristine
   flower-like nano-architecture and provide fast pathways for the
   transport of Li-ions and electrons. As a cathode material in a LIB, the
   prepared NL333 electrode demonstrates an outstanding high-rate
   capability. Particularly, in a narrow voltage range of 2.7-4.3 V, the
   discharge capacity at an ultra-fast charge discharge rate (20C) is up to
   126 mAh g(-1), which reaches 78\% of that at 0.2C, and is much higher
   than that (i.e., 44.17\%) of the traditional bulk LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2.

Abstract = {{The recovery of phosphorus from wastewater has gathered strength due to
   its acceptance as a sustainable method for solving wastewater treatment
   plant struvite problems and the low global reserves of phosphorus ore.
   Although the chemistry and successful operation of phosphorus recovery
   plants are well documented, there still exists opportunity to reduce and
   optimize the use of external resources, such as magnesium, that is
   required for the nutrient recovery. One of the primary operational costs
   arises from the need for external magnesium addition, and therefore, the
   proper (and timely) detection of the element is necessary. In this
   study, methods were tested which could provide information, on-site, on
   the rate of application of the element and its concentration in the
   various water matrices. A method was developed that utilizes the
   combined use of pH and conductivity to determine the amount of external
   magnesium that needs to be added to a water sample. The amount required
   was determined by locating a transition point in the
   pH-conductivity-external magnesium added graph and the phosphate
   concentration in the water. For each mole of phosphorus removed, the
   molar ratio of Mg:P was 1.3-2.0 at the transition point. The magnesium
   concentration in the water matrix was also determined by the hardness
   test method; this method was found to be suitable for quick, on-site
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Operating a multi-purpose hydropower reservoir during flooding and high
   inflow events is a challenging and complicated task. Three main elements
   contribute to this complexity: addition of minimizing flood damage to
   the set of objectives of the problem, exponential boost in inflow
   forecast uncertainty-driven risks as a result of the high sensitivity of
   the outcomes to inflow forecasts, and the unavoidable necessity of
   making a decision within a very short time although the decision making
   process requires comprehensive analysis. A Risk-Informed Decision Making
   (RIDM) framework as a pre-developed guideline for operational planners
   might be the only solution to the problem.We explain the structure of
   such a framework in the literature, and implement an RIDM framework for
   the Cheakamus River System. In developing the RIDM framework in our
   study, we make several modifications to the previous RIDM framework for
   Cheakamus River System by minimizing subjectivity in the decision making
   process, incorporating comprehensive risk consideration in the process,
   and taking account of the entire range of operational alternatives. We
   also explain how the framework could be developed for other case
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Niobium is a widely used micro-alloying element in steels that can
   retard the austenite-to-ferrite transformation primarily by solute drag
   when Nb remains in solution. It is critical to develop quantitative
   models to predict the effect of Nb on the transformation kinetics. In
   the present work, dedicated continuous cooling transformation (CCT)
   studies were performed for a low-carbon steel microalloyed with 0.047 wt
   pct Nb starting from fully recrystallized austenite states with the same
   grain size but different amounts of Nb in solution. The
   austenite-to-ferrite transformation kinetics is described from a
   fundamental perspective by assuming a mixed-mode reaction including
   solute drag of Nb. Using the solute drag model of Fazeli and Militzer,
   the intrinsic interface mobility, trans-interface diffusivity of Nb, and
   its binding energy to the interface have been determined from the CCT
   data. The interfacial parameters are critically analyzed and compared
   with independent measurements of diffusion and grain boundary
   segregation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes efficient backoff algorithms for uplink multi-packet
   reception (MPR) capable IEEE 802.11 systems in order to maximize the
   system throughput. According to the proposed algorithms, each station
   (STN) estimates, in a Bayesian manner under an unsaturated channel
   traffic condition, the number of backlogged STNs sharing the multiple
   access channel to obtain an optimal (re) transmission probability.
   Additionally, an access point and associated STNs cooperate by
   exchanging information piggybacked in transmitted data packets and the
   corresponding acknowledgment packets. The mean and variance of the
   queuing delays of the proposed algorithms are extensively evaluated via
   simulations under various environments such as time-varying populations
   and various asymmetric traffic conditions and compared to those of the
   conventional binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm. Furthermore,
   the queuing performance of the proposed algorithms is compared to the
   queuing delay lower bound obtained from a system that has perfect
   knowledge of the backlog size. Numerical results demonstrate the
   robustness of the proposed algorithms in various environments, and that
   they outperform the BEB algorithm.}},

   we propose an improved method to better evaluate the real impact of a
   paper. The proposed method calibrates the real influence of a paper over
   time. Then we propose a scheme of evaluating the contribution of each
   author in a paper. We later develop a new method to combine the
   information of the author itself and the structure of the co-author
   network. We use the number of co-authorship to calculate the effective
   distance between two authors, and evaluate the strength of their
   influence to each other with the law of gravity. The strength of
   influence is used to build a new network of authors, which is a
   comprehensive topological representation of both the quality of the node
   and its role in network. Finally, we apply our method to the Erdos

Title = {{Swinging Bus Operation of Inverters for Fuel Cell Applications With

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{For reliability reasons, the employment of small film capacitors instead
   of electrolytic ones is an interesting alternative for the dc-link in
   single-phase inverters for fuel cell applications. Due to the low
   capacitance that can be accomplished at an acceptable cost using this
   technology, there are large low-frequency voltage fluctuations (100/120
   Hz and harmonics) in the dc-link caused by the double-frequency power
   transfer. By allowing these variations in the bus, the capacitor bank
   absorbs the current ripple from the inverter to avoid detrimental
   oscillations in the fuel cell. Traditional control strategies for
   inverters are usually designed to operate with nearly constant input
   voltage and are not able to effectively handle large (e. g., > 10\%)
   low-frequency input voltage fluctuations. This paper introduces the
   analysis of a swinging bus in the context of fuel cell standalone
   applications (i.e., voltage-source inverters) and proposes a nonlinear
   control approach to operate inverters with very large input voltage
   swing: the natural switching surface (NSS). Under the proposed scheme,
   the inverter presents excellent dynamic and steady-state
   characteristics, even at moderate switching frequency (e. g., 3.6 kHz).
   In order to illustrate the superior performance of the NSS, a comparison
   to a proportional-resonant (PR) controller is performed. Unlike the
   linear compensator, the NSS is able to reject the large bus voltage
   oscillations and achieve high-quality output voltage with low total
   harmonic distortion (THD). Simulation and experimental results are
   provided to illustrate the behavior of the swinging bus and to validate
   the NSS control scheme under the proposed demanding operating

Abstract = {{This work relates to developing thermal protection for a finite period
   of exposure to a high temperature environment. This type of transient
   heat transfer problem starts with a heating period, which is then
   followed by a cooling period once the high temperature environment
   disappears. The study is particularly relevant to the thermal protection
   of flight data recorders from high temperature flame. In this work,
   transient heat conduction through a three-concentric-layer configuration
   is numerically studied, which includes a metal housing, a thermal
   insulation, and a phase change material. The thermal performance is
   evaluated using the center temperature changing with time. It is found
   that the center temperature reaches a peak during cooling period rather
   than heating period. Time taken to reach the peak and the peak value
   depend on the sizes and properties of the layers. The properties include
   latent heat of fusion, melting temperature, heat capacities, and thermal
   conductivities. Parametric study is conducted to analyze and distinguish
   the influence of these parameters. The study provides general guidance
   for determining sizes and selecting materials for the thermal design of
   flight data recorders. Additionally, the study is also useful for other
   similar applications, for which thermal management and protection over a
   period of time is needed. In this paper, analysis starts with a baseline
   configuration composed of specific materials and sizes. Finite changes
   are applied to sizes, properties of the materials, and the results are
   compared to understand the roles of the varied parameters in affecting
   the thermal protection performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Current screening techniques based on areal bone mineral density (aBMD)
   measurements are unable to identify the majority of people who sustain
   hip fractures. Biomechanical examination of such events may help
   determine what predisposes a hip to be susceptible to fracture.
   Recently, drop-tower simulations of in-vitro sideways falls have allowed
   the study of the mechanical response of the proximal human femur at
   realistic impact speeds. This technique has created an opportunity to
   validate explicit finite element (FE) models against dynamic test data.
   This study compared the outcomes of 15 human femoral specimens fractured
   using a drop tower with complementary specimen-specific explicit FE
   analysis. Correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) were
   found to be moderate for whole bone stiffness comparison (R-2=0.3476 and
   22.85\% respectively). No correlation was found between experimentally
   and computationally predicted peak force, however, energy absorption
   comparison produced moderate correlation and RMSE (R-2= 0.4781 and
   29.14\% respectively). By comparing predicted strain maps to high speed
   video data we demonstrated the ability of the FE models to detect
   vulnerable portions of the bones. Based on our observations, we conclude
   that there exists a need to extend the current apparent level material
   models for bone to cover higher strain rates than previously tested
   experimentally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A space-filling curve (SFC) is a proximity preserving linear mapping of
   any multidimensional space and is widely used as a clustering tool.
   Equi-sized partitioning of an SFC ignores the loss in clustering quality
   that occurs due to inaccuracies in the mapping. Often, this results in
   poor locality within partitions, especially for the conceptually simple,
   Morton order curves. We present a heuristic that improves partition
   locality in arbitrary geometries by slicing a Morton order curve at
   points where spatial locality is sacrificed. In addition, we develop
   algorithms that evenly distribute points to the extent possible while
   maintaining spatial locality. A metric is defined to estimate relative
   inter-partition contact as an indicator of communication in parallel
   computing architectures. Domain partitioning tests have been conducted
   on geometries relevant to turbulent reactive flow simulations. The
   results obtained highlight the performance of our method as an
   unsupervised and computationally inexpensive domain partitioning tool.

Abstract = {{The looping of dry CO2 sorbents in Dual Fluidized Beds (DFBs) plays a
   prominent role in CO2 capture methods, and understanding the
   hydrodynamics of DFBs is of great importance. Geldart B lime-based
   pellets were investigated in a DFB with a constant bubbling fluidized
   bed velocity of 0.17 m/s, a riser velocity varied between 1.3 and 5.3
   m/s, a loop-seal aeration velocity ranging from 0.08 to 1.08 m/s and a
   temperature from ambient to 550 C. The solids circulation flux (G(s))
   increased with increasing superficial riser velocities, as well as with
   increasing loop-seal aeration. Experiments at elevated temperatures
   revealed that increasing the temperature decreased G(s) and the solids
   volume fraction in the bottom section of the riser. The riser underwent
   transition from fast fluidization to pneumatic transport by increasing
   either the superficial riser velocity or the temperature. The
   interdependence between the riser solids fraction, G(s) and particle
   drag was explored by means of the slip factor. A new slip factor
   correlation is proposed which makes use of the drag coefficient and

Abstract = {{The use of calcium hydroxide for scavenging zincate species is
   demonstrated to be a highly effective approach for increasing the
   electrolyte capacity and improving the performance of the zinc-air fuel
   cell system. A fundamental approach is established in this study to
   quantify the formation of calcium zincate as the product of scavenging
   and the amount of water compensation necessary for optimal performance.
   The good agreement between predicted and experimental results proves the
   validity of the proposed theoretical approach. By applying the results
   of theoretical predictions, both the electrolyte capacity and the cell
   longevity have been increased by more than 40\%. It is also found that,
   using Ca(OH)(2) to scavenge zincate species in concentrated KOH
   solutions, affects mostly the removal of zincate, rather than ZnO, from
   the electrolyte, whereas the presence of excess, free, mobile H2O plays
   a key role in dissolving ZnO and forming zincate. The results obtained
   in this study demonstrate that the proposed approach can widely and
   effectively be applied to all zinc-air cell systems during their

Abstract = {{Soft, sensitive, and conformable strain sensors can provide tactile
   sensation to prosthetic limbs and can be used for epidermal and wearable
   health monitoring. High strain sensitivity is often achieved by using
   piezoelectric ceramics, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), with
   known issues for large-area scalability, rigidity, and biocompatibility.
   Here, we report a nature-inspired, piezoresistive, soft, and benign
   core-shell nanofibrous sensor that exhibits an unprecedented gauge
   factor in excess of 60, arising from a reversible disjointing/jointing
   of a large number of interfiber junctions, consequently changing the
   current path and resistance in response to both tensile and compressive
   strains. Nanofiber textile sensor arrays are demonstrated with fast,
   low-voltage, accurate, and repeatable sensing over 1000 cycles for
   epidermal monitoring of limb and musculoskeletal movements and radial
   pulse waveform, for real-time monitoring of simulated intermittent
   Parkinson's tremors, and for biaxial tactile sensing and localization of
   point of touch.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to characterize the structure of
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) treated gas diffusion layers (GDLs) with
   and without microporous layers (MPLs) using 3D X-ray micro computed
   tomographic (mu CT) microscopy. In this work, the structure of single
   and dual layer GDLs is evaluated via mu CT for various GDL samples (such
   as Toray TGP-H-060 and AvCarb EP40) loaded with different MPLs. A new
   method is presented for separating, or segmenting, the various phases of
   the GDL, i.e., void space, carbon fiber (including binder and PTFE), and
   MPL. Through analysis, it was found that the variation in bulk porosity
   and the average pore diameter of the GDLs depends highly on the GDL
   series manufacturing and treatment processes. Using advanced image
   analysis techniques, routines were developed to accurately segment the
   GDL fibers (including binder/PTFE) and the MPL. The percentage of the
   intruding MPL material into the carbon fiber paper as a function of the
   GDL thickness was successfully found for dual layer GDLs, with varying
   PTFE content and areal weight loading in the MPL. This analysis provides
   invaluable insight into the physical microstructure of paper-based GDLs,
   emphasizing the heterogeneous porosity distribution of single layer GDLs
   and the interaction of the MPL with the carbon fiber paper of dual layer
   GDLs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have investigated the response of smooth muscle cells
   to transient stretch-compress (SC) and compress-stretch (CS) maneuvers.
   The results indicate that the transient SC maneuver causes a sudden
   fluidization of the cell while the CS maneuver does not. To understand
   this asymmetric behavior, we have built a biomechanical model to probe
   the response of stress fibers to the two maneuvers. The model couples
   the cross-bridge cycle of myosin motors with a viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt
   element that represents the stress fiber. Simulation results point to
   the sensitivity of the myosin detachment rate to tension as the cause
   for the asymmetric response of the stress fiber to the CS and SC
   maneuvers. For the SC maneuver, the initial stretch increases the
   tension in the stress fiber and suppresses myosin detachment. The
   subsequent compression then causes a large proportion of the myosin
   population to disengage rapidly from actin filaments. This leads to the
   disassembly of the stress fibers and the observed fluidization. In
   contrast, the CS maneuver only produces a mild loss of myosin motors and
   no fluidization.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Multi-Channel Membrane Reactor (MCMR) was designed and built for
   the small-scale production of hydrogen via Steam Methane Reforming
   (SMR). The prototype alternates an SMR gas channel to produce hydrogen
   catalytically, with a Methane Catalytic Combustion (MCC) gas channel to
   provide the heat of reaction needed by the endothermic reforming. A
   palladium-silver membrane inside the reforming gas channel shifts the
   reaction equilibrium, allowing lower operating temperatures, and
   producing pure hydrogen in a single vessel. Using an innovative
   air-spray coating technique, channels were coated with
   Ru-MgO-La2O3/gamma-Al2O3 and Pd/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst particles for the
   SMR and MCC reactions, respectively. Results for the proof-of-concept
   MCMR showed that methane conversion in the reformer of 91\% and a
   hydrogen purity in excess of 99.99\% were possible with the reformer
   operating at 570 degrees C and 15 bar. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Due to large variability in streamflows and a lack of adequate reservoir
   storage capability in US territories, a treaty for the Columbia River
   was established between Canada and the USA in 1964. However, the treaty
   only considers power generation and flood control, and to address
   environmental issues, supplemental operating agreements have been signed
   each year since the 1990s. In this paper, we present a goal programming
   (GP) optimization algorithm to model the terms and conditions of the
   Supplemental Operating Agreements of the Columbia River Treaty (CRT)
   between BC Hydro and ``United States Entities{''}. The GP technique is a
   multi-objective programming method that has been used in many different
   fields including reservoir optimization. After its introduction in 1961,
   it has been used extensively and is considered a robust modeling
   technique. The GP algorithm we have developed models the multi-objective
   problem using a combination of lexicographic and weighted
   goal-programming techniques. Case studies using four scenarios were
   performed to assess the satisfaction of environmental requirements for
   different target flow requirements at the US-Canadian border of the
   Columbia River. The GP algorithm we have developed allows for the
   constraints to deviate from a target value. This in turn provides
   modeling flexibility to handle infeasibility, typically encountered when
   hard constraints are included in the formulation of the optimization
   problem. GP can be used to investigate the trade-offs between multiple
   objectives by minimizing the deviation from user-specified target
   levels. In addition, the goal-programming formulation can represent more
   realistic real-time operational situations of a complex multi-reservoir
   system like the BC Hydro system.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a study on the end-to-end average bit error rate
   (BER), the average channel capacity and the outage performance of a
   multi-hop power line communication (PLC) system equipped with
   decode-and-forward (DF) relays. To combat the issue of distance
   dependent signal attenuation, multi-hop data transmission has recently
   been introduced for PLC systems. However, apart from the distance
   dependent signal attenuation, PLC systems also suffer from (i) the
   variation in signal amplitude (fading) because of reflections and (ii)
   impulsive noise. Thus, in this study, the channel for each hop of the
   multi-hop PLC system is modelled by a log-normal fading amplitude, which
   is clubbed to a distance dependent signal attenuation factor. To
   consider the effect of the impulsive noise along with the background
   noise, the additive noise at each node is modelled by a
   Bernoulli-Gaussian process. Analytical expressions for the end-to-end
   average BER for binary phase-shift keying, the average channel capacity
   and the outage probability are obtained. The merit of the multi-hop PLC
   system over a conventional direct transmission PLC system for fixed
   transmission power is shown through numerical results. The authors'
   results show that with increasing number of DF relays, the end-to-end
   average BER, the average channel capacity and the outage performance
   improve.}},

   applications of hybrid simulation optimization in the forest industry,
   which is an important economic sector in many countries. Use of these
   models in forest products supply chains has been limited. These models
   can be used to deal with uncertainties from various sources in forest

Abstract = {{Cellulosic handsheets prepared by unrefined and highly refined Kraft and

   investigated. The contact angles on handsheets prepared with unrefined
   fibres were significantly larger than those of refined ones after
   treatment due to their higher surface roughness. However, on highly
   refined samples, although the treatments resulted in a hydrophobic

Abstract = {{Partnerships have the potential to improve corporate competitiveness in
   the global market. Cost reduction, marketing, product diversification
   and development, and customer service improvement are the common drivers
   for entering into a partnership. Previous studies have revealed that
   partnership performance is influenced by a number of factors:
   similarity, compatibility, mutuality, joint decision-making, information
   sharing, risk/reward sharing, relationship-specific assets, and trust
   and commitment between partners. However, few empirical studies have
   specifically investigated the importance of these factors in partnership
   performance. In addition, no comprehensive study has investigated the
   importance of partnership drivers and the factors influencing
   partnership performance in the forest industry. In this study, based on
   a survey of forest products companies in British Columbia, Canada, we
   investigated 1) the types of partners, the importance of the various
   partnership drivers, and their correlation with company characteristics,
   and 2) the importance of the factors influencing partnership
   performance. The results showed that the type of partners and the
   importance of partnership drivers are correlated with the company's
   revenue and its position in the supply chain. The results of regression
   analysis indicate that the degree of joint decision-making,
   relationship-specific assets, and risk/reward sharing are the best
   predictors of partnership performance in the companies surveyed.}},

Abstract = {{In order to produce long-lasting, non-wettable, micro-nano patterned
   metallic surfaces, femtosecond laser ablation process has been used. The
   effects of femtosecond laser irradiation process parameters (fluence,
   scanning speed and laser beam overlap) on the hydrophobicity of the
   resulted micro/nano-patterned morphologies on stainless steel are
   studied in detail. First, depending on the laser parameters, seven
   distinctly different nano-patterns were produced, namely nano-rippled,
   paraboloidal, sinusoidal, triple roughness, cauliflowered,
   tulip-flowered, and scaly nanostructures. These were classified
   according to the amount of energy absorbed by the surface that is a
   function of the laser intensity and scanning speed. Subsequently, the
   various fabricated substrates were chemically treated by silanization to
   reduce their surface energy and make them intrinsically hydrophobic with
   Young's water contact angle higher than 105 degrees. Analysis of the
   wettability revealed superhydrophobicity for most of these structures,
   particularly of the cauliflowered and scaly patterns with contact angles
   in excess of 160 and hysteresis of less than 10 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Weak supervisory information of web images, such as captions, tags, and
   descriptions, make it possible to better understand images at the
   semantic level. In this paper, we propose a novel online multimodal
   co-indexing algorithm based on Adaptive Resonance Theory, named OMC-ART,
   for the automatic co-indexing and retrieval of images using their
   multimodal information. Compared with existing studies, OMC-ART has
   several distinct characteristics. First, OMC-ART is able to perform
   online learning of sequential data. Second, OMC-ART builds a two-layer
   indexing structure, in which the first layer co-indexes the images by
   the key visual and textual features based on the generalized
   distributions of clusters they belong to; while in the second layer,
   images are co-indexed by their own feature distributions. Third, OMC-ART
   enables flexible multimodal search by using either visual features,
   keywords, or a combination of both. Fourth, OMC-ART employs a ranking
   algorithm that does not need to go through the whole indexing system
   when only a limited number of images need to be retrieved. Experiments
   on two published data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
   of our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents regret-based adaptive search algorithms for
   non-stationary simulation-based discrete optimization problems. The
   proposed algorithm relies on a potential-based sampling strategy that
   prescribes how to successively take samples from the search space.
   Performance analysis shows that the randomly evolving set of global
   optimizers can be properly tracked by showing that the worst case regret
   can be kept arbitrarily small infinitely often. The proposed scheme
   allows temporal correlation of the simulation data, and assumes no
   functional properties on the objective function. Numerical examples show
   that performance gains are obtained in both convergence speed and
   efficiency as compared with random search, simulated annealing, and pure

Abstract = {{Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and associated Markov modulated time series
   are widely used for estimation and control in e.g. robotics,
   econometrics and bioinformatics. In this paper, we modify and extend a
   recently proposed approach in the machine learning literature that uses
   the method of moments and a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) to
   estimate the parameters of an HMM. In general, the method aims to solve
   a constrained non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, it is
   shown that if the observation probabilities of the HMM are known, then
   estimating the transition probabilities reduces to a convex optimization
   problem. Three recursive algorithms are proposed for estimating the
   transition probabilities of the underlying Markov chain, one of which
   employs a generalization of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity to
   recast the problem into a non-constrained optimization problem.
   Numerical examples are presented to illustrate how these algorithms can
   track slowly time-varying transition probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{To solve the mobile traffic explosion problem, there have been many
   efforts to try to offload the mobile traffic from infrastructured
   cellular links to direct local short-range communications among users.
   In this paper, we propose a novel framework of traffic offloading by
   Tag-Assisted Social-Aware opportunistic sharing in mobile social
   networks, TASA, to offload traffic by device-to-device sharing. Based on
   the evaluation of the tags of users and contents, we select a subset of
   users who are likely to receive the same content as initial seeds
   depending on their spreading impacts in online SNSs and their mobility
   patterns in offline MSNs. Then users share the content via opportunistic
   local connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, LTE D2D) with each
   other. The observation from SNS activities reveals that individual users
   have distinct access patterns, which allows TASA to further exploit the
   user-dependent access delay between the content generation time and each
   users access time for traffic offloading purposes. We model and analyze
   the traffic offloading and content spreading among users by taking into
   account various options in linking SNS and MSN trace data. The
   trace-driven evaluation demonstrates that TASA can reduce up to 78.9\%
   of the cellular traffic.}},

   multi-objective optimization method that is capable of finding multiple
   trade-off solutions, not only to choose a preferred solution for
   implementation, but also to have a deeper understanding of the
   interactions among design variables. In this paper, we consider two ship
   design models involving uncertainties in design variables, and
   demonstrate the usefulness of an evolutionary multi-objective
   optimization (EMO) method and subsequent data analysis procedures in
   arriving at valuable design principles that enhance the knowledge of a
   designer. The study is pedagogical yet provide key insights of ship
   design issues and importantly outlines the systematic procedure for
   applying the technology to other more complex design problems.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based design in earthquake engineering is a structural
   optimization problem that has, as the objective, the determination of
   design parameters for the minimization of total costs, while at the same
   time satisfying minimum reliability levels for the specified performance
   criteria. Total costs include those for construction and structural
   damage repairs, those associated with non-structural components and the
   social costs of economic losses, injuries and fatalities. This paper
   studies the influence, on the optimization results, of incorporating
   energy dissipation devices based on steel yielding. We use a general
   framework to approach this problem, using a numerical optimization
   strategy and incorporating the use of neural networks for the evaluation
   of dynamic responses and the reliability levels achieved for a given set
   of design parameters. The strategy is applied to an example of a
   four-story office building, with energy dissipation devices located at
   each floor level. Optimum results show that a minimum control force and
   stiffness is necessary to reduce the replacement of control devices
   after the occurrence of earthquakes, which increases the total life

Abstract = {{Wireless network virtualization has attracted great attentions from both
   academia and industry. Another emerging technology for next generation
   wireless networks is in-band full duplex (FD) communications. Due to its
   promising performance, FD communication has been considered as an
   effective way to achieve self-backhauls for small cells. In this paper,
   we introduce wireless virtualization into small cell networks, and
   propose a virtualized small cell network architecture with FD
   self-backhauls. We formulate the virtual resource allocation problem in
   virtualized small cell networks with FD self-backhauls as an
   optimization problem. Since the formulated problem is a mixed
   combinatorial and non-convex optimization problem, its computational
   complexity is high. Moreover, the centralized scheme may suffer from
   signaling overhead, outdated dynamics information, and scalability
   issues. To solve it efficiently, we divide the original problem into two
   subproblems. For the first subproblem, we transfer it to a convex
   optimization problem, and then solve it by an efficient alternating
   direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed algorithm. The
   second subproblem is a convex problem, which can be solved by each
   infrastructure provider. Extensive simulations are conducted with
   different system configurations to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an orthogonal frequency division multiple
   access based full duplex distributed antenna system (FDDAS) with energy
   recycling capability and develop an energy efficient resource allocation
   scheme for such system. In particular, in order to optimize the energy
   efficiency of FDDAS, we formulate the problem of joint subchannel
   allocation and power control as a mixed integer nonlinear programming
   problem. Since the formulated optimization problem is a NP-hard problem
   whose computation complexity will rise exponentially with larger network
   scale, we develop a low complexity subchannel allocation and power
   control algorithm. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm is
   established. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm for
   FDDAS results in a higher system energy efficiency than the existing
   algorithm for distributed antenna systems without energy recycling
   capability.}},

Abstract = {{Effective capacity is defined as the maximum constant traffic arrival
   rate that a communication channel can support in order to guarantee a
   certain statistical delay constraint. We investigate the effective
   capacity performance of the optical wireless communications employing
   the coherent detection and polarization multiplexing over the
   Gamma-Gamma turbulence fading channels for two different power
   adaptation techniques, namely, independent power adaptation and joint
   power adaptation. In a polarization multiplexing system, independent
   power adaptation allocates transmit power to an orthogonally polarized
   channel considering only the signal-to-noise ratio statistics of that
   particular channel whereas the joint power adaptation allocates transmit
   power to an orthogonally polarized channel considering the joint
   signal-to-noise ratio statistics of both channels. Our analysis reveals
   the superiority of the joint power adaptation technique in order to
   support the stringent statistical delay constraint services over the
   strong turbulence fading channels compared to an independent power
   adaptation technique. However, the numerical results demonstrate that
   the performance gap between the joint and independent power adaptations
   gets significantly reduced as the statistical delay constraints become
   loose and/or the turbulence fading gets weaker.}},

Abstract = {{A unified performance analysis is presented for dualhop
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems operating over non-identically

   model is used to cover various AF relaying schemes, namely,
   variable-gain AF relaying, fixed-gain AF relaying, and channel-assisted
   relaying, as well other unconventional schemes. Although, in some
   applications, systems operating over Rician fading links can be
   approximated and analyzed using equivalent systems operating over
   Nakagami-m fading links, we show that this is not sufficiently accurate
   in the case of AF relaying systems. Therefore, single-fold
   infinite-series expressions for the probability density function (PDF)
   and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the instantaneous
   end-to-end received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of such systems are
   derived, and Monte-Carlo simulations are used to verify the precision of
   the derived expressions. In addition, the effects of the relaying model
   parameters, as well as the channel fading parameters, on system

   Femto-clouds are formed with the aim to avoid the remote cloud costs
   while improving the quality of experience (QoE) of users in terms of
   handling latency. The core of the formulated game represents an optimal
   structure for femto-clouds such that the computational resources of FAPs
   are maximally exploited, yet the incentive earned by each femto-cloud is
   divided among the FAPs in a fair fashion. Numerical simulations using

   of the beamforming technique is to maximize the minimum data rate of the
   SRs subject to transmission power constraints at the SCTs as well as
   asynchronous interference power constraints at the PRs. The optimal
   beamforming design is a quadratically constrained quadratic program
   max-min optimization problem, which is non-convex and non-linear.
   Therefore, we reformulate the optimal beamforming design as a
   quasi-convex problem by using the so-called semidefinite program (SDP)
   relaxation technique that can be solved using the standard SDP solvers
   and bisection method. However, the computational complexity of the
   optimal beamforming technique is high. Therefore, we study important
   properties of the optimization problem and propose a low complexity
   suboptimal beamfoming technique by using the properties.}},

Abstract = {{Many domain-specific ontologies exist. These ontologies are used in text
   mining processes to better understand text that is available within the
   specific domain. Example domains include specific business areas such as
   marketing or functional areas such as particular types of operations
   within the intelligence community. This paper makes a step toward
   developing a broad ontology for the innovation and design process as a
   domain. Such an ontology can be used to better understand the discussion
   that takes places in the design and development of new innovations and
   can be used to better understand the influences on that development. In
   many cases, the success, failure, or final direction of a new innovation
   may not rest upon its technical merits but on the non-technical
   influences during the design and development process such as political
   influences. This paper uses examples within the shipbuilding domain in
   order to take steps toward building an Innovation and Design Process
   Ontology that can be applied to the Technology Delivery System (TDS)
   framework as a means of capturing and understanding the influences on
   the delivery system.}},

Abstract = {{Checkpointing is widely deployed in computer systems to recover from
   failures due to both hardware and software errors. However, as faults
   propagate, checkpoints may become corrupted by saving erroneous states
   and make errors unrecoverable, especially at aggressive checkpoint
   frequencies. In this paper, we proposed a technique that automatically
   analyzes a given program to guide checkpoint strategies in order to
   minimize checkpoint corruptions.
   To understand checkpoint corruptions, we first perform a large-scale
   fault injection study across ten benchmark applications. We then
   classify checkpoint corruptions, and comprehensively characterize the
   fault propagations leading to these corruptions. Leveraging these
   findings, we build RECOV, a compiler-based tool that automatically
   identifies the program locations that have lowest density of fault
   propagation for placing checkpoints, and combines it with low-overhead
   protection techniques. Our experimental results shows that RECOV can
   eliminate nearly 92\% of the checkpoint corruptions with about 5\%
   performance overhead. RECOV reduces the unavailability of the system by
   8.25 times even at very aggressive checkpoint frequencies, showing that
   it is effective in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) platforms are commonly used for
   prototyping complex designs, allowing designers to evaluate and validate
   the functionality at speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than
   simulation. To counter the limited observability of hardware, on-chip
   trace buffers are used to record the behaviour of a small subset of
   signals. To effectively use the limited capacity of these on-chip trace
   buffers, trigger circuitry is required to determine when to start and/or
   stop recording signal behaviour. Although it is possible to implement
   the trigger circuitry and add it to the user circuit at compile time,
   this would require recompiling a design every time the trigger circuit
   is modified, reducing debug productivity. In this paper, we present and
   evaluate an adaptive virtual overlay architecture for rapid trigger
   implementation. The overlay is built from logic and routing resources
   not used by the user circuit, reducing the overhead and impact on the
   user circuit. At debug time, the pre-synthesised overlay architecture
   can quickly be configured to implement the desired trigger
   functionality. We show that our overlay architecture provides
   flexibility required for mapping trigger circuitry with negligible
   impact on delay. We also show trigger mapping is significantly faster
   rather than recompile insertion, increasing debug productivity.}},

Abstract = {{High-level synthesis (HLS) for FPGA designs has gained significant
   traction in recent years. A key component in its adoption is allowing
   users to debug their hardware systems in the context of the original
   source code. This is becoming even more challenging as modern HLS tools
   enable the user to provide multithreaded source code for synthesis to
   hardware. Although recent work has begun to tackle source-level
   debugging of HLS circuits, none have addressed doing this in
   multithreaded circuits. In such systems it may be necessary to observe
   the behaviour of multiple threads for long run times in order to locate
   obscure or non-deterministic bugs and performance issues.
   In this paper we present a trace-based debugging architecture which
   records values from user-selected tracepoints into on-chip memories
   during circuit execution. The recorded values can be provided to the
   user as a cycle-accurate timeline of events to aid them in debugging
   multithreaded HLS circuits. We present a novel technique to allow
   multiple hardware threads to share trace buffers, effectively increasing
   the execution trace that can be recorded. This is accomplished by
   analyzing the control and data flow graph to determine the maximum rates
   at which each thread can encounter tracepoints, using this information
   to select which threads can share trace buffers, and automatically
   generating round-robin circuitry to arbitrate access to the buffers.
   Using this technique we are able to obtain an average of 4X improvement
   in trace length for an 8 thread system. This provides users with a
   longer timeline of execution and greater visibility into the execution
   of multithreaded HLS circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges generated during powder handling often adversely
   influence process performance. In cases where significant charges are
   present, accidental discharge of the accumulated charges may cause
   sparks, fires, even explosions, affecting process performance and
   causing significant safety concerns. Electrostatic charging is a
   complicated phenomenon, especially when handling powder mixtures of
   poly-disperse particles because of bi-polar charging, with small
   particles being charged opposite to their larger counterparts. Bipolar
   charging can lead to agglomeration, segregation and severe adhesion to
   walls or contact surfaces. Therefore, in order to characterize
   electrostatic properties of powders, it is desirable to measure not only
   the net charges on a powder, but also its polarity. In this work, a
   simple method is developed to investigate charge generation due to
   particle-particle collisions and particle-wall contact during powder
   handling. The experimental set-up consisted of two parallel copper
   plates connected to a high voltage power supply and a vibrating charging
   device with adjustable contacting surfaces. When subjected to a static
   electrical field, negatively charged particles moved to the positive
   side of the parallel plates, whereas positively charged particles
   migrated to the negative side. The separation of charged particles under
   investigation indicated bi-polar charging in a polydisperse powder
   system, with smaller particles carrying charges of polarity opposite to
   their larger counterparts. However, smaller particles were also found to
   carry two different charges from a set of fine particle-only experiments
   in binary powder mixtures. This was due to two different charging
   mechanisms: charge transfer and charge separation. In a further study
   with the addition of fine particles to mono-sized powders, the results
   indicated that the addition of fine particles helped reduce the net
   charges of the mixtures, with fine particles tending to carry positive
   charges after powder separation. When a typical antistatic agent
   (Larostat 519) was added to the mono-sized powders, the net charges of
   the mixtures decreased. Particle separation experiments revealed that
   this antistatic agent considerably altered the charging behavior of the
   host powders. This finding implies that the role of Larostat 519 in
   neutralizing charges differs from that of simple addition of other fine
   particles. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep arousals are sudden awakenings from sleep which can be identified
   as an abrupt shift in EEG frequency and can be manually scored from
   various physiological signals by sleep experts. Frequent sleep arousals
   can degrade sleep quality, result in sleep fragmentation and lead to
   daytime sleepiness. Visual inspection of arousal events from PSG
   recordings is time consuming and cumbersome, and manual scoring results
   can vary widely among different expert scorers. This paper reports the
   design and performance evaluation of an effective and efficient method
   to automatically detect sleep arousals using a single channel EEG. A
   detection model, based on a Curious Extreme Learning Machine (C-ELM),
   using a set of 22 features is proposed. The performance was evaluated
   using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
   (AUC) and the Accuracy (ACC). The proposed C-ELM based model achieved an
   average AUC and ACC of 0.85 and 0.79 respectively. The best AUC from
   among the 50 datasets used was 0.88. In comparison, the average AUC and
   ACC of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model were 0.69 and 0.67
   respectively, and the best AUC from among the same 50 datasets used was
   0.88. This indicates that the proposed C-ELM based model works well for
   the sleep arousal detection problem.}},

Abstract = {{The elderly often struggle when interacting with technologies. This is
   because the software and hardware components of the technologies are not
   familiar to the elderly's mental model. This is a lack of empirical
   studies about how the concept of familiarity can be infused into the
   design of interactive technology systems to bridge the digital divide
   preventing today's elderly people from actively engaging with such
   technologies. In this paper, we investigate the impact of familiarity in
   design on the adoption of wellness games for the elderly. We propose a
   familiarity design framework with three familiarity design elements: 1)
   symbolic familiarity; 2) cultural familiarity; and 3) actionable
   familiarity. We then conduct a focused group study involving 10 people
   over 65 years old to experience two wellnesses games - one with
   familiarity based design considerations and one without. The results
   shows that familiarity in design improves the perceived satisfaction and
   adoption likelihood significantly among the elderly users. These results
   can potentially benefit intelligent interface agent designed to interact

Abstract = {{The user behavior is one of the key factors to impact the communication
   performance of vehicular ad hoc networks. Generally, more active
   vehicles can enhance the connectivity performance. Nevertheless, an
   increasing number of active vehicles may bring about significant
   interference and thus negatively affect the connectivity. In this paper,
   a highway model is presented to study the effects of active vehicle
   ratio on connectivity performance in the presence of co-channel
   interference. A closed form expression of the inter-vehicle connectivity
   probability is also derived to evaluate the impacts of active ratio,
   traffic flow, and fading factors under Nakagami fading channel.
   Analytical results of inter-vehicle connectivity probability are shown
   to be consistent with the simulation results, and can be applied to
   estimate connectivity performance with interference in the network

Abstract = {{This paper develops a framework for multi-robot cooperation (MRC) and

Abstract = {{Psi Intelligent Control aims to provide a framework for controlling
   autonomous dynamic systems with prediction capabilities inspired by Psi
   precognition. Psi in nature relates to an event or state not yet
   experienced. Although Psi phenomenon is unexplained, it is an
   inspiration for the present study. The research intends to define and
   develop frameworks and systems capable of providing information for
   predicting future events (e.g., for motion control of an autonomous
   vehicle) and use that information in control of autonomous dynamic
   systems. A generalized approach inspired by Psi precognition is
   proposed, and the effect of this technique in the response of dynamic
   systems is explored. The corresponding parameters and constraints to
   develop and analyze Psi Intelligent Control for dynamic systems are
   discussed. Obtaining optimized solutions while considering uncertainties
   in the system and input parameters are investigated. Optimal Uncertainty
   Quantification is used to obtain optimized solutions for the control of
   the autonomous dynamic system, with imperfectly known response
   functions, input probability measures and parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of Portland cement to soil is a technique widely used to
   improve mechanical properties. This paper presents the findings from a
   laboratory research program to study the mechanical behavior of
   artificially cemented sands. The results of drained triaxial tests
   conducted on specimens of mixture of Fraser River sand and cement are
   presented and discussed. The soil used in this study was sand obtained
   from the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. The specimens were
   prepared using a cement content of 5\% by dry weight of soil to result
   in a void ratio of 0.98 (representing a relatively loose condition) and
   with curing in a wet room for 28 days. The tests indicated that the soil
   displayed dilatant behavior at low effective confining stresses and
   contractive behavior at high effective confining stresses. It was
   possible to define the shear strength characteristics based on the peak
   deviator stress under low effective confining stresses and large-strain
   shear resistance. The peak soil strength under low confining stresses
   could be described using a cohesion intercept of 41.8 kPa and friction
   angle of 29.3o. Under large deformations, a friction angle of 34.2
   degrees was observed which is similar to the constant volume friction
   angle reported for the natural Fraser River sand.}},

Abstract = {{Code coverage is a popular test adequacy criterion in practice. Code
   coverage, however, remains controversial as there is a lack of coherent
   empirical evidence for its relation with test suite effectiveness. More
   recently, test suite size has been shown to be highly correlated with
   effectiveness. However, previous studies treat test methods as the
   smallest unit of interest, and ignore potential factors influencing this
   relationship. We propose to go beyond test suite size, by investigating
   test assertions inside test methods. We empirically evaluate the
   relationship between a test suite's effectiveness and the (1) number of
   assertions, (2) assertion coverage, and (3) different types of
   assertions. We compose 6,700 test suites in total, using 24,000
   assertions of five real-world Java projects. We find that the number of
   assertions in a test suite strongly correlates with its effectiveness,
   and this factor directly influences the relationship between test suite
   size and effectiveness. Our results also indicate that assertion
   coverage is strongly correlated with effectiveness and different types
   of assertions can influence the effectiveness of their containing test
   suites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores solutions to linearized power-flow equations with
   bus-voltage phasors represented in rectangular coordinates. The key idea
   is to solve for complex-valued perturbations around a nominal voltage
   profile from a set of linear equations that are obtained by neglecting
   quadratic terms in the original nonlinear power-flow equations. We prove
   that for lossless networks, the voltage profile where the real part of
   the perturbation is suppressed satisfies active-power balance in the
   original nonlinear system of equations. This result motivates the
   development of approximate solutions that improve over conventional DC
   power-flow approximations, since the model includes ZIP loads. For
   distribution networks that only contain ZIP loads in addition to a slack
   bus, we recover a linear relationship between the approximate voltage
   profile and the constant-current component of the loads and the nodal
   active- and reactive-power injections.}},

   voltage gain of 31.4 dB, and a noise figure of 6.8 dB while consuming
   360 mu W. The second configuration is an LNA that is stacked with a
   voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). It yields a gain of 18.3 dB, a NF

Abstract = {{In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, idle users may
   passively overhear the signal transmitted to the intended user, known as
   internal eavesdroppers. In order to improve the secrecy performance,
   artificial noise (AN) is used jointly with maximum ratio transmission
   (MRT) precoding. Since the idle users can be anywhere in the cell, we
   investigate the secrecy outage probability for the legitimate user by
   taking an expectation over the positions of all internal eavesdroppers.
   Furthermore, according to the secrecy performance of the legitimate user
   in the given location, we define a new concept Secrecy Area centered on
   the base station (BS) where all the legitimate users satisfy the secrecy
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements i.e. secrecy outage probability.
   Then, in order to achieve the maximum Secrecy Area under the given
   secrecy QoS requirements, we derive the optimal power allocation factor
   for AN, which is irrelevant to the channel state information (CSI) of
   both the legitimate user and the eavesdropper. The analytical and
   simulation results show that, by AN-assisted MRT precoding, the secrecy
   performance is significantly improved and the Secrecy Area can be
   efficiently enlarged with a modest increase of the transmit power.}},

Abstract = {{In a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) interference network, the maximum
   achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) determines the

   In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing the minimum SINR of
   independent parallel data streams across all users in a MIMO
   interference network that employs interference alignment (IA) in the
   presence of channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. To this end, we
   propose a low-complexity robust SINR fairness algorithm based on the
   power allocation across data streams. Building on the conventional IA
   design, we provide a closed-form solution for the power allocation
   problem. It is observed that the proposed power allocation (PA)-based
   robust design outperforms the conventional robust design, when the
   channel changes drastically and the CSI uncertainty cannot be reliably
   bounded. Furthermore, the PA-based robust design provides significant
   performance gain over the benchmark Max-SINR algorithm.}},

   practically relevant values of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio
   (SINR) threshold, e.g., beta <= 10 dB, and spreading sequence length,
   e.g., N-c >= 7, the base station is able to estimate the true
   cardinality with vanishing error in only one shot, even if the network
   is so populated, e.g., the number of active devices N >= 100. Otherwise,
   one may apply the proposed method in couple of consecutive shots such

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two opportunistic scheduling algorithms for

   eavesdroppers. Different from the existing works on scheduling
   algorithms with secrecy considerations, we focus on the practical
   scenario where LUs experience diverse path-loss to the base station
   (BS). Hence, both secrecy throughput and fairness among LUs are crucial
   design considerations. In the proposed scheduling algorithms, the
   feedback information generated by each LU is designed to reduce the
   probability that the LU is selected by the BS when the eavesdroppers
   overhear much information. It is proved that fairness among LUs can be
   achieved in arbitrary fading channels. In order to investigate the
   efficiency of our proposed scheduling algorithms, the normalized secrecy
   throughput, i.e., the secrecy throughput for a given LU normalized by
   the probability of it being selected, is analyzed and proved to achieve
   double-logarithmic growth}},

Abstract = {{In future, a massive number of devices are expected to communicate for
   pervasive monitoring and measurement, industrial automation, and
   home/building energy management. Nevertheless, such Machine-to-Machine
   (M2M) communications are prone to failure due to depletion of machines
   energy if the communication system is not designed properly. A key step
   in building energy-efficient protocols for large-scale M2M
   communications is to assess, model or characterize a network energy
   consumption profile. To meet this need, we develop a theoretical and
   numerical framework to evaluate the cumulative distribution function
   (CDF) of the total energy consumption by fully exploiting the properties
   of stochastic geometry. Unlike the other existing approaches, we model
   the transmission energy as a function of transmission power, packet
   size, and link affordable capacity that is a logarithmic function of
   experienced Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). Since it is
   very difficult, if not impossible, to derive a closed-form expression
   for the CDF, we derive numerically computable first-and second-order
   moments of energy consumption. Applying these moments we then propose
   Log-normal and Log-logistic distributions to approximate the CDF. Our
   simulation results show that Log-logistic almost precisely approximates
   the exact CDF.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a hybrid strategy containing pattern search
   (PS) optimization and genetic algorithm (GA) to resolve the problem of
   power allocation in cognitive radio networks. Considering the fluctuant

   the problem of coexistence between licensed users and cognitive users is
   proposed first. Then, based on the analyses of outage probability for
   cognitive users, a corresponding objective function with regard to the
   power allocation over Rayleigh fading channels is obtained. Due to the
   nonlinearity and complexity of this power optimization problem, it is
   uneasy to figure it out directly by using traditional methods, such as
   common mathematical deduction or linear programming. Inspired by the
   concept of intelligent algorithms, we try to employ the scheme of
   combining PS optimization and GA method, which are both efficient
   intelligent algorithms to resolve this difficulty. Furthermore, the
   numerical results are encouraging and show that the proposed approach is
   worthy of consideration in solving the problem of optimal power

Abstract = {{Cooperative transmission is an efficient method for wireless sensor
   networks (WSN) to decrease the power consumption of sensor transmitter
   and counter the detrimental effect of signal fading inherent to wireless
   channels. During the course, a key issue is how the sensor relay should
   handle the balance of assisting other node's communications and
   accomplishing its own tasks and what kind of situation the sensor
   transmitter needs to ask for the cooperation rather than direct
   communication. In this paper, we investigate the potential bargaining
   for resource allocation in WSN over Rayleigh fading environments to
   address the problems by considering the energy fairness for both the
   participants of the cooperative transmission. Based on Rayleigh fading
   channels' characteristics, a relevant system model is first built. Then,
   after analyzing the system capacity in given outage probability over the
   fading channels, a system utility function with regard to the
   transmit-time allocation addressing both participants' energy concern is
   proposed. An iterative algorithm is subsequently achieved by solving the
   Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, essential analyses and discussions on the
   equilibrium existence and convergence conditions of the iterative
   algorithm are provided.}},

Abstract = {{We present and evaluate an algorithm for image reconstruction from a
   small number of projections in 3D x-ray computed tomography (CT). The
   proposed algorithm is similar to the class of projected gradient
   methods. Because each iteration of these algorithms for large 3D CT
   reconstruction is very computationally demanding, our goal is to devise
   an algorithm with fast convergence. To achieve this goal, in the
   proposed algorithm the gradient descent for reducing the measurement
   misfit term is carried out using a stochastic gradient descent iteration
   and the gradient directions are weighted using weights suggested by
   parallel coordinate descent. To further improve the speed of the
   algorithm, at each iteration we minimize the cost function on the
   subspace spanned by the direction of the current projected gradient and
   several previous update directions. We apply the proposed algorithm on
   simulated and real cone-beam projections and compare it with a
   well-known accelerated projected gradient algorithm, Monotone Fast
   Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (MFISTA). Evaluations show
   that the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm is superior to
   that of MFISTA.}},

Abstract = {{A new technique has been developed to facilitate safer personalized
   tourniquet systems for surgery, using a unique dual-purpose tourniquet
   cuff that enables automatic measurement of tourniquet Limb Occlusion
   Pressure (LOP), while overcoming limitations inherent in manual and
   automatic techniques of LOP measurement. A study was performed to
   determine the accuracy of this new technique compared to LOP measured
   using a gold standard Doppler ultrasound technique. 252 pairs of LOP
   measurements were taken from upper and lower limbs of 143 surgical
   patients, enrolled from three different surgical clinics, using the new
   technique and the Doppler technique. LOP difference was defined as new
   technique reading minus Doppler technique reading. The mean LOP
   difference (new-Doppler) +/- SD mmHg was +0.56 +/- 11.73 for all limbs
   (252 limbs), +0.99 +/- 7.79 for upper limbs (134 upper), and +0.08 +/-
   15.03 for lower limbs (118 lower). Additional analysis was performed to
   further improve the performance of the new technique by noise detection
   and by development of rules allowing identification and removal of
   outlier data prior to completion of each LOP measurement. In this study,
   the additional analysis removed 3/252 pairs of LOP measurements and
   reduced the SD: mean LOP difference (new-Doppler) +/- SD mmHg was
   improved to +0.30 +/- 10.31 for all limbs (249 limbs), +0.99 +/- 7.79
   for upper limbs (134 upper), and -0.50 +/- 12.62 for lower limbs (115
   lower). We conclude that the new technique of LOP measurement has
   surgically acceptable accuracy comparable to LOP measurement by Doppler
   ultrasound. Additionally, the new technique may facilitate adoption of
   safer personalized tourniquet systems by incorporating inherent
   advancements over manual and automatic techniques of LOP measurement,
   including: elimination of a distal LOP sensor; reduced procedural
   complexity and surgical time; related improvements in the rate of
   success of LOP determination; and reduced direct and indirect costs.}},

Abstract = {{The automotive Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging research field by
   applying the IoT into the intelligent transportation system. Information
   sharing among objects such as smart mobile devices and vehicles' sensors
   plays an important role in strengthening their partnership in the
   vehicular environment. In this paper, we first consider message trading
   and propose a community-based information sharing (CIS) mechanism to
   motivate all objects to engage in sharing traffic events with each
   other. Specifically, a message processing algorithm and a message
   generating algorithm are proposed to handle incoming messages originated
   from other objects and to share new traffic events with others,
   respectively. Since CIS only uses private information, e.g., location
   data, locally, the proposed mechanism also ensures the privacy of all
   objects during information sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that
   the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the quality of experience
   of human-beings in terms of the average arriving delay.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, much attention has been paid to the green design of wireless
   communication systems using energy efficiency (EE) metrics that should
   capture all energy consumption sources to deliver the required data. In
   this paper, we formulate an accurate EE metric for cooperative two-hop
   systems that use the amplify-and-forward relaying scheme. Different from
   the existing research that assumes the availability of perfect channel
   state information (CSI) at the communication cooperative nodes, we
   assume a practical scenario, where training pilots are used to estimate
   the channels. The estimated CSI can be used to adapt the available
   resources of the proposed system in order to maximize the EE. Two
   estimation strategies are assumed namely disintegrated channel
   estimation, which assumes the availability of channel estimator at the
   relay, and cascaded channel estimation, where the relay is not equipped
   with channel estimator and only forwards the received pilot(s) in order
   to let the destination estimate the cooperative link. The channel
   estimation cost is reflected on the EE metric by including the
   estimation error in the signal-to-noise term and considering the energy
   consumption during the estimation phase. Based on the formulated EE
   metric, we propose an energy-aware power allocation algorithm to
   maximize the EE of the cooperative system with channel estimation.
   Furthermore, we study the impact of the estimation parameters on the
   optimized EE performance via simulation examples.}},

Abstract = {{Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been standardized at the 3GPP since 2008
   and targets the delivery of high data rate services with strict
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. It is now the fastest ever
   growing mobile technology and is gradually becoming the mainstream radio
   access technology used in cellular networks. The latest video coding
   standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), achieves higher
   compression rate than its predecessor Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and
   for the same level of quality uses almost 50\% less bandwidth. HEVC is
   the leading video compression technology that will be used to deliver
   high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) video content to
   users. Extensions of HEVC, such as 3D-HEVC, are now being developed and
   standardized by MPEG to deliver 3D video content. The current issues
   with LTE include its lack of awareness regarding the type of packets
   being transmitted, and their importance to the end user. The aim of this
   paper is to investigate the performance of 3D-HEVC over LTE networks
   using metrics such as packet loss ratio and average user throughput. We
   also propose a cross-layer solution in the form of a packet
   prioritization scheme to help provide better quality-of-experience (QoE)
   to users and demonstrate its advantages over a baseline scheme that is
   not QoE-aware.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an integrated model of top-down and bottom-up visual
   attention with self-awareness for a homecare robot. For mimicking the
   human attention processes, a robot self-awareness model with fuzzy
   decision making system is developed and utilized, which is an important
   improvement on the existing robot attention models. Besides the
   task-driven object-based biasing, a robot self-awareness model can
   generate other parts of top-down biases in a robot visual attention
   model. Some results from the self-awareness model are obtained here. In
   order to update the weights in robot memory, the learning process is
   carried out through the Bayes' rule. Three images are tested to evaluate
   the developed methods. Four types of saliency maps are compared to see
   how self-awareness can affect robot attention selection.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes an automated approach for the analysis of
   right-turn merging behavior of vehicles. Traditional methods for
   collecting merging behavior data are labor intensive, suffer from
   reliability issues, are time consuming, and costly. Automated video
   merging behavior analysis is advocated as alternative data collection
   procedure resolving many shortcomings in the manual data collection. The
   main elements of the behavior analysis include merging conflicts, gap
   acceptance, and lane discipline. Traffic conflicts provide invaluable
   information that can be used to assess safety factors and to understand
   potential collision mechanisms. Gap acceptance is important for
   developing merging vehicles modeling frameworks. Lane discipline of
   merging vehicles is significant in showing potential aggressive and
   dangerous merging maneuvers and driver compliance to traffic rules. The
   article advocates automated computer vision as the engine to capture and
   analyze various merging behavior elements. The analysis is demonstrated
   using a case study from Doha, Qatar. A validation of the results was
   performed that demonstrated the soundness of the methodology and
   potential benefits for automated behavior data collection. The
   microscopic behavior data captured using the proposed automated
   methodology can be useful for use in road design, traffic management and
   safety evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to compare the recorded response of an
   instrumented building in San Jose, California, with the response
   obtained from a finite element model of the building. Three ground
   motions from past earthquakes, one with significantly higher-amplitude
   than the other two, are used for the study. A detailed model of the
   building is created and calibrated using one of the lower-amplitude
   motions. It was demonstrated that the model closely simulates the
   building response under the other low-amplitude motion, while the
   results obtained using the larger motion did not match well with the
   recorded motions. For the higher-amplitude shaking, the building was
   more flexible as its fundamental period increased because of rocking
   effects. Hence, the model has to be updated by including soil-structure
   interaction effects using more flexible translational springs and adding
   vertical springs; resulting in a good match between measured and
   computed motions. As part of the study, the variation of the dynamic
   characteristics of the building obtained from a modal analysis of the
   recorded motions was investigated too. It can be concluded that a
   calibrated model based on only low level recorded motions may not be
   suitable to a higher level ground shaking.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents robust control of large-scale prototypes for
   miniaturized optical image stabilizers (OIS's) with product variations.
   Based on the conceptual design of a miniaturized lens-tilting OIS for
   mobile applications, large-scale 3-DOF prototypes are fabricated as a
   proof of concept. Variations in geometrical parameter of the lens
   platform are produced to mimic unavoidable product variations in
   fabrication of the micro-scale devices. Using frequency response data, a
   model set with real parametric uncertainty is developed to represent the
   dynamics of the prototypes under product variations and force unbalance.
   A robust controller for the model set is designed based on mu-synthesis,
   and the closed-loop performance of hand shake compensation is verified
   experimentally on the prototypes. Experimental results show that the
   designed robust controller outperforms the classical controller
   consisting of lead-lag compensators and notch filters in compensating
   lens vibrations caused by involuntary hand shake while taking photos.}},

   sensor that can measure the pump wear allows for maintaining the

   is designed to measure the structural wear on impeller blades. This
   sensor can be installed on existing pumps and does not require any pump
   modifications. Using a magnetic circuit with the pump and its
   components, wear is estimated by measuring the gap between the impeller
   and the pump housing. As the impeller wears, the gap between the
   impeller and the pump housing increases causing the reluctance of the
   magnetic circuit to increase which in turn reduces the inductance of the
   coil driving the magnetic circuit. This online magnetic sensor includes
   an electronic circuit and has an unamplified sensitivity of 0.60 V/mm.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in nanoscale components assembly have led to the
   invention of low-power and high-density nanofabrics, which can be
   integrated with conventional CMOS transistors. CMOS/nanofabric hybrid
   circuits combine the flexibility and high fabrication yield advantages
   of CMOS technology with ultra fast nanometerscale devices. CMOL is a
   novel architecture which consists of a nanofabric overlay on top of a
   CMOS stack. CMOL can be configured to implement NOR-based logic circuits
   by programming nanodevices placed between the nanofabric's overlapping
   nanowires. Defects rate in nanofabric-based circuits is expected to be
   higher than that of conventional CMOS technology. Misassembly of
   nanodevices will lead to non-programmable crosspoints, while broken
   nanowires will result in unreachable circuit's components. In such
   cases, utilizing CMOS/nanofabric architectures requires robust
   reconfiguration-based defect-tolerance design automation tools that can
   circumvent defective components and insure circuits functionality.
   In this work, we propose a heuristic-based nanofabric reconfiguration
   around defective nano-components in CMOL circuits. Simulated Evolution
   (SimE) is formulated to find circuits configurations that adhere to
   nanowires connectivity constraint and rely on non defective components.
   Circuits of various sizes from ISCAS'89 benchmarks were used to evaluate
   our proposed design. Results show that SimE yield successful
   reconfigurations in acceptable computation time when up to 50\% of
   nanodevices are stuck-at-open and 70\% of nanowires are broken.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grids coulpled with effiicient demand side management (DSM) is an
   important step for greener cities of the future. DSM has the potential
   to significantly improve smart grid operations by reducing the peak to
   average ratio. Current DSM schemes are able to reduce peak load by as
   much as 30\% which can translate to significant cost savings and
   reduction in green house emissions. But for realistic deployment of DSM
   systems in the grid there are two very important aspects which need to
   be considered: scalability and user acceptability. Since the current DSM
   algorithms are required to control potentially hundreds of thousands of
   devices, they have to be scalable and tractable for such myriad numbers.
   On the other hand DSM affects the life style of the consumer and this
   should be as less disruptive as possible. The various DSM techniques
   proposed in the literature attempt to first reduce the cost and then
   attempt to resolve one of the two aforementioned aspects. The result is
   that the techniques are either scalable or are only considerate of the
   deadlines of the consumers. An ideal system should cater to both of
   these aspects. Our system Deli2P is user centric and scalable thus
   catering to both of these aspects. Essentially we provide to the
   consumer a deadline centric interface. The deadlines solutions are
   generally not scalable. But instead of solving this problem as a
   scheduling for deadline problem we transform the problem to a
   priority-based problem thus making it scalable for large number of
   devices. Our results show that with this scheme we can reduce peak power
   by upto 30\% but without violating consumers' deadlines.}},

Abstract = {{Fault tolerance is increasingly important for multirobot systems,
   especially those operating in an unknown and hazardous environments.
   This paper presents a framework for a fault tolerant multi- robot system
   that works cooperatively to achieve a common goal. The proposed
   methodology comprises four key phases: grouping of robots, task
   execution, fault detection, and fault tolerance. Initially robots are
   grouped based on their capabilities. Next, the process of task execution
   takes place during which components of the robots are monitored in real
   time to detect faults. Upon detection of partial or full failure of a
   robot, the other team members respond robustly, reliably, flexibly, and
   coherently while communicating with each other to regroup and perform
   remaining tasks in order to achieve the common goal. The proposed
   methodology is implemented in a group of simulated heterogeneous mobile
   robots that transport multiple objects cooperatively to a goal location
   in an unknown and unstructured environment.}},

Abstract = {{The term Psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy
   transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or
   biological mechanisms {[}1]. A variant of Psi is precognition which
   relates to an event or state not yet experienced. Although Psi
   phenomenon is unexplained, it is an inspiration for the study in the
   present work. The representation of prediction of future events for
   motion control is explained in a framework inspired by Psi precognition.
   In the current research, motion control of an autonomous vehicle is of
   interest where the future state of the vehicle in a dynamic environment
   is predicted using a multi-agent/ robot or a swarm configuration
   approach. This research is aimed to address a problem where an agent in
   a multi-agent/ robot or a swarm configuration can inform the vehicle
   under investigation about the changes in the dynamic environment before
   the vehicle itself can experience or sense an event. The corresponding
   parameters and constraints to solve such problem are discussed. A
   generalized approach inspired by Psi precognition is proposed and the
   effect of this technique in the system response is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Cities today face multifarious challenges, including environmental
   sustainability, and low carbon solutions. Given these trends, it is
   critical to understand how information and communication technology
   (ICT) can benefit the future of city-planning process. Internet of
   Things (IoT) is a futuristic communication concept integrating plethora

   important because of construction and deployment characteristics of

   fault detection and error correction scheme based on redundant residue
   arithmetic, which provides a low complexity, delay tolerant and

Abstract = {{Driving is an integral part of our everyday lives, and the average
   driving time of people globally is increasing to 84 minutes everyday,
   which is a time when people are uniquely vulnerable. A number of
   research works have identified that mobile crowdsensing in vehicular
   social networks (VSNs) can be effectively used for many purposes and
   bring huge economic benefits, e.g., safety improvement and traffic
   management. This paper presents our effort that toward context-aware
   mobile crowdsensing in VSNs. First, we introduce a novel
   application-oriented service collaboration (ASCM) model which can
   automatically match multiple users with multiple mobile crowdsensing
   tasks in VSNs in an efficient manner. After that, for users' dynamic
   contexts of VSNs, we proposes a context information management model,
   that aims to enable the mobile crowdsensing applications to autonomously
   match appropriate service and information with different users
   (requesters and participants) in crowdsensing.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded systems are widely used in critical situations and hence, are
   targets for malicious users. Researchers have demonstrated successful
   attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and
   medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
   for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have
   constraints (such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes
   monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we
   formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem.
   Having the set of the security properties of the system and the
   invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes
   the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available
   memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded
   devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may
   define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also
   propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We
   implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our
   results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of
   memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our
   IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time.
   This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and
   optimizing them.}},

   pump and a thermo-responsive valve. The device is `remotely operated by
   an AC electromagnetic field (40.5 similar to 58.5 mT, 450 kHz) that
   provides the power for the pump and the valve. It is suitable for
   long-term therapy applications, which use a solid drug in reservoir
   (SDR) approach and avoids unwanted drug diffusion. When the
   electromagnetic field is on, the electrolytic pump drives the drug
   towards the valve. The valve is made of a magnetic composite consisting
   of a smart hydrogel: Poly (N-Isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) and iron
   powder. The heat generated in the iron powder via magnetic losses causes
   the PNIPAm to shrink, allowing the drug to flow past it. When the
   electromagnetic field is off, the PNIPAm swells, sealing the outlet. In
   the meantime, the bubbles generated by electrolysis recombine into
   water, causing a pressure reduction in the pumping chamber. This draws
   fresh fluid from outside the pump into the drug reservoir before the
   valve is fully sealed. The recombination can be accelerated by a
   platinum (Pt) coated catalytic reformer, allowing more fluid to flow
   back to the drug reservoir and dissolve the drug. By repeatedly turning
   on and off the magnetic field, the drug solution can be delivered
   cyclically.}},

Abstract = {{A levitation system, which is composed of a highly oriented pyrolytic
   graphite (HOPG) rotor and NdFeB permanent magnets, is proposed in this
   paper. The diamagnetic force between the HOPG rotor and the NdFeB
   magnets contributes to the levitation and friction-free rotation of the
   rotor. The rotor is first designed as a disc with four blades. Force
   analysis and levitation characteristics are carried out in finite
   element software COMSOL (TM). The highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
   (HOPG) rotor was successfully fabricated with mu EDM
   (micro-electro-discharge machining) system. A laser displacement sensor
   and a mass flow controller are used to characterize the levitation
   height and rotation speed of the rotor. The levitation height of 130
   square m observed with the rotor matches well with the simulation
   result. The revolution of the rotor is demonstrated by applying gas
   flow, showing stable, continuous actuation with the maximum rate of 500
   rpm. These promising results suggest potential applications of the
   mechanism toward frictionless microsensors and micromotors.}},

Abstract = {{Low cost and low power scalar embedded processors can issue only a
   single instruction per cycle which results in longer execution time for
   applications and consequently lower energy efficiency. Superscalar
   processor that can issue multiple instructions per cycle are more energy
   efficient than scalar processors, however, they consume more power which
   is severely limited in embedded systems that operate on small batteries
   or energy harvesting power sources. In this paper we propose an energy
   efficient dual-issue embedded processor that can deliver up to 60\%
   improvement in IPC (instruction-per-cycle) performance with less than
   20\% increase in power consumption compared to a single-issue embedded
   processor. In contrast to traditional multi-issue embedded processors
   that use power intensive superscalar techniques to extract
   instruction-level parallelism from applications, the proposed processor
   uses simple hardware techniques to resolve instruction scheduling
   conflicts. The processor is optimized for implementation on low cost
   FPGAs suitable for power sensitive embedded applications.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) refers to a spectrum of hip
   joint abnormalities that may lead to significant adverse consequences if
   not detected and treated early in infancy. Clinical exam with selective
   ultrasound (US) imaging is the current standard used for early detection
   and diagnosis of DDH in infants up to 6 months of age. However, current
   US systems require specialized training and have considerable
   between-center variability, which raises concerns of missed early
   diagnoses and subsequent complications from late treatment. We propose a
   novel, automatic, and near real-time image analysis approach that
   extracts bone contours in US images of the neonatal hip and calculates
   image based dysplasia metrics (alpha and beta angles). We present
   quantitative validation on 54 US scans of femoral head flexion collected
   from 10 infants under age of 3 months.}},

   adjacent voxels to share similar regression coefficients despite of
   spatial noise; 2) an iterative voxels (groups) merging and adaptive

Abstract = {{Brain Computer Interfaces ( BCI) aim at providing a means to control
   devices with brain signals. Self-paced BCIs, as opposed to synchronous
   ones, have the advantage of being operational at all times and not only
   at specific system-defined periods. Traditionally, in the BCI field, a
   sliding window over the brain signal is used to detect the intention of
   the user at a given time. This approach ignores the temporal
   correlations between the adjacent time windows. This paper proposes a
   novel approach to classify self-paced BCI data using structural support
   vector machines. Our proposed approach considers the history of the
   brain signals in the context of sequential supervised learning to better
   detect the intention of the user from his/her brain signals. We have
   compared our proposed model to the sliding window approach with Support
   Vector Machines ( SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA)
   classifiers. Using data collected from 4 individuals form BCI
   competition IV, it is shown that the F-1 score of our approach is
   significantly better than the sliding window approach. The average F-1
   score of our method across all subjects is 0.3 and 0.5 higher than the
   sliding window with SVM and LDA classifiers, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Line-commutated thyristor-controlled AC/DC and AC/AC converters are
   commonly used in high power industrial applications. Therefore,
   analyzing industrial distribution systems requires accurate and
   computationally efficient models that may be easily implemented in
   simulation software packages. Average-value models (AVMs) avoid the
   discrete switching of the converters, provide accurate system-level
   steady-state and transient simulation results, which make such models
   particularly suitable for large scale studies of power electronic
   systems. Parametric average value modeling (PAVM) is one of very
   promising techniques resulting in accurate models that are also
   considerably simpler in terms of mathematical complexity. The PAVMs for
   AC/DC converter systems have been thoroughly analyzed in literature.
   This paper proposes a new PAVM for AC/AC cyclo-converters which supply
   the load at lower AC frequencies. The superior performance and
   computational advantages of the proposed PAVM of cyclo-converters are
   verified against the detailed model in terms of CPU efficiency as well
   as numerical accuracy.}},

   efficient models in power electronics simulation modeling and simulation
   programs. The switch-level detailed models of such rectifier systems can
   be readily implemented using commercially available transient simulation
   packages. To improve the simulation efficiency for the transient
   studies, the so-called parametric average-value modeling (PAVM)
   technique has been developed. The PAVM provides models with accurate
   steady-state and transient simulation results with considerably lower
   mathematical complexity and computational burden, avoiding the discrete
   switching states of converters, making it suitable for large-scale
   system-level studies. In this paper, performance of PAVM of
   thyristor-controlled rectifiers is investigated for unbalanced
   conditions. The results show that the PAVM of thyristor-controlled
   rectifier provides a good approximation of transient and steady-state
   operation behavior of the detailed model even under unbalanced
   conditions while demonstrating improvements in terms of numerical
   efficiency and simulation speed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the implementation and design process of integrating an
   adaptive digital PID control scheme on an existing 650W LLC DC-DC
   resonant converter is presented. The objective is to improve the
   converter's dynamic response while maintaining adequate gain and phase
   margins over several different operating ranges and to improve the
   converter's ability to reject the 120Hz disturbance produced from the AC
   line source. The small signal models of the converter are obtained using
   MATLAB's System Identification Toolbox, which estimates a mathematical
   model based on the empirical uncompensated loop-gain frequency response
   data collected either from PSIM simulation or from the physical
   converter using a Venable frequency response analyzer. Compensator
   designs are based on the estimated models and digital control is
   performed using a TMS320F28035 digital signal microcontroller.
   Simulation and experimental results are presented which validates the
   estimated model and the compensator design process. The adaptive
   compensation control performance is compared to a typical single
   compensation controller to show the performance advantages.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids are an attractive option in remote areas with elevated
   renewable resources. However, with or without grid connection,
   microgrids often results in weak grids. Hence, microgrids are much
   affected by the power variations and require energy storage systems to
   smooth them out. Flywheel based energy storage systems (FESSs) are
   gaining momentum in microgrids as, despite the limited amount of stored
   energy, they allow to interchange high power and have long useful
   lifetime. In addition, the state-of-charge is very simple to estimate as
   it only consists on measuring the spinning speed. In FESSs, the flywheel
   is attached to an electrical machine, which is connected to the grid
   through a back-to-back converter. Controlling the three phase converter
   as a virtual synchronous machine allows to overcome instability issues
   of the PLL-based control in a weak grids. For his reason, his paper
   proposes to control the grid-side converter of the FESS as a virtual
   synchronous machine. Small signal analysis is applied to the equations
   of the virual synchronous machine. The DC-link voltage is regulated by
   the machine-side converter. Simulation results are provided to
   illustrate the proposed concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic interaction between various sources and loads in
   power-converter-based DC systems has been an area of increasing interest
   and research for several decades. Stability of a DC distribution system
   at a particular interface may be analyzed by looking at the source and
   load impedances in frequency domain, for which appropriate models are
   required. Since most of the sources and loads are switching converters
   with significant discontinuities, these studies are typically conducted
   by using appropriate average and small-signal models. Having appropriate
   accurate models will make it possible to run simulations and analyze the
   system in frequency domain. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive
   system identification of a commercially available Flyback converter that
   is used as a source in 48/24 VDC telecom DC power systems. The derived
   detailed and average-value models are verified experimentally. The
   identified source model is used in the investigation of dynamic
   stability of the considered DC distribution system with constant power
   loads (CPLs).}},

Abstract = {{Multiport converter (MPC) can be identified as an effective conversion
   structure due to their higher power density and reduced component count.
   In traditional multiple-stage converter system, each input source and
   output load are interconnected through a DC bus using independent
   converters to exchange power. When the number of the input sources and
   output loads increases, the number of converters increases, thus
   resulting in more complicated structure. As a prominent alternative, MPC
   can be introduced to simplify the multiple-stage converter system. This
   paper presents some simple methods for deriving MPCs based on
   conventional two-port converters. By decomposing the two-port converters
   into pulsating source cells (PSCs) and output filter cells (OFCs), MPCs
   can be synthesized with multiple of those cells.}},

Abstract = {{High-level synthesis (HLS) for FPGA designs has received considerable
   attention in recent years. To make this design methodology mainstream,
   improved debugging technologies are essential. Ideally, a user should be
   able to debug their design using the original source code, without
   detailed knowledge of the underlying hardware, while the circuit
   executes in-situ. Although recent work has made progress toward this
   goal, existing solutions lack a full system for obtaining visibility
   into circuits that have been heavily optimized by the compiler. HLS
   compilers typically perform many optimizations, including moving
   variable values out of memories and into registers distributed
   throughout the design. Debugging such circuits typically requires either
   understanding the hardware and probing the appropriate RTL-level
   registers, or ignoring these variables while debugging the design,
   neither of which is desirable.
   In this work we present a new signal-tracing technique, specifically
   designed for circuits that have been optimized by an HLS tool. We build
   on past work which extracts information from the HLS process to
   determine which signals are relevant to record each cycle. We
   automatically embed circuitry which dynamically selects the relevant
   signals, cycle-by-cycle, and records them into on-chip memories. In
   addition, we explore techniques to balance tracing between cycles to
   further improve memory efficiency. For each 100Kb of memory allocated to
   trace buffers, our technique can, on average, record and replay 4322
   lines of source code, versus 141 lines using conventional tracing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Binary Content Addressable Memories (BCAMs), also known as associative
   memories, are hardware-based search engines. BCAMs employ a massively
   parallel exhaustive search of the entire memory space, and are capable
   of matching a specific data within a single cycle. Networking, memory
   management, pattern matching, data compression, DSP, and other
   applications utilize CAMs as single-cycle associative search
   accelerators. Due to the increasing amount of processed information,
   modern BCAM applications demand a deep searching space. However,
   traditional BCAM approaches in FPGAs suffer from storage inefficiency.
   In this paper, a novel, efficient and modular technique for constructing
   BCAMs out of standard SRAM blocks in FPGAs is proposed. Hierarchical
   search is employed to achieve high storage efficiency. Previous
   hierarchical search approaches cannot be cascaded since they provide a
   single matching address; this incurs an exponential increase of RAM
   consumption as pattern width increases. Our approach, however,
   efficiently regenerates a match indicator for every single address by
   storing indirect indices for address match indicators. Hence, the
   proposed method can be cascaded and exponential growth is alleviated
   into linear. Our method exhibits high storage efficiency and is capable
   of implementing up to 9 times wider BCAMs compared to other approaches.
   A fully parameterized Verilog implementation is being released as an
   open source library. The library has been extensively tested using
   Altera's Quartus and ModelSim.}},

Abstract = {{Peak energy harvesting in Photovoltaic (PV) systems requires fast and
   effective Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) detection. Incremental
   Conductance (InCond) MPPT is one of the most popular detection methods,
   given its simple implementation and accuracy. In this paper, a new
   InCond technique is proposed based on small-signal identification and
   adaptive-step using a Lock-In Amplifier (LIA). The use of small-signal
   identification virtually eliminates the losses typically encountered in
   traditional large-signal MPPT perturbations. This feature improves the
   steady-state efficiency, while the LIA allows for robust and accurate
   measurement of the equivalent AC resistance to achieve maximum power
   extraction, even in the presence of noise. The proposed algorithm
   enables fast tracking during both static and changing environmental
   conditions, as well as smooth operation in steady-state. The proposed
   implementation reduces the adaptive-step InCond to a simple
   Discrete-Time Integral Controller, simplifying its analysis and
   configuration. Overall, the proposed implementation delivers superior
   results with similar hardware both during transients and in steady
   state. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the
   proposed implementation, and to illustrate its behavior in steady and

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel power management solution for
   resource-constrained devices in the context of Internet of Things (IoT).
   We focus on smartphones in the IoT, as they are getting increasingly
   popular and equipped with strong sensing capabilities. Smartphones have
   complex and asynchronous power consumption incurred by heterogeneous
   components including their on-board sensors. Their interaction with the
   cloud allows them to offload computation tasks and access remote data
   storage. In this work, we aim at monitoring the power consumption
   behaviours of the smartphones, profiling both individual applications
   and the system as a whole, to make better decisions in power management.
   We design a cloud orchestration architecture as an epic predictor of
   behaviours of smart devices by extracting their application
   characteristics and resource utilization. We design and implement this
   architecture to perform energy profiling and data analysis on massive
   data logs. This cloud orchestration architecture coordinates a number of
   cloud-based services and supports dynamic workflows between service
   components, which can reduce energy consumption in the energy profiling
   process itself. Experimental results showed that small portion of
   applications dominate the energy consumption of smartphones. Heuristic
   profiling can effectively reduce energy consumption in data logging and
   communications without scarifying the accuracy of power monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud service selection and financial expense are two main concerns of
   users considering adoption of cloud computing services. In this paper,
   we propose a novel cloud federation that is cognitive to the dynamic
   prices. The cloud federation system first determines on which cloud
   services should the user applications be deployed. Then, when a cloud
   provider is charging too high for a VM, the proposed system
   automatically migrates user tasks to a cloud system that is charging at
   a lower rate. We discuss the architectural framework and platform
   design, provide a mathematic formulation and investigate a total service
   fee minimization approach with privacy constraints. Preliminary
   simulation results demonstrate the proposed system can lower the cost of
   cloud services by exploiting the advantages of different price policies
   provided by multiple cloud providers.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating ubiquitous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and powerful
   cloud computing (CC), Sensor-Cloud (SC) is attracting growing attention
   from both academia and industry. However, pricing for SC is barely
   explored. In this paper, filling this gap, five SC pricing models (i.e.,
   SCPM1, SCPM2, SCPM3, SCPM4 and SCPM5) are proposed first. Particularly,
   they charge a SC user, based on 1) the lease period of the user; 2) the
   required working time of SC; 3) the SC resources utilized by the user;
   4) the volume of sensory data obtained by the user; 5) the SC path that
   transmits sensory data from the WSN to the user, respectively. Further,
   analysis is also presented to study and demonstrate the performance of
   the proposed SCPMs. We believe that the pricing designs and analysis
   performed in this work could be a very valuable guidance for future
   researches regarding pricing in SC.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of people are severely injured or killed in road accidents
   every year and most of these accidents are caused by human error.
   Fatigue and negative emotions such as anger adversely affect driver
   performance, thereby increasing the risk involved in driving. Research
   has shown that listening to the right kind of music in these situations
   can ameliorate driver performance and improve road safety. Context-aware
   music delivery systems succeed in delivering suitable music according to
   the situation through the process of music mood-mapping which identifies
   the mood of a song. Additionally, we can leverage the power of the cloud
   to enable crowd sensing of the mood-mapping of various songs and enhance
   the effectiveness of situation-aware music delivery for drivers. The
   cloud can be used to aggregate the crowd sensed music mood-mapping data
   and improve the effectiveness of music delivery by providing accurate
   mood-mappings from the aggregated data. Currently, context-aware music
   delivery systems consider only features from the song for music
   mood-mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to music
   mood-mapping for drivers which also incorporates the social context of a
   driver including age, gender and cultural background to enhance the
   effectiveness of music delivery in context-aware music recommendation
   systems for drivers.}},

Abstract = {{Over recent years, the demand for rich multimedia services over mobile
   networks has been soaring at a tremendous pace. However, it is
   envisioned that traditional dedicated networking equipment in mobile
   network operators (MNOs) cannot support the phenomenal growth of the
   traffic load and user demand dynamics, but consume unnecessary energy
   resource inefficiently. The emerging techniques for mobile content
   caching and delivery become more and more attractive, by which popular
   content can be cached inside mobile front-haul and back-haul networks,
   so that demands to the same content from users in proximity can be
   easily accommodated without redundant transmissions from the remote
   resource, thereby eliminating duplicated traffic significantly. While
   the incorporation between advanced cloud computing technologies and
   network function virtualization (NFV) techniques has become an essential
   issue in the evolution process of mobile systems, in this article, we
   propose the concept of ``Caching-as-a-Service{''} (CaaS), a caching
   virtualization framework along with the development of Cloud-based Radio
   Access Networks (C-RAN), and the virtualization of Evolved Packet Core
   (EPC). Then we study the potential techniques related to the cache
   virtualization, and discuss technical details of caching virtualization
   and system optimization for CaaS. We carry out numerical evaluation on
   proposed framework and show significant improvement on the performance
   of reducing inter-MNO traffic load and intra-MNO traffic load.}},

Abstract = {{In smart cities, cellular network plays a crucial role to support
   connectivity anywhere and anytime. However, the communication demand
   brought by applications and services is hard to predict. Traffic in
   cellular networks might fluctuate heavily over time to time, which
   causes burden and waste under different traffic states. Recently, small
   cell was proposed to enhance spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency
   in cellular networks. However, how green the small cell network can be
   is still a question because of the accompanying interference. To meet
   this challenge, new green technologies should be developed. In this
   paper, we propose a green small cell planning scheme considering dynamic
   traffic states. First, we predefine a set of candidate locations for
   base stations (BSs) in a geographical area and generate a connection
   graph which contains all possible connections between BSs and user
   equipments (UEs). Then we adopt a heuristic to switch off small cell BSs
   (s-BSs) and update BS-UE connections iteratively. Finally we obtain a
   cell planning solution with energy efficiency without reducing spectrum
   efficiency and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The simulation
   results show that our dynamic small cell planning scheme has low
   computational complexity and achieves a significant improvement in
   energy efficiency comparing with the static cell planning scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) extracts information about how
   energy is being used in a building from electricity measurements
   collected at a single location. Obtaining measurements at only one
   location is attractive because it is inexpensive and convenient, but it
   can result in large amounts of data from high frequency electrical
   measurements. Different ways to compress or selectively measure this
   data are therefore required for practical implementations of NILM. We
   explore the use of random filtering and random demodulation, techniques
   that are closely related to compressed sensing, to offer a
   computationally simple way of compressing the electrical data. We show
   how these techniques can allow one to reduce the sampling rate of the
   electricity measurements, while requiring only one sampling channel and
   allowing accurate NILM performance. Our tests are performed using real
   measurements of electrical signals from a public data set, thus
   demonstrating their effectiveness on real appliances and allowing for
   reproducibility and comparison with other data management strategies for
   NILM.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on the problem of joint load scheduling and
   generation management to better match supply and demand. We formulate an
   optimization problem to jointly minimize the generation cost and
   discomfort cost of the users subject to the voltage and power balance
   equations for the equivalent circuit of the power system. The optimal
   power flow (OPF) equations are solved using semidefinite programming
   (SDP) relaxation technique. In our system model, we assume that users
   can exploit renewable energy resources (RERs). RERs are random in nature
   and may cause voltage variations in different nodes of the system. To
   minimize the risk of having high voltage values, a barrier term is added
   to the objective function. This term is calculated based on the concept
   of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Simulation results show that
   compared to the case where there is no control over the load, our
   proposed algorithm reduces the generation cost by better matching the
   generation and demand. Moreover, the proposed algorithm reduces the
   voltage variations at different nodes of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a low-complexity scheme for the integration of
   power-line communication (PLC) and visible-light communication (VLC)
   systems. Rather than decoding the PLC signal prior to transmission from
   an LED luminary, a simple all-analog PLC/VLC amplify-and-forward (AF)
   module is described. The incoming PLC signals, which occupy a band of
   2-28 MHz, are frequency down-shifted prior to transmission to increase
   the usable bandwidth of the LEDs. The required DC bias is then added to
   make the signals compatible with intensity modulation/direct detection
   (IM/DD). In addition to DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM), spatial
   optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) is applied to PLC/VLC integration. In SO-OFDM,
   the LEDs are divided into groups, and each group of LEDs is modulated by
   a different filtered OFDM signal. The results show that frequency
   down-conversion of the PLC spectrum prior to forwarding provides an
   improvement in capacity, while SO-OFDM provides a peak-to-average power
   ratio (PAPR) reduction which translates into improved capacity when the
   VLC link is operating in the high signal-to-noise ratio (high-SNR)

   the same time, this technology requires transmission of multiple video
   streams and depth maps, increasing the necessity for efficient

   multiview compression by introducing a method that corrects depth maps
   to achieve high quality synthesized views while significantly reducing
   the required bitrate. Our proposed method uses a three-phase depth map
   correction, including eliminating anomalies, segmentation, depth value
   correction, and finally inter-frame and intra-frame filtering.
   Subjective performance evaluations show that our method yields high
   quality synthesized views while significantly reduces the required
   bandwidth for the corrected depth maps (up to 48\%).}},

Abstract = {{In smart grid, demand response is a viable approach to motivate users
   towards shifting the demand during the peak load periods. Each user can
   also benefit by reducing its total cost. In most of the existing
   studies, the demand response program is modeled as a one-shot game among
   myopic users, who aim to minimize their cost in one period of time. In
   this paper, we show that the Nash equilibrium (NE) in the one-shot game
   can be inefficient in reducing the peak load demand and the users' cost.
   We address the inefficiency of the NE by modeling the demand response
   program as a repeated game. A grim-trigger strategy is proposed to
   determine the subgame perfect equilibrium. To address the issue of
   fairness, we partition the set of users into groups. In each time
   period, only one group of users are required to participate in the
   demand response program. Simulation results show that the proposed
   demand response repeated game can benefit both the users, by reducing
   their long-term cost, and the utility company, by reducing the
   peak-to-average ratio in the aggregate load demand.}},

Abstract = {{The transition from electromechanical to advanced smart meters offers
   great opportunities in load management, energy saving, and resource
   optimization. However, the fine-grained usage data collected by the
   smart meters also raises privacy concerns. The household load profile
   can be analyzed by non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to infer
   customer activity routines and behavioral preference. Several data
   obfuscation techniques based on controlling a local rechargeable battery
   or a controllable load have been proposed to mitigate the privacy
   leakage of the customers. In this paper, we introduce the use of
   electric vehicles (EVs) for load hiding. In particular, we propose an
   EV-assisted battery load hiding algorithm, which combines the use of an
   EV with a local rechargeable battery to achieve the dual purpose of
   optimal charging and measurement obfuscation. Since EVs are becoming
   increasingly popular and part of many households, their use renders the
   implementation of load hiding less costly compared to methods only using
   dedicated rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, EVs provide more
   flexibility than other household loads in terms of energy storage. We
   evaluate our proposed algorithm using real data for electricity price,
   household consumption, and EV parameters. Adopting mutual information as
   a measure for information leakage, numerical results show that the
   proposed algorithm can reduce the customer's cost while maintaining the
   expected privacy level.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) can be coordinated by an aggregator to
   participate in the electricity day-ahead market (DAM) and provide
   frequency regulation service. In the DAM, a short-term forward contract
   is made between the aggregator and an independent system operator (ISO).
   The contract specifies the contract size, which is the amount of
   regulation capacity provided by the aggregator for each hour of the next
   day. However, since the capacity of the aggregator is provided by many
   EVs instead of a single source, the challenge is how to efficiently
   aggregate the small and uncertain individual capacity and determine the
   optimal size of the forward contract. We consider two cases for the
   contract between the aggregator and the ISO. In the first case, the
   aggregator needs to ensure that the capacity provided by the EVs on the
   next day will meet the amount specified in the contract. In contrast, in
   the second case, the ISO allows an update of the contract size. A
   stochastic program is formulated to determine the contract size for both
   cases. Our problem formulation incorporates risk management using the
   conditional value at risk (CVaR). Chance constraints are embedded when
   the contract size is fixed. We tackle the chance constraints using the
   Markov inequality and propose an efficient algorithm. The EV charging
   data collected in the province of British Columbia, Canada, is used to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results
   show that the proposed algorithm improves the revenue of the aggregator
   compared to an existing algorithm from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communication is becoming a critical technology
   to improve the spectral efficiency in cellular communication systems.
   Although many upper-layer protocols have been designed for D2D
   communications, these work did not consider the specific characteristics
   of D2D channels, such as low antenna height and dual mobility, due to
   the lack of adequate D2D channel models. To promote research on these
   aspects, in this paper, different geometry-based stochastic models
   (GBSMs) are evaluated to facilitate channel-oriented D2D communication
   system design and optimization. Firstly, based on the specific
   characteristics of D2D channels, different GBSMs are introduced for D2D
   channels, their spatial correlation and Doppler properties are analyzed.
   Next, the space-time-frequency characteristics metrics including spatial
   cross-correlation function and Doppler power spectral density are used
   to evaluate the different channel models with different scenarios.
   Simulation results show that GBSMs can be easily modified to adapt
   different D2D communication scenarios, and the application of GBSMs have
   enormous relationship with D2D communication scenarios.}},

   rectifier. A second stage converter, either a classical boost or buck
   converter, converts the fluctuating voltage from the first stage to a
   regulated output voltage. The application of the tracking load is
   illustrated with experimental results for a CMOS class D rectifier and a
   10 W class F GaN RF rectifier.}},

Abstract = {{Soft clay deposits are known to potentially affect the character of
   seismic ground motion by amplifying it and making more destructive. A
   reliable seismic site response analysis is required to quantify these
   affects. An essential element of a reliable site response analysis is a
   constitutive model that can realistically describe the stress-strain
   response of the soil deposits and capture the effects of initial and
   evolving anisotropy, proper degradation of strength, and reduction of
   shear modulus during cyclic loading. When such representative models are
   robustly implemented in a nonlinear effective stress numerical platform
   they can be used to properly simulate the seismic wave propagation
   through clay deposits. A recent bounding surface extension of the
   SANICLAY family of models possesses most of the features required for
   cyclic response of clays, and provides a realistic accumulation of
   plastic shear strains, and a representative simulation of modulus
   reduction and damping ratio curves during successive loading cycles. The
   model, named SANICLAY-B, is implemented in the effective stress fully
   coupled nonlinear dynamic finite element program OpenSees. The superior
   features of the SANICLAY-B model, in comparison to the original SANICLAY
   model, have been illustrated in numerical simulation of propagation of
   seismic waves through saturated soft clay deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Research on pile groups in resisting lateral loading is usually based on
   analysis, field and centrifuge tests of small pile groups. The
   interaction between piles is modelled by modifying the lateral
   resistance p-y curves developed for a single pile or by using a group
   factor for the entire group to simulate the effect of soil-pile-soil
   interaction. The modifying factors for the p-y curves and the
   appropriate group factors for pile groups are based entirely on static
   tests and there is no direct verification that these factors are
   appropriate to handle the dynamic loading of earthquake induced ground
   motions. In this paper we investigate the interaction effects between
   piles under static and seismic loading using the computer
   programVERSAT-P3D. The analytical procedure is calibrated using data
   from static experimental tests of 3 x 3 pile groups. The group sizes
   were expanded to 4 x 4, 5 x 5, 8 x 8, 10 x 10, 10 x 2 and 15 x 2 for the

Abstract = {{Performance analysis of a water distribution system (WDS) under pipe
   failure can be studied from different aspects. Performance analysis
   techniques are mostly restricted to the single performance index of

   to study the performance of a WDS in three aspects of adequacy, equity
   and efficiency of water delivery simultaneously. Results reveal that
   evaluating the performance of a WDS in just one aspect cannot guaranty
   the perfect overall performance of the WDS in future from all aspects.
   This study recommends octant/quadrant analysis as a more comprehensive

Abstract = {{The performance of an ad-hoc network is greatly limited by collisions
   due to hidden terminals. In this paper, we propose a receiver tracking
   contention (RTC) scheme, which achieves high throughput by allowing the
   receivers to assist for channel contention. In RTC, link is the basic
   unit for channel access contention. Specifically, transmitter is used to
   contend for the channel and receiver is used to announce the potential
   collision. Based on INT message coding scheme, transmitter and its
   corresponding receiver can be well coordinated. In such mechanism,
   hidden terminals are avoided and exposed terminals are encouraged to
   transmit simultaneously. Based on OFDM modulation, RTC packets several
   subcarriers as subcontention unit and operates channel contention over
   multiple subcontention units. Furthermore, each subcontention unit
   maintains a transmission set, where collision-free links are allowed to
   merged into the transmission set. In this case, the transmission set of
   subcontention unit can be aggregated after each contention period. When
   the subcontention unit i is the smallest index of non-empty
   subcontention unit, the transmission set of unit i will win the channel
   contention and transmitters of unit i will start to transmit in the
   following data transmission period. Analysis and simulation results show
   that RTC achieves a notable throughput gain over Baclaf as high as 190\%
   through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In cloud manufacturing for regional industrial cluster, there is
   increasing necessity of collaboration among enterprises or facilities.
   It is valuable to explore the characteristics of these collaboration
   behaviors for effectively scheduling dispersed manufacturing facilities
   and organizing their collaboration. The collaborative relation of
   manufacturing in regional industrial cluster can be described as a
   generalized social collaboration network. In this paper, we introduce
   the relevant entities and relations of facilities collaboration, and
   propose the method for building Facility Collaboration Network (FCN). We
   further design the dynamically growing process of FCN for different
   facility selection strategies, including random selection, balanced
   selection, random selection with preference and balanced selection with
   preference. Based on the metrics such as network scale, node degree
   distribution, act degree distribution, average shortest distance and
   number of cliques, we present the statistical characteristics of FCN,
   and analyze relevant characteristics and laws for efficient facilities
   selection in cloud manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first microactuator that selectively and
   simultaneously produces rotational and linear motions of its
   rotor/slider targeted at applications for minimally invasive active
   catheters. The magnet rotor/slider component is levitated by ferrofluid
   accumulated around it inside a catheter tube, achieving low-friction
   actuation for electromagnetic rotation of the component and/or its
   pneumatic sliding along the tube's axis. A microfabricated prototype of
   the actuator is coupled with a prism mirror to demonstrate full
   3-dimentional (3D) scanning of an energy beam, verifying the designed
   functionality of the actuator. Testing of the prototype reveals a
   superior axial stability of rotation over the preceding device with no
   linear actuation function. The results indicate a promising potential
   for circumferential 3D imaging usable for different types of endoscopic

Abstract = {{A stainless-steel (SS) chip of capacitive pressure sensor and its new

   through thermal bonding of the chip dies made of medical-grade SS to the
   Au-polyimide diaphragm film. The capacitive cavity design with dead-end
   holes is verified to increase the pressure sensitivity. Laser
   microwelding is applied to permanently bond the sensor chips onto SS
   substrates. The microwelding is revealed to provide twice the mechanical
   strength and similar to 6x electrical conductance in its bond compared
   with a conductive epoxy case. The microwelded sensor exhibits an average
   sensitivity of 120 ppm/mmHg close to its pre-welding level. The welding
   integration with a SS antenna stent is demonstrated. The results suggest
   that laser microwelding is a promising packaging technique for SS-based

Abstract = {{Since the temporal and spatial correlations of sensor readings are
   existent in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), this paper develops a
   clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme by integrating network
   coding (NC) and compressed sensing (CS) for correlated data. The proper
   selections of NC coefficients and measurement matrix are designed for
   this scheme. This design guarantees the reconstruction of clustered
   compression data successfully with an overwhelming probability and
   unifies the operations of NC and CS into real field successfully.
   Moreover, in contrast to other spatio-temporal schemes with the same
   computational complexity, the proposed scheme possesses lower
   reconstruction error by employing the independent encoding in each
   sensor node (including the cluster head nodes) and joint decoding in
   sink node. At the same time it has lower computational complexity as
   compared with JSM-based spatio-temporal scheme by exploiting the
   temporal and spatial correlations of original sensing data step by step.
   Finally, the simulation results verify that the clustered
   spatio-temporal compression scheme outperforms the other two compression
   schemes significantly in terms of recovery error and compression gain.}},

Abstract = {{While energy efficiency is essential to extend the battery life of
   embedded devices, performance cannot be ignored. High performance
   superscalar embedded processors are more energy efficient than low
   performance scalar processors, however, they consume more power which is
   very limited in battery operated or self powered embedded industrial
   devices. In this paper we propose an energy efficient dual-issue
   embedded processor that can deliver up to 60\% improvement in IPC (
   instruction-per-cycle) performance with less than 20\% increase in power
   consumption compared to a single-issue scalar processor. In contrast to
   traditional multi-issue embedded processors that use power intensive
   superscalar techniques to extract instruction-level parallelism from
   applications, the proposed processor uses simple hardware techniques to
   resolve instruction scheduling conflicts. The processor is optimized for
   implementation on low cost FPGA which makes it a suitable candidate for
   cost sensitive embedded industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise in popularity of robot-mediated teleconference

   In this work, we compare the efficacy of a conventional keyboard and a
   non-contact, gesture-based, Leap interface in controlling the
   display/camera of a 7-DoF (degrees of freedom) telepresence platform for
   remote collaboration. Twenty subjects participated in our usability
   study where performance, ease of use, and workload were compared between
   the interfaces. While Leap allowed smoother and more continuous control
   of the platform, our results indicate that the keyboard provided
   superior performance in terms of task completion time, ease of use, and
   workload. We discuss the implications of novel interface designs for
   telepresence applications.}},

   The architecture of our system is similar to that of a universal joint
   in that a hollowed sphere (the eyeball), hosting a miniature CMOS color
   camera, takes the part of the cross shaft that connects a pair of hinges
   that are oriented at 90 degrees of each other. This concept allows the
   motors to remain static, enabling placing them in multiple
   configurations during the mechanical design stage facilitating the
   inclusion of other robotic parts into the robots head. Based on our

Abstract = {{As the rate of transient hardware faults increases, researchers have
   investigated software techniques to tolerate these faults. An important
   class of faults are those that cause long-latency crashes (LLCs), or
   faults that can persist for a long time in the program before causing it
   to crash. In this paper, we develop a technique to automatically find
   program locations where LLC causing faults originate so that the
   locations can be protected to bound the program's crash latency.
   We first identify program code patterns that are responsible for the
   majority of LLC causing faults through an empirical study. We then build
   CRASHFINDER, a tool that finds LLC locations by statically searching the
   program for the patterns, and then refining the static analysis results
   with a dynamic analysis and selective fault injection-based approach. We
   find that CRASHFINDER can achieve an average of 9.29 orders of magnitude
   time reduction to identify more than 90\% of LLC causing locations in
   the program, compared to exhaustive fault injection techniques, and has
   no false-positives.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is a prospective technique of interference
   management in wireless networks, and jamming is a potential threat for
   security, which will degrade the performance of IA networks severely.
   However, the jamming issue is simply ignored in the existing IA studies.
   In this paper, we propose a novel anti-jamming scheme for the IA-based
   network, in which there exists an adversarial jammer outside the network
   intending to interrupt the transmission of IA users. In the proposed
   scheme, the jamming and interferences are constrained into the same
   subspace at each receiver, and thus the jamming signal can be eliminated
   perfectly along with interferences. To achieve this goal, more antennas
   should be equipped or fewer data streams can be transmitted in the
   network. Thus the feasibility conditions of the proposed scheme are
   derived in the cases of one and more streams for each user,
   respectively. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness
   of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A general model for queue-aware radio resource management (RRM) and
   scheduling in a slotted-time communication system employing a finite
   data buffer is studied under quasi-static fading channel condition.
   Queue-awareness therefore dominates the RRM and scheduling problem.
   According to the buffer queue state in each time slot, the system
   adaptively selects transmission mode or schedules the available radio
   resources. The resulting queue-aware sub-fading-block scheduling
   improves resource utilization when long coherence time is experienced,
   without resorting to physical layer techniques such as opportunistic
   beamforming which require more sophisticated RF hardware at the
   transmitter. The scheduling problem is then formulated as an infinite
   horizon Markov decision process (MDP) which is irreducible under
   arbitrary resource allocation policy. The dynamic programming (DP)
   approach is employed to solve the MDP problem. Two DP algorithms, namely
   relative value iteration (RVI) and policy iteration with relative policy
   evaluation (PIRE) are investigated. Numerical results for single user
   adaptive modulation show that both algorithms effectively approach the
   optimal scheduling policy obtained by exhaustive search in the average
   queue length minimization and the average packet blocking plus packet
   retransmission minimization problems. A significant performance
   improvement over random RRM policy and equal buffer partitioning
   queue-aware policy is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Secure transmission in large-scale MISO systems employing artificial
   noise (AN) is studied under the per-antenna constant envelope (CE)
   constraint. Achievable secrecy rate of the per-antenna CE precoding
   scheme for large-scale MISO is analyzed and compared with that of the
   matched filter linear precoding. A two-stage per-antenna CE precoding
   scheme for joint signal-plus-AN transmission is proposed. The first
   stage determines the per-antenna CE precoding for the
   information-bearing signal. A properly generated AN using an iteration
   algorithm is incorporated into the transmit signal in the second stage
   such that the combined signal-plus-AN satisfies the per-antenna CE
   constraint and the AN is orthogonal to the user channel. It is shown
   that compared to conventional per-antenna CE transmission, this joint
   signal-plus-AN secure transmission scheme does not require additional
   transmit power. An alternative low-complexity AN generation scheme which
   uses a separate antenna to cancel the AN leakage to the intended user
   introduced by randomly generated AN is also proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware errors are becoming more prominent with reducing feature sizes,
   however tolerating them exclusively in hardware is expensive.
   Researchers have explored software-based techniques for building error
   resilient applications for hardware faults. However, software based
   error resilience techniques need configurable and accurate fault
   injection techniques to evaluate their effectiveness. In this paper, we
   present LLFI, a fault injector that works at the LLVM compiler's
   intermediate representation (IR) level of the application. LLFI is
   highly configurable, and can be used to inject faults into selected
   targets in the program in a fine-grained manner. We demonstrate the
   utility of LLFI by using it to perform fault injection experiments into
   nine programs, and study the effect of different injection choices on
   their resilience, namely instruction type, register target and number of
   bits flipped. We find that these parameters have a marked effect on the
   evaluation of overall resilience.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a single-link cooperative communication
   system, where the half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay does not
   have its own energy supply. Instead, it harvests energy from the
   interference and the signal received from the source and uses that
   harvested energy for relaying operation. For such systems, we develop
   joint optimal allocation of the transmit powers of the source and relay
   nodes and the power-splitting ratio allocation scheme. In particular, in
   order to maximize the end-to-end system throughput by joint optimal
   allocation of the transmit powers of the source and relay nodes and the
   power-splitting ratio, we formulate an optimization problem. The
   resulting problem is a non-convex polynomial program, which is hard to
   solve optimally and efficiently. Therefore, we develop an efficient
   solution by transforming, relaxing, and modifying the original problem.
   Numerical results show that our developed scheme performs very close to
   the optimal solution with reduced complexity and provides an intuitive
   direction on how to exploit the interference so as to achieve a good
   throughput performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and implementation of low-power CMOS
   radio-frequency (RF) receiver (Rx) building blocks that operate at 2.4
   GHz. The design approach exploits the biasing of MOS devices in their
   moderate inversion region to optimize the trade-off between the
   performance and the power consumption. A cascade of a low-noise
   amplifier (LNA) and a mixer achieves a voltage gain of 31.4 dB, and a
   noise figure (NF) of 6.8 dB while consuming 360 mu W. A 101 mu W
   voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is also demonstrated. Several
   low-power architectures, including a combination of an LNA with a VCO,
   are also presented. A proof-of-concept prototype for the combined
   LNA-VCO is implemented in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process. The circuit consumes
   240 mu W from a 0.8 V supply, and achieves a gain of 18.3 dB, an NF of

Abstract = {{A generic sensor network architecture is developed, combining
   Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) concepts.
   Distributed sensor nodes consist of a local controller (Raspberry-Pi
   board), to pre-process and format data collected from several sensors,
   and an Ethernet and power management circuit, to interface with
   PoE-enabled Ethernet ports. The system design follows a client-server
   architecture: by combining PoE with the IoT, the endpoint clients and
   servers (PoE controller modules) can communicate in local area network
   using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Clients can send
   commands to observe sensor data, change data acquisition sampling rate,
   and post new sensor resources. As data gets observed by clients, it can
   be further stored in a custom-designed HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5)
   file format, for post-processing, visualization and data management. The
   convergence of data and power flow control enables a smart power
   management at the network level - most of the sensor nodes will be
   powered-up (awoken) only after custom triggering events detected by a
   main subset of always-on sensing nodes. These PoE controller modules are
   intended for structural and environment monitoring in one of the tallest
   wooden tower in the world, to be built in UBC campus. The generic
   architecture may be further adopted in the future for other types of
   applications, like environmental monitoring or human health.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the environmental impact of wind farms has been receiving
   increasing attention. As land is more extensively exploited for onshore
   wind farms, they are more likely to be in proximity with human
   dwellings, infrastructure (e.g. roads, transmission lines) and
   environmental features (e.g. rivers, lakes, forests). As a result of
   regulatory constraints, this proximity causes significant portions of
   the wind farm terrain to become unusable for turbine placement. In this
   work, we present a constrained, continuous-variable model for layout
   optimization that takes noise and energy as objective functions, based
   on Jensen's wake model and ISO-9613-2 noise calculations. A
   multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the
   optimization problem, considering a set of land use constraints, which
   are handled with static and dynamic penalty functions. A set of test
   cases with different number of turbines and percentages of land
   availability are solved. Results from this bi-objective optimization
   model illustrate how the severity of the land use constraints affects
   the trade-off between energy generation and noise production.}},
