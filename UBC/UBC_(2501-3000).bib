Abstract = {{In this paper a novel methodology is presented to incorporate
   uncertainties associated with seismic loads, characterization of
   structural model parameters, and description of soil properties in the
   probabilistic assessment of seismic-related damage of existing jacket
   type offshore platforms located in seismic active areas.
   The main objective of this methodology is to facilitate the
   probabilistic analysis of soil-pile-structure interactions (SPSI) by
   implementing a Comprehensive Interaction Incremental Dynamic Analysis
   (Comprehensive Interaction IDA) method that involves the convolution of
   uncertainties associated with three separate elements: structure, piles
   and supporting soil. This quantitative seismic analysis procedure
   consists of: a) selecting an appropriate suite of strong ground motion
   records and performing a Comprehensive Interaction IDA on a nonlinear
   model of an existing fixed platform; b) summarizing the Comprehensive
   Interaction IDA results into various percentile performance bounds; and
   c) integrating the results with respect to hazard intensity-recurrence
   relations into a probabilistic seismic format To address and propagate
   these uncertainties, the Latin Hypercube Sampling technique in
   conjunction with the Simulated Annealing optimization is applied to
   evaluate their effects on the structural responses with a relatively
   small number of simulations. The proposed methodology with the ability
   of incorporating uncertainties in existing platforms can be effectively
   used to evaluate the structural integrity in other industries. (C) 2014

Title = {{Evaluating the treatment of a synthetic wastewater containing a

   removal efficiency and effects on juvenile rainbow trout}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) can evade degradation
   in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and can be chronically discharged into
   the environment, causing concern for aquatic organisms, wildlife, and
   humans that may be exposed to these bioactive chemicals. The ability of
   a common STP process, conventional activated sludge (CAS), to remove
   PPCPs (caffeine, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, estrone, 17
   alpha-ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, naproxen, 4-nonylphenol, tonalide,
   triclocarban and triclosan) from a synthetic wastewater was evaluated in
   the present study. The removal of individual PPCPs by the
   laboratory-scale CAS treatment plant ranged from 40 to 99.6\%. While the
   efficiency of removal for some compounds was high, remaining quantities
   have the potential to affect aquatic organisms even at low
   concentrations. Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were
   exposed to influent recreated model wastewater with methanol (IM,
   solvent control) or with PPCP cocktail (IC), or CAS-treated effluent
   wastewater with methanol (EM, treated control) or with PPCP cocktail
   (EC). Alterations in hepatic gene expression (evaluated using a
   quantitative nuclease protection plex assay) and plasma vitellogenin
   (VTG) protein concentrations occurred in exposed fish. Although there
   was partial PPCP removal by CAS treatment, the 20\% lower VTG transcript
   levels and 83\% lower plasma VTG protein concentration found in
   EC-exposed fish compared to IC-exposed fish were not statistically
   significant. Thus, estrogenic activity found in the influent was
   retained in the effluent even though typical percent removal levels were
   achieved raising the issue that greater reduction in contaminant load is
   required to address hormone active agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between coronary arterial blood pressure,
   plaque morphology and composition, and sites of fibrous cap (FC)
   bursting, has been the focus of many recent studies. Instability of
   atherosclerotic plaques, defined as the propensity for FCs to burst, has
   been thought to occur at places where FCs are thin and necrotic core
   (NC) areas are large and highly compliant. However, here we show
   quantitatively, using a fiber-reinforced, anisotropic and hyperelastic
   FE model, that FC thickness and NC size and compliance alone are limited
   in predicting vulnerable and high-risk plaques. We suggest that plaque
   instabilities primarily occur at sites of high and concentrated
   mechanical stresses irrespective of fibrous cap thickness or NC area and
   compliance. Also, limitations of imaging techniques, such as
   intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, for providing
   input into (FE) models of atherosclerosis are discussed. The proposed
   model can be used to predict vulnerable plaque sites and rupture risks
   in patients. The current study also provides a framework for future
   research in which three-dimensional platform and viscoelastic properties
   of plaque composition can be considered in time-dependent and fatigue
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{A novel separation process for detoxifying cadmium-containing residues
   arising from zinc hydrometallurgical processes has been developed. The
   solution of sulfuric acid and ammonium citrate ((NH4)(3)C6H5O7) is used
   as the lixiviant to partially extract copper and other metals from the
   residue at room temperature. Copper in the leachate is recovered by
   solvent extraction (SX) with LIX 973. Cobalt in the raffinate from the
   copper SX process is recovered by precipitation with
   alpha-nitroso-beta-naphthol. Zinc remaining in the solution, at high
   concentrations, is further separated from cadmium by solvent extraction
   with P204 (di(2-ethylhexly)phosphoric acid, D2EHPA). The results show
   that around 50\% of the copper and virtually all the zinc, cadmium and
   cobalt in the residue can be leached under the experimental conditions
   used here. Virtually all dissolved copper and cobalt can be recovered in
   the subsequent solvent extraction and precipitation processes. The
   presence of (NH4)(3)C6H5O7 could significantly facilitate the extraction
   of zinc by D2EHPA. More than 97\% of the dissolved zinc can be recovered
   through a two-stage counter current solvent extraction process. After
   separating copper, cobalt and zinc, cadmium can easily be recovered from
   the solution either by cementation with zinc powder or by
   electrowinning, while the purified solution can be recycled back to the
   leaching process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{58-65}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{The extent of fouling control in air sparged submerged membrane systems
   is dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions generated by sparging and
   the resulting shear stress induced onto membranes. Although the optimal
   sparging conditions (i.e. bubble size and frequency) that promote
   fouling control remain unclear, recent studies suggest that pulse bubble
   sparging is more efficient for fouling control than coarse bubble
   sparging. The present study demonstrated that pulse bubble sparging was
   substantially more effective at transferring power to the membranes than
   coarse bubble sparging. Pulse bubble sparging required approximately
   50\% less power for fouling control than coarse bubble sparging. The
   spatial distribution of fouling was not homogenous in the system; lower
   fouling rates were observed in the zone of influence of bubbles. The
   width of the zone of influence induced by gas sparging increased with
   bubble size and frequency, indicating that the size and frequency of
   bubbles can be optimized to minimize the required number of spargers in
   a system and therefore the total volume of gas required for fouling
   control. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{220-232}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Numerical errors form a major source of uncertainty in CFD simulations.
   This source of error, which is more significant on unstructured meshes,
   can be alleviated by a careful choice of discretization scheme. In the
   context of finite volume methods, there are many suggestions for the
   discretization of diffusive fluxes appearing in viscous flow
   simulations. In this paper, a wide range of discretization schemes
   commonly used for diffusive flux approximation in cell-centered
   unstructured finite volume solvers are compared in terms of
   discretization and truncation errors. In addition, a novel eigenanalysis
   tool is proposed to relate these two forms of numerical error to each
   other and to interpret the error behaviors obtained by each scheme. The
   error comparisons are performed on unstructured meshes consisting of
   both isotropic and anisotropic triangles. Our results suggest that
   adding a solution jump term to the baseline face gradient (determined as
   the average of two adjacent cell gradients) provides the most accurate
   approximation for diffusive fluxes. Also, this term produces sufficient
   damping to stabilize the discretization even on highly skewed meshes.

   (PXRD) measurements on these hydrates were performed for temperatures in
   the range of 93-183 K, and the a-axis and c-axis lattice constants and
   the small and medium sH cage occupancies were determined. The PXRD
   results show that the a-axis lattice constants of the three clathrate
   hydrates are close in magnitude, but at each temperature, for the c-axis
   lattice constants c(CH4) > c(Kr) > Or). Parrinello-Rahman molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the three sH dathrate

   lattice constants at different temperatures were reproduced by the
   simulations. The dynamics of the small cage guests are characterized by
   the velocity autocorrelation functions. The experiments and computations

Abstract = {{This article reports on the construction and predictive models for a
   platform comprised of an engineered tethered membrane. The platform
   provides a controllable and physiologically relevant environment for the
   study of the electroporation process. The mixed self-assembled membrane
   is formed via a rapid solvent exchange technique. The membrane is
   tethered to the gold electrode and includes an ionic reservoir
   separating the membrane and gold surface. Above the membrane, there is
   an electrolyte solution, and a gold counterelectrode. A voltage is
   applied between the gold electrodes and the current measured. The
   current is dependent on the energy required to form aqueous pores and
   the conductance of each pore. A two-level predictive model, consisting
   of a macroscopic and a continuum model, is developed to relate the pore
   dynamics to the measured current. The macroscopic model consists of an
   equivalent circuit model of the tethered membrane, and asymptotic
   approximations to the Smoluchowski-Einstein equation of electroporation
   that is dependent on the pore conductance and the energy required to
   form aqueous pores. The continuum model is a generalized
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck (GPNP) system where an activity coefficient to
   account for steric effects of ions is added to the standard PNP system.
   The GPNP is used to evaluate the conductance of aqueous pores, and the
   electrical energy required to form the pores. As an outcome of the setup
   of the device and the two-level model, biologically important variables
   can be estimated from experimental measurements. To validate the
   accuracy of the two-level model, the predicted current is compared with
   experimentally measured current for different tethering densities.}},

   immersed in MgCl2 solutions had the lowest corrosion rate, while samples
   immersed in the NaCl solutions showed the worst performance. The longer
   expected durability of samples immersed in MgCl2 was attributed to the
   lower corrosion kinetics, and a greater surface coverage by the

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{162-172}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D granular model has been developed to simulate solidification
   during fusion welding of Al alloys. The model simulates the gradual
   development of the weld mushy zone composed of both continuous liquid
   films and solidifying grains by coupling thermal fields based on the
   Rosenthal equation, a modified Voronoi tessellation to provide grain
   structure at the mesoscale, and the evolution of solid fraction within a
   grain based on the Scheil equation. The shape and geometry of the
   columnar and equiaxed grains within the weld pool has been characterized
   from experiments, and therefore the model can be used to link the
   solidification behaviour of individual grains to the macroscopic
   properties of the weld. The gradual formation of microscale liquid
   channels lying along the grain boundaries within the mushy zone is
   investigated and the role of welding parameters, including amperage and
   welding speed, on transitions in the semisolid microstructure is
   explored. The study reveals that the ability of the microscale liquid
   channels to feed molten metal into the solidifying areas is not uniform
   through the weld, and is strongly affected by grain size since smaller
   grains hinder the feeding ability of the mushy zone. (C) 2014 Acta

Title = {{Large-Scale Synthesis of TiO2 Microspheres with Hierarchical

Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{17}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a simple and reproducible synthesis strategy was employed
   to fabricate TiO2 microspheres with hierarchical nanostructure. The
   microspheres are macroscopic in the bulk particle size (several hundreds
   to more than 1000 mu m), but they are actually composed of P25
   nanoparticles as the building units. Although it is simple in the
   assembly of P25 nanoparticles, the structure of the as-prepared TiO2
   microspheres becomes unique because a hierarchical porosity composed of
   macropores, larger mesopores (ca. 12.4 nm), and smaller mesopores (ca.
   2.3 nm) has been developed. The interconnected macropores and larger
   mesopores can be utilized as fast paths for mass transport. In addition,
   this hierarchical nanostructure may also contribute to some extent to
   the enhanced photocatalytic activity due to increased multilight
   reflection/scattering. Compared with the state-of-the-art photocatalyst,
   commercial Degussa P25 TiO2, the as-prepared TiO2 microsphere catalyst
   has demonstrated significant enhancement in photodriven conversion of
   CO2 into the end product CH4. Further enhancement in photodriven
   conversion of CO2 into CH4 can be easily achieved by the incorporation
   of metals such as Pt. The preliminary experiments with Pt loading reveal
   that there is still much potential for considerable improvement in TiO2
   microsphere based photocatalysts. Most interestingly and significantly,
   the synthesis strategy is simple and large quantity of TiO2 microspheres
   (i.e., several hundred grams) can be easily prepared at one time in the
   lab, which makes large-scale industrial synthesis of TiO2 microspheres
   feasible and less expensive.}},

Title = {{The presence of nitrate dramatically changed the predominant microbial
   community in perchlorate degrading cultures under saline conditions}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Perchlorate contamination has been detected in both ground
   water and drinking water. An attractive treatment option is the use of
   ion-exchange to remove and concentrate perchlorate in brine. Biological
   treatment can subsequently remove the perchlorate from the brine. When
   nitrate is present, it will also be concentrated in the brine and must
   also be removed by biological treatment. The primary objective was to
   obtain an in-depth characterization of the microbial populations of two
   salt-tolerant cultures each of which is capable of metabolizing
   perchlorate. The cultures were derived from a single ancestral culture
   and have been maintained in the laboratory for more than 10 years. One
   culture was fed perchlorate only, while the other was fed both
   perchlorate and nitrate.
   Results: A metagenomic characterization was performed using Illumina DNA
   sequencing technology, and the 16S rDNA of several pure strains isolated
   from the mixed cultures were sequenced. In the absence of nitrate,
   members of the Rhodobacteraceae constituted the prevailing taxonomic
   group. Second in abundance were the Rhodocyclaceae. In the nitrate fed
   culture, the Rhodobacteraceae are essentially absent. They are replaced
   by a major expansion of the Rhodocyclaceae and the emergence of the
   Alteromonadaceae as a significant community member. Gene sequences
   exhibiting significant homology to known perchlorate and nitrate
   reduction enzymes were found in both cultures.
   Conclusions: The structure of the two microbial ecosystems of interest
   has been established and some representative strains obtained in pure
   culture. The results illustrate that under favorable conditions a group
   of organisms can readily dominate an ecosystem and yet be effectively
   eliminated when their advantage is lost. Almost all known
   perchlorate-reducing organisms can also effectively reduce nitrate. This
   is certainly not the case for the Rhodobacteraceae that were found to
   dominate in the absence of nitrate, but effectively disappeared in its
   presence. This study is significant in that it reveals the existence of
   a novel group of organisms that play a role in the reduction of
   perchlorate under saline conditions. These Rhodobacteraceae especially,
   as well as other organisms present in these communities may be a
   promising source of unique salt-tolerant enzymes for perchlorate
   reduction.}},

   assessment}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{90-101}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Current dominant methods for slope stability analysis are the limit
   equilibrium method and the strength reduction method. Both methods are
   based on the limit equilibrium conditions. However, the limit
   equilibrium methods are limited to the rigid body assumption, while the
   strength reduction method is computationally expensive and has
   convergence issues due to the non-linear iterative computations. In this
   paper, we propose a current stress-based search algorithm to directly
   obtain the critical slip surface and the safety factor. The numerical
   manifold method, which unifies the continuum and discontinuum analysis
   problems, is used for stress analysis to obtain the stress distribution
   of soil slopes or rock slopes cut by joints. Based on the stress results
   obtained, a graph theory is used to convert the solution of the critical
   slip surface to a shortest path problem, which can be directly solved by
   the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The proposed method couples the numerical
   manifold method and the graph theory allowing for stability analyses of
   both rock and soil slopes within the same framework. The method
   completely removes the computational effort needed for iterations in the
   strength reduction method as well as eliminating the rigid body
   assumptions in the limit equilibrium method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Initial Instability in Total Ankle Replacement: A Cadaveric
   Biomechanical Investigation of the STAR and Agility Prostheses}},

Abstract = {{Background: Design improvements have increased the success of total
   ankle replacement, providing patients with end-stage ankle arthritis a
   viable alternative to arthrodesis. However, revision rates are higher
   than those for hip and knee arthroplasty, with the most prevalent cause
   of failure being aseptic loosening. The objective of this study was to
   quantify and compare the relative bone-implant motion patterns in two
   well-known total ankle replacement designs.
   Methods: A custom-designed mechanical simulator applied compressive
   loads (up to 300 N) and bending moments (3 Nm) to six pairs of human
   cadaveric ankles implanted with total ankle replacements, inducing a
   natural range of motion about three orthogonal axes: plantar
   flexion-dorsiflexion, inversion-eversion, and internal-external
   rotation. The implants analyzed were the Agility and the STAR
   (Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement). The relative bone-implant
   motions for each implant component were measured with use of an optical
   motion capture system.
   Results: The Agility typically exhibited greater relative motion than
   the STAR, with significant differences for the tibial component in
   inversion-eversion (p = 0.037) and for the talar component in
   internal-external rotation (p = 0.039). The magnitudes of the relative
   motions were affected by the loading direction and by compression. The
   motion magnitudes were quite large, with values exceeding 1000 mm for
   the Agility talar component in plantar flexion-dorsiflexion and in
   inversion-eversion.
   Conclusions: The greater magnitudes of relative motion in the Agility
   suggest that primary instability of the implant may contribute to its
   higher clinically observed aseptic loosening rate. Future total ankle
   replacement designs will require better fixation to improve outcomes.
   The results underscore the need to conduct preclinical biomechanical
   assessments of relative motion patterns in ankle replacements.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{19-39}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework that integrates existing climate
   conditions with a Geographical Information System (GIS) to develop an
   on-demand dangerous goods (DG) routing support system. The framework
   focuses on mitigating the risks associated with DG transportation via
   route selection. Evidently, DG routing involves a number of decisions
   that require the consideration of multiple and sometimes conflicting
   risks. As a result, the framework includes a number of different routing
   criteria pertaining to safety, efficiency, security, and cost. The
   framework was applied to a large-scale transportation network
   representing the Metro Vancouver area. The network was represented
   spatially in a GIS database along with a real-time dispersion plume
   model to simulate a specific chemical release under local weather
   conditions. The results show that different routing criteria lead to
   different optimal route choices. The authors also compared route
   selection based on the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) for protection
   and isolation actions with route selection based on dispersion models.
   The comparison results show that, when employing the ERG in a small
   spill scenario, decision-makers are at risk of exposing a large number
   of individuals to severe health effects. Vice. versa, if the ERG was to
   be followed in a large spill scenario, many individuals who are not at
   risk would be unnecessarily evacuated. This translates into increased
   evacuation costs, and wastes the time and effort of emergency personnel.
   The study shows that these issues are properly addressed if a dispersion
   model is used to refine the estimation of the impact zone by including
   measures that are specific to the shipment.}},

Title = {{Creating flexible mappings between Building Information Models and cost
   information}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{107-118}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{During the early design stages of construction projects, accurate and
   timely cost feedback is critical to design decision making. This is
   particularly challenging for cost estimators, as they must quickly and
   accurately estimate the cost of the building when the design is still
   incomplete and evolving. State-of-the-art software tools typically use a
   rule-based approach to generate detailed quantities from the design
   details present in a building model and relate them to the cost items in
   a cost estimating database. In this paper, we propose a generic approach
   for creating and maintaining a cost estimate using flexible mappings
   between a building model and a cost estimate. The approach uses queries
   on the building design that are used to populate views, and each view is
   then associated with one or more cost items. The benefit of this
   approach is that the flexibility of modem query languages allows the
   estimator to encode a broad variety of relationships between the design
   and estimate. It also avoids the use of a common standard to which both
   designers and estimators must conform, allowing the estimator added
   flexibility and functionality to their work. Crown Copyright (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In magnetic resonance imaging, it is a common to acquire multiple scans
   of the K-space so that the effects of noise and motion artifacts can be
   reduced by averaging the K-space scans. However, sampling the full
   K-space is time consuming; to reduce the scan time, compressed sensing
   (CS)-based reconstruction algorithms are employed to recover images from
   partially sampled K-space scans. A recent study showed that the recovery
   can also be achieved by exploiting the rank deficiency of the underlying
   images. In this paper, we will show how the reconstruction can be
   further improved by combining CS techniques with low-rank recovery
   methods. Our proposed formulation leads to a least-square minimization
   problem that is regularized by an l(1)-norm and a nuclear norm. There is
   no efficient and accurate algorithm to solve this problem; therefore, we
   derive an algorithm to solve the said problem based on the Split Bregman
   approach. The results show that our proposed technique reduces the
   reconstruction error by about 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) using
   convolutional codes in nonfading channels can be significantly improved
   if the coded bits are not interleaved at all. This particular BICM
   system is referred to as BICM trivial (BICM-T). In this paper, we
   analyze a generalized BICM-T system that uses a nonequally spaced signal
   constellation in conjunction with a bit-level multiplexer in an additive
   white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. As such, one can exploit the full
   benefit of BICM-T by jointly optimizing different system modules to
   further improve its performance. We also investigate the performance of
   the considered BICM-T system in the Gaussian mixture noise (GMN) channel
   because of its practical importance. The presented numerical results
   show that an optimized BICM-T system can offer gains up to 1.5 dB over a
   non-optimized BICM-T system in the AWGN channel for a target bit error
   rate of 10(-6). The presented results for the GMN channel interestingly
   reveal that if the strength of the impulsive noise component, i.e., the
   noise component due to some ambient phenomenon in the GMN, is below a
   certain threshold level, then the BICM-T system performs significantly
   better as compared to traditional BICM system.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of acquiring and transmitting EEG signals in
   Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) in an energy efficient fashion. In
   WBANs, the energy is consumed by three operations: sensing (sampling),
   processing and transmission. Previous studies only addressed the problem
   of reducing the transmission energy. For the first time, in this work,
   we propose a technique to reduce sensing and processing energy as well:
   this is achieved by randomly under-sampling the EEG signal. We depart
   from previous Compressed Sensing based approaches and formulate signal
   recovery (from under-sampled measurements) as a matrix completion
   problem. A new algorithm to solve the matrix completion problem is
   derived here. We test our proposed method and find that the
   reconstruction accuracy of our method is significantly better than
   state-of-the-art techniques; and we achieve this while saving sensing,
   processing and transmission energy. Simple power analysis shows that our
   proposed methodology consumes considerably less power compared to
   previous CS based techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The current state of practice for the seismic design of basement walls
   in Vancouver is based on the Mononobe-Okabe (M-O) method using a peak
   ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.46g mandated by the National Building
   Code of Canada (NBCC). A series of dynamic numerical analyses are
   conducted to study the seismic performance of basement walls designed
   for the M-O earth pressures derived from different fractions of the
   current building code mandated PGA. The walls are subjected to seven
   ground motions spectrally matched to the uniform hazard spectrum (UHS)
   prescribed by the NBCC for Vancouver. The analyses show that current
   engineering practice for designing basement walls based on the M-O
   method and using a PGA of 0.46g is too conservative. The analyses
   suggest that a wall designed using a 50\%-60\% PGA will give an
   acceptable performance in terms of drift ratio. The results of
   sensitivity analyses on input parameters are also presented and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we perform receiver design for a diffusive molecular

   sources of information molecules in addition to the transmitter, and
   enzymes in the propagation environment to mitigate intersymbol

   observations to show how often independent observations can be made. We
   derive the maximum likelihood sequence detector to provide a lower bound
   on the bit error probability. We propose the family of weighted sum
   detectors for more practical implementation and derive their expected
   bit error probability. Under certain conditions, the performance of the
   optimal weighted sum detector is shown to be equivalent to a matched
   filter. Receiver simulation results show the tradeoff in detector
   complexity versus achievable bit error probability, and that a slow flow
   in any direction can improve the performance of a weighted sum detector.}},

Title = {{Calibrating Road Design Guides Using Risk-Based Reliability Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Existing geometric design guides provide deterministic design criteria
   for highway elements that ignore the uncertainty associated with many
   design parameters. Reliability analysis has been advocated as an
   approach to account for this uncertainty and to evaluate the risk
   associated with a particular design feature. This paper discusses one
   important application of reliability analysis: the calibration of
   geometric design models to yield consistent safety (risk) levels. The
   paper provides calibrated design charts for the middle ordinate M,
   defined as the lateral distance between edge of median barriers and
   centerline of the adjacent traffic lane, at different probability of
   noncompliance levels. The results show that the calibrated values ofM
   are generally lower than those derived from the AASHTO design guide. The
   calibrated design charts can offer designers dealing with highways with
   constricted right-of-way an option to use lower middle ordinate values
   and enable them to estimate the safety consequences of their decisions.
   Overall, the calibrated charts can aid the decision maker in determining
   the safety implications of deviating from geometric design standards and
   quantifying the safety level built in design values that are deemed
   acceptable. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Visco-plastic lubrication (VPL) has been established as a method for
   reliably suppressing interfacial instabilities and enhancing flow
   stability for multi-layer systems. Here we extend this methodology to
   the formation of shaped interfaces in multifluid core-annular
   configurations. We study multi-layer VPL flows in which we perform both
   experiment and computation with oscillating the flow rates of the
   individual phases. According to the flow rate variations we succeed in
   freezing in a range of different interfacial patterns. Experiments
   performed with carbopol as lubricating fluid, and with xanthan and
   polyethylene oxide solutions as core fluid, serve to illustrate the
   potential of the method. We show that single pulsed changes in the
   imposed inflow rates can result in small interface indentations that
   remain frozen into the interface as it propagates downstream. Repeated
   pulses produce periodically patterned interfaces. We are able to control
   the frequency and amplitude of the interfacial patterns, but not
   directly the shape. Inelastic core fluids have been observed to produce
   rounded bulges whereas elastic core fluids have produced diamond shapes.
   Moreover, numerical simulations extend the range of shapes achievable
   and give us interesting insights into the forming process. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{A transit network, visualized as a graph, can be evaluated using
   indicators such as connectivity, coverage, directness, and complexity,
   among others, based on the relationships between network elements. This
   study focuses on the analysis of interconnected and operationally
   complicated bus networks, a shortcoming of existing approaches tailored
   to simpler, metro networks. A new procedure is proposed for drawing bus
   networks as graphs, by disaggregating them into sub-networks at the
   traffic analysis zone level. As well, improved network connectivity
   indicators are proposed which incorporate the influence of bus
   operational characteristics. The effect of bus route transfers is
   analyzed by introducing intermediate walking transfer edges. The
   contribution of this research will provide transit agencies with
   quantitative measures to analyze the network characteristics and the
   related operational attributes at a zonal sub-network level across the
   agency's coverage area. The proposed methodology was demonstrated by

Abstract = {{In the presence of heterogeneous service provider (SP) networks such as

   the network selection behavior of mobile users. A novel probabilistic
   framework is presented, with explicit analytical expressions for the
   transition and steady state network selection probabilities of the
   users. The proposed framework utilizes the price charged and the utility
   obtained at the SPs in obtaining the transition probabilities, even in
   the presence of multi-homing users. Furthermore, network-level
   parameters such as call blocking probabilities and throughput are
   obtained in terms of the steady state probabilities. Numerical results
   indicate that the prices and utilities at the heterogeneous SPs have
   considerable impact on the overall network performance.}},

Abstract = {{Low angular spread of propagation environments and small interelement
   spacing within mobile terminals are two main factors degrading the
   capacity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This is
   particularly more evident in underground tunnels and mines that have
   lower angular spread compared to conventional environments. In such
   environments where colocated MIMO (C-MIMO) systems may not perform
   properly, we have shown that for access-point-to-mobile communications
   with limited and fixed antenna spacing at the mobile end, capacity close
   to that of an independent and identically distributed Rayleigh channel
   is achievable by employing distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) systems. To find
   and optimize C-MIMO and D-MIMO average capacities, we employed the
   waveguide-multimode model and particle-swarm-optimization method. We
   found that D-MIMO systems show desirable performance while significantly
   outperforming C-MIMO configurations. Nevertheless, D-MIMO desirable
   performance depends on the antennas' placement and is achievable for
   optimized locations. Based on the results, by uniformly distributing
   D-MIMO antennas along the tunnel axis and optimizing the transverse
   location of antennas afterward, suitable performance can be achieved.
   This paper is concluded by providing implications for D-MIMO antenna
   deployment in underground mines.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider physical layer security provisioning in
   multicell massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
   Specifically, we consider secure downlink transmission in a multicell
   massive MIMO system with matched-filter precoding and artificial noise
   (AN) generation at the base station (BS) in the presence of a passive
   multiantenna eavesdropper. We investigate the resulting achievable
   ergodic secrecy rate and the secrecy outage probability for the cases of
   perfect training and pilot contamination. Thereby, we consider two
   different AN shaping matrices, namely, the conventional AN shaping
   matrix, where the AN is transmitted in the null space of the matrix
   formed by all user channels, and a random AN shaping matrix, which
   avoids the complexity associated with finding the null space of a large
   matrix. Our analytical and numerical results reveal the following, in
   multicell massive MIMO systems employing matched-filter precoding: 1) AN
   generation is required to achieve a positive ergodic secrecy rate if the
   user and the eavesdropper experience the same path loss; 2) even with AN
   generation, secure transmission may not be possible if the number of
   eavesdropper antennas is too large and not enough power is allocated to
   channel estimation; 3) for a given fraction of power allocated to AN and
   a given number of users, in case of pilot contamination, the ergodic
   secrecy rate is not a monotonically increasing function of the number of
   BS antennas; and 4) random AN shaping matrices provide a favorable
   performance/complexity tradeoff and are an attractive alternative to
   conventional AN shaping matrices.}},

Abstract = {{All-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with ab initio
   calculations are used to study the thermodynamic properties and
   microscopic structure of four ionic liquids (ILs) based on the
   imidazolium cation with different alkyl side branches, ({[}bmmim]+,
   1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium; {[}bmim]+, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium;
   {[}apmim]+, 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium; {[}mim]+,
   1-methylimidazolium), paired with the {[}(CF3SO2)(2)N]-,
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion, in the temperature range of
   (298 to 600) K. We observed the highest value of the molar internal
   energy, enthalpy of vaporization, and cohesive energy density for the
   amine-functionalized {[}apmim]{[}Tf2N] ionic liquid. Structural analysis
   shows that the amine functionalization of the end of the alkyl side
   chain of imidazolium cation does not significantly affect the
   organization of {[}Tf2N]- around {[}apmim]+, but additional NH2 groups
   lead to short-range cationcation structural correlations between
   neighboring {[}apmim]+. The C-2 methylation extensively affects
   preferential out-of-plane face-to-face locations of {[}Tf2N]- around
   {[}bmmim]+ and also the cationcation distributions. {[}mim]{[}Tf2N] has
   the highest simulated density and better packing efficiency of liquid
   phase in comparison with other studied ILs. The strongest first shell
   probability density region of {[}mim](+) neighbors above and below the
   imidazolium ring of the reference cation represents better pi-pi
   stacking in the liquid phase of this ionic liquid. The presented results
   determine the role of the cation structure on the properties of this
   family of ILs. Good agreement was achieved between simulation results of
   the bulk phase and quantum calculations which are performed to determine
   the optimized structure of isolated ion pairs in chosen configurations
   and the strength of cationanion interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of the annual thermal histories in seven deep, intermontane
   lakes in western Canada along a north-south transect from 49.67 degrees
   to 61.25 degrees N reveals latitudinal trends in thermal structure;
   specifically: I) summer maximum and winter minimum mean temperatures
   decrease similar to 0.2 degrees C per degree latitude, 2) the dates of
   maximum and minimum heat content lag similar to 1 and similar to 6 days
   per degree latitude, respectively, 3) the lengths of summer and winter
   stratification lag similar to 8 days per degree latitude, 4) the timing
   of the spring and autumn turnovers lags similar to 4 days per degree
   latitude, 5) the timing of the onset and break-up of ice cover lags
   similar to 6 days per degree latitude, and 6) the rate of response to
   atmospheric heating and cooling is similar to 1MJ m(-2) day(-1) per
   degree latitude. We propose that insight into the response of a lake at
   a specific latitude to climate change can be acquired by examining the
   present conditions of a morphologically and dynamically similar lake at
   an appropriate latitude and altitude further south. Of interest is the
   potential transition of a lake from one mictic state to another, with
   consequences to the resupply of nutrients to the euphotic zone and to
   the phenology of spring and fall phytoplankton blooms. The absence or
   presence of ice cover and timing of freeze-up and break-up also affect a
   lake's heat budget and thermal history. The full interpretation of
   climate signals in lake systems requires an understanding of
   lake-specific physical forcing and response mechanisms. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Calibration is essential in freehand 3-D ultrasound to find the spatial
   transformation from the image coordinates to the sensor coordinate
   system. Calibration accuracy has significant impact on image-guided
   interventions. We introduce a new mathematical framework that uses
   differential measurements to achieve high calibration accuracy. Accurate
   measurements of axial differences in ultrasound images of a multi-wedge
   phantom are used to calculate the calibration matrix with a closed-form
   solution. The multi-wedge phantom has been designed based on the
   proposed differential framework and can be mass-produced inexpensively
   using a 3-D printer. The proposed method enables easy, fast and highly
   accurate ultrasound calibration, which is essential for most current
   ultrasound-guided applications and also widens the range of new
   applications. The precision of the method using only a single image of
   the phantom is comparable to that of the standard N-wire method using 50
   images. The method can also directly take advantage of the fine sampling
   rate of radiofrequency ultrasound data to achieve very high calibration
   accuracy. With 100 radiofrequency ultrasound images, the method achieves
   a point reconstruction error of 0.09 +/- 0.39 mm. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{We present on the use of well-known stochastic methods for computing the

   Typically, a Boltzmann distribution, which requires the exploration of
   the complete configuration space of an N-cell QCA circuit, is used to
   compute the 2(N) steady-states of the QCA circuit. However, the
   exponential growth in states as the circuit size grows makes computing
   the Boltzmann distribution infeasible for large circuits. Thus, we
   approximate the Boltzmann distribution of a QCA circuit by conducting a
   partial exploration of the complete configuration space by means of a
   Monte Carlo method, simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm. The
   approximated Boltzmann distribution from each method was able to compute
   the steady-state polarizations with a very high degree of accuracy, with
   the simulated annealing algorithm producing the best results.}},

Title = {{A wave interaction approach to studying non-modal homogeneous and
   stratified shear instabilities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{755}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Homboe (Geophys. Publ., vol. 24, 1962, pp. 67-112) postulated that
   resonant interaction between two or more progressive, linear interfacial
   waves produces exponentially growing instabilities in idealized
   (broken-line profiles), homogeneous or density-stratified, inviscid
   shear layers. Here we have generalized Holmboe's mechanistic picture of
   linear shear instabilities by (i) not initially specifying the wave
   type, and (ii) providing the option for non-normal growth. We have
   demonstrated the mechanism behind linear shear instabilities by
   proposing a purely kinematic model consisting of two linear,
   Doppler-shifted, progressive interfacial waves moving in opposite
   directions. Moreover, we have found a necessary and sufficient (N\&S)
   condition for the existence of exponentially growing instabilities in
   idealized shear flows. The two interfacial waves, starting from
   arbitrary initial conditions, eventually phase-lock and resonate (grow
   exponentially), provided the N\&S condition is satisfied. The
   theoretical underpinning of our wave interaction model is analogous to
   that of synchronization between two coupled harmonic oscillators. We
   have re-framed our model into a nonlinear autonomous dynamical system,
   the steady-state configuration of which corresponds to the resonant
   configuration of the wave interaction model. When interpreted in terms
   of the canonical normal-mode theory, the steady-state/resonant
   configuration corresponds to the growing normal mode of the discrete
   spectrum. The instability mechanism occurring prior to reaching steady
   state is non-modal, favouring rapid transient growth. Depending on the
   wavenumber and initial phase-shift, non-modal gain can exceed the
   corresponding modal gain by many orders of magnitude. Instability is
   also observed in the parameter space which is deemed stable by the
   normal-mode theory. Using our model we have derived the discrete
   spectrum non-modal stability equations for three classical examples of
   shear instabilities: Rayleigh/Kelvin-Helmholtz, Holmboe and
   Taylor-Caulfield. We have shown that the N\&S condition provides a range
   of unstable wavenumbers for each instability type, and this range
   matches the predictions of the normal-mode theory.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is intended to investigate and compare the
   hemodynamics in two different sizes of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts
   for upper arm hemodialysis vascular access: 8-mm tapered to 6-mm at the
   arterial side and straight 6 mm. A computational simulation approach is
   presented for this study, which is validated against the available
   experimental and numerical pressure measurements in the literature. The
   imposed boundary conditions at the arterial inlet and venous outlet
   boundaries of the models are physiological velocity and pressure
   waveforms, respectively. Blood flow fields and distribution patterns of
   the hemodynamic indices including wall shear stress (WSS) as one of the
   major hemodynamic parameters of the cardiovascular system and spatial
   wall shear stress gradient (SWSSG) as an indicator of disturbed flow
   patterns and hence susceptible sites of lesion developments are analyzed
   and compared between the two grafts. The tapered 6- to 8-mm graft
   seemingly is associated with less disturbed flow patterns within the
   venous anastomosis (VA) and the vein downstream while benefiting from
   higher blood flow rates within. Also, it shows a definitive advantage in
   terms of WSS and SWSSG distribution patterns around the VA and
   throughout the vein downstream with significantly lower values, which
   reduce the risk of thrombosis formation and stenotic lesion
   developments. The only disadvantage encountered in using 6- to 8-mm
   tapered graft is higher values of hemodynamic parameters at the arterial
   junction attributable to its significantly higher mean blood flow rate
   within. The results clearly indicate that the tapered 6- to 8-mm graft
   entirely outperforms straight 6-mm graft hemodynamically as an upper arm
   hemodialysis vascular access graft and confirms clinical data in the
   literature, which suggests advantageous use of tapered 6- to 8-mm grafts
   in the creation of upper arm brachioaxillary hemodialysis vascular
   access grafts in selected groups of patients with expectably higher
   patency rates and lower complications.}},

Abstract = {{Hillert's mean-field elastic prediction of the diffusivity of carbon in
   ferrite is regularly used to explain the experimental observation of
   slow diffusion of carbon in supersaturated ferrite. With increasing
   carbon supersaturation, the appropriateness of assuming that many-body
   carbon interactions can be ignored needs to be re-examined. In this
   work, we have sought to evaluate the limits of such mean-field
   predictions for activation barrier prediction by comparing such models
   with molecular dynamics simulations. The results of this analysis show
   that even at extremely high levels of supersaturation (up to 8 at\% C),
   mean-field elasticity models can be used with confidence when the
   effects of carbon concentration on the energy of carbon at octahedral
   and tetrahedral sites are considered. The reasons for this finding and

Abstract = {{Concrete infrastructure repair remains a formidable challenge. We need
   to understand the repair performance and develop innovative materials
   and placement processes that lead to durable, cost-effective and
   esthetically pleasing repairs. In this context, fiber reinforced
   concrete is considered promising.
   The influence of fibers on the properties of the interface between old
   concrete and fiber reinforced repair remains poorly understood. This
   paper describes an experimental study on the influence of fibers on the
   mechanical properties of the interface. Bond strength was assessed by
   means of slant shear tests with different slants. Shear-normal stress
   interaction diagrams, adhesion strength and internal friction were
   obtained. Repair mortars with different contents of Polyvinyl Alcohol
   (PVA) fibers and the influence of wet dry cycles were investigated.
   Results show that PVA fibers added to the repair can significantly
   enhance interfacial adhesion. Once the repair interface is fully
   developed, fibers, however, do not mitigate damage from wetting and
   drying. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electric power networks are spatially distributed systems, subject to
   different magnitude and recurrence of earthquakes, that play a
   fundamental role in the well-being and safety of communities. Therefore,
   identification of critical components is of paramount importance in
   retrofit prioritization. This article presents a comparison of five
   seismic performance assessment models (M1 to M5) of increasing
   complexity. The first two models (M1 and M2) approach the problem from a
   connectivity perspective, whereas the last three (M3 to M5) consider
   also power flow analysis. To illustrate the utility of the five models,
   the well-known IEEE-118 test case, assumed to be located in the central
   United States, is considered. Performances of the five models are
   compared using both system-level and component-level measures. Spearman
   rank correlation is computed between results of each model. Highest
   values, at both system- and component-level, are obtained, as expected,
   between M1 and M2, and within models M3 to M5. The values between
   component-level measures are relatively high across all models,
   indicating that simpler ones (M1 and M2) are appropriate for
   vulnerability assessment and retrofit prioritization. The complex
   flow-based models (M3 to M5) are suitable if actual performance of the
   systems is desired, as it is the case when the power network is
   considered within a larger set of interconnected infrastructural
   systems.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present an experimental and numerical study on the freezing of static
   water droplets on surfaces with different wettability when the surfaces
   are subject to rapid cooling. Temperature evolution of the droplets is
   recorded using both intrusive and non-intrusive methods to identify the
   processes involved in the cooling and phase change of the droplets. It
   is found the time taken for a droplet to freeze depends on the droplet
   temperature at the pre-recalescence instant as well as the surface
   wettability. To provide insight into the heat transfer during the
   freezing process, thermal simulation is carried out by numerically
   solving the enthalpy-based heat conduction equation. To determine the
   initial and boundary conditions for the simulation of freezing, the
   thermal history of the droplet prior to the occurrence of freezing is
   numerically analyzed by solving single phase heat conduction driven by
   rapid cooling. The numerical results of droplet freezing are compared to
   the experimental data, showing close agreement on the freezing time. (C)

Abstract = {{Rodent models of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) are often used to
   investigate the effects of injury mechanism, injury speed, and cord
   displacement magnitude, on the ensuing cascade of biological damage in
   the cord. However, due to its small size, experimental observations have
   largely been limited to the gross response of the cord. To properly
   understand the relationship between mechanical stimulus and biological
   damage, more information is needed about how the constituent tissues of
   the cord (i.e., gray and white matter) respond to injurious stimuli. To
   address this limitation, we developed a novel magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI)-compatible test apparatus that can impose either a contusion-type
   or dislocation-type acute cervical SCI in a rodent model and facilitate
   MR-imaging of the cervical spinal cord in a 7 T MR scanner. In this
   study, we present the experimental performance parameters of the MR rig.
   Utilizing cadaveric specimens and static radiographs, we report
   contusion magnitude accuracy that for a desired 1.8 mm injury, a nominal
   1.78 mm injury (SD = 0.12 mm) was achieved. High-speed video analysis
   was employed to determine the injury speeds for both mechanisms and were
   found to be 1147 mm/s (SD = 240 mm/s) and 184 mm/s (SD = 101 mm/s) for
   contusion and dislocation injuries, respectively. Furthermore, we
   present qualitative pilot data from a cadaveric trial, employing the MR
   rig, to show the expected results from future studies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{78}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study a dynamic simulation modeling approach is used to assess
   the integration of torrefaction into the wood pellet production and
   distribution supply chain. The developed model combines discrete event
   and discrete rate simulation approaches and allows considering
   uncertainties, interdependencies, and resource constraints along the
   supply chain which are usually simplified or ignored in static and
   deterministic models. It includes the whole supply chain from sources of
   raw materials to the distribution of the final products. The model is
   applied to an existing wood pellet supply chain, located in British
   Columbia, Canada, to assess the cost of delivered torrefied pellets to
   different markets, energy demand, and carbon dioxide emissions along the
   supply chain and compare them with those of regular pellets. In the
   presented case study, integration of torrefaction leads to lower
   delivered cost to existing and potential markets due to increased energy
   density and reduced distribution costs. In comparison with regular
   pellets, the delivered cost of torrefied pellets (\$/GJ) to Northwest
   Europe is 9\% lower. Also, the energy consumption and the emitted carbon
   dioxide along the supply chain are decreased due to more efficient
   transportation of torrefied pellets. Integration of torrefaction into
   the wood pellet production and distribution supply chain could result in
   less expensive and cleaner biofuel. The feasibility of such integration
   depends on the trade-off between the higher capital and operating costs
   and the reduced transportation costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the use of wireless mesh network (WMN) as a
   last-mile option for Internet access. Despite the many benefits of WMNs,
   the performance of Internet access may not be ideal. One of the main
   issues is the interaction of transmission control protocol (TCP) with
   the underlying network. The poor performance of TCP over multi-hop
   networks is well-documented, and extensive research exists, which
   addresses TCPs foible and enhance TCP performance for multihop
   environments. This paper provides a thorough survey of TCP performance
   issues over WMNs and the available solutions to address these issues.
   Among the existing methods, we focused on network coding (NC) and the
   ways that TCP interacts with network coded systems. NC is a technique
   that encodes the received packets in each node before forwarding them
   towards the destination. The use of NC in the transport layer to address
   performance issues raised by wireless access is a recent research topic.
   This paper presents a detailed study of TCP interaction with NC. Some
   open research areas in this field are suggested. Copyright (C) 2012 John

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of reconstructing EEG signals from lower

   reconstruct the EEG signal using an analysis prior formulation. Moreover
   we use the inter-channel correlation while reconstruction which leads to
   a row-sparse analysis prior multiple measurement vector (MMV) recovery
   problem. To improve the reconstruction, we formulate the recovery as a
   non-convex optimization problem. Such a non-convex row-sparse MMV
   recovery problem had not been encountered before; this work derives an

Abstract = {{With recent advances in parallel cooperative transmissions between
   multiple source-destination pairs, interference cancellation (IC) can be
   achieved to improve the capacity performance of wireless networks.
   However, from energy efficiency perspective, user cooperation may not be
   always appealing, since the increased data rate of one user comes at the
   price of the energy consumed by another user. In this paper, we study
   the potential benefits/drawbacks of cooperative communications on
   network-level issues, such as the capacity and the energy efficiency. We
   show that, in terms of network energy efficiency, cooperative
   communications do not always outperform non-cooperative communications,
   and cooperative communications should be dynamically applied in topology
   control to optimize the overall network energy efficiency. Specifically,
   we propose an energy-efficient topology control scheme by jointly
   considering the capacity and energy consumption of non-cooperative and
   cooperative communications. Simulation results are presented to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, is capable of removing heavy metals
   from acid rock drainage (ARD). Previous studies have neglected the
   dealumination of clinoptilolite and its impact during remediation. This
   study observed the dealumination of clinoptilolite during ARD
   remediation in a slurry bubble column (SBC), and investigated its impact
   on the capture of zinc.
   Uptake tests were performed with natural ARD and various sorbent average
   particle diameters from 300 to 1400 mu m, superficial gas velocities
   from 0.08 to 0.23 m s(-1), initial aqueous pH from 2 to 6, Zn
   concentrations from 15 to 215 ppm and sorbent/solution mass ratios from
   25 to 400 g kg(-1) to test zinc uptake. Dealumination of clinoptilolite
   was sometimes observed during the uptake process. Increased Al in the
   aqueous phase led to co-precipitation of Zn-Al colloid, enhanced by
   abundant sulfate in solution. The unit zinc uptake of the Al colloid was
   found to be much higher than for the raw clinoptilolite. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Cycling is a popular form of recreation and method of commuting with
   clear health benefits. However, cycling is not without risk. In Canada,
   cycling injuries are more common than in any other summer sport; and
   according to the US National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration,
   52,000 cyclists were injured in the US in 2010. Head injuries account
   for approximately two-thirds of hospital admissions and three-quarters
   of fatal injuries among injured cyclists. In many jurisdictions and
   across all age levels, helmets have been adopted to mitigate risk of
   serious head injuries among cyclists and the majority of epidemiological
   literature suggests that helmets effectively reduce risk of injury.
   Critics have raised questions over the actual efficacy of helmets by
   pointing to weaknesses in existing helmet epidemiology including
   selection bias and lack of appropriate control for the type of impact
   sustained by the cyclist and the severity of the head impact. These
   criticisms demonstrate the difficulty in conducting epidemiology studies
   that will be regarded as definitive and the need for complementary
   biomechanical studies where confounding factors can be adequately
   controlled. In the bicycle helmet context, there is a paucity of
   biomechanical data comparing helmeted to unhelmeted head impacts and, to
   our knowledge, there is no data of this type available with contemporary
   helmets. In this research, our objective was to perform biomechanical
   testing of paired helmeted and unhelmeted head impacts using a validated
   anthropomorphic test headform and a range of drop heights between 0.5 m
   and 3.0 m, while measuring headform acceleration and Head Injury
   Criterion (HIC). In the 2 m (6.3 m/s) drops, the middle of our drop
   height range, the helmet reduced peak accelerations from 824 g
   (unhelmeted) to 181 g (helmeted) and HIC was reduced from 9667
   (unhelmeted) to 1250 (helmeted). At realistic impact speeds of 5.4 m/s
   (1.5 m drop) and 6.3 m/s (2.0 m drop), bicycle helmets changed the
   probability of severe brain injury from extremely likely (99.9\% risk at
   both 5.4 and 6.3 m/s) to unlikely (9.3\% and 30.6\% risk at 1.5 m and
   2.0 m drops respectively). These biomechanical results for acceleration
   and HIC, and the corresponding results for reduced risk of severe brain
   injury show that contemporary bicycle helmets are highly effective at
   reducing head injury metrics and the risk for severe brain injury in
   head impacts characteristic of bicycle crashes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Collision modification functions: Incorporating changes over time}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{46-54}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Collision modification factors (CMFs) are considered the primary tools
   for estimating the effectiveness of safety treatments at road sites.
   Three main techniques are commonly used to estimate CMFs: the empirical
   Bayes (EB) method, the comparison-group (CG) method, and a combination
   of the EB and CG methods. CMF estimates from these techniques are
   usually provided with a measure of uncertainty of the estimate, in the
   form of standard error and confidence interval.
   However, representing CMFs as point estimates may not be adequate to
   explain how a safety countermeasure affects collision frequency over
   time and to evaluate the presence of novelty effects associated with the
   treatment. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to show how to
   overcome this drawback through the development of collision modification
   functions (CMFunctions) which incorporate changes over time for the
   treatment effectiveness, rather than using a single value.
   Within a fully Bayesian (FB) context, linear and non-linear intervention
   models, which acknowledge that the safety treatment effects do not
   always occur instantaneously but are spread over future time periods,
   provide a promising methodological framework for estimating CMFunctions
   with time trend.
   A case study is presented where the linear and non-linear intervention
   models were applied to estimate the effectiveness of the ``Signal Head
   Upgrade Program{''} recently implemented in the city of Surrey (British
   Columbia, Canada). The results of the case study highlight the
   advantages of estimating CMFunctions with time trend and impact on the
   economic evaluation of safety countermeasures. Given the way future
   benefits are discounted to present values, the results of using a
   CMFunction can affect the cost effectiveness of safety countermeasures
   significantly. The results also showed the non-linear intervention
   models provide a more realistic trend where the treatment effect in the
   long-run converges to an everlasting treatment impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Demolished concrete generates significant volume of construction and
   demolition (C\&D) waste worldwide that has huge potentials for concrete
   coarse aggregate. This study discusses the use of recycled coarse
   aggregate in concrete in a repeated fashion, and investigates the fresh
   and hardened properties of this green concrete type. Three different
   generations (1st, 2nd and 3rd) of repeated recycled concrete were
   produced using 100\% recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) as a replacement of
   natural coarse aggregate where RCA was recycled 3 times over its life
   span. i.e. the 3rd generation recycled concrete was made with RCA, which
   was produced after 3 repeated casting of recycled concrete with 100\%
   RCA and then demolishing the hardened concrete. The results show that
   the repeated recycled concrete experienced slightly lower compressive
   strength than the control concrete; however, all mixes successfully
   achieved their target strength at 56th day expect the 3rd generation
   concrete. Another interesting finding of this study shows that even the
   3rd generation concrete could surpass the target strength by at least
   25\% while considering long term strength gain. The stress-strain curves
   of repeated recycled concrete are also presented and discussed. (C) 2014

   bends, tapers and directional couplers, all realized with compatible
   geometries in order to be used as building blocks for more complex
   integrated optics devices (interferometers, switches, resonators, etc.).
   Fabricated SWG tapers for TE and TM polarizations are described; they
   allow for connecting SWG devices to regular strip waveguides with loss
   lower than 1 dB per taper. Our SWG directional coupler presents a very
   compact design and a negligible wavelength dependence of its crossover
   length (and as a consequence of its coupling coefficient, kappa), over a
   40 nm bandwidth. This wavelength flatten response represents a bandwidth
   enhancement with respect to standard directional couplers (made using
   strip or rib waveguides), in particular for the TE mode. SWG bends are
   demonstrated, their loss dependence on radius is analyzed, and
   fabricated bends have a loss in the range 0.8-1.6 dB per 90 degrees
   bend. Simulated and measured results show promise for large-scale
   fabrication of complex optical devices and high sensitivity sensors
   based on SWG waveguides with engineered optical properties, tailored to
   specific applications. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Acid rock drainage (ARD) is a major pollution problem globally that has
   adversely impacted the environment. Identification and quantification of
   uncertainties are integral parts of ARD assessment and risk mitigation,
   however previous studies on predicting ARD drainage chemistry have not
   fully addressed issues of uncertainties. In this study, artificial
   neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) are used for the
   prediction of ARD drainage chemistry and their predictive uncertainties
   are quantified using probability bounds analysis. Furthermore, the
   predictions of ANN and SVM are integrated using four aggregation methods
   to improve their individual predictions. The results of this study
   showed that ANN performed better than SVM in enveloping the observed
   concentrations. In addition, integrating the prediction of ANN and SVM
   using the aggregation methods improved the predictions of individual
   techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of catchment geophysical characteristics and climate on the

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a recognized indicator of natural
   organic matter (NOM) in surface waters. The aim of this paper is
   twofold: to evaluate the impact of geophysical characteristics, climate
   and ecological zones on DOC concentrations in surface waters and, to
   develop a statistical model to estimate the regional variability of
   these concentrations. In this study, multilevel statistical analysis was
   used to achieve three specific objectives: (1) evaluate the influence of
   climate and geophysical characteristics on DOC concentrations in surface
   waters; (2) compare the influence of geophysical characteristics and
   ecological zones on DOC concentrations in surface waters; and (3)
   develop a model to estimate the most accurate DOC concentrations in
   surface waters. The case study involved 115 catchments from surface
   waters in the Province of Quebec, Canada. Results showed that mean
   temperatures recorded 60 days prior to sampling, total precipitation 10
   days prior to sampling and percentages of wetlands, coniferous forests
   and mixed forests have a significant positive influence on DOC
   concentrations in surface waters. The catchment mean slope had a
   significant negative influence on DOC concentrations in surface waters.
   Water type (lake or river) and deciduous forest variables were not
   significant. The ecological zones had a significant influence on DOC
   concentrations. However, geophysical characteristics (wetlands, forests
   and slope) estimated DOC concentrations more accurately. A model
   describing the variability of DOC concentrations was developed and can
   be used, in future research, for estimating DBPs in drinking water as
   well evaluating the impact of climate change on the quality of surface
   waters and drinking water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly efficient light absorption and charge separation within the
   photosystem and reaction center (RC) complexes of photosynthetic plants
   and bacteria are of great interest for solar cell and photo detector
   applications, since they offer almost unity quantum yield and expected
   ultimate power conversion efficiencies of more than 18\% and 12\%,
   respectively. In addition, the charge separated states created by these
   protein complexes are very long lived compared to conventional
   semiconductor solar cells. In this work, a novel technique is presented
   for the deposition of photosynthetic protein complexes, by
   electrospraying RCs of Rhodobacter sphaeroides onto highly ordered
   pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrodes. Remarkably, it is shown that the
   RCs not only survive exposure to the high electric fields but also yield
   peak photocurrent densities of up to 7 mu A cm(-2), which is equal to
   the highest value reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{The through-process microstructural effects in A356 subjected to rotary
   forming at elevated temperatures have been investigated. Macro- and
   micro-hardness testing has been used extensively to track changes in the

   Targeted thermal treatments have been used to isolate the effects of
   mechanical deformation through comparative measurements. These
   measurements include macro and micro hardness measurements,
   energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and examination of eutectic-Si particle
   size and morphology. The results indicate that the as-cast material is
   stable up to approximately 144 degrees C, with the rotary formed
   material exhibiting decreased macrohardness in-line with the time spent
   at elevated temperature. Post heat treatment, there was a significant
   decrease in hardness with increased levels of deformation. Results
   indicate that precipitation hardening is not appreciably affected by
   rotary forming, and the principal cause for the drop in hardness with
   deformation is due to the condition of Al-Si eutectic phase. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The separation of cells by filtration through microstructured
   constrictions is limited by clogging and adsorption, which reduce
   selectivity and prevent the extraction of separated cells. To address
   this key challenge, we developed a mechanism for simply and reliably
   adjusting the cross-section of a microfluidic channel to selectively
   capture cells based on a combination of size and deformability. After a
   brief holding period, trapped cells can then be released back into flow,
   and if necessary, extracted for subsequent analysis. Periodically
   clearing fitter constrictions of separated cells greatly improves
   selectivity and throughput, and minimizes adsorption of cells to the
   filter microstructure. This mechanism is capable of discriminating
   cell-sized polystyrene microspheres with <1 mu m resolution. Rare cancer
   cells doped into leukocytes can be enriched similar to 1800x with
   similar to 90\% yield despite a significant overlap in size between
   these cell types. An important characteristic of this process is that
   contaminant leukocytes are captured by non-specific adsorption and not
   mechanical constraint, enabling repeated filtration to improve
   performance The throughput of this mechanism is 900 000 cells per hour
   for 32 multiplexed microchannels, or similar to 1200 000 cells cm(-2)
   h(-1) on a per area basis, which exceeds existing micropore filtration
   mechanisms by a factor of 20.}},

Abstract = {{The impedance characteristics of the laminar flow-based fuel cells
   (LFFCs), which are also called microfluidic fuel cells (MFFCs), are
   measured to study the crossover and depletion phenomena. To study the
   effect of the crossover and depletion separately, the impedances are
   measured at different flow rates simulating different crossover
   conditions; while the effect of depletion is controlled by keeping the
   current density constant through changing the fuel concentration at
   different flow rates. Then the depletion effect is studied by measuring
   the impedance characteristics of the cell at various fuel
   concentrations. It is shown that the crossover affects the moderate
   frequency ranges in the measured Nyquist plot; whereas depletion impacts
   the low frequency domain. Finally, the impedance measurements at various
   potentials suggest that increasing the current density increases the
   effect of crossover while decreases the effect of depletion. This could
   be the result of carbon dioxide production in the anode. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is employed to investigate the flame
   characteristics and the mean chemical source term <((omega) over
   dot)over tilde>(k) of hydrogen/air premixed turbulent combustion in the
   thin reaction zones regime. Three flames with different initial radius
   and equivalence ratio are considered. The probability density functions
   (PDFs) of the flame curvature, shape factor and turbulent flame velocity
   are plotted and compared for different flames. The distributions of the
   flame curvature and shape factor indicate that the local geometries for
   both of the flame kernel and planar flame are similar, irrespective of
   their difference in the global geometry. The modified laminar flamelet
   PDF (MLF-PDF) shows improvements over the widely used beta-PDF for the
   progress variable distribution. Several closures for the conditional
   mean reaction rate are integrated with the presumed PDFs and compared
   with the DNS data. It is demonstrated that the predictions of the
   first-order reaction rate integrated with the MLF-PDF are satisfactory
   for H-2 but not for the intermediate species OH. The second-order
   closure integrated with the MLF-PDF is proved to be promising in
   predicting both of the major and intermediate species. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Distributed generations (DGs) have significant benefits in the electric
   power industry, such as a reduction in CO2 and NOX emissions in
   electricity generation, improvement of voltage profile in distribution
   feeders, amending voltage stability in heavy load levels, enhancement of
   reliability and power quality, as well as securing the power market.
   Despite the numerous advantages of DG technologies, weak capability in
   dispatching and management of DGs is a major challenge for distribution
   system operators. Hence, during recent years, several studies about
   various aspects of control, operation, placement, and sizing of DGs have
   been conducted. This paper presents a novel application of
   multiobjective particle swarm optimization with the aim of determining
   the optimal DGs places, sizes, and their generated power contract price.
   In the proposed multiobjective optimization, not only are the
   operational aspects, such as improving voltage profile and stability,
   power-loss reduction, and reliability enhancement taken into account,
   but also an economic analysis is performed based on the distribution
   company's and DG owner's viewpoints. The simulation study is performed
   on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system and the consequent
   discussions prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulence, quantified as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic
   energy (epsilon), was measured with 1400 temperature-gradient
   microstructure profiles obtained concurrently with time series
   measurements of temperature and current profiles, meteorology, and
   lake-atmosphere fluxes using eddy covariance in a 4 km(2) temperate lake
   during fall cooling. Winds varied from near calm to 5 m s(-1) but
   reached 10 m s(-1) during three storm events. Near-surface values of e
   were typically on the order of 10(-8) to 1027 m(2) s(-3) and reached
   10(-5) m(2) s(-3) during windy periods. Above a depth equal to vertical
   bar L-MO vertical bar, the Monin-Obukhov length scale, turbulence was
   dominated by wind shear and dissipation followed neutral law of the wall
   scaling augmented by buoyancy flux during cooling. During cooling,
   epsilon(z) = 0.56 u({*}W)(3)/kz + 0.77 J(BO) and during heating
   epsilon(z) = 0.6 u({*}w)(3)/kz, where u({*}w) is the water friction
   velocity computed from wind shear stress, k is von Karman's constant, z
   is depth, and J(BO) is surface buoyancy flux. Below a depth equal to
   vertical bar L-MO vertical bar during cooling, dissipation was uniform
   with depth and controlled by buoyancy flux. Departures from similarity
   scaling enabled identification of additional processes that moderate
   near-surface turbulence including mixed layer deepening at the onset of
   cooling, high-frequency internal waves when the diurnal thermocline was
   adjacent to the air-water interface, and horizontal advection caused by
   differential cooling. The similarity scaling enables prediction of
   near-surface e as required for estimating the gas transfer coefficient
   using the surface renewal model and for understanding controls on scalar
   transport.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Study design: This was a prospective cohort observational study.
   Objective: To determine the effect of dehydration and rehydration on
   spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) measurement on magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI).
   Setting: MRI Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Canada.
   Methods: Ten healthy subjects (aged 21-32 years) were scanned on a 3T
   MRI scanner at four time points: (1) baseline, (2) rescan after 1 h, (3)
   the next day after fasting for a minimum of 14 h and (4) after
   rehydration with 1.5 l of water over the course of 1 h. Two independent,
   established semi-automatic CSA measurement techniques (one based on
   two-dimensional (2D) edge detection, the other on three-dimensional (3D)
   surface fitting) were applied to a 3D T1-weighted scan of each subject
   at each time point, with the operator blinded to scan order. The
   percentage change in CSA from baseline to each subsequent time point was
   calculated. One-tailed paired t-tests were used to assess the
   significance of the changes from baseline.
   Results: A decrease in CSA following dehydration was detected by both
   measurement methods, with a mean change of -0.654\% (s.d. = 0.778,
   P<0.05) and -0.650\% (s.d. = 1.071, P<0.05) for the first and second
   methods, respectively.
   Conclusion: Dehydration can confound CSA measurements on MRI. The
   magnitude of the effect is significant relative to short-term
   pathological changes that have been observed in diseases such as
   multiple sclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the multicast lifetime capacity of energy-limited wireless ad
   hoc networks using directional multibeam antennas by formulating and
   solving the corresponding optimization problem. In such networks, each
   node is equipped with a practical smart antenna array that can be
   configured to support multiple beams with adjustable orientation and
   beam width. The special case of this optimization problem in networks
   with single beams have been extensively studied and shown to be NP-hard.
   In this paper, we provide a globally optimal solution to this problem by
   developing a general MILP formulation that can apply to various
   configurable antenna models, many of which are not supported by the
   existing formulations. In order to study the multicast lifetime capacity
   of large-scale networks, we also propose an efficient heuristic
   algorithm with guaranteed theoretical performance. In particular, we
   provide a sufficient condition to determine if its performance reaches
   optimum based on the analysis of its approximation ratio. These results
   are validated by experiments as well. The multicast lifetime capacity is
   then quantitatively studied by evaluating the proposed exact and
   heuristic algorithms using simulations. The experimental results also
   show that using two-beam antennas can exploit most lifetime capacity of
   the networks for multicast communications.}},

Abstract = {{Recent results have shown that selfish users do not have an incentive to
   participate in intersession network coding in a static noncooperative
   game setting. Because of this, the worst-case network efficiency (i.e.,
   the price-of-anarchy) can be as low as 20\%. In this paper, we show that
   if the same game is played repeatedly, then the price-of-anarchy can be
   improved to 36\%. We design a grim-trigger strategy that encourages
   users to cooperate and participate in the intersession network coding. A
   key challenge is to determine a common cooperative coding rate that the
   users should mutually agree on. We resolve the conflict of interest
   among the users through a bargaining process and obtain tight upper
   bounds for the price-of-anarchy that are valid for any possible
   bargaining scheme. Moreover, we propose a simple and efficient min-max
   bargaining solution that can achieve these upper bounds, as confirmed
   through simulation studies. The coexistence of multiple selfish network
   coding sessions as well as the coexistence of selfish network coding and
   routing sessions are also investigated. Our results represent a first
   step toward designing practical intersession network coding schemes that
   achieve reasonable performance for selfish users.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we introduce an innovative method for generating
   mappings of M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) and M-ary quadrature
   amplitude modulation (M-QAM) constellations for bit-interleaved coded
   modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID). The proposed simple method
   not only yields mappings for higher order constellations efficiently but
   also outperforms previously reported mappings. Presented results show
   that, in Rayleigh fading channels, the proposed mapping can gain up to
   4.4 dB for a target bit error rate (BER) of 10(-6), which is in the
   range of many practical interests over the binary switching algorithm
   mappings while it offers a comparable error floor. In AWGN channels, the
   gain is up to 5.8 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic radiations emanating from the high voltage lines and
   substations pose serious adverse health consequences to living beings.
   As a result, selection of power substation location is an important
   strategic decision-making problem for both public and private sectors.
   In general, many conflicting factors affect the appropriate substation
   location selection problem which adheres to uncertain and imprecise
   data. In this paper, a simple, systematic and logical scientific
   approach is structured to evaluate power substation location through
   integrating Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with the
   Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations
   (PROMETHEE). The proposed integrated approach provides more realistic
   and reliable results, and facilitates the decision-maker to handle
   multiple contradictory decision perspectives through eliminating the
   limitations of FAHP and PROMETHEE methods. To accredit the proposed
   model, it is implemented in a power substation location selection
   problem in Bangladesh. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The chemistry and kinetics of the removal of tellurium from copper
   sulphate-sulphuric acid solution by cuprous ion reduction and
   precipitation were studied. The Te-VI reduction reaction order with
   respect to cuprous and tellurium concentration was investigated at an
   acidity range of 10-100 g/L H2SO4 and at temperatures of 75 degrees C-95
   degrees C. The reduction reaction mechanism, a suggested rate
   determining step and a rate law were offered accordingly for reduction
   of Te-VI with cuprous. The kinetics fit the simple rate equation of
   -dTe(VI)/dt=k(1){[}Cu+]{[}Te-VI]. A plausible Te-VI reduction with
   cuprous was suggested via slow reduction of H6TeO6 to TeO(OH)(+)
   followed by faster reduction of TeO(OH)(+) to lower tellurium oxidation
   states. The rate constant k(1) was calculated at different sulphuric
   acid concentrations (10, 15, 50, 75, 100 g/L) at T = 95.2 degrees C.
   Increasing solution acidity significantly increased the tellurium
   reduction reaction rate. An empirical correlation of k(1) = 0.0297 x
   {[}H2SO4](1.35) was found between the rate constants and the sulphuric
   acid concentration over the range of 10 g/L < {[}H2SO4] <100 g/L. An

Title = {{The kinetics of oxidative leaching of vanadium trioxide}},
Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{83-89}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The oxidative leaching of vanadium trioxide was studied in sulfuric acid
   solutions from 30 degrees C to 90 degrees C. This study was performed in
   three stages. First, the kinetics of leaching using oxygen was
   investigated. It was shown that this oxidative leaching is
   chemically-controlled with an activation energy of around 69 kJ/mol.
   Secondly, vanadium(III) oxidative leaching was studied using ferric ions
   and oxygen. The presence of ferric enhanced kinetics significantly.
   Finally, oxidative leaching using a constant ferric-ferrous ratio from 1
   to 300 was investigated. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was found to be
   a suitable oxidant for controlling solution potential. The oxidation
   rate using a constant ferric-ferrous ratio was very sensitive to
   temperature, giving a large activation energy (38 kJ/mol) and was
   proportional to the Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio to the power of 0.47. The
   leaching rate using the shrinking sphere model was modeled as:
   partial derivative d/partial derivative t = 12,088 x exp (-4580/T)

   an expression to predict the redox potential of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple up
   to 150 degrees C}},
Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic model is developed and shown to reliably simulate the
   speciation of the quatemary H2SO4-Fe-2(SO4)(3)-FeSO4-H2O system through
   a wide range of solution compositions and temperatures (25 degrees C-150
   degrees C). The main species involved (including H+, Fe2+, Fe3+, SO42-,
   HSO4-,FeHSO4+, FeSO4 degrees, FeHSO42+, Fe(SO4)(2)(-), FeSO4+, Fe2O3 and
   H2O) were investigated, and their thermodynamic data were collected and
   critically assessed to evaluate their activity coefficients and
   equilibrium constants. Results show that the species distribution
   depends highly on the initial total amount of iron, acidity, nominal
   Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and temperature. Modeling results also reveal that most
   of the Fe(III) is distributed as complexes or precipitates and the free
   Fe3+ accounts for only a minor percentage, whereas a large amount of
   Fe(II) exists in the form of free Fe2+, with the rest dissolved as
   complexes. Moreover, based on the model results, the temperature
   dependence of the real Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios and their activity coefficient
   ratios was subsequently obtained and employed to systematically study
   the redox potential of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple. The redox potentials
   predicted by the model increase with the nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and
   temperature when the nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios are 10:1, 100:1 and
   1000:1, with its values in the range of 736-956 mV (all potentials in
   the present study are quoted with respect to the Standard Hydrogen
   Electrode at 25 degrees C) from 25 degrees C to 150 degrees C in the
   studied acidic iron sulfate solutions. At a nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of
   1:1, the predicted potentials are relatively stable with respect to
   temperature, typically between 671 mV and 679 mV, because the real
   Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in solution is much lower for such a condition. The
   speciation model explains the change of redox potential with temperature
   for all nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios. An expression is also developed to
   calculate the redox potential and is supported by experimental results
   from the literature. It appears that the redox potential can be easily
   and accurately determined only based on the variables of temperature and
   nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio, independent of the nominal concentrations of
   H2SO4 and Fe3+. Moreover, this expression is probably applicable to more
   general cases at or around room temperature. The proposed model was
   validated by reliable prediction of measured redox potential from 25
   degrees C to 150 degrees C. Comparison of previously published results
   of ferric solubility, together with an analysis of the calculated pH and
   ionic strength, provides additional justification for the model
   developed herein. These findings contribute to the research on aqueous
   speciation of acid iron sulfate solutions, the reduction kinetics of the
   Fe3+/Fe2+ couple, as well as the mechanistic analysis in industrial
   leaching processes of chalcopyrite and other sulfide minerals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The rheological behaviour of three different commercially manufactured
   chocolates are studied as a model paste system in order to understand
   their processing characteristics at different temperatures by using
   parallel-plate and capillary flow. The rheological behaviour is
   distinctly different at temperatures below and above 30 degrees C. At
   temperatures below 30 degrees C it behaves as a soft solid. A previously
   developed phenomenological mathematical model for
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) paste flow was used to model its rheology
   and capillary extrusion. The model takes into account the
   elastic-plastic (strain hardening) and viscous nature of the material in
   its non-melt state. The predictive capability of this model is tested
   against capillary data for a variety of capillary dies having different
   length-to-diameter ratios (L/D) and contraction angles (2 alpha). At
   temperatures above 30 degrees C, chocolate behaves as a
   visco-elasto-plastic liquid. Its behaviour has been determined as a
   Herschel-Bulkley viscoplastic material with a small degree of
   thixotropy. The rheological data obtained from parallel plates and
   bob-cup rheometer were used to formulate a thixotropic model using a
   structural parameter. The capillary data were found to be well described

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The entry capillary flow of four different polylactides (previously
   characterized by Othman et al. (2012)) has been modeled with both a
   viscous (Cross) and a viscoelastic (K-BKZ) model. The modeling takes
   into account slip-at-the-wall, which was found to increase with decrease
   of molecular weight. The flow through different capillary dies and
   apparent shear rates show the excess pressure losses (ends correction),
   which are smaller than those for other similar linear polymer melts. The
   viscous simulations capture well the ends correction, while the
   viscoelastic simulations improve these predictions, as they also account
   for the viscoelastic nature of the polymer melts. It is concluded that
   solely viscous modeling can capture their flow behavior satisfactorily.

Abstract = {{Turbulent drag reduction has been observed to occur over a wide range of
   additive systems, such as solution of synthetic or natural polymers, and
   fibre suspensions. In this study, the influence of softwood kraft pulp
   fibres and synthetic polymer additives on turbulent drag reduction (DR)
   in a hydrocyclone is investigated. It was demonstrated that cellulose
   fibre suspensions and aqueous polymeric solutions reduce the fluid
   energy losses in comparison to water during hydrocyclone operation
   within the range of reject ratios studied. A maximum drag reduction of
   58\% and 55\% was found to occur at a volume split fraction of 50\% for
   a 0.9\% fibre suspension and a 300ppm anionic polyacrylamide solution,
   respectively. Polymer degradation or polymer chain decay displayed
   adverse effects for 100ppm and 150ppm solutions after 22min of run time
   at 11.2kW pumping power and a reject ratio of 25\%. Synergistic effects
   were observed with pulp suspensions containing both cationic and anionic
   polyacrylamide (CPAM and APAM, respectively); a maximum DR of 41\% was
   observed for a 0.7\% fibre suspension containing 100-300ppm of polymer
   at a reject ratio of 50\%. Similarly to aqueous polymer solutions, the
   degradation of 300ppm APAM or CPAM in a 0.7\% fibre suspension decreased
   the observed DR up to 38\% after 30min of run time at 11.2kW pumping
   power and a reject ratio of 25\%. The near 43\% reduction in CPAM
   concentration, due to surface adsorption, when present in a 0.7\% fibre
   suspension assisted in quantifying the DR variations observed between
   suspensions containing APAM or CPAM.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling of equipment surfaces affects the efficient processing of heavy
   hydrocarbons. An experimental study is reported on the deposition of
   bitumen-containing droplets from a gas-vapour mixture at temperatures up
   to incipient coking conditions. A heavy oil-diluent feed mixture was
   atomized with nitrogen in a vertical spray chamber, and flowed upwards
   normal to a circular disk. The disk was attached to a load cell to
   measure total deposited mass with time, and at the end of each
   experiment the amount deposited was determined gravimetrically. The
   effects on deposition rate of heavy oil concentration in the feed
   mixture, temperature, and flow-rates of feed mixture and nitrogen were
   determined. Different surfaces and coatings were tested. The deposition
   rate was found to depend most strongly on the droplet concentration,
   which was predicted with HYSYS, using an isothermal flash calculation.
   As temperature was increased, deposit H/C atomic ratio decreased and ash
   content increased.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification of electrospun lignin nanofibres with
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) was conducted through
   surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRPase) using
   various biocatalysts under aqueous conditions. Three biocatalysts were
   investigated, a catalase from bovine liver (CBL), a peroxidase from
   horseradish (HRP), and a laccase from Trametes versicolor (LTV). All of
   the biocatalysts were found to successfully graft PNIPAM polymer brushes
   from the nanofibre surfaces. PNIPAM brush thickness was dependent on
   enzyme activity and significantly influenced by the reaction conditions;
   manipulating the type of enzyme, the concentration of reducing reagent
   and solution pH resulted in PNIPAM brushes of various molecular weight,
   thickness, and grafting density. Lignin fibre surface immobilized PNIPAM
   brushes with a thickness of >100 nm and a corresponding molecular weight
   of more than 1 x 10(6) g mol(-1) and a polydispersity index of less than
   1.30 were obtained using LTV as the catalyst and ascorbic acid as the
   reducing agent. The effect of reducing reagent on the weight percentage
   of PNIPAM on the nanofibre surface was determined by measuring the
   enthalpy (Delta H) of the phase transition, which was found to exhibit a
   similar trend as that of the measured PNIPAM brush thickness. Finally,
   the low critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM immobilized
   lignin nanofibre was similar to that of pure PNIPAM and decreased with
   increasing the ionic concentration, which simultaneously changed the
   modified fibre mats from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of histological slices to volumetric imaging of the
   prostate is an important task that can be used to optimize imaging for
   cancer detection. Such registration is challenging due to physical
   changes of the specimen during excision and fixation, and misalignment
   of the histological slices during preparation and digital scanning. In
   this work, we consider a multi-slice to volume registration method in
   which a stack of sparse, unaligned 2-D whole-mount histological slices
   is registered to a 3-D volumetric imaging of the prostate. We propose a
   particle filtering framework to contend with the high dimensionality of
   the search space and multimodal nature of the optimization. Such
   framework allows modeling of the uncertainty in the pose of the slices
   and in the imaged information, in order to derive optimal registration
   parameters in a Bayesian approach. Intensity-, region-, and point-based
   similarity metrics were incorporated into the registration algorithm to
   account for different imaging modalities. We demonstrate and evaluate
   our method on a diverse set of data that includes a synthetic volume, ex
   vivo and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, and in vivo ultrasound.}},

Title = {{On the use of body biasing to improve linearity in low LO-power CMOS
   active mixers}},
Journal = {{MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1026-1032}},

Abstract = {{In a radio-frequency (RF) transceiver, the linearity of the mixer has a
   profound effect on the overall transceiver performance. In many RF
   transceivers, active mixers are used due to their higher gain which also
   improves the overall receiver noise figure. In a typical RF active mixer
   where the transistors in the LO stage switch abruptly, most of the
   nonlinear distortions come from the transconductance or RF stage and
   thus the linearity of the mixer can be enhanced by proper design of the
   RF stage. In low-power receivers, however, to reduce the power
   consumption of the local oscillator (LO) circuit, the amplitude of LO
   signal is low and thus the switching of the transistors in the LO stage
   of the mixer is gradual. In this paper, we propose a technique to
   improve the linearity of such low-power mixers by enhancing the
   linearity of the LO stage. In particular, body biasing is utilized in
   the LO stage to improve the linearity. To verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed technique, two proof-of-concept double-balanced
   down-conversion active mixers have been designed and fabricated in
   0.13-mu m CMOS. The maximum IIP3 of +2.7 dBm and -4.9 dBm at a
   conversion gain of 13 dB and 16 dB are achieved for the first and second
   prototype respectively. For a 2.4 GHz RF input signal and an
   intermediate-Frequency (IF) of 50 MHz, the first prototype consumes 2.4
   mW from a 1.2 V supply while the second one consumes only 780 mu W from
   a 0.7 V supply. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An overview of air emission intensities and environmental performance of
   grey cement manufacturing in Canada}},
Journal = {{CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Air emissions generated in grey cement manufacturing originate primarily
   from the combustion of fossil fuels required to heat the kiln and the
   chemical reaction of raw materials in the pyroprocessing phase. Given
   that the kiln system is enclosed, air emissions generated, discharge
   from a single point source kiln stack. Unlike other industries, the
   point source kiln stack enables the cement sector to accurately monitor
   and record total air emissions. The largest contributors to air
   emissions from grey cement manufacturing are carbon dioxide (CO2),
   oxides of nitrogen (NO (x) ), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and dust/particulate
   matter (PM). In Canada, grey cement manufacturing facilities are
   required to annually report these emissions through the National
   Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI). Since CO2, NO (x) , SO2 and PM are
   the largest contributors to air emissions, and Canadian grey cement
   facilities are required to report these emissions, combining NPRI data
   with annual grey cement production data allows for the development of
   intensity-based environmental performance indicators. Based on data
   provided by NPRI, in combination with industry production, we can better
   understand the environmental performance of Canada's grey cement
   manufacturing. On the global stage, intensity-based performance measures
   provide a useful tool for comparison and demonstrate a strong
   environmental performance for grey cement production in Canada. As an
   energy intensive and trade exposed (EITE) grey cement manufacturing is
   vulnerable to unbalanced environmental policy, which may ultimately
   result in leakage of production and air emissions to developing
   countries.}},

   three-dimensional porous materials. We do so using a variety of liquids,

   the imbibition process using high-speed digital imaging. Here,
   experiments were conducted on 2-280 nm CPG membranes with drops with
   initial volumes ranging from 100 to 600 pL. We derive scaling laws for
   imbibition through dimensional analysis and advance the argument that
   the rate of absorption is related to two-dimensionless groups where v(t)
   is the imbibed volume, as determined from experiments, t is the time, v
   (tot) the total liquid volume, the porosity, mu the liquid viscosity, k
   the permeability, and p (c) the Laplace capillary pressure. We show this
   scaling to well describe the system at intermediate T values and report

Abstract = {{Self-propelled jumping upon drop coalescence has been observed on a
   variety of textured superhydrophobic surfaces, where the jumping motion
   follows the capillary-inertial velocity scaling as long as the drop
   radius is above a threshold. In this paper, we report an experimental
   study of the self-propelled jumping on a Leidenfrost surface, where the
   heated substrate gives rise to a vapour layer on which liquid drops
   float. For the coalescence of identical water drops, we have tested
   initial drop radii ranging from 20 to 500 mu m, where the lower bound is
   related to the spontaneous takeoff of individual drops and the upper
   bound to gravitational effects. Regardless of the approaching velocity
   prior to coalescence, the measured jumping velocity is around 0.2 when
   scaled by the capillary-inertial velocity. This constant non-dimensional
   velocity holds for the experimentally accessible range of drop radii,
   and we have found no cutoff radius for the scaling, in contrast to prior
   experiments on textured superhydrophobic surfaces. The Leidenfrost
   experiments quantitatively agree with our numerical simulations of drop
   coalescence on a flat surface with a contact angle of 180 degrees,
   suggesting that the cutoff is likely to be due to drop-surface
   interactions unique to the textured superhydrophobic surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Coalescing drops spontaneously jump out of plane on a variety of
   biological and synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces, with potential
   applications ranging from self-cleaning materials to self-sustained
   condensers. To investigate the mechanism of self-propelled jumping, we
   report three-dimensional phase-field simulations of two identical
   spherical drops coalescing on a flat surface with a contact angle of 180
   degrees. The numerical simulations capture the spontaneous jumping
   process, which follows the capillary-inertial scaling. The out-of-plane
   directionality is shown to result from the counter-action of the
   substrate to the impingement of the liquid bridge between the coalescing
   drops. A viscous cutoff to the capillary-inertial velocity scaling is
   identified when the Ohnesorge number of the initial drops is around 0.1,
   but the corresponding viscous cutoff radius is too small to be tested
   experimentally. Compared to experiments on both superhydrophobic and
   Leidenfrost surfaces, our simulations accurately predict the nearly
   constant jumping velocity of around 0.2 when scaled by the
   capillary-inertial velocity. By comparing the simulated drop coalescence
   processes with and without the substrate, we attribute this low
   non-dimensional velocity to the substrate intercepting only a small
   fraction of the expanding liquid bridge.}},

Title = {{Auto-ejection of liquid drops from capillary tubes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{752}},
Pages = {{670-692}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Wicking flow inside capillary tubes can attain considerable momentum so
   as to produce a liquid jet at the end of the tube. Auto-ejection refers
   to the formation of droplets at the tip of such a jet. Experimental
   observations suggest that a tapering nozzle at the end of the capillary
   tube is necessary for auto-ejection; it has never been reported for a
   straight tube. Besides, most experimental realizations require
   microgravity, although it is possible under normal gravity if the nozzle
   has a sufficiently sharp contraction. This computational study focuses
   on two related issues: the critical condition for auto-ejection, and the
   hydrodynamics of the liquid meniscus as affected by geometric
   parameters. We adopt a diffuse-interface Cahn-Hilliard model for the
   moving contact line, and allow the dynamic contact angle to deviate from
   the static one through wall energy relaxation. From analyzing the
   dynamics of the meniscus in the straight tube and the nozzle, we
   establish a critical condition for the onset of auto-ejection based on a
   Weber number defined at the exit of the nozzle and an effective length
   that encompasses the geometric features of the tube-nozzle combination.
   In particular, this shows that capillary ejection is not possible in
   straight tubes. With steeper contraction in the nozzle, we predict two
   additional regimes of interfacial rupture: rapid ejection of multiple
   droplets and air bubble entrapment. The numerical results are in general
   agreement with available experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Limited access to sophisticated technology and the
   unreliability of simple tools prevent accurate and reliable human
   standing balance assessments outside research laboratory settings. The
   goal of this study was to develop and validate a simple objective
   balance assessment tool that provides an accurate, reliable, and
   affordable alternative to currently available laboratory and clinical
   methods. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects were filmed performing the
   Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) while wearing inertial measurement
   units (IMU) measuring linear accelerations and angular velocities from
   seven locations of the body: forehead, sternum, waist, right and left
   wrist, and right and left shin. Each video was scored by four
   experienced BESS raters, whose mean scores were used to develop an
   algorithm computing objective BESS (oBESS) scores solely from IMU data.
   Interrater reliability and accuracy of oBESS scores were assessed using
   intraclass correlations (ICC). Results: Raters displayed low variability
   in scoring (ICC3,1 = 0.91). The oBESS was able to produce scores with
   accurate fit to raters (ICC3,1 = 0.92) and predicted individual BESS
   scores (ICC3,1 = 0.90) using data from one IMU placed at the forehead.
   oBESS was unable to produce accurate scores (ICC3,1 = 0.68) when using
   IMU data from the subset of conditions (firm surface only) used in
   popular concussion identification protocols. Conclusion: The oBESS can
   reliably predict total BESS scores in healthy subjects. Pending further
   validation, oBESS could represent a valid tool to assess balance by
   offering an objective and reliable alternative to the current scoring
   methods of the BESS.}},

Title = {{Assessment and optimization of forest biomass supply chains from

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Forest biomass is a renewable source that has the potential to
   substitute fossil fuels in many applications, from the generation of
   bioenergy (heat, electricity or transportation fuels) to the production
   of bioproducts (chemicals and other materials). The increased use of
   forest biomass could support the reduction of anthropogenic carbon
   emissions to the environment and could help forest-dependent communities
   achieve energy independence while generating jobs. The viability and
   feasibility of generating valuable products from forest biomass depend
   on ensuring the long-term availability of biomass supply with the
   required quality at a competitive cost. This calls for a cost-efficient
   design of the forest biomass supply chain. Social and environmental
   aspects have to be considered in the design as well to guarantee
   sustainable use of this renewable resource. In this paper, we present a
   review of studies that assessed or optimized economic, social and
   environmental aspects of forest biomass supply chains for the production
   of bioenergy and bioproducts. The majority of studies so far considered
   either economic (techno-economic and optimization studies) or
   environmental (life cycle assessment studies) aspects of bioenergy
   projects. Nevertheless, there is a recent trend to integrate economic,
   environmental and social aspects in the assessment and optimization of
   forest biomass supply chains. Combined approaches integrating
   multi-objective optimization and life cycle assessment have started to
   flourish. In these studies, GHG emissions are the most frequently used
   environmental indicator, production and capital costs are the preferred
   economic measures and the number of created jobs is the most considered
   social criterion. Further research has to be done to study and assess
   the potential social impacts of using forest biomass. There is a need
   for further development of decision support tools that consider
   economic, environmental and social criteria to aid the design and
   planning of forest biomass supply chains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Many researches have been conducted on the health influence of Particle

   paper, a data-analysis approach of the PM issue is raised to offer a new
   viewpoint of this problem. The applied method extracts the relations of
   air quality system record as a relation map, which illustrates the
   influence among the parameters in a graph. The method successfully
   fitted the weather record, and derived from it the influencers of PM.
   The result shows that the average temperature, average barometric
   pressure and concentration of Ozone are all factors that have an
   influence on the concentration of PM A short justification of it is also

Abstract = {{During the last decade, the development of tidal current industries has
   experienced a rapid growth. Many devices are being prototyped. For
   various purposes, investors, industries, government and academics are
   looking to identify the best device in terms of of cost of energy and
   performance. However, it is difficult to compare the cost of energy of
   new devices directly because of uncertainties in the operational and
   capital costs. It may however be possible to compare the power output of
   different devices by standardizing the definition of power coefficients.
   In this paper, we derive a formula to quantify the power coefficient of
   different devices. Specifically, this formula covers ducted devices, and
   it suggests that the duct shape should be considered. We also propose a
   procedure to quantify the efficiency of a tidal current turbine farm by
   using the power output of the farm where no hydrodynamic interaction
   exists between turbines, which normalizes a given farm's power output We
   also show that the maximum efficiency of a farm can be obtained when the
   hydrodynamic interaction exists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study quantified the significant environmental impacts of a
   two-story residential building located in Vancouver, Canada, with a
   projected 60-year life span: (i) an inventory of all the construction
   materials was analyzed, covering the building structure and exterior and
   interior envelopes as well as the energy consumption; (ii) four types of
   functional units were defined; (iii) the five top building materials
   were examined, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate
   the impact associated with the choice of building materials. Two life
   cycle phases, manufacturing and operation, were more significant in all
   of the impact categories, and two building assemblies, the walls and the
   roof, bore most of the environmental loads. In terms of the sensitivity
   analysis, the roofing asphalt had the largest impact, dominating three
   of the seven selected impact categories. Despite different definitions
   of functional units, the function of the dwelling buildings is always
   the same, to provide protection and housing for their habitants.
   Additionally, to improve the performance of an existing building,
   several strategies were proposed for the building renovation and
   maintenance, including alternative replacement materials regarding the
   building components with high environmental burdens, good patterns of
   the occupants' consumption behaviors as well as considerations of the
   financial and environmental cost. Finally, limitations and challenges
   are discussed to explore better design decisions in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{A series of three bis(tridentate) cycloruthenated sensitizers with
   furyl, thiophene, or selenophene units attached to the cyclometalated
   ligand were designed to examine how chalcogen atoms effect interfacial
   electron transfer events that occur following the absorption of visible
   light by the sensitizers when attached to mesoporous titania thin films
   immersed in CH3CN electrolytes. Spectroelectrochemistry established that
   the Ru-III/II reduction potentials were confined to the 0.954-0.965 V vs
   NHE range for the series and that the density of TiO2 acceptor states
   were sensitizer-independent. Pulsed light excitation into the
   metal-to-ligand charge transfer band of the sensitized thin films
   resulted in rapid excited state injection k(inj) > 10(8) s(-1). Charge
   recombination (Ru-III/TiO2(e(-)) -> Ru-II/TiO2) rate constants were
   insensitive to the identity of the cyclometalated compound, yet the open
   circuit photovoltages were markedly lower for the compound containing
   selenophene. These lower photovoltages appear to be a manifestation of a
   4-fold-larger, second-order rate constant measured for the reaction
   between triiodide and TiO2(e(-)) in the case that the selenophene
   comprises the donor fragment of the dye. Adduct formation between
   oxidized iodide(s) and the selenophene moiety of the sensitizer is
   implicated.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model has been developed for the i-CFB deNO(x) reactor,
   which is designed for the hydrocarbon-based selective catalytic
   reduction (HC-SCR) process. The i-CFB model consists of three submodels:
   hydrodynamics, NOx adsorption, and reaction kinetics. The modeling
   results show good agreement with the experimental data. It is observed
   from the simulation that the performance of the i-CFB reactor is very
   sensitive to gas bypass from the draft tube to the annulus (R-d.a) but
   is less sensitive to the converse (R-a.d). The solids circulation rate
   (G(s)) has little effect on the overall deNO(x) efficiency. The analysis
   of NOx adsorption and reduction at both the annulus and the draft tube
   zones revealed that solids residence time in the reduction zone is too
   short for the NOx reduction reaction for the current i-CFB reactor
   design. A large reduction zone could significantly enhance the overall
   deNO(x) efficiency. The optimum reduction zone area ratio
   (A(R)/A(total)) should be similar to 0.65-0.7. Further increases in the
   A(R)/A(total) ratio will decrease NOx conversion. It is also observed
   that the performance of the i-CFB at higher A(R)/A(total) ratios is less
   sensitive to gas bypass from the reduction zone to the adsorption zone.
   The deNO(x) efficiency of i-CFB reactor becomes more sensitive to NOx
   adsorption capacity at higher A(R)/A(total) ratios.}},

   acid by azeotropic distillation proposed in our earlier publication
   {[}Li et al., hid. Eng. Chem. Res., 2013, 52, 3481-3489], in this paper,
   the vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) for the FeSO4 + H2O and H2SO4 + FeSO4
   + H2O systems were first determined by the quasi-static ebulliometric
   method. The azeotropic temperatures of the H2SO4 + H2O + entrainer
   (cyclohexane and octane) systems were also measured. The corresponding
   electrolyte nonrandom two-liquid interaction parameters were obtained by
   regressing the experimental data with a maximum average absolute
   deviation of boiling points of 0.83 K. The model with newly obtained
   parameters was verified by comparing its prediction with the
   experimental azeotropic temperature for the H2SO4 + FeSO4 + H2O + C6H12
   quaternary system. The temperature and sulfuric acid concentration
   ranges of the study were 305.9-396.9 K and 0-86.1 wt \%, respectively.
   Following from the experimental results, semicontinuous distillation
   experiments for the sulfuric acid recovery were performed with
   cyclohexane as the entrainer. Equipped with the new parameters, Aspen
   Plus was adopted to carry out the process simulation for the recovery of
   dilute sulfuric acid by azeotropic distillation. The simulation results
   show that when cyclohexane was employed as the entrainer, the dilute
   sulfuric acid can be concentrated to 68\% by a packed column containing
   4 theoretical stages and with a reboiler temperature of only 361 K.}},

Abstract = {{Oil palm residues are not currently suitable as feedstock for thermal
   energy generation because their high ash content can cause slagging,
   corrosion, and fouling. A water leaching treatment is a potential
   strategy to reduce the ash content in these residues. This study
   evaluates the effects of the duration and temperature of water leaching
   on two types of oil palm residues, namely, empty fruit bunches (EFBs)
   and palm kernel shells (PKSs). The optimum process duration for ash
   removal from EFBs was found to be 5 min, as the effect of convection on
   scrubbing was observed to remove substantial ash from the substrate
   during this period. A cross-flow model with estimated kinetic parameters
   of water leaching for EFB and PKS was developed and showed that three
   leaching stages of EFB achieved the greatest ash reduction from 5.47\%
   to 2.63\%. A low ash content of PKS showed no value for ash removal in
   any leaching process. Although there was no significance in the total
   ash reduction due to temperature effects, the leaching treatment was
   found to be most effective in reducing potassium, from 2.42\% to 0.69\%
   and 0.36\% at 25 and 55 degrees C, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Katabatic flows over alpine mountainous terrain differ from their
   forested or bare slope counterparts due to the presence of
   well-ventilated, short vegetation. The impact of a grass canopy and
   larger-scale pressure perturbations on the one-dimensional mean momentum
   balance is explored via theory and field measurements. The model
   presented here reproduces the measured velocity jet shape and turbulent
   flux gradients. These two features imply that even when Monin-Obuhkov
   similarity theory breaks down, its use for a stability adjusted mixing
   length remains effective to first order. Results reveal that outer layer
   pressure effects can be significant under low-speed wind conditions at
   the top of the thin katabatic layer when larger variations in the wind
   direction are observed. An analytical expression to estimate the jet
   height, which can be utilized in large-scale weather prediction models,
   shows the importance of including canopy effects for the thin katabatic
   flow region above the vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D coupled thermal-fluid model describing mass, momentum and energy
   transport within a Ti-6Al-4V rolling ingot cast in an (Electron Beam
   Cold Hearth Remelting) EBCHR process has been developed to describe
   steady state casting conditions. The model incorporates a number of the
   physical phenomena inherent to the industrial process, including a metal
   inlet in the center of one of the narrow faces, complex boundary
   conditions based on industrial practice, buoyancy driven flow within the
   liquid and flow attenuation using a Darcy momentum source term within
   the mushy zone. The model ignores turbulence in the liquid pool and
   Marangoni (surface tension) driven surface flows. The model has been
   validated against liquid pool depth and profile measurements made on an
   experimental casting seeded with insoluble dense markers and doped with
   dense alloy additions. Comparisons have also been made to video images
   taken of the top surface during casting. The results indicate that the
   model is able to quantitatively predict the steady state sump depth and
   profile and is able to qualitatively predict aspects of the top surface
   temperature distribution. The model has also been used to conduct a
   process heat balance and sensitivity analyses. The process heat balance
   conducted on the model domain indicates that at steady state the liquid
   metal inlet contributes 88\% of the total power input, while the
   electron beam provides net 12\% after accounting for radiation losses
   from the top surface; 62\% of the heat is lost through the ingots sides
   and the balance is lost via bulk transport of sensible heat through the
   bottom of the domain. The results of the sensitivity analysis on pool
   depth indicate that casting rate has the largest effect followed by
   metal inlet superheat. The thermal, flow and pressure fields predicted
   by the steady state model serves as the initial conditions for a
   transient hot-top model, which is the subject of a forth-coming paper.

Abstract = {{The usability of IT security management (ITSM) tools is hard to evaluate
   by regular methods, making heuristic evaluation attractive. In this
   article, we explore how domain specific heuristics are created by
   examining prior research in the area of heuristic and guideline
   creation. We then describe our approach of creating usability heuristics
   for ITSM tools, which is based on guidelines for ITSM tools that are
   interpreted and abstracted with activity theory. With a between-subjects
   study, we compared the employment of the ITSM and Nielsen's heuristics
   for evaluation of a commercial identity management system. Participants
   who used the ITSM set found more problems categorized as severe than
   those who used Nielsen's. We analyzed several aspects of our heuristics
   including the performance of individual participants using the
   heuristic, the performance of individual heuristics, the similarity of
   our heuristics to Nielsen's, and the participants' opinion about the use
   of heuristics for evaluation of IT security tools. We then discuss the
   implications of our results on the use of ITSM and Nielsen's heuristics
   for usability evaluation of ITSM tools.}},

Abstract = {{The cyanidation process is still the dominant technique for gold ore
   treatment. In this study, the potential use of the guanidine extractant
   LIX 7950 for recovering silver and gold from alkaline cyanide solution
   was investigated. The results indicate that LIX 7950 can effectively and
   efficiently extract silver and gold from their cyanide solution. The
   extraction of silver and gold with the extractant is favorable at low
   pH. High cyanide to silver ratio tends to suppress silver loading while
   cyanide concentration exhibits insignificant effect on gold extraction.
   The extraction of the mixture solution of metal cyanide complexes with
   the extractant indicated an extraction sequence of Au>Ag>Zn>Ni>Cu>Fe.
   The loaded silver and gold can be stripped off efficiently with moderate
   strong NaOH solutions at the presence of small amount of NaCN. The
   important findings in the research suggest that the extractant can be
   potentially used to recover silver and gold from alkaline cyanide
   leachate and the barren cyanide solution from the SX circuit can be
   recycled to the cyanidation process.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of fuel cells is
   numerically studied using a pore network modeling approach. The model is
   developed based on an experimental visualization technique (fluorescence
   microscopy). The images obtained from this technique are analyzed to
   find patterns of flow inside the GDL samples with different
   hydrophobicity. Three different flow patterns are observed: initial
   invasion, progression, and pore-filling. The observation shows that
   liquid water flows into the majority of available pores on the boundary
   of the untreated GDL and several branches are segregated from the
   initial pathways. For the treated GDL, however, a handful of boundary
   pores are invaded and the original pathways extend toward the other side
   of the medium with minimum branching. The numerical model, developed
   based on an invasion percolation algorithm, is used to study the effects
   of GDL hydrophobicity and thickness on the flow configuration and
   breakthrough time as well as to determine the flow rate and saturation
   in different GDL samples. During the injection of water into the
   samples, it is numerically shown that the flow rates are monotonically
   decreasing for both treated and untreated samples. For the treated
   sample, however, the injection flow rate is constantly lower than that
   of the untreated sample, resulting in a lower overall water saturation
   at breakthrough. The numerical results also suggest that hydrophobic
   treatment of thick samples has minor effects on water management and
   overall performance. The developed model can be used to optimize the GDL
   properties for designing porous medium with effective transport
   characteristics. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Dairy manure, acidified using organic acids (acetic, oxalic, and citric
   acid) were treated with microwave enhanced advanced oxidation process
   (MW/H2O2-AOP). The effect of a mixture of oxalic acid and commonly used
   mineral acids (sulfuric and hydrochloric acid) on MW/H2O2-AOP was also
   examined. Substantial amounts of phosphorus were released under
   MW/H2O2-AOP, regardless of organic acid or mineral acid used. All three
   organic acids were good acidifying reagents; however, only oxalic acid
   could remove free calcium ion in the solution, and improve settleability
   of dairy manure. The MW/H2O2-AOP and calcium removal process could be
   combined into a single-stage process, which could release phosphate,
   solubilize solids and remove calcium from dairy manure at the same time.
   A mixture of oxalic acid and mineral acid produced the maximum volume of
   clear supernatant and had an ideal molar ratio of calcium to magnesium
   for effective struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) crystallization
   process. A single-stage MW/H2O2-AOP would simplify the process and
   reduce mineral acid consumption compared to a two-stage operation. The
   results of a pilot scale study demonstrate that MW/H2O2-AOP is effective
   in treating manure and recovering resource from dairy farms.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of distributed generation based on renewable energy sources
   into the power system has gained popularity in recent years. Many
   small-scale electricity suppliers (SESs) have recently entered the
   electricity market, which has been traditionally dominated by a few
   large-scale electricity suppliers. The emergence of SESs enables direct
   trading (DT) of electricity between SESs and end-users (EUs), without
   going through retailers, and promotes the possibility of improving the
   benefits to both parties. In this paper, the cooperation between SESs
   and EUs in DT is analyzed based on coalitional game theory. In
   particular, an electricity pricing scheme that achieves a fair division
   of revenue between SESs and EUs is analytically derived by using the
   asymptotic Shapley value. The asymptotic Shapley value is shown to be in
   the core of the coalitional game such that no group of SESs and EUs has
   an incentive to abandon the coalition, which implies the stable
   operation of DT for the proposed pricing scheme. Unlike the existing
   pricing schemes that typically require multiple stages of calculations
   and real time information about each participant, the electricity price
   for the proposed scheme can be determined instantaneously based on the
   number of participants in DT and statistical information about
   electricity supply and demand. Therefore, the proposed pricing scheme is
   suitable for practical implementation. Using computer simulations, the
   price of electricity for the proposed DT scheme is examined in various
   environments, and the numerical results validate the asymptotic
   analysis. Moreover, the revenues of the SESs and EUs are evaluated for
   various types of SESs and different numbers of participants in DT. The
   optimal ratio of different types of SESs is also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Different from a traditional wireless sensor network (WSN) powered by
   nonrechargeable batteries, the energy management policy of a
   rechargeable WSN needs to take into account the process of energy
   harvesting. In this paper, we study the energy allocation for sensing
   and transmission in an energy harvesting sensor node with a rechargeable
   battery and a finite data buffer. The sensor aims to maximize the
   expected total amount of data transmitted until the sensor stops
   functioning subject to time-varying energy harvesting rate, energy
   availability in the battery, data availability in the data buffer, and
   channel fading. Since the lifetime of the sensor is a random variable,
   we formulate the energy allocation problem as an infinite-horizon Markov
   decision process (MDP), and propose an optimal energy allocation (OEA)
   algorithm using the value iteration. We then consider a special case
   with infinite data backlog and prove that the optimal transmission
   energy allocation (OTEA) policy is monotonic with respect to the amount
   of battery energy available. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations
   to compare the performance of our OEA algorithm, OTEA algorithm, the
   finite-horizon transmission energy allocation (FHTEA) algorithm extended
   from {[}2], and the finite-horizon OEA (FHOEA) algorithm from {[}1].
   Simulation results show that the OEA algorithm transmits the largest
   amount of data, and the OTEA algorithm can achieve a near-optimal
   performance with low computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{In computational fluid dynamics models for hemodynamics applications,
   boundary conditions remain one of the major issues in obtaining accurate
   fluid flow predictions. For major cardiovascular models, the realistic
   boundary conditions are not available. In order to address this issue,
   the whole computational domain needs to be modeled, which is practically
   impossible. For simulating fully developed turbulent flows using the
   large eddy simulation and dynamic numerical solution methods, which are
   very popular in hemodynamics studies, periodic boundary conditions are
   suitable. This is mainly because the computational domain can be reduced
   considerably. In this study, a novel periodic boundary condition is
   proposed, which is based on mass flow condition. The proposed boundary
   condition is applied on a square duct for the sake of validation. The
   mass-based condition was shown to obtain the solution in 15\% less time.
   As such, the mass-based condition has two decisive advantages: first,
   the solution for a given Reynolds number can be obtained in a single
   simulation because of the direct specification of the mass flow, and
   second, simulations can be made more quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic properties of aggregate are different from those of
   impermeable particles and have not been well established, owing to their
   complex structural feature. Therefore, this paper focuses on the study
   of hydrodynamic properties of an aggregate by computational fluid
   dynamics method. An aggregate with self-similar structure composed of
   four primary spheres is constructed to account for its fractal geometry.
   Navier-Stokes equations are applied for the whole flow field in relation
   to the aggregate. Both exterior and interior flow through the aggregate
   could be seen clearly. Fluid collection efficiency, an indication of
   permeability, is also obtained. Reynolds number has complicated
   influence on fluid collection efficiency. Furthermore, the larger the
   space between four primary particles is, the larger the fluid collection
   efficiency. The smaller the fractal dimension is, the larger the fluid
   collection efficiency. These findings will enable the development of
   more realistic models for the flocculation and material transfer
   dynamics of fractal aggregate. All these results contribute to further
   research about mass transfer between the aggregate interior and the bulk
   liquid solution, as well as those researches related to irregular porous
   structures. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the rate-optimal transceiver design for a
   hybrid single-carrier frequency-domain equalization and orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing decode-and-forward (DF)
   multiple-input-multiple-output(MIMO) relay system. Such hybrid systems
   can provide a high end-to-end bit rate and a low peak-to-average power
   ratio at one of the transmitting nodes. Assuming minimum
   mean-squared-error equalization at the receiving nodes, we optimize the
   transmit precoding matrices for maximization of the achievable bit rate
   (ABR) of the system subject to a joint node transmit power constraint.
   We provide a unified solution for the precoding matrices, which subsumes
   the solutions for pure single-carrier and pure multicarrier MIMO DF
   relay systems as special cases. Specifically, the optimal structure of
   the precoding matrices is obtained by exploiting the relation between
   our design and conventional point-to-point MIMO transceiver designs.
   With the optimal precoding structure, the optimization problem reduces
   to a convex power allocation problem, for which an efficient closed-form
   solution is derived. Numerical results are provided to confirm the
   excellent ABR performance of the proposed relaying schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Corticomuscular coupling analysis based on multiple datasets such as
   electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides
   a useful tool for understanding human motor control systems. A popular
   conventional method to assess corticomuscular coupling has been the
   pair-wise magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between EEG and concomitant
   EMG recordings. However, there are certain limitations associated with
   the MSC, including the difficulty in robustly assessing group inference,
   only dealing with two types of datasets simultaneously and the
   biologically implausible assumption of pair-wise interactions. To
   overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose assessing
   corticomuscular coupling by combining multiset canonical correlation
   analysis (M-CCA) and joint independent component analysis (jICA). The
   proposed method takes advantage of the M-CCA and jICA to ensure that the
   extracted components are maximally correlated across multiple datasets
   and meanwhile statistically independent within each dataset. Simulations
   were performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. We
   also applied the proposed method to concurrent EEG, EMG, and behavior
   data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results reveal
   highly correlated temporal patterns among the three types of signals and
   corresponding spatial activation patterns. In addition to the expected
   motor areas, the corresponding spatial activation patterns demonstrate
   enhanced occipital connectivity in the PD subjects, consistent with
   previous medical findings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design to make ambulatory health
   monitoring via body area networks (BAN) more reliable and robust. The
   proposed design builds on our centralized body area network access
   scheme (CBAS), a receiver-initiated medium access control (MAC) scheme
   that improves the visibility of a BAN in a coexistent environment, where
   diverse networks with various physical and MAC protocols share the radio
   spectrum. The design enhances CBAS by incorporating a network layer
   scheme that improves the packet delivery ratio (PDR), while minimizing
   the need for multihop cooperative transmissions; thus, packet delay is
   less compromised to achieve higher PDRs. The MAC layer provides the
   network layer with local information about the quality of on-body links
   to enable the BAN to identify the most reliable links in a distributed
   manner. Extensive experimental results are presented, which give
   insights on how the proposed cross-layer design improves PDR and packet
   delay. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed design which takes
   advantage of dynamic scheduling and multihop relays as warranted by the

Abstract = {{This paper reports a method that enables real-time displacement
   monitoring and control of micromachined resonant-type actuators using
   wireless radiofrequency (RF). The method is applied to an out-of-plane,
   spiral-coil microactuator based on shape-memory-alloy (SMA). The SMA
   spiral coil forms an inductor-capacitor resonant circuit that is excited
   using external RF magnetic fields to thermally actuate the coil. The
   actuation causes a shift in the circuit's resonance as the coil is
   displaced vertically, which is wirelessly monitored through an external
   antenna to track the displacements. Controlled actuation and
   displacement monitoring using the developed method is demonstrated with
   the microfabricated device. The device exhibits a frequency sensitivity
   to displacement of 10 kHz/mu m or more for a full out-of-plane travel
   range of 466 mu m and an average actuation velocity of up to 155 mu m/s.
   The method described permits the actuator to have a self-sensing
   function that is passively operated, thereby eliminating the need for
   separate sensors and batteries on the device, thus realizing precise
   control while attaining a high level of miniaturization in the device.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a multiple kernel learning support vector machine
   algorithm is proposed for the identification of EEG signals including
   mental and cognitive tasks, which is a key component in EEG-based brain
   computer interface (BCI) systems. The presented BCI approach included
   three stages: (1) a pre-processing step was performed to improve the
   general signal quality of the EEG; (2) the features were chosen,
   including wavelet packet entropy and Granger causality, respectively;
   (3) a multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM) based on
   a gradient descent optimization algorithm was investigated to classify
   EEG signals, in which the kernel was defined as a linear combination of
   polynomial kernels and radial basis function kernels. Experimental
   results showed that the proposed method provided better classification
   performance compared with the SVM based on a single kernel. For mental
   tasks, the average accuracies for 2-class, 3-class, 4-class, and 5-class
   classifications were 99.20\%, 81.25\%, 76.76\%, and 75.25\%
   respectively. Comparing stroke patients with healthy controls using the
   proposed algorithm, we achieved the average classification accuracies of
   89.24\% and 80.33\% for 0-back and 1-back tasks respectively. Our
   results indicate that the proposed approach is promising for
   implementing human-computer interaction (HCI), especially for mental
   task classification and identifying suitable brain impairment
   candidates.}},

Abstract = {{We show analytically that a well-known transfer function previously

   the vector electromagnetic borehole ground penetrating radar problem. We
   also show that the transfer function's precision is improved for the
   low-loss case through the use of complex velocity. The transfer function
   has a strong effect on amplitude, and is therefore a critical
   preprocessing step for 2-D full-wave inversion when finding conductivity
   is of concern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the transfer function
   through various numerical experiments and a synthetic frequency-domain
   full-wave inversion. We also compare the effectiveness of this
   curved-ray transfer function to a quasi-straight-ray transfer function.
   The inversion demonstrates the positive effect the transfer functions
   have on recovering conductivity and also that they are effective even
   when there are sharp velocity contrasts.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the dependence of the crystalline volume fraction on the mean
   crystallite size for hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon based
   photovoltaic solar cells; this work builds upon an earlier study by
   Schmidt et al. (Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 1536 (2013)). For each
   photovoltaic solar cell considered, the X-ray diffraction and Raman
   spectra are measured. Through the application of Scherrer's equation,
   the X-ray diffraction results are used to determine the corresponding
   mean crystallite sizes. Through peak decomposition, the Raman results
   are used to estimate the corresponding crystalline volume fraction.
   Plotting the crystalline volume fraction as a function of the mean
   crystallite size, it is found that larger mean crystallite sizes tend to
   favor reduced crystalline volume fractions. The ability to randomly pack
   smaller crystallites with a greater packing fraction than their larger
   counterparts was suggested as a possible explanation for this
   observation.}},

   uranium(IV) sulfate x-hydrate changes from being fully crosslinked in
   three dimensions in the anhydrous compound, through sheet and chain

Title = {{Cervical Vertebral Realignment When Voluntarily Adopting a Protective

Journal = {{SPINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{E885-E893}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Design. In vivo human volunteer study of the intervertebral
   postural changes and muscle activity levels while tensing the neck
   muscles.
   Objective. To determine if actively tensing the neck muscles changes the
   posture of the cervical spine and, because axial impact neck injury
   often occurs while inverted, whether these changes exist both upright
   and upside down.
   Summary of Background Data. Rollover accidents are dynamic and complex
   events in which head contacts with the vehicle interior can cause
   catastrophic neck injuries. Computational modeling has suggested that
   active neck muscles may increase the risk of cervical spine fracture in
   a rollover crash. Cadaver testing has also demonstrated that overall
   neck alignment and curvature are key to understanding and preventing
   catastrophic neck injuries. Although muscle activity and neck posture
   affects the resulting injury, there are currently no in vivo data
   describing how tensing the neck muscles influences intervertebral
   posture.
   Methods. Eleven human subjects (6 females, 5 males) actively tensed
   their neck muscles while seated upright and inverted. Vertebral
   alignment was measured using fluoroscopy and muscle activity was
   recorded using surface and indwelling electrodes in 8 neck muscles.
   Results. On average, tensed muscles increased cervical spine curvature
   and anterior motion of the cervical vertebrae relative to the torso.
   These changes, which were magnified by inversion, indicate that cervical
   intervertebral posture differs considerably between the relaxed and
   tensed states.
   Conclusion. Active muscle contraction can change the vertebral alignment
   in upright and inverted postures. This change in posture may alter the
   load path and injury mechanics during an axial head impact and may help
   explain the disparity between the neck injuries observed in real-world
   rollover accidents and ex vivo cadaver experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the impact of deep cryogenic and tempering treatment on
   the corrosion behavior of AISI 420 (UNS S42000) and AISI 52100 (UNS
   G52986) steel in 3.5\% sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium bicarbonate
   (NaHCO3) + 0.25\% NaCl solution was studied using open-circuit potential
   (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The relationship of microstructure and
   the electrochemical response of differently treated samples was
   discussed. The results indicated that, compared with the conventional
   treatment, no significant modification of the electrochemical corrosion
   behavior after cryogenic treatments was observed. No passive behavior
   was observed for either AISI 420 or AISI 52100 in 3.5\% NaCl, whereas it
   was observed in NaHCO3 + 0.25\% NaCl solution. Different effects of
   tempering treatment on the corrosion behavior between AISI 420 and AISI
   52100 were observed due to different modifications of the microstructure
   during the tempering process. The amount of retained austenite has a
   critical role in determining the pitting resistance. The pitting
   resistance increased with the amount of retained austenite.}},

Title = {{Group reduction factors for analysis of laterally loaded pile groups}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{51}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The lateral response of piles embedded in soil is typically analyzed
   using the beam on nonlinear Winkler springs approach, in which soil-pile
   interaction is modeled by nonlinear p-y curves (where p is soil
   resistance and y is horizontal displacement). In this approach, one of
   the most common methods of accounting for interaction effects in pile
   groups is to modify the single pile p-y curves using a p-multiplier for
   each row of piles in the group, with higher values for leading row and
   lower values for trailing rows. The leading and trailing rows
   interchange during seismic loading; therefore, sometimes an average
   p-multiplier is used for all piles in the group. This average
   p-multiplier is called the group reduction factor. Group reduction
   factors have been established from experimental data from static loading
   tests on small pile groups, mostly 3 x 3 groups with free pile head
   conditions and center-to-center pile spacings of about 3 pile diameters.
   In this paper, continuum simulations are used to study the group
   reduction factors in 3 x 3 to 6 x 6 square pile groups subjected to
   static loading. The study includes the effects of various parameters,
   including pile spacing, pile head condition, and the friction angle of
   soil, on the group reduction factors. Calculated group reduction factors
   from this study compare well with available group test data, that is,
   typically small pile groups. However, the study shows that design
   guidelines such as the American Association of State Highway and
   Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and Federal Emergency Management
   Agency (FEMA) P-751 overestimate the group reduction factors, hence the
   lateral resistance, in larger pile groups and larger spacings,
   especially for fixed pile head conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION}},

Abstract = {{Water distribution systems (WDSs) face numerous challenges in providing
   service to their customers. An especially difficult challenge occurs
   when several pipes in the system fail simultaneously. Simultaneous
   failure is more likely to occur in older networks or systems located in
   harsh climatic conditions. Previous studies have focused on WDS
   reliability when pipes fail individually. The current research proposes
   a technique to determine the reliability of a WDS experiencing different
   degrees of simultaneous pipe failure and to assess errors in reliability
   that occur when an inappropriate level of simultaneous failure is
   assumed. The model was applied to two case studies including a
   hypothetical small system and an actual WDS. Comparing the various
   states of reliability provided valuable information about system
   sensitivity to simultaneous multipipe failures. Results demonstrated
   that a system may be able to achieve a higher level of reliability if
   more realistic expectations of simultaneous failure are assumed.}},

Title = {{Geometry-based CT scanner for measuring logs in sawmills}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{66-73}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Significant economic advantage can be achieved by assessing logs at the
   inlet of a sawmill so that they can be optimally processed to produce
   the highest possible value products from the available raw material.
   Computed Tomography (CT) scanning is of particular interest because it
   can identify the locations and sizes of internal quality-controlling
   features such as knots, heartwood/sapwood extent, rot, cracks and holes.
   Conventional CT scanning is based on medical-style equipment, which
   needs to have very high spatial and density resolution. This need sets
   very high requirements on the measurement resolution and accuracy, and
   substantially increases equipment complexity and cost. These features
   make such equipment unsuited for typical sawmill applications. However,
   for log scanning applications, high spatial and density resolution and
   measurement accuracy are not needed because most targeted internal
   features are fairly large and have specific geometrical shapes. Based on
   this thought, this paper proposes a novel geometry-based CT
   reconstruction approach and corresponding density reconstruction
   algorithms. A prototype CT scanner was built and the CT reconstructions
   were determined by processing the measured data using the proposed
   density reconstruction approach. The results obtained compare well with
   the results computed from conventional CT reconstruction. The good
   comparison gives confidence in the usefulness and applicability of the
   proposed CT approach for industrial use in sawmills for log scanning.

   weeks and then slightly gained weight The analysis of the released ions
   was performed by induced coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer
   (ICP-OES). The results revealed that the precipitation of the dissolved
   Fe and Co could cause the weight gain of the 316L and Co-28Cr-6Mo
   alloys. The surface chemistry of the specimens was determined by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS analysis of Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy
   showed that the interaction of Mo with HSA is different from Mo with
   bovine serum albumin (BSA). This was also observed for Na adsorption
   into the oxide layer of Ti-6Al-4V alloy in the presence of HSA and BSA.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the fabrication and characterization of a vibration-based
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane type electromagnetic energy
   harvester (EMEH) is reported. The harvester is suitable for generating
   electric energy from low level sinusoidal and narrow band random
   vibrations. Under acceleration levels greater than 0.1 g the behaviour
   of the EMEH is nonlinear, exhibiting sharp jump and hysteresis phenomena
   during frequency sweeps. Under sinusoidal excitations (0.1-3 g), the
   device produces a maximum of 88.8 mV load voltage and 39.4 mu W power.
   At a matching load impedance of 10.1 Omega and when excited at its
   resonant frequency of 108.4 Hz and 3 g base acceleration, it generates a
   power of 68.0 mu W, which corresponds to a power density of 30.22 mu
   W/cm(3). The nonlinear behaviour of the EMEH is exploited to harvest
   energy under narrow band random excitations. At higher acceleration
   levels of narrow band (50-150 Hz) random excitations, the device
   exhibits a broadening of the load voltage spectrum in comparison to the
   response under relatively low acceleration levels of narrow band (5-150
   Hz) random excitations. The results show that the nonlinear behaviour of
   the PDMS membrane can be utilized to enhance the bandwidth of the
   harvester under narrow band random excitations and provides a simple
   alternative to other bandwidth broadening methods such as beam
   prestress, resonance tuning, or stopper impacts.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of shear on the flow-induced crystallization
   (FIC) of several polypropylenes of various macrostructures was studied
   using rheometry combined with polarized microscopy. Generally, an
   increase in strain and strain rate or decrease of temperature is found
   to decrease the thermodynamic barrier for crystal formation and thus
   enhancing crystallization kinetics at temperatures between the melting
   and crystallization points. Secondly, popular models based on suspension
   theory which are used to relate the degree of crystallinity to
   normalized rheological functions (such as viscosity) are validated
   experimentally. For this purpose, the space filling of crystals in the
   polarized micrographs determined from image processing was plotted as a
   function of normalized viscosity under various shear rates. It is found
   that the constant(s) of various suspension models should be dependent on
   the flow parameters in order for the suspension models to describe the
   effect of shear on FIC, particularly at higher shear rates.}},

Abstract = {{High-yield pulping of wood chips using low-consistency (LC) refining in
   combination with primary-stage high-consistency (HC) refining has
   previously been shown to produce paper with quality parameters (tensile
   strength and light-scattering coefficient) commonly targeted for
   newsprint with significantly less refining energy input than using only
   HC refining. However, questions remain on the differences in the
   refining action between the two refiner types and for high-yield
   pulping, the refiner energy demand is a crucial process parameter.
   Therefore, fines- and fiber-fraction development in HC and LC refining
   has been studied in detail using Bauer-McNett fractionation, and the
   respective tensile strengths of the different fractions have been
   compared. Quantitative and qualitative (morphological) characteristics
   of the isolated fine fractions have also been analyzed in detail using a
   newly developed automated fluorescence microscopy method and scanning
   electron microscopy. The results suggest the difference in LC/HC pulp
   properties (strength and optical) is partly derived from deviating fiber
   and fines morphologies and mass balances. The quality of the fines
   generated during HC and LC refining also differs. LC-refined pulps
   contain thinner fibrillar fines (thread-like) and HC-refined pulps
   broader fibrils such as lamellae-type fines. Flake-like fines from the
   outer fiber wall decreased in relative amount with energy input.}},

Abstract = {{In situ neutron diffraction and elastic-viscoplastic self-consistent
   (EVPSC) modeling have been employed to understand the deformation
   mechanisms of the loading-unloading process under uniaxial tension in a
   solid-solution-strengthened extruded Mg-9 wt.\% Al alloy. The initial
   texture measured by neutron diffraction shows that the \{00.2\} basal
   planes in most grains are tilted around 20-30 from the extrusion axis,
   indicating that basal slip should be easily activated in a majority of
   grains under tension. Non-linear stress strain responses are observed
   during unloading and reloading after the material is fully plastically
   deformed under tension. In situ neutron diffraction measurements have
   also demonstrated the non-linear behavior of lattice strains during
   unloading and reloading, revealing that load redistribution continuously
   occurs between soft and hard grain orientations. The predicted
   macroscopic stress-strain curve and the lattice strain evolution by the
   EVPSC model are in good agreement with the experimental data. The EVPSC
   model provides the relative activities of the available slip and
   twinning modes, as well as the elastic and plastic strains of the
   various grain families. It is suggested that the non-linear phenomena in
   the macroscopic stress-strain responses and microscopic lattice strains
   during unloading and reloading are due to plastic deformation by the
   operation of basal (a) slip in the soft grain orientations (e.g.
   \{10.1\}, \{11.2\} and \{10.2\} grain families). (C) 2014 Acta

Abstract = {{Agricultural residues represent an abundant, readily available, and
   inexpensive source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. However,
   biomass has complex structural formation that binds cellulose and
   hemicellulose. This necessitates the initial breakdown of the
   lignocellulosic matrix. Steam explosion pretreatment was performed on
   barley straw grind to assist in the deconstruction and disaggregation of
   the matrix, so as to have access to the cellulose and hemicellulose. The
   following process and material variables were used: temperature (140-180
   degrees C), corresponding saturated pressure (500-1100 kPa), retention
   time (5-10 min), and mass fraction of water 8-50\%. The effect of the
   pretreatment was assessed through chemical composition analysis. The
   severity factor R-o, which combines the temperature and time of the
   hydrolytic process into a single reaction ordinate was determined. To
   further provide detailed chemical composition of the steam exploded and
   non-treated biomass, ultimate analysis was performed to quantify the
   elemental components. Data show that steam explosion resulted in the
   breakdown of biomass matrix with increase in acid soluble lignin.
   However, there was a considerable thermal degradation of cellulose and
   hemicellulose with increase in acid insoluble lignin content. The high
   degradation of the hemicellulose can be accounted for by its amorphous
   nature which is easily disrupted by external influences unlike the
   well-arranged crystalline cellulose. The carbon content of the solid
   steam exploded product increased at higher temperature and longer
   residence time, while the hydrogen and oxygen content decreased, and the
   higher heating value (HHV) increased. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{33-46}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A combined finite-discrete element approach is used to simulate the
   complete 3D fracture process during conventional laboratory testing,
   including Brazilian indirect tension and uniaxial and biaxial
   compression. A typical granite rock type (based on the Lac du Bonnet
   granite) was simulated to investigate the fracture pattern and
   mechanical strength of brittle rock in the laboratory. Damage intensity
   parameters (D-21 and D-32) are introduced and utilized to characterize
   the induced damage in the models. These parameters provide an improved
   representation of the cumulative associated damage and facilitate a
   quantitative characterization of crack intensity during testing. The
   numerical simulations included both 3D and 2D models, and show that
   there is a good agreement between the strength response derived from
   simulations both in 3D and 2D and the considered rock material. A good
   correlation also exists between the fracture pattern in 3D and the
   equivalent 2D models. The influence of confinement on the biaxial
   strength and the associated damage in compression is investigated. While
   axial splitting is the dominant failure mode at low confinement,
   finite-discrete element simulations show that a shear failure mode tends
   to dominate as the confinement increases. The dependency of dilation
   upon the confining pressure is also demonstrated, the dilation angle
   decreasing with increased confinement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rapidly increasing the penetration level of renewable energies has
   imposed new challenges to the operation of power systems. Inability or
   inadequacy of these resources in providing inertial and primary
   frequency responses is one of the important challenges. In this paper,
   this issue is addressed within the framework of security-constrained
   unit commitment (SCUC) by adding new constraints representing the system
   frequency response. A modified system frequency response model is first
   derived and used to find analytical representation of system minimum
   frequency in thermal-dominant multi-machine systems. Then, an effective
   piecewise linearization (PWL) technique is employed to linearize the
   nonlinear function representing the minimum system frequency,
   facilitating its integration in the SCUC problem. The problem is
   formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem which is
   solved efficiently by available commercial solvers. The results indicate
   that the proposed method can be utilized to integrate renewable
   resources into power systems without violating system frequency limits.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are devices that store
   enormous amounts of charge electrostatically when a potential is applied
   between electrodes of very high surface area (typically made of porous
   carbon) and an electrolyte. Wider commercialization of this technology
   has been held back by the lack of ultralow-cost electrode materials. We
   demonstrate that used coffee grounds can be processed to form low-cost
   electrodes. The surface and electrochemical characteristics of
   microporous activated carbons from used coffee grounds (CGCs) were
   measured. First, optimal times and temperatures for carbonization and
   activation were identified on the basis of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution. Second, CGCs were
   used as polarized electrodes in EDLCs, whose capacitances were evaluated
   using cyclic voltammetry. The results show that carbonization for 1 h at
   600 degrees C with a heating rate of 300 degrees C/h, followed by CO2
   activation for 2 h at 1000 degrees C, affords the highest BET surface
   area (1867 m(2)/g) compared to other works. The produced CGCs have many
   micropores of less than 2 nm across, which contribute to the formation
   of an electric double layer. Capacitors made using these CGCs show the
   highest capacitance (103 F/g) in 0.8 M (C2H5)(4)NBF4/PC as an organic
   electrolyte, which is much higher than the similar to 80 F/g typically
   used in organic-electrolyte-based commercial EDLCs, suggesting that
   coffee grounds are a useful electrode material. (C) 2014 Institute of

Abstract = {{The performance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinylcaprolactam

   the induction time and decrease the hydrate growth. On the other hand,
   hydrates agglomerated more readily. PVP performed more efficiently than
   PVCap in delaying nucleation time but PVCap controlled the growth and
   delayed agglomeration more effectively. Addition of n-heptane to the
   system increased induction time and reduced growth. Unexpectedly,
   addition of KHIs in the presence of n-heptane decreased nucleation time
   but controlled growth effectively. Meanwhile, hydrate particles remained
   dispersed more efficiently and no agglomeration was detected. These
   observations confirm that high-pressure rheology is an additional

Abstract = {{The impact of water droplets on solid surfaces is studied experimentally
   and theoretically. Theoretical equations based on energy conservation
   are developed. In our theoretical study, the droplet is modeled as a
   ring-like shape, which matches the dynamic shape of droplets observed
   from our experimental tests. In the analysis of energy conservation, the
   nonuniform distribution of pressure inside the deformed droplet is taken
   into account by introducing a flow potential energy term in the
   theoretical equations. To derive viscous dissipation for recoiling, a
   viscous layer coefficient is introduced. Its values for the tests using
   smooth surfaces are found to be within a small range. Both theoretical
   predictions and experimental data show significant influence of surface
   wettability on maximum spread and recoiling process. With the increase
   of advancing contact angle, surface energy shows a decreasing trend,
   whereas flow potential energy shows an increasing trend and becomes
   significant for hydrophobic surfaces. (c) 2014 American Institute of

Journal = {{HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{945-955}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) is required for the
   accurate simulation of heat transfer in castings especially for near
   net-shape processes. The large number of factors influencing heat
   transfer renders quantification by theoretical means a challenge.
   Likewise experimental methods applied directly to temperature data
   collected from castings are also a challenge to interpret because of the
   transient nature of many casting processes. Inverse methods offer a
   solution and have been applied successfully to predict the IHTC in many
   cases. However, most inverse approaches thus far focus on use of in-mold
   temperature data, which may be a challenge to obtain in cases where the
   molds are water-cooled. Methods based on temperature data from the
   casting have the potential to be used however; the latent heat released
   during the solidification of the molten metal complicates the associated
   IHTC calculations. Furthermore, there are limits on the maximum distance
   the thermocouples can be placed from the interface under analysis. An
   inverse conduction based method have been developed, verified and
   applied successfully to temperature data collected from within an
   aluminum casting in proximity to the mold. A modified specific heat
   method was used to account for latent heat evolution in which the rate
   of change of fraction solid with temperature was held constant. An
   analysis conducted with the inverse model suggests that the
   thermocouples must be placed no more than 2 mm from the interface. The
   IHTC values calculated for an aluminum alloy casting were shown to vary
   from 1,200 to 6,200 Wm(-2) K-1. Additionally, the characteristics of the
   time-varying IHTC have also been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Joint blind source separation (JBSS) is a means to extract common
   sources simultaneously found across multiple datasets, e. g.,
   electroencephalogram (EEG) and kinematic data jointly recorded during
   reaching movements. Existing JBSS approaches are designed to handle
   multidimensional datasets, yet to our knowledge, there is no existing
   means to examine common components that may be found across a
   unidimensional dataset and a multidimensional one. In this paper, we
   propose a simple, yet effective method to achieve the goal of JBSS when
   concurrent multidimensional EEG and unidimensional kinematic datasets
   are available, by combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)
   with independent vector analysis (IVA). We demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed method through numerical simulations and application to
   data collected from reaching movements in Parkinson's disease. The
   proposed method is a promising JBSS tool for real-world biomedical
   signal processing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable bone cements have been well characterized and studied in
   non-load bearing bone fixation and bone screw augmentation applications.
   Current calcium phosphate cement or poly(methyl methacrylate) cement
   have drawbacks like low mechanical strength and in situ exothermic
   properties. This leads especially in patients with osteoporosis to
   worsening contact between implant and bone and can finally lead to
   implant failure. To improve these properties, a calcium silicate cement
   (CSC) was prepared, which additionally contained the bisphosphonate
   risedronate (RA) to promote osteoblast function. Cement setting rate and
   compressive strength were measured and found to be reduced by RA above
   0.5 wt\%. X-ray diffraction, Rietveld refinement analysis, scanning
   electron microscopy, and porosity measurements by gas sorption revealed
   that RA reduces calcium silicate hydrate gel formation and changes the
   cement's microstructure. Cumulative release profiles of RA from CSC up
   to 6 months into phosphate buffer solution were analyzed by
   high-performance liquid chromatography, and the results were compared
   with theoretical release curves obtained from the Higuchi equation.
   Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements and drug release studies
   indicate that calcium-RA formed within the cement, from which the drug
   can be slowly released over time. An investigation of the cytotoxicity
   of the RA-CSC systems upon osteoblast-like cells showed no toxic effects
   of concentrations up to 2\%. The delivery of RA from within a CSC might
   thus be a valuable and biocompatible new approach to locally deliver RA
   and to reconstruct and/or repair osteoporosis-related bone fractures.

   Determination of local impact of surfactants by visualization techniques}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Powerful techniques, based on the Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence
   (PLIF) technique, are deployed to locally visualize and quantify the
   impact of surfactants in wastewaters on hydrodynamics and oxygen mass
   transfer. Bubble diameter, aspect ratio, rise velocity, contamination
   angle, as well as flux, flux density, liquid side mass transfer and
   diffusion coefficients of transferred oxygen are determined based on
   these techniques applied in the wake of rising bubbles of diameter 1 mm
   and through planar gas/liquid interfaces. The initial experiments were
   performed in demineralized water containing small amounts of surfactant.
   Different concentrations of surfactant were added to finally reach the
   Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC). Bubbles have classically been
   found to be more spherical with a reduced rise velocity in the presence
   of surfactants up to the CMC. Above the CMC, these hydrodynamic
   characteristics were found to be almost constant, although the oxygen
   mass transfer decreased due to the presence of surfactants. Experimental
   results were markedly lower than predicted by the well-known Frossling
   equation with rigid surfaces. This is believed to be caused by a barrier
   of surfactants hindering the oxygen mass transfer at the interface.
   Similar hindrance of oxygen mass transfer applies to waters from sewage
   plants (filtered raw water and treated water), making accurate design of
   aeration tanks difficult. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Drug screening using engineered blood vessels (EBVs) faces considerable
   barriers in approximating the conditions of an in vivo environment. To
   address this issue, we have introduced a microfluidic system for

   oxidized dextran was used for in situ gelable tubular scaffolds. The
   microfluidic system consisted of four glass capillaries that generated a
   coaxial flow of pre-polymer and phosphate buffered solutions. It rapidly
   produced cell-laden tubular microgels inside glass capillaries. The
   mechanical strength of the tubular microgels was suitable for their
   application as EBVs, with a maximum Young's modulus of 12.2 +/- A 1.9
   kPa. In vitro cell studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   verified the biocompatibility and non-cytotoxicity of the gelation and
   fabrication process. Thus, in situ gelable cell-laden tubular microgels
   can be a potential platform for screening drugs to treat blood vessel

   to individual treatments. Therefore, we employed a rat model of cervical
   SCI to evaluate the combination of four noninvasive treatments that
   individually have been reported to be effective for acute SCI during
   clinically relevant therapeutic time windows. These treatments included
   ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and ketogenic diet (KD). These were selected
   not only because of their previously reported efficacy in SCI models but
   also for their potentially different mechanisms of action. The
   administration of ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD several hours to days
   postinjury was based on previous observations by others that each
   treatment had profound effects on the pathophysiology and functional
   outcome following SCI. Here we showed that, with the exception of a
   modest improvement in performance on the Montoya staircase test at 8-10
   weeks postinjury, the combinatorial treatment with ghrelin, ibuprofen,
   C16, and KD did not result in any significant improvements in the
   rearing test, grooming test, or horizontal ladder. Histologic analysis
   of the spinal cords did not reveal any significant differences in tissue
   sparing between treatment and control groups. Although single approaches
   of ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD have been reported to be beneficial
   after SCI, our results show that the combination of the four
   interventions did not confer significant functional or histological
   improvements in a cervical model of SCI. Possible interactions among the
   treatments may have negated their beneficial effects, emphasizing the
   challenges that have to be addressed when considering combinatorial drug
   therapies for SCI. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Impregnated electrospun nanofibrous membranes for water vapour transport
   applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{461}},
Pages = {{146-160}},

Abstract = {{Membranes with high water vapour permeance and selectivity find many end
   uses including protective clothing, dehydration, and humidification. One
   application for water vapour transport membranes is in energy recovery
   ventilators (ERVs) for buildings. These devices improve building energy
   efficiency by transporting heat and moisture between incoming and
   outgoing air streams in building ventilation systems, effectively
   `recycling' the energy used to condition the indoor air. Membranes for
   these devices must have high vapour permeance, and selectivity for water
   vapour over other gases and contaminants that may be present in the
   exhaust indoor air. Due to the high rates of water vapour transport
   required in these gas to gas devices, boundary layer and internal
   resistances within the membrane contribute significantly to performance.
   Commercially available membranes suffer from high water vapour transport
   resistance in the microporous substrate support layer. In this study we
   report the fabrication of novel impregnated electrospun nanofibrous
   membranes (IENM) for water vapour transport applications. Electrospun
   nanofibre layers are impregnated with a polyether-polyurethane solution
   and cured to create continuous thin impregnated fibre loaded film layers
   which are bound to a non-woven support layer. These membranes have high
   water vapour permeance and selectivity while eliminating the requirement
   for a microporous support layer which has high vapour transport
   resistance. Here we report initial studies on how controllable factors
   in the membrane fabrication (namely fibre loading and impregnated
   solution polymer solids concentration) affect structural and permeation
   properties of IENMs created. Membranes with adequate permeance and
   selectivity are demonstrated and direction for optimization is
   identified. We find that the nanofibre loading has a significant impact
   on water vapour permeability as the membrane thickness decreases. Future
   work will study how modifications to the geometric and structural
   properties of the fibres affect the membrane performance. (C) 2014

Title = {{Kinetics of CO2 absorption by CaO through pressure swing cycling}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{78-87}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{CO2 capture by means of CaO cycling represents a cost effective,
   immediate solution to rising CO2 emissions. The mechanism of loss of
   utilization efficiency and associated change in carbonation kinetics of
   CaO particles was examined by conducting calcination/ carbonation
   cycling of 150-250 mu m Strasburg limestone precursor, by swinging the
   pressure from atmospheric (for calcination) to 5, 10 and 20 bar(g) (for
   carbonation) at constant temperatures of 975-1025 degrees C and a flow
   of pure CO2. Increased carbonation pressure led to an increase in
   utilization over 100 cycles from 0.128 +/- 0.005 to 0.271 +/- 0.035 for
   5 and 20 bar(g) respectively. Samples were examined by scanning electron
   microscopy and BET. The carbonation kinetics were determined by plotting
   the rates of reaction for both the kinetically controlled and diffusion
   controlled carbonation stages. Sintering, grain boundary formation and
   elimination, and changes in particle surface area are found to all play
   important roles in causing the initial rapid loss in surface
   reaction-controlled rate, followed by partial recovery over multiple
   cycles. The loss of grain boundaries due to sintering caused an increase
   in the reaction-controlled rate and residual calcium utilization due to
   a shift in the dynamics of carbonation/calcination nucleation and
   molecular volume contraction. The rate of the reaction-controlled regime
   was found to be a function of carbonation pressure. The
   diffusion-controlled rate is independent of pressure and temperature.

Title = {{Phase field crystal modeling as a unified atomistic approach to defect
   dynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Material properties controlled by evolving defect structures, such as
   mechanical response, often involve processes spanning many length and
   time scales which can not be modeled using a single approach. We present
   a variety of results that demonstrate the ability of phase field crystal
   (PFC) models to describe complex defect evolution phenomena on atomistic
   length scales and over long, diffusive time scales. Primary emphasis is
   given to the unification of conservative and nonconservative dislocation
   creation mechanisms in three-dimensional fcc and bcc materials. These
   include Frank-Read-type glide mechanisms involving closed dislocation
   loops or grain boundaries as well as Bardeen-Herring-type climb
   mechanisms involving precipitates, inclusions, and/or voids. Both source
   classes are naturally and simultaneously captured at the atomistic level
   by PFC descriptions, with arbitrarily complex defect configurations,
   types, and environments. An unexpected dipole-to-quadrupole source
   transformation is identified, as well as various complex geometrical
   features of loop nucleation via climb from spherical particles. Results
   for the strain required to nucleate a dislocation loop from such a
   particle are in agreement with analytic continuum theories. Other basic
   features of fcc and bcc dislocation structure and dynamics are also
   outlined, and initial results for dislocation-stacking fault tetrahedron
   interactions are presented. These findings together highlight various
   capabilities of the PFC approach as a coarse-grained atomistic tool for
   the study of three-dimensional crystal plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{A durable hydrophilic and protein-resistant surface of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based devices is desirable in many
   biomedical applications such as implantable and microfluidic devices.
   This paper describes a stable antifouling hydrogel coating on PDMS
   surfaces. The coating method combines chemical modification and surface
   microstructure fabrication of PDMS substrates.
   Three-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylates containing C=C groups were
   used to modify PDMS surfaces with micropillar array structures
   fabricated by a replica molding method. The micropillar structures
   increase the surface area of PDMS surfaces, which facilitates secure
   bonding with a hydrogel coating compared to flat PMDS surfaces. The
   adhesion properties of the hydrogel coating on PDMS substrates were
   characterized using bending, stretching and water immersion tests.
   Long-term hydrophilic stability (maintaining a contact angle of 55
   degrees for a month) and a low protein adsorption property (35 ng/cm(2)
   of adsorbed BSA-FITC) of the hydrogel coated PDMS were demonstrated.
   This coating method is suitable for PDMS modification with most
   crosslinkable polymers containing C=C groups, which can be useful for
   improving the anti-biofouling performance of PDMS-based biomedical
   microdevices.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents simulation and experimental results of ultra-thin
   optical ring resonators, having larger Evanescent Field (EF) penetration
   depths, and therefore larger sensitivities, as compared to conventional
   Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI)-based resonator sensors. Having higher
   sensitivities to the changes in the refractive indices of the cladding
   media is desirable for sensing applications, as the interactions of
   interest take place in this region. Using ultra-thin waveguides (< 100
   nm thick) shows promise to enhance sensitivity for both bulk and surface
   sensing, due to increased penetration of the EF into the cladding. In
   this work, the designs and characterization of ultra-thin resonator
   sensors, within the constraints of a multi-project wafer service that
   offers three waveguide thicknesses (90 nm, 150 nm, and 220 nm), are
   presented. These services typically allow efficient integration of
   biosensors with on-chip detectors, moving towards the implementation of
   lab-on-chip (LoC) systems. Also, higher temperature stability of
   ultra-thin resonator sensors were characterized and, in the presence of
   intentional environmental (temperature) fluctuations, were compared to
   standard transverse electric SOI-based resonator sensors. (C)2014

Abstract = {{Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes are often used in electrochemical studies
   such as those focusing on electrochemical sensor development. The
   application of a GC electrode as a sensor for particle-wall interaction
   studies requires knowledge of the potential of zero charge (PZC), which

   presents the temperature dependency of the PZC for a GC electrode at
   temperatures up to 473 K in 10 mu M, 1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM NaClO4 and NaF
   solutions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to measure
   the potential at which the differential capacitance reaches its minimum.
   It was found that the PZC of GC changes linearly with temperature with
   an average temperature coefficient of 0.71 mV K-1 and varies from 285
   +/- 5 to 415 +/- 5 mV (vs. SHE298) when the temperature increased from

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{484}},
Pages = {{27-35}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of As, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn in campus
   dust from kindergartens, elementary schools, middle schools and
   universities of Xi'an, China were determined by X-ray fluorescence
   spectrometry. Correlation coefficient analysis, principal component
   analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used to analyze the data
   and to identify possible sources of these metals in the dust. The
   spatial distributions of metals in urban dust of Xi'an were analyzed
   based on the metal concentrations in campus dusts using the
   geostatistics method. The results indicate that dust samples from
   campuses have elevated metal concentrations, especially for Pb, Zn, Co,
   Cu, Cr and Ba, with the mean values of 7.1, 5.6, 3.7, 2.9, 2.5 and 1.9
   times the background values for Shaanxi soil, respectively. The
   enrichment factor results indicate that Mn, Ni, V, As and Ba in the
   campus dust were deficiently to minimally enriched, mainly affected by
   nature and partly by anthropogenic sources, while Co, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn
   in the campus dust and especially Pb and Zn were mostly affected by
   human activities. As and Cu, Mn and Ni, Ba and V, and Pb and Zn had
   similar distribution patterns. The southwest high-tech industrial area
   and south commercial and residential areas have relatively high levels
   of most metals. Three main sources were identified based on correlation
   coefficient analysis, PCA, CA, as well as spatial distribution
   characteristics. As, Ni, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and Cr have mixed sources -
   nature, traffic, as well as fossil fuel combustion and weathering of
   materials. Ba and V are mainly derived from nature, but partly also from
   industrial emissions, as well as construction sources, while Co
   principally originates from construction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Improving the Accuracy and Efficiency of Respiratory Rate Measurements
   in Children Using Mobile Devices}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{The recommended method for measuring respiratory rate (RR) is counting
   breaths for 60 s using a timer. This method is not efficient in a busy
   clinical setting. There is an urgent need for a robust, low-cost method
   that can help front-line health care workers to measure RR quickly and
   accurately. Our aim was to develop a more efficient RR assessment
   method. RR was estimated by measuring the median time interval between
   breaths obtained from tapping on the touch screen of a mobile device.
   The estimation was continuously validated by measuring consistency (\%
   deviation from the median) of each interval. Data from 30 subjects
   estimating RR from 10 standard videos with a mobile phone application
   were collected. A sensitivity analysis and an optimization experiment
   were performed to verify that a RR could be obtained in less than 60 s;
   that the accuracy improves when more taps are included into the
   calculation; and that accuracy improves when inconsistent taps are
   excluded. The sensitivity analysis showed that excluding inconsistent
   tapping and increasing the number of tap intervals improved the RR
   estimation. Efficiency (time to complete measurement) was significantly
   improved compared to traditional methods that require counting for 60 s.
   There was a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The most balanced
   optimization result provided a mean efficiency of 9.9 s and a normalized
   root mean square error of 5.6\%, corresponding to 2.2 breaths/min at a
   respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min. The obtained 6-fold increase in mean
   efficiency combined with a clinically acceptable error makes this
   approach a viable solution for further clinical testing. The sensitivity
   analysis illustrating the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency will
   be a useful tool to define a target product profile for any novel RR
   estimation device.}},

Title = {{Stability of commercial glucanase and beta-glucosidase preparations
   under hydrolysis conditions}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{The cost of enzymes makes enzymatic hydrolysis one of the most expensive
   steps in the production of lignocellulosic ethanol. Diverse studies have
   used commercial enzyme cocktails assuming that change in total protein
   concentration during hydrolysis was solely due to adsorption of endo-
   and exoglucanases onto the substrate. Given the sensitivity of enzymes
   and proteins to media conditions this assumption was tested by
   evaluating and modeling the protein concentration of commercial
   cocktails at hydrolysis conditions. In the absence of solid substrate,
   the total protein concentration of a mixture of Celluclast 1.5 L and
   Novozyme 188 decreased by as much as 45\% at 50 degrees C after 4 days.
   The individual cocktails as well as a mixture of both were stable at 20
   degrees C. At 50 degrees C, the protein concentration of Celluclast 1.5
   was relatively constant but Novozyme 188 decreased by as much as 77\%.
   It was hypothesized that Novozyme 188 proteins suffer a structural
   change at 50 degrees C which leads to protein aggregation and
   precipitation. Lyophilized beta-glucosidase (P-beta-glucosidase) at 50
   degrees C exhibited an aggregation rate which was successfully modeled
   using first order kinetics (R-2 = 0.97). By incorporating the possible
   presence of chaperone proteins in Novozyme 188, the protein aggregation
   observed for this cocktail was successfully modeled (R-2 = 0.96). To
   accurately model the increasing protein stability observed at high
   cocktail loadings, the model was modified to include the presence of
   additives in the cocktail (R-2 = 0.98). By combining the measurement of
   total protein concentration with the proposed Novozyme 188 protein
   aggregation model, the endo- and exoglucanases concentration in the
   solid and liquid phases during hydrolysis can be more accurately
   determined. This methodology can be applied to various systems leading
   to optimization of enzyme loading by minimizing the excess of endo- and
   exoglucanases. In addition, the monitoring of endo- and exoglucanases
   concentrations can be used to build mass balances of enzyme recycling
   processes and to techno-economically evaluate the viability of enzyme
   recycling.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the influence of grain orientation on electrochemical
   behavior and semiconductor properties, such as donor density, flat-band
   potential, and diffusivity of point defects (D-0), of the passive films
   were studied on Nb single crystals with orientations of (100), (110),
   and (111) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 1 M NaOH solution by
   cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   Mott-Schottky analysis, and point defect model. The results shown that
   the (100) crystal face of Nb exhibits the lowest corrosion rate in both
   PBS and 1 M NaOH solutions. The Mott-Schottky analysis revealed that the
   passive film formed on the (100) face has the lowest donor density and
   the flat-band potential was almost independent of the grain
   orientations, but decreased with an increase of pH. A different
   relationship between steady-state current density (j(ss)) and film
   formation potential was observed in these two solutions and the possible
   causes were discussed. The diffusivity was calculated based on the point
   defect model. D-0, of the passive films in PBS solution is in the range
   of 10-21 to 10-19 cm(2)/s, depends on the grain orientation and film
   formation potential. In 1 M NaOH solution, D-0 is close to 10-18 cm(2)/s
   independent of the film formation potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A model was developed for the hydrocarbon selective catalytic reduction
   (HC-SCR) of NOx in a fluidized bed reactor. For the kinetics, the
   reaction was divided into two submodels: (i) NO oxidation and
   adsorption; (ii) hydrocarbon oxidation and NOx reduction. The kinetic
   parameters were obtained from fitting a fixed bed model to fixed bed
   experimental data. Mass transfer between solids and gas phases was also
   considered in this fixed bed model with the reaction term being embedded
   into the solids phase mass balance equation. Comparing with fixed bed
   experimental data, the model showed an average error of about 7\% for
   NOx conversion and about 5\% for HC conversion. The fitted kinetics was
   then incorporated into a fluidized bed reactor model, which included gas
   flow in the bubble phase, gas flow in the dense phase and solids flow in
   the dense phase. The fluidized bed reactor model was compared to the
   fluidized bed experimental data. The model showed acceptable agreement
   with measured NOx conversion, but poor agreement with observed HC
   conversion data. Suggekions were proposed to further improve the model
   and experimental data. The fluidized bed model was then applied to
   simulate NOx reduction in the reduction zone of the internal circulating
   fluidized bed (i-CFB) reactor. The simulation results showed that NOx
   conversion could be improved if NOx is fed into the reactor via the
   solids phase, the same as what happens in the reduction zone of an i-CFB
   reactor. Also, for the reduction zone of the i-CFB reactor, a higher
   solids circulation rate is preferred if NOx feed rate is. kept at a
   constant. These simulations could provide good suggestions for the i-CFB
   design and operation.}},

Abstract = {{A common indicator of rheological dysfunction is a measurable decrease
   in the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs). Decreased RBC
   deformability is associated with cellular stress or pathology and can
   impede the transit of these cells through the microvasculature, where
   RBCs play a central role in the oxygenation of tissues. Therefore, RBC
   deformability has been recognized as a sensitive biomarker for
   rheological disease. In the current study, we present a strategy to
   measure RBC cortical tension as an indicator of RBC deformability based
   on the critical pressure required for RBC transit through microscale
   funnel constrictions. By modeling RBCs as a Newtonian liquid drop, we
   were able to discriminate cells fixed with glutaraldehyde concentrations
   that vary as little as 0.001\%. When RBCs were sampled from healthy
   donors on different days, the RBC cortical tension was found to be
   highly reproducible. Inter-individual variability was similarly
   reproducible, showing only slightly greater variability, which might
   reflect biological differences between normal individuals. Both the
   sensitivity and reproducibility of cortical tension, as an indicator of
   RBC deformability, make it well-suited for biological and clinical
   analysis of RBC microrheology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ever increasing traffic demand is becomming a serious concern for
   mobile network operators. In order to solve the traffic explosion
   problem, there have been research efforts on offloading the traffic from
   cellular links to local communications among users. In this article, we
   leverage opportunistic device-to-device sharing, exploit the social
   impact among users in social network services (SNSs), and propose the
   novel framework of traffic offloading assisted by SNSs via opportunistic
   sharing in mobile social networks, called TOSS. In TOSS, initially a
   subset of mobile users are selected as seeds depending on their content
   spreading impact on online SNSs and their mobility patterns in offline
   MSNs. Then users share content objects via opportunistic local
   connectivity (e. g., WiFi Direct) with each other. Furthermore, the
   observation of SNS user activities reveals that individual users have
   distinct access patterns, which allows TOSS to utilize the
   user-dependent access delays between the content generation time and
   each user's access time for opportunistic sharing purposes. By
   trace-driven evaluation, we demonstrate that TOSS can reduce by
   63.8-86.5 percent of cellular traffic while satisfying the access delay
   requirements of all users. Therefore, traffic offloading by leveraging
   opportunistic device-to-device sharing based on SNSs can be quite
   effective and efficient as a promising content delivery service for
   traffic reduction in future mobile networks.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Storage of CO2 in depleted natural gas reservoirs is considered an
   attractive option to mitigate climate change concerns of CO2 from
   sources such as thermal power plants. In this regard, a number of
   depleted gas reservoirs located in Northern Alberta, Canada have been
   identified as potential sites for CO2 storage at temperature and
   pressure conditions at which CO2 forms gas hydrate crystals in the
   presence of water. This offers the possibility of storing more CO2 than
   what can be normally stored as a gas at the same conditions. The
   injection of CO2 in a bed of silica sand partially saturated with water
   (wet sand) at pressure and temperature conditions similar to those in a
   typical depleted gas reservoir in Northern Alberta was investigated in
   this work. The CO2 gas was injected into the simulated reservoir under
   the gas cap mode and the spiral tube mode procedure. Through the
   pressure drop measurements the CO2 gas consumption was determined and
   also the amount of water converted to hydrate was calculated. The
   results indicate that 39-47\% of water formed hydrate in the gas cap
   mode gas injection experiments and 51-55\% in the spiral tube mode
   injection experiments. Hydrate saturation reached 0.11-0.15 after 24 h
   for each gas injection mode. Finally, the capacity of the laboratory
   reservoir to store CO2 in various forms was determined. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{For practical purposes, kinetic hydrate inhibitors must perform
   predictably in the presence of oil as well as saline and high driving
   forces, but such deterministic behavior is rarely achieved. Here, we
   evaluated two biological inhibitors, type I and type III antifreeze
   proteins (AFPs I and III), under these exacting conditions using a
   double high-pressure crystallizer apparatus and additionally assayed
   using high-pressure micro-differential scanning calorimetry. The two AFP
   types behaved somewhat differently under these environmental conditions.
   The addition of AFP I reduced natural gas hydrate induction time,
   whereas AFP III had no impact on hydrate crystal nucleation.
   Nonetheless, for both AFPs, gas hydrate growth was significantly
   inhibited to similar to 50\% of that found in control experiments. Once
   hydrate had formed, decomposition was slower and started later. Thus,
   gas hydrates formed in the presence of APF I and III appeared to remain
   stable outside the hydrate stable zone, an observation that has also
   been noted for other inhibitors. Our observations have potential
   implications for the use of biological inhibitors under subsea pipeline
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A new line of research uses compression methods to measure the
   similarity between signals. Two signals are considered similar if one
   can be compressed significantly when the information of the other is
   known. The existing compression-based similarity methods, although
   successful in the discrete one dimensional domain, do not work well in
   the context of images. This paper proposes a sparse representation-based
   approach to encode the information content of an image using information
   from the other image, and uses the compactness (sparsity) of the
   representation as a measure of its compressibility (how much can the
   image be compressed) with respect to the other image. The sparser the
   representation of an image, the better it can be compressed and the more
   it is similar to the other image. The efficacy of the proposed measure
   is demonstrated through the high accuracies achieved in image
   clustering, retrieval and classification.}},

Volume = {{208}},
Pages = {{1-17}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the time transient isothermal flow of lyotropic nematic
   liquid crystals (LC) between two eccentric cylinders was studied
   numerically by applying the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) theory. The start-up
   flow induced by the steady rotation of the inner cylinder was used to
   model the lubrication problem inside a journal bearing. The ability of
   liquid crystalline materials to form ordered boundary layers with good
   load-carrying capacity, outstanding lubricating properties, has been
   widely demonstrated. The LdG theory for the microstructure of the
   molecules along with continuity and momentum equations were solved
   simultaneously using General PDE and Laminar Flow packages of the COMSOL
   Multiphysics. Flow properties and structure were investigated as a
   function of simulation time, the Reynolds number and the Energy ratio,
   R. Interconnection and impact of the texture and defects
   formation/evolution on velocity profile and pressure distribution was
   observed; nucleation and evolution of disclination line and defect
   points were detected and pursued over the simulation time. For high
   Reynolds numbers, the flow reached quasi-stationary condition while the
   microstructure evolution was at unsteady state. The influence of the
   Energy ratio and the Reynolds number on the formation and evolution of
   polydomains was studied. Indeed, it was found that coupling the
   evolution of liquid crystalline microstructure with the hydrodynamics
   has a quantitative and qualitative impact on the macro-scale attributes
   of the flow and on the structure. The standard procedure to classify
   defects has been applied, oblate and isotropic defects have been
   identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of people who sustain hip fractures after a fall to the
   side would not have been identified using current screening techniques
   such as areal bone mineral density. Identifying them, however, is
   essential so that appropriate pharmacological or lifestyle interventions
   can be implemented.
   A protocol, demonstrated on a single specimen, is introduced, comprising
   the following components; in vitro biofidelic drop tower testing of a
   proximal femur; high-speed image analysis through digital image
   correlation; detailed accounting of the energy present during the drop
   tower test; organ level finite element simulations of the drop tower
   test; micro level finite element simulations of critical volumes of
   interest in the trabecular bone.
   Fracture in the femoral specimen initiated in the superior part of the
   neck. Measured fracture load was 3760 N, compared to 4871 N predicted
   based on the finite element analysis. Digital image correlation showed
   compressive surface strains as high as 7.1\% prior to fracture. Voxel
   level results were consistent with high-speed video data and helped
   identify hidden local structural weaknesses.
   We found using a drop tower test protocol that a femoral neck fracture
   can be created with a fall velocity and energy representative of a
   sideways fall from standing. Additionally, we found that the nested
   explicit finite element method used allowed us to identify local
   structural weaknesses associated with femur fracture initiation. (C)

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast
   majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more
   sustainable. A smart city is a city in which information and
   communications technology are merged with traditional infrastructures,
   coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. The
   increasing amount of waste generated, and the collection and treatment
   of waste poses a major challenge to modern urban planning in general,
   and to smart cities in particular. To cope with this problem, automated
   vacuum waste collection (AVWC) uses air suction on a closed network of
   underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off points scattered
   throughout the city to a central collection point, reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions and the inconveniences of conventional methods (odours,
   noise, etc.). Since a significant part of the cost of operating AVWC
   systems is energy consumption, we have developed a model with the aim of
   applying constraint programming technology to schedule the daily
   emptying sequences of the drop off points in such a way that energy
   consumption is minimized. In this paper we describe how the problem of
   deciding the drop off points that should be emptied at a given time can
   be modeled as a constraint integer programming (CIP) problem. Moreover,
   we report on experiments using real data from AVWC systems installed in
   different cities that provide empirical evidence that CIP offers a
   suitable technology for reducing energy consumption in AVWC. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Using the principles of classical micromechanics, analytical equations
   are developed in this paper to estimate the effective orthotropic
   properties of a unit cell of strand-based composites according to their
   constituent phase properties and their microstructural features such as
   resin thickness, void content and strand geometrical characteristics.
   Although a special type of strand-based wood composite product, Parallel
   Strand Lumber, is considered here as an illustrative example, the
   methodology can be used for other wood composites consisting of high
   volume fraction of wood strands. The predictive accuracy of the derived
   analytical equations is investigated through comparisons with numerical
   results. Finally, applications of these equations in a linear
   viscoelastic analysis are discussed. The analytical micromechanics
   models developed here provide an efficient means of computing effective
   properties of a unit cell of strand-based composites. These models can
   then be used within a multi-scale modelling framework that has been
   developed previously to simulate the macroscopic behaviour of structures
   made of such materials.}},

Abstract = {{A smart grid (SG) consists of many subsystems and networks, all working
   together as a system of systems, many of which are vulnerable and can be
   attacked remotely. Therefore, security has been identified as one of the
   most challenging topics in SG development, and designing a mutual
   authentication scheme and a key management protocol is the first
   important step. This paper proposes an efficient scheme that mutually
   authenticates a smart meter of a home area network and an authentication
   server in SG by utilizing an initial password, by decreasing the number
   of steps in the secure remote password protocol from five to three and
   the number of exchanged packets from four to three. Furthermore, we
   propose an efficient key management protocol based on our enhanced
   identity-based cryptography for secure SG communications using the
   public key infrastructure. Our proposed mechanisms are capable of
   preventing various attacks while reducing the management overhead. The
   improved efficiency for key management is realized by periodically
   refreshing all public/private key pairs as well as any multicast keys in
   all the nodes using only one newly generated function broadcasted by the
   key generator entity. Security and performance analyses are presented to
   demonstrate these desirable attributes.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of two antifreeze proteins (AFPs), type I and III (AFP I
   and III), as kinetic natural gas hydrate inhibitors in saline solutions
   was evaluated using a high pressure micro differential scanning
   calorimeter and a high pressure apparatus consisting of two
   crystallizers. Although AFP I and III were found to prolong
   crystallization time and reduce initial gas hydrate growth in saline
   solutions, the growth rate increased when hydrate started to form in the
   gas phase. Circular dichroism experiments suggested that the saline
   solution did not perturb AFP I and III structures. However, in the
   presence of saline, the inhibitory activity of AFP I to prolong
   induction time decreased while AFP III was more active. As a
   consequence, we propose that a decrease in hydrophobic forces and the
   neutralization of ion charges could explain AFP adsorption to the
   surface of hydrate crystals. Once the hydrate formed, melting was
   delayed, and consequently hydrate decomposition took longer in the
   presence of AFPs. We suggest conditions whereby the properties of AFPs
   could be harnessed for petrochemical recovery and transport.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{281-289}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable building practices can considerably reduce building's
   environmental impact in energy consumption. Covering a building envelope
   with green vegetation, such as green roof and green wall, is considered
   a sustainable construction practice, as green vegetation has a positive
   performance in energy savings. It reduces heat flux and solar
   reflectivity, generates evaporative cooling, increases thermal
   performance of the building envelope, and blocks the wind effect on the
   building. This paper analyses the energy performance of green vegetation
   in a high occupancy LEED Gold standard building in Canada. DesignBuilder
   software was used to model the energy consumption for heating and
   cooling, and EnergyPlus software was used to perform the detailed energy
   simulations. The developed simulation model was validated with the
   actual energy consumptions of the selected building. Three different
   scenarios of green vegetation were simulated and the results show that
   green vegetation could considerably reduce the negative heat transfer
   through the building facade in summer and winter months. However, the
   analysis demonstrated that the green vegetation is not cost-effective in
   winter months or cold climatic regions due to the low energy savings
   performance. The paper concludes with recommendations to improve the
   overall energy performance in green buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) are one of the important building blocks of
   wireless receivers. LNA design parameters such as gain, noise figure,
   linearity, input matching, and stability are important metrics and
   typically affect the overall performance of the receiver. The strong
   trade-offs among these design parameters often necessitate several
   design iterations. While many of these trade-offs are due to the nature
   of the circuit and are inevitable, it is desirable to decouple the
   effects of each parameter on the others. In this work, body biasing is
   introduced as a technique to enhance the linearity, to improve the noise
   figure and to provide gain variation. These techniques are presented in
   the context of a three-stage LNA. By applying body biasing in each
   stage, noise figure, gain variation and linearity of the overall
   amplifier are adjusted almost independently, i.e., with minimal
   interrelation among these design parameters. As a proof-of-concept, a
   prototype 4.4-GHz LNA is designed and fabricated in a 0.13-mu m CMOS
   technology. The LNA achieves a minimum noise figure of 3.8 dB, maximum
   gain of 20.2 dB, and a maximum IIP3 of -14 dBm while consuming 3.6 mW
   from a 1.2 V supply.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic average-value models (AVMs) for AC-DC rectifier circuits are
   generally formulated in state-space form and hence are straightforward
   to implement in state-variable-based simulation languages. In the nodal
   analysis-based approach used in electromagnetic transient (EMTP-type)
   simulation packages, the development of AVMs requires additional effort
   to reformulate and interface the models with the external ac and dc
   networks. This paper proposes a new averaged-circuit model for
   three-phase line-commutated rectifiers which is directly interfaced with
   the ac and dc networks, thereby achieving a simultaneous solution of the
   respective variables in EMTP-type solution. The proposed model is
   verified against conventionally interfaced model, as well as detailed
   switching model of the original rectifier circuit. A significant
   improvement of numerical accuracy and stability of the solution is

Abstract = {{A methodology for producing a low density cellulose-based foam has been
   developed by combining a surfactant with pulp, mixing at high velocity
   to entrain air, and then drying in a non-restrained fashion. The
   structure of the foam, characterized through optical microscopy and
   X-ray computed tomographic microscopy, consists of pulp fibres in random
   orientations surrounding air bubbles along with large void spaces.
   Through careful design of experiments, the effect of fibre type, length
   distribution, surfactant, and air content on the mechanical behavior and
   permeability of the foam material was investigated. The results indicate
   that foamed cellulose materials can be produced at a strength of
   one-half the tensile strength of a standard handsheet, but having a
   relative density of only one percent. No chemical additives were used to
   enhance the strength of these samples as the properties of the foam
   material are enhanced simply through variation of the process
   parameters. Thus, a strong cellulose-based foam, with a density as low
   as 10 mg/cm(3), can be fabricated using standard papermaking
   infrastructure and hence at low cost.}},

   application with intensity of 500 W/m(2) over a period of 3-5 h/day.
   Randomized SODIS experiments over a period of 3 years were conducted to
   consider seasonal and weather variations. Six samples each for five
   levels of turbidity (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 NTU) were exposed to sunlight
   under variable cloud cover conditions on different days during the
   3-year sampling period. Samples were collected and analyzed for
   remaining FCs at different intervals in each sampling day. Analysis of
   variance revealed that turbidity and percent of cloud cover are the most
   significant process parameters. It was found that FCs die-off in SODIS
   bottles followed the first-order kinetics. Different data sets were used
   for the development and calibration of the model. The calibrated model
   was further verified against the literature. Simple characteristics
   curves have also been established for practical application at household
   level to estimate exposure periods. The study revealed a significant
   difference between the required exposure periods for different turbidity
   and cloud cover conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured cobalt (Co) and cobalt-iron (CoFe) alloy coatings were
   electrodeposited from sulfate solutions in the presence and absence of
   saccharin. The effects of saccharin on the corrosion behavior of Co and

   crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique coupled with cyclic voltammetry
   (CV) measurements. Saccharin was added to the electrolyte as a grain
   refiner and brightener. Interestingly, opposite corrosion behaviors were
   found for all nanostructured coatings in 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M NaOH. The
   use of saccharin as an additive in the plating solution accelerated the
   anodic reaction for all deposits in acidic medium. The mass decreases
   while dissolution rate increased with higher saccharin concentration.
   Meanwhile, formation of a thick passive film on the Co electrode surface
   were enhanced while a hindering effect was observed for CoFe alloy
   coatings deposited in the presence of saccharin in alkaline solution.
   The anodic and cathodic curves obtained from potentiodynamic
   polarization experiments were also in agreement with the EQCM results.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of liquid crystalline materials leads to a preferred
   direction of molecules in the vicinity of solid surfaces that gives them
   outstanding tribological properties. Intrinsic molecular order of liquid
   crystalline materials close to the solid boundaries protects the rubbing
   surfaces against wear. Due to the bio-compatible nature of most
   lyotropic liquid crystalline materials, they have been considered as
   viable candidates to be used as bio-lubricants. In order to understand
   the complex flow patterns and microstructure of liquid crystals, in this
   paper, start-up flow-induced microstructure of a nematic liquid crystal
   in a simplified capsular space of prosthetic hip joint was studied using
   the Landau-de Gennes nematodynamic theory. Flow streamlines,
   dimensionless pressure distribution, and rheological properties for a
   liquid crystal and for synovial fluid affected by rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) were presented and compared. The liquid crystals exhibited higher
   degrees of net pressure lifting force across the capsular gap while
   forming an ordered molecular layer close to the solid surfaces that
   protects the surface against wearing mechanism while decreasing the
   coefficient of friction (COF). Formation of molecular microstructure in
   vicinity of solid surfaces with perpendicular orientation to the normal
   surface vector was observed.}},

   leachate using sand, activated carbon and peat filters}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Landfill leachates are repeatedly found contaminated with organic
   pollutants, such as alkylphenols (APs), phthalates and polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at levels exceeding water quality
   standards. It has been shown that these pollutants may be present in the
   colloidal and truly dissolved phase in contaminated water, making
   particle separation an inefficient removal method. The aim of this study
   was to investigate sorption and degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons
   (PHCs), selected APs, bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates and PAHs from
   landfill leachate using sand, granulated activated carbon (GAC) and peat
   moss filters. A pilot plant was installed at an inactive landfill with
   mixed industrial and household waste and samples were collected before
   and after each filter during two years.
   Leachate pre-treated in oil separator and sedimentation pond failed to
   meet water quality standards in most samples and little improvement was
   seen after the sand filter. These techniques are based on particle
   removal, whereas the analysed pollutants are found, to varying degrees,
   bound to colloids or dissolved. However, even highly hydrophobic
   compounds expected to be particle-bound, such as the PHCs and
   high-molecular weight PAHs, were poorly removed in the sand filter. The
   APs and BPA were completely removed by the GAC filter, while mass
   balance calculations indicate that 50-80\% of the investigated phenols
   were removed in the peat filter. Results suggest possible AP degradation
   in peat filters. No evidence of phthalate degradation in the landfill,
   pond or the filters was found. The PHCs were completely removed in 50\%
   and 35\% of the measured occasions in the GAG and peat filters,
   respectively. The opposite trend was seen for removal of PAHs in GAG
   (50\%) and peat (63\%). Oxygenated PAHs with high toxicity were found in
   the leachates but not in the pond sediment. These compounds are likely
   formed in the pond water, which is alarming because sedimentation ponds
   are commonly used treatment techniques. The oxy-PAHs were effectively
   removed in the GAG, and especially the peat filter. It was hypothesized
   that dissolved compounds would adsorb equally well to the peat and GAC
   filters. This was not completely supported as the GAC filter was in
   general more efficient than peat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   The hydrogen permeation performance of the Pd-Ru composite membrane
   followed Sieverts' law, suggesting that diffusion of atomic hydrogen

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{106-113}},

Abstract = {{Silico-aluminates (zeolites) have been recently utilized promisingly as
   the support for photocatalytic hydrogen production using solar-activated
   TiO2-based nanoparticles. Aside from conventional advantages offered by
   the supports in photocatalysis, we demonstrate the unique
   physicochemical impact of zeolites on photocatalytic hydrogen
   production. Beside zeolites, our synthesized materials comprise titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) as the semiconductor, cobalt ions as the hydrogen
   evolution sites, and heteropolyacids (HPAs) as the multifunctional solid
   acids with significant excitability under visible light. Four classes of
   zeolites (Na-Y, Na-mordenite, H-Y, and H-beta) with different Si/Al
   ratios and sodium contents were evaluated. Among the studied
   photocatalysts, Na-Y and Na-mordenite containing 10 wt\% titania emerged
   as the potential candidates for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with
   corresponding rates of 250.8 and 187.2 mu mol/g h, in comparison to 84.2
   mu mol/g h for Degussa P25; while these values for H-Y and H-beta were
   96.8 and 100.1 mu mol/g h, respectively. The higher photocatalytic
   activity of the first two classes is attributed to the basicity of the
   zeolite matrix, which is possibly due to the pH dependency of the TiO2
   band edges. The results indicate the importance of controlling the
   chemical properties of the zeolite as a photocatalyst support through
   the selection of suitable types. Furthermore, our analyses show that the
   precise pore size distribution of the zeolite framework rules over
   accommodating the impregnated species whether in the pores or on the
   surface. This ultimately enables a vast array of synthesis opportunities
   for development of the-state-of-the-art solar-activated photocatalysts
   based on earth-abundant materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Computed Tomography (CT) is extensively used as a medical diagnostic
   tool, and increasingly adopted for scientific and industrial research.
   In the wood industry, there is a growing interest in using the CT
   technique to assess the quality of logs entering a sawmill to enable the
   material to be appropriately processed into maximum value products.
   Internal features of interest include knots, heartwood/sapwood boundary,
   rot and splits. Most commercially available CT scanning systems are
   modeled on medical designs and provide high spatial and density
   resolution. They are very complex and delicate devices with
   correspondingly high cost. However, log scanning has its own distinctive
   characteristics: specific overall and feature geometries and relatively
   coarse scanning resolution requirement. To fit these characteristics,
   the novel geometry-based coarse-resolution CT scanning approach
   described here has been developed and implemented. The models,
   algorithms, scanner design and result validation are presented in
   detail. The resulting CT reconstructions for an example log using the
   proposed geometry-based coarse-resolution approach compare well with CT
   reconstructions for same log using the same data with conventional
   filtered back projection inversion. The good comparison gives confidence
   in the usefulness and applicability of the proposed CT method for
   industrial use in sawmills for log quality assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking the position and orientation of a 3-D ultrasound transducer has
   many clinical applications. Tracking requires calibration to find the
   transformation between the tracking sensor and the ultrasound
   coordinates. Typically the set of image slice data are scan converted to
   a Cartesian volume using assumed motor geometry and a single
   transformation to the sensor. We propose, instead, the calibration of
   individual slices using a 2-D calibration technique. A best fit to a
   subset of slices is performed to decrease data collection time compared
   with that for calibration of all slices, and to reduce the influence of
   random errors in individual calibrations. We compare our technique with
   four scan conversion-based techniques: 2-D N-wire on the center slice,
   N-wire using a 3-D volume, N-wire using a 3-D volume including the edge
   points and a new closed-form planar method using a 3-D volume. The
   proposed multi-slice technique produced the smallest point
   reconstruction error (0.82 mm using a tracked stylus). (C) 2014 World

Abstract = {{Growing availability of mobile devices capable of sensing and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive molecular dynamics study on the
   effects of nanocracks (a row of vacancies) on the fracture strength of
   graphene sheets at various temperatures. Comparison of the strength
   given by molecular dynamics simulations with Griffith's criterion and
   quantized fracture mechanics theory demonstrates that quantized fracture
   mechanics is more accurate compared to Griffith's criterion. A numerical
   model based on kinetic analysis and quantized fracture mechanics theory
   is proposed. The model is computationally very efficient and it quite
   accurately predicts the fracture strength of graphene with defects at
   various temperatures. Critical stress intensity factors in mode I
   fracture reduce as temperature increases. Molecular dynamics simulations
   are used to calculate the critical values of integral () of armchair
   graphene at various crack lengths. Results show that depends on the
   crack length. This length dependency of can be used to explain the
   deviation of the strength from Griffith's criterion. The paper provides
   an in-depth understanding of fracture of graphene, and the findings are

Abstract = {{Biomass drying is performed mainly in rotary dryers, which occupy a
   large footprint. To explore the efficient drying of biomass, a fluidized
   bed dryer was proposed. Good circulation of biomass particles could be
   established in the fluidized bed without the use of inert particle or
   mechanical aids. The initial moisture content of the input sawdust
   affected its fluidization performance. For the drying of sawdust of
   high-moisture content, the fluidization behavior could be divided into
   three stages: partial fluidization, full fluidization with increasing
   drying rate, and full fluidization with decreasing drying rate. A high
   drying rate could be achieved because of the fast mass and heat transfer
   rate in the fluidized bed. The fluidized bed dryer has a drying
   performance similar to the binary mixture fluidized bed dryer but more
   compact, and requires no separation of dried biomass particles from the
   inert bed particles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate how the cooperation emerges in the square lattice when
   individuals play the prisoner's dilemma game by adopting different
   strategy updating methods. First, we classify individuals in two classes
   at the strategy updating stage: stochastic players and smart players.
   The stochastic players are those who take the classical Fermi rule,
   while the smart players are those who make comprehensive evaluation for
   strategy updating. Second, we adopt Dempster Shafer theory to combine
   smart players' evaluations from payoff and environment aspects.
   Simulation results reveal that the comprehensive strategy updating
   method has a positive impact on the emergence of cooperation.
   Furthermore, the number of cooperators increases with the proportion of
   smart player increase. However, it is noteworthy that defector never
   become extinct, even all players in the network are smart ones. This is
   because some smart players would maximize their payoff if they choose to
   betray their cooperative neighbors. Our work in this paper may provide
   further understanding of the origin of cooperation in social and biology
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider target localization in randomly deployed multi-hop wireless
   sensor networks, where messages originating from a sensor node are
   broadcast by flooding and the node-to-node message delays are
   characterized by independent, exponential random variables. Using
   asymptotic results from first-passage percolation theory and a maximum
   entropy argument, we formulate a stochastic jump process to approximate
   the hop count of a message at distance r from the source node. The
   resulting marginal distribution of the process has the form of a
   translated Poisson distribution which characterizes observations
   reasonably well and whose parameters can be learnt, for example by
   maximum likelihood estimation. This result is important in Bayesian
   target localization, where mobile or stationary sinks of known position
   use the hop count conditioned on the Euclidean distance, to estimate the
   position of a sensor node or event within the network, based solely on
   observations of the hop count. For the target localization problem,
   simulation results show that the proposed model provides reasonably good
   performance, especially for densely connected networks. (C) 2014

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{The increase in internet traffic, number of users, and availability of
   mobile devices poses a challenge to wireless technologies. In long-term
   evolution (LTE) advanced system, heterogeneous networks (HetNet) using
   centralized coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmitting radio over
   optical fibers (LTE A-ROF) have provided a feasible way of satisfying
   user demands. In this paper, an orthogonal wavelet division
   multiple-access (OWDMA) processor architecture is proposed, which is
   shown to be better suited to LTE advanced systems as compared to
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) as in LTE systems
   3GPP rel.8 (3GPP, http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/36300.htm). ROF systems
   are a viable alternative to satisfy large data demands; hence, the
   performance in ROF systems is also evaluated. To validate the
   architecture, the circuit is designed and synthesized on a Xilinx
   vertex-6 field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The synthesis results
   show that the circuit performs with a clock period as short as 7.036 ns
   (i.e., a maximum clock frequency of 142.13 MHz) for transform size of
   512. A pipelined version of the architecture reduces the power
   consumption by approximately 89\%. We compare our architecture with
   similar available architectures for resource utilization and timing and
   provide performance comparison with OFDMA systems for various quality
   metrics of communication systems. The OWDMA architecture is found to
   perform better than OFDMA for bit error rate (BER) performance versus
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in wireless channel as well as ROF media. It
   also gives higher throughput and mitigates the bad effect of
   peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR).}},

Abstract = {{We have successfully developed hybrid piezoelectric paper through fiber
   functionalization that involves anchoring nanostructured BaTiO3 into a
   stable matrix with wood cellulose fibers prior to the process of making
   paper sheets. This is realized by alternating immersion of wood fibers
   in a solution of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) PDDA (+),
   followed by poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) PSS (-), and once again in
   PDDA (+), resulting in the creation of a positively charged surface on
   the wood fibers. The treated wood fibers are then immersed in a BaTiO3
   suspension, resulting in the attachment of BaTiO3 nanoparticles to the
   wood fibers due to a strong electrostatic interaction. Zeta potential
   measurements, X-ray diffraction, and microscopic and spectroscopic
   analysis imply successful functionalization of wood fibers with BaTiO3
   nanoparticles without altering the hydrogen bonding and crystal
   structure of the wood fibers. The paper has the largest piezoelectric
   coefficient, d(33) = 4.8 +/- 0.4 pC N-1 at the highest nanoparticle
   loading of 48 wt \% BaTiO3. This newly developed piezoelectric hybrid
   paper is promising as a low-cost substrate to build sensing devices.}},

Abstract = {{A model relating potential and current in continuous parallel plate iron
   electrocoagulation (EC) was developed for application in drinking water
   treatment. The general model can be applied to any EC parallel plate
   system relying only on geometric and tabulated input variables without
   the need of system-specific experimentally derived constants. For the
   theoretical model, the anode and cathode were vertically divided into n
   equipotential segments in a single pass, upflow, and adiabatic EC
   reactor. Potential and energy balances were simultaneously solved at
   each vertical segment, which included the contribution of ionic
   concentrations, solution temperature and conductivity, cathodic hydrogen
   flux, and gas/liquid ratio. We experimentally validated the numerical
   model with a vertical upflow EC reactor using a 24 cm height 99.99\%
   pure iron anode divided into twelve 2 cm segments. Individual
   experimental currents from each segment were summed to determine total
   current, and compared with the theoretically derived value. Several key
   variables were studied to determine their impact on model accuracy:
   solute type, solute concentration, current density, flow rate,
   inter-electrode gap, and electrode surface condition. Model results were
   in good agreement with experimental values at cell potentials of 2-20 V
   (corresponding to a current density range of approximately 50-800
   A/m(2)), with mean relative deviation of 9\% for low flow rate, narrow
   electrode gap, polished electrodes, and 150 mg/L NaCI. Highest deviation
   occurred with a large electrode gap, unpolished electrodes, and Na2SO4
   electrolyte, due to parasitic H2O oxidation and less than unity current
   efficiency. This is the first general model which can be applied to any
   parallel plate EC system for accurate electrochemical voltage or current
   prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A colloidal silica incorporated porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) was
   utilized as a dual-template to prepare mesoporous carbon nanofibers
   (MCNFs). Such a strategy is simple because it takes advantage of
   commercially available materials (i.e., colloidal silica and AAO) and
   the templates can be removed in one step. The as-prepared MCNF shows a
   hierarchical nanostructure consisting of open macroporous channel
   connected with large mesopores and micropores. As a result of the large
   surface area and unique hierarchical nanoarchitecture which facilitates
   fast mass and electron transport, the MCNF reveals a discharge capacity
   of 679 mA h g(-1) at 25 mA g(-1). This value is significantly greater
   than that (i.e., 394 mA h g(-1)) observed for an ordered mesoporous
   carbon (OMC) with a similar specific surface area. Furthermore, at 3000
   mA g(-1), the MCNF demonstrates a discharge capacity of 585 mA h g(-1),
   which is about twice that (i.e., 256 mA h g(-1)) of the OMC. Copyright

Abstract = {{The authors analyse an L-channel selection combining (SC) scheme for a
   power line communication (PLC) system with binary phase-shift keying.
   The focus is on improving the reliability in data transfer of the system
   instead of improving the data rate. To enhance the reliability in data
   transfer, multiple PLC channels are used to send the same
   information-bearing signal to the receiver. The L PLC channels are
   subject to log-normal fading, which is modelled by a multivariate
   log-normal distribution with an exponential correlation. The channels
   are also corrupted by additive impulsive noise as well as thermal noise.
   To consider the effect of both types of noises, they adopt a Gaussian
   mixture noise model, in which the additive noise samples are taken from
   a Bernoulli-Gaussian process. The system performance is evaluated in
   terms of the average bit error rate and the average channel capacity,
   for which approximate closed form expressions are derived. Numerical
   results showing the impact of the number of PLC channels, the amount of
   correlation, the noise scenarios, and the fading environments on the
   performance are presented. The authors' results show that the
   performance improves with increasing number of PLC channels; however,
   the amount of improvement reduces with increasing channel correlation.}},

Volume = {{603}},

Abstract = {{The propensity for the magnesium alloy ZEK100 to develop large
   microscale plistic strain heterogeneity has been quantified and
   correlated to microstructure using a combination of experiments and
   simulations. Conditions were specifically selected where deformation is
   dominated by slip rather than twinning. Digital image correlation
   measurements of intragranular plastic strain heterogeneity have revealed
   plastic strains as large as 5 times the macroscopic tensile strain. This
   strain amplification was found to be neither spatially correlated nor
   correlated with crystal orientation. Large local strains were, however,
   found to be statistically linked to proximity to grain boundaries. This
   suggests the importance of interactions between neighboring grains. To
   investigate this further full-field viscoplastic Fast Fourier Transform
   (VPFFT) crystal plasticity simulations were performed on synthetic
   microstructures representative of the material studied experimentally.
   It was found that both the macroscopic stress-strain response as well as
   the local plastic strain distribution could be well reproduced when the
   anisotropy in `hardness' of the basal and non-basal slip systems was
   sufficiently high. Strain amplification was found to occur, in this
   case, to slip in regions of high basal slip activity adjacent to regions
   of high non-basal slip activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Fiber delivery of ultrashort pulses is important for multiphoton
   endoscopy. A chirped photonic crystal fiber (CPCF) is first
   characterized for its transmission bandwidth, propagation loss, and
   dispersion properties. Its extremely low dispersion (similar to 150
   fs(2)/m) enables the delivery of sub-30 fs pulses through a similar to 1
   m-long CPCF. The CPCF is then incorporated into a multiphoton imaging
   system and its performance is demonstrated by imaging various biological
   samples including yew leaf, mouse tendon, and human skin. The imaging
   quality is further compared with images acquired by a multiphoton
   imaging system with free-space or hollow-core photonic band-gap fiber
   (PBF) delivery of pulses. Compared with free-space system, the CPCF
   delivered system maintains the same ultrashort pulsewidth and the image
   qualities are comparable. Compared with the PBF delivery, CPCF provides
   a 35 times shorter pulsewidth at the sample location, which results in a
   similar to 12 and 50 times improvement in two-photon excitation
   fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) signals
   respectively. Our results show that CPCF has great potential for fiber
   delivery of ultrashort pulses for multiphoton endoscopy. (C) 2014

Title = {{Leaching kinetics of enargite in alkaline sodium sulphide solutions}},

Abstract = {{Leaching of enargite samples containing approximately 12\% As, 0.5\% Sb
   and 39\% Cu was studied in alkaline sulphide solutions containing sodium
   hydroxide and sodium sulphide. Kinetic parameters studied included
   temperature, particle size, reagent concentration, agitation rate and
   stoichiometry in high pulp density experiments. The extraction of
   arsenic was chemical reaction controlled with an activation energy of 74
   kJ mol(-1), indicating the importance of temperature on the process. The
   relative contributions of total initial sulphide and hydroxide
   concentrations on leaching kinetics were determined and a new rate
   equation was developed
   r(AS) = - d{[}As]/dt = k'{[}As](2.37) {[}S2-](1.83){[}OH-](3.31), kg
   t(-1) h(-1)
   where k' depends on system activation energy and can be predicted from
   this parameter (it had a value of 1.63 x 10(-3) in this work). This rate
   equation was validated against data presented in other similar studies
   of enargite leaching. It is demonstrated that the hydroxide ion plays a
   direct role in the leaching reaction, rather than simply ensuring
   adequate sulphide speciation. Copper, iron, zinc, and silver were not
   extracted during the leaching procedure. Through chemical analysis,
   X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy leach residues were
   characterised. Residues contained copper-sulphur compounds such as
   digenite, bornite and sodium copper sulphide (NaCu5S3). (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Wireless nano-sensor networks (WNSNs), which consist of nano-sensors a
   few hundred nanometers in size with the capability to detect and sense
   new types of events in nano-scale, are promising for many unique
   applications such as air pollution surveillance. The nano-sensors of
   WNSNs are highly energy-constrained, which makes it essential to develop
   energy-efficient communication techniques in such networks. In this
   paper, we focus on WNSNs employing on-off keying (OOK) modulation,
   whereby transmission energy minimization corresponds to the minimization
   of average codeword weight (ACW). We formulate an integer nonlinear
   programming problem to construct prefix-free codes with minimum ACW
   under the constraint of average codeword length (ACL) so as to minimize
   the transmission energy consumption while guaranteeing the throughput
   larger than a preset desired value. In addition, two efficient
   algorithms, called binary tree based weight decreasing (BT-WD) algorithm
   and binary tree based length decreasing (BT-LD) algorithm, are presented
   for constructing low-ACW prefix-free codes. The effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithms is verified through simulations and comparisons with
   the exhaustive search method. Compared with the available fixed-length
   low-weight codes, the designed prefix-free variable-length codes allow
   us to not only control the throughput more flexibly but also achieve
   lower transmission energy consumption in the scenarios with low or
   medium bit error rates.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive mathematical model of the hot extrusion process for
   aluminum alloys has been developed and validated. The plasticity module
   was developed using a commercial finite element package, DEFORM-2D, a
   transient Lagrangian model which couples the thermal and deformation
   phenomena. Validation of the model against industrial data indicated
   that it gave excellent predictions of the pressure during extrusion. The
   finite element predictions of the velocity fields were post-processed to
   calculate the thickness of the surface cladding as one billet is fed in
   after another through the die (i.e., the transverse weld). The
   mathematical model was then used to assess the effect a change in feeder
   dimensions would have on the shape, thickness and extent of the
   transverse weld during extrusion. Experimental measurements for
   different combinations of billet materials show that the model is able
   to accurately predict the transverse weld shape as well as the clad
   surface layer to thicknesses of 50 mu m. The transverse weld is
   significantly affected by the feeder geometry shape, but the effects of
   ram speed, billet material and temperature on the transverse weld
   dimensions are negligible.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Online gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry that entertains a
   large, global population. One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons
   the competition and spoils the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span
   from industry-supported expenditures to detect and limit it, to victims'
   monetary losses due to cyber crime.
   This article studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social
   network built on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery
   platform. We collected information about more than 12 million gamers
   connected in a global social network, of which more than 700 thousand
   have their profiles flagged as cheaters. We also observed timing
   information of the cheater flags, as well as the dynamics of the
   cheaters' social neighborhoods.
   We discovered that cheaters are well embedded in the social and
   interaction networks: their network position is largely
   indistinguishable from that of fair players. Moreover, we noticed that
   the number of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical,
   real-world population density, or with the local popularity of the Steam
   Community. Also, we observed a social penalty involved with being
   labeled as a cheater: cheaters lose friends immediately after the
   cheating label is publicly applied.
   Most importantly, we observed that cheating behavior spreads through a
   social mechanism: the number of cheater friends of a fair player is
   correlated with the likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future.
   This allows us to propose ideas for limiting cheating contagion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to design a smooth switching gain-scheduled
   linear parameter varying (LPV) controller for LPV systems. The moving
   region of the gain-scheduling variables is divided into a specified
   number of local subregions as well as subregions for the smooth
   controller switching, and one gain-scheduled LPV controller is assigned
   to each of the local subregions. For each switching subregion, a
   function interpolating two local LPV controllers associated with its
   neighborhood subregions is designed to satisfy the constraint of smooth
   transition of controller system matrices. The smooth switching
   controller design problem amounts to solving a feasibility problem which
   involves nonlinear matrix inequalities. To find a solution to the
   feasibility problem, an iterative descent algorithm which solves a
   series of convex optimization problems is proposed. The usefulness of
   the proposed controller design method is demonstrated with a control
   example of a flexible ball-screw drive system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effect of clay nanoparticles on the glass transition and melting
   behavior of PLA was examined using a heat flux, rapid scanning rate
   calorimeter. The samples were prepared by electrospinning through
   incorporation of clay in the electrospinning solution, which facilitated
   composites with high filler loadings (15-25 wt.\%). Incorporation of
   clay increased the crystallization kinetics of PLA only at lower loading
   levels. The incorporation of 15.3 wt.\% clay resulted in only a slight
   reduction in the overall degree of crystallinity (w(c)) in PLA, while a
   substantial reduction was observed with the incorporation of 25.0 wt.\%
   clay. A significant reduction in the equilibrium melting temperature
   (T-m(0)) was observed for nanocomposites containing 15.3 wt.\% clay
   compared to the neat PLA fiber; however, the extent of reduction was
   mitigated when increasing the clay loading further to 25 wt.\%. The PLA
   nanocomposites with 15.3 wt.\% clay exhibited the lowest T-g values in
   both semicrystalline and amorphous samples. Elucidating the differences
   in thermal behavior and morphology of these nanocomposites as a function
   of clay loading is crucial for optimizing their physical and mechanical
   properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of pyrite (FeS2) on the electrochemical dissolution of fresh
   and passivated chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) electrodes has been studied.
   Current density values for the dissolution of CuFeS2 were calculated
   from EIS measurements. FeS2 increased the dissolution rate of fresh and
   passivated CuFeS2 electrodes indicating that the galvanic effect
   continued even after the electrode was chemically passivated. The
   dissolution rate of CuFeS2 decreased by a factor of 3 after the
   passivation treatment. Due to the low diffusion rates of ions within the
   CuFeS2 passive film and due to an increase in the resistance to the
   transfer of electrons at the electrode/film interface, the activity of
   FeS2 for the reduction of Fe3+ ions was also reduced by a factor of 2.3
   even though FeS2 was not exposed to any chemical treatment. The results
   in this work indicate that the dissolution rate of the fresh CuFeS2
   electrode was controlled by the reduction of Fe3+ ions whereas for the
   passivated CuFeS2 electrode the dissolution rate was controlled by
   diffusion within the passive film. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a multimodal imaging system which combines multiphoton
   microscopy and optical coherence tomography to visualize the
   morphological structures, and to quantify the refractive index (RI) and
   thickness of cornea. The morphological similarities and differences at
   different corneal layers across various species are identified. In the
   piscine and human corneas, the stromata exhibit thin fibers that
   indicate an overall collagen direction. Human corneas display collagen
   micro-folds which cause increased light attenuation. In the murine,
   porcine and bovine corneas, the stromata show interwoven collagen
   patterns. The Bowman's layer and the Descemet's membrane are also
   distinguished in some species. The RI and thicknesses are quantified for
   the epithelium and the stromal layers respectively, where the epithelium
   is found to have slightly higher RI than the stroma. The average
   epithelial and stromal RI are, respectively, 1.371 +/- 0.016 and 1.360
   +/- 0.008 for the murine corneas; 1.502 +/- 0.057 and 1.335 +/- 0.011
   for the piscine corneas; 1.433 +/- 0.023 and 1.357 +/- 0.013 for the

   corneas; and 1.400 +/- 0.007 and 1.376 +/- 0.003 for the bovine corneas.
   The multimodal system can potentially provide a comprehensive

Title = {{Role of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) in reverting neuronal

Abstract = {{Purpose: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease is
   an adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder. ALS-CSF has been
   shown to produce toxic effects on motor neuron cells like aberrant
   neurofilament phosphorylation and morphological alterations of nuclear
   and soma size. Our current study was designed to investigate the
   neuroprotective role of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) in
   reverting the adverse effects produced by ALS-CSF.
   Methods: Our present study was carried out to determine the restorative
   potential of PDGF on the toxic effects of ALS-CSF on NSC motor neuron
   cells from patients. Therefore the cells were divided in to three
   groups: (a) normal control (NC) - the cells were not exposed to ALS-CSF;
   (b) ALS group - the cells were exposed to ALS-CSF; (c) NALS group - the
   cells were exposed to non ALS CSF. Further each of these groups was
   supplemented with PDGF.
   Results and conclusions: We observed that the mean area of nucleus and
   cell soma of the differentiated NSC motor neuron cells was significantly
   reduced in the cells exposed to ALS-CSF. We also observed that
   subsequent treatment with PDGF restored the soma area and nucleus of the
   ALS-CSF exposed cells significantly. Taken together, we show that
   supplementation with PDGF restores the morphological changes induced by
   ALS-CSF and PDGF may play a significant role in protecting motor neurons
   from apoptosis in ALS and thereby it promoting the cell survival.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale modeling tools have great potential to aid the development of
   new steels and processing routes. Currently, industrial process models
   are at least in part based on empirical material parameters to describe
   microstructure evolution and the resulting material properties. Modeling
   across different length and time scales is a promising approach to
   develop next-generation process models with enhanced predictive
   capabilities for the role of alloying elements. The status and
   challenges of this multiscale modeling approach are discussed for
   microstructure evolution in advanced low-carbon steels. First-principle
   simulations of solute segregation to a grain boundary and an
   austenite-ferrite interface in iron confirm trends of important alloying
   elements (e.g., Nb, Mo, and Mn) on grain growth, recrystallization, and
   phase transformation in steels. In particular, the linkage among
   atomistic simulations, phase-field modeling, and classic diffusion
   models is illustrated for the effects of solute drag on the
   austenite-to-ferrite transformation as observed in dedicated
   experimental studies for iron model alloys and commercial steels.}},

Abstract = {{Recent global protocols and agreements have motivated countries to use
   biomass for energy generation, However, the barriers in biomass
   utilization including variations in biomass availability, high moisture
   content, low bulk density and dispersed distribution of biomass have
   made investors reluctant to invest in bioenergy projects in some parts
   of the world. In this paper, in addition to a brief summary of the
   conversion technologies used for energy generation, a review of the
   world literature on techno-economic assessment of district energy
   systems using forest biomass as the primary fuel with references
   extending over two decades is provided. Although energy generation from
   forest biomass is found to be expensive in many countries, the review of
   literature revealed important factors that increased the share of
   biomass in energy production in other countries. These important factors
   include using more efficient technologies, providing governmental grants
   and subsidies, setting new policies in favor of biomass utilization,
   increasing emission reduction targets, and introducing tradable carbon
   credits. The feasibility of utilizing forest biomass in district heating
   systems has been examined in the literature mainly based on the costs,
   while considering social and environmental profiles of these systems
   could improve their acceptance. Future research studies on assessing the
   performance of biomass district energy systems should consider
   environmental and social impacts of these systems in addition to their
   costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium(II) and chloride ions tend to form complexes in aqueous
   solution. Both theoretical and experimental (by UV spectrum) results
   indicate that there are four complexes formed in aqueous solution
   containing 3 mol/L hydrochloric acid and 20 mmol/L PdCl2. This work
   evaluates the kinetics of electrochemical deposition of palladium on a
   Platinum electrode. For this purpose, palladium electrodeposition was
   investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), potentiostatic
   current-time transients (CTTs) and Tafel curve. By CTTs curves, the
   regions corresponding to the charge transfer control, mixed control and
   diffusion control were identified. In the diffusion control region,
   palladium electrodeposition mechanism was characterized as progressive
   nucleation with three-dimensional (3D) growth under diffusion control;
   as for the mixed control region, an adsorption (I (Ads)), ion transfer
   (I (IT)), and nucleation and growth (I (NG)) model were proposed to
   analyze the current-time transients quantitatively, which could separate
   the I (Ads), I (IT) and I (NG) perfectly.}},

Title = {{Spatial distribution and risk assessment of metals in dust based on

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of metal (Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni
   and V) concentrations in urban dust of Xi'an, China was determined using
   the geographical information system method on dust from nursery and
   primary schools. The health risk of these metals in campus dust to
   children was assessed based on the EPA heath risk model. The results
   indicate elevated metal concentrations, especially of Cu, Pb, Zn, Co, Cr
   and Ba, which are 1.5-10.2, 2.6-73.0, 2.1-26.5, 2.0-10.9, 1.2-10.2 and
   1.1-10.4 times the background values of Shaanxi soil, respectively. Pb,
   Cr, Cu and Ba have similar distribution patterns. The hot-spot areas of
   Pb, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr and Ba are mainly associated with industrial
   activities and heavy traffic. Their spatial distributions in the Xi'an
   urban dust indicated that these metals mainly originate from vehicles
   and industrial activities. For As, Mn, Ni and V, natural factors are
   important in controlling their distributions. Health risk assessment
   shows that ingestion is the largest exposure route of metals in dust
   from nursery and primary schools to children. The mean hazard indices
   for non-cancer risk of all analyzed metals due to campus dust are within
   the safe range, while the maximum hazard indices of Pb, Cr and As are
   close to, or slightly higher than, safe levels. The cancer risks of As,
   Co, Cr and Ni to nursery and primary school children, considering only
   inhalation, are within the acceptable range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Motion and coalescence of sessile drops driven by subtrate wetting
   gradient and external flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{746}},
Pages = {{214-235}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We report two-dimensional simulations of drop dynamics on a substrate
   subject to a wetting gradient and an external pressure gradient along
   the substrate. A phase-field formulation is used to represent the drop
   interface, and the moving contact line is modelled by Cahn-Hilliard
   diffusion. The Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations are solved by
   finite elements on an adaptively refined unstructured grid. For a single
   drop and a pair of drops, we consider three scenarios of drop motion
   driven by the wetting gradient only, by the external flow only, and by a
   combination of the two. Both the capillary force and the hydrodynamic
   drag depend strongly on the shape of the drop. Since the drop adapts its
   shape to the local wetting angles and to the external flow on a finite
   time scale, hysteresis is a prominent feature of the drop dynamics under
   opposing forces. For each wetting gradient, there is a narrow range of
   the magnitude of the external flow within which a single drop can
   achieve a stationary state. The equilibrium drop shape and position
   depend on its initial shape and the history of forcing. For a pair of
   drops, the wetting gradient or external flow alone tends to produce
   catch-up and coalescence. The flow-driven coalescence arises from a
   viscous shielding effect that relies on the asymmetric shape of the
   trailing drop once it is deformed by flow. This mechanism operates at
   zero Reynolds number, but is much enhanced by inertia. With the two
   forces opposing each other, the external flow favours separation while
   the wetting gradient favours coalescence. The outcome depends on their
   competition.}},

   substrate stiffness and stress significantly outweigh the effects of

Abstract = {{Natural clays are anisotropic in their in situ state and have an
   undisturbed shear strength in excess of the remolded strength. In
   addition, most of the structures founded on clay deposits must be
   designed to withstand cyclic loads such as earthquakes or ocean waves.
   When subjected to cyclic loadings, clay exhibits complex response. A
   realistic modeling of clay response under irregular loading requires an
   appropriate description of the stress-strain relationship. This paper
   extends the formulation of a Simple ANIsotropic CLAY plasticity
   (SANICLAY) model by incorporation of a bounding surface formulation for
   simulation of clay response under cyclic loading. The most important
   elements of the proposed formulation are incorporation of bounding
   surface plasticity concept with proper repositioning of the projection
   center and adoption of a new damage parameter. These have led to
   significantly improved simulation of clay response in cyclic loading.
   The model is developed with the aim of maintaining the simplicity and
   yet including an adequate level of sophistication for successful
   modeling of the key features of clay response. The formulation is
   presented in detail followed by validation of the model demonstrating
   its capabilities in capturing a number of important characteristic
   features of clay response in cyclic loading. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {{Experimental data are combined with classic theories describing
   electrolytes in solution and at surfaces to define the primary
   mechanisms influencing protein retention and elution during isoelectric
   chromatofocusing (ICF) of proteins and protein mixtures. Those
   fundamental findings are used to derive a new model to understand and
   predict elution times of proteins during ICF. The model uses a modified
   form of the steric mass action (SMA) isotherm to account for both ion
   exchange and isoelectric focusing contributions to protein partitioning.
   The dependence of partitioning on pH is accounted for through the
   characteristic charge parameter m of the SMA isotherm and the
   application of Gouy-Chapman theory to define the dependence of the
   equilibrium binding constant K-bi on both m and ionic strength. Finally,
   the effects of changes in matrix surface pH on protein retention are
   quantified through a Donnan equilibrium type model. By accounting for
   isoelectric focusing, ion binding and exchange, and surface pH
   contributions to protein retention and elution, the model is shown to
   accurately capture the dependence of protein elution times on column
   operating conditions. Biotechnol. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 925-936.

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{58-69}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical exfoliation of graphite assisted by ionic liquids (ILs)
   has been proposed as a high-throughput, green and scalable graphene
   production technique. Previous research has focused on IL/water
   electrolytes with high IL content (from 1:0.1 to 1:1 IL/water volume
   ratios). Here, we introduce and investigate a novel IL/acetonitrile
   electrolyte with dramatically lower loads of ionic liquids (similar to
   1:50 IL/acetonitrile vol. ratio). Our approach provides three main
   advantages: cost efficiency due to low IL content, extended
   electrochemical stability in a non-aqueous electrolyte, and high
   exfoliation yield by effective anionic intercalation within the
   graphitic layers. Using iso-molded graphite rod as the anode, we
   achieved up to 86\% of exfoliation with the majority of the products as'
   graphene flakes in addition to smaller quantities of carbonaceous
   particles and rolled sheets. We also demonstrate by Raman spectroscopy
   the beneficial sonication effect on improving the quality of the
   graphene-based products. Moreover, in contrast with previous literature,
   we prove that the electrolyte coloration during electro-exfoliation in
   the IL media is related to the occurrence of diverse reactions involving
   the IL moieties and cannot be associated with different stages of
   graphene formation. The cathodically generated species can also
   interfere with the anionic intercalation in the graphite anode. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A new gene expression system was developed in Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
   replacing a pRK415-based system used previously. The broad host-range
   IPTG-inducible plasmid pIND4 was used to create the plasmid pIND4-RC1
   for expression of the puhA and pufQBALMX genes, encoding the reaction
   centre (RC) and light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1) proteins. The strain R.
   sphaeroides Delta RCLH was used to make a knockout of the rshI
   restriction endonuclease gene, enabling electroporation of DNA into the
   bacterium; a subsequent knockout of ppsR was made, creating the strain
   R. sphaeroides RCx lacking this oxygen-sensing repressor of the
   photosynthesis gene cluster. Using pIND4-RC1, LH1 levels were increased
   by a factor of about 8 over pRS1 per cell in cultures grown
   semi-aerobically. In addition, the ppsR knockout allowed for
   photosynthetic pigment-protein complex synthesis in the presence of high
   concentrations of molecular oxygen; here, LH1 levels per cell increased
   by 20 \% when grown under high aeration conditions. A new medium (called
   RLB) is the E. coli medium LB supplemented with MgCl2 and CaCl2, which
   was found to increase growth rates and final cell culture densities,
   with an increase of 30 \% of LH1 per cell detected in R. sphaeroides
   RCx(pIND4-RC1) grown in RLB versus LB medium. Furthermore, cell density
   was about three times greater in RLB compared to semi-aerobic
   conditions. The combination of all the modifications resulted in an
   increase of LH1 and RC per mL of culture volume by approximately
   35-fold, and a decrease in the length of culture incubation time from
   about 5 days to similar to 36 h.}},

Pages = {{308-321}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes an audio copy detection system that is robust to
   various attacks. These include the severe pitch shift and tempo change
   attacks which existing systems fail to detect. First, we propose a novel
   two dimensional representation for audio signals called the time-chroma
   image. This image is based on a modification of the concept of chroma in
   the music literature and is shown to achieve better performance in song
   identification. Then, we propose a novel fingerprinting algorithm that
   extracts local fingerprints from the time-chroma image. The proposed
   local fingerprinting algorithm is invariant to time/frequency scale
   changes in audio signals. It also outperforms existing methods like SIFT
   to a great extent. Finally, we introduce a song identification algorithm
   that uses the proposed fingerprints. The resulting copy detection system
   is shown to significantly outperform existing methods. Besides being
   able to detect whether a song (or a part of it) has been copied, the
   proposed system can accurately estimate the amount of pitch shift and/or
   tempo change that were applied to a song. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We grew TiO2-Al2O3 nanocomposite coatings on titanium substrates by
   electrophoretic enhanced microarc oxidation (EEMAO) technique under
   several voltages and established a correlation between microstructure,
   surface hardness, and corrosion resistance of the coatings in sulfuric
   acid and sodium chloride solutions. Structural analysis revealed that
   the coatings contained anatase, rutile, alumina, and tialite phases.
   Formation kinetics of tialite phase was studied. It was found that
   increasing the voltage gives rise to a coarser morphology, i.e., larger
   pore size, and incorporation of more alumina nanoparticles into the
   layers. It is shown that surface hardness of the titanium substrates
   increased by a factor of 4 following EEMAO treatment. Corrosion
   resistance of titanium was enhanced significantly. Resistance against
   pitting corrosion was improved as well. We proposed a formation
   mechanism for the TiO2-Al2O3 composite coatings at different voltages
   based on the chemical and electrochemical foundations.}},

Abstract = {{Relaying is one of the key techniques adopted by third-generation
   partnership project long-term evolution (LTE) advanced as part of 4G
   cellular technologies, aiming to increase coverage and capacity of
   networks especially for the edge nodes. The authors have considered the
   uplink scheduling of LTE networks with the help of positioned relay
   nodes which have fixed routing configuration. The entire problem is
   projected as a constrained convex optimisation formulation and for the
   solution purpose, subgradient method is adopted. Revealing the guiding
   principles of optimal solution, a few suboptimal scheduling algorithms
   are proposed to allocate resource blocks across all nodes with the help
   of existing work. Deploying a large number of relays may not be useful
   to basic user nodes, and hence, the proposed schemes are adaptive and
   have ability to distinguish useful relays from not-useful ones. In
   addition to system throughput maximisation, for ensuring fairness across
   user nodes, the authors have proposed scheduling techniques which are
   the outcome of Nash bargaining solution. Numerical calculations and
   results have been shown to justify that relay nodes can potentially
   improve system's performance at low load, whereas at high load they
   remain inactive because of their inability to contribute.}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Covering a building envelope with green walls is considered a
   sustainable construction practice. Green walls can be classified as
   green facades or living walls based on their purpose and
   characteristics. Living walls are built with different layers and
   variable planting styles depending on the geographic location, function,
   and weather conditions. This paper discusses a comparative lifecycle
   assessment (LCA) of three living wall systems: trellis system, planter
   box system, and felt layer system. Chemical emissions and energy
   consumption of the living wall materials are evaluated in the whole
   lifecycle, and compared with the chemical absorption and energy savings
   of operational living walls. The results demonstrated that the felt
   layer system is not environmentally sustainable in air cleaning and
   energy saving compared to the trellis system and modular panel system.
   The environmental performance of living walls is influenced by the types
   of materials and plants chosen for the systems, as well as the external
   factors, such as climate and building type. The LCA indicates the need
   of environmental friendly materials for sustainable living walls. (C)

Abstract = {{To better understand the influence of Fe-rich intermetallics on
   solidification defect formation, fast in situ synchrotron X-ray
   tomographic microscopy experiments were performed on a commercial A319
   alloy (Al-7.5Si-3.5Cu, wt.\%) with 0.2 and 0.6 wt.\% Fe. Real-time
   observations during solidification and semi-solid deformation
   experiments reveal that beta-intermetallics contribute via several
   different mechanisms to porosity formation and hot tearing
   susceptibility. While beta-intermetallics were not observed to nucleate
   porosity directly, they do block interdendritic channels, thereby
   reducing the shrinkage feeding, and increasing pore tortuosity. Pores
   also grow preferentially along the surface of the beta-intermetallics,
   suggesting that the beta-phase has a lower gas solid interfacial energy
   than alpha-Al, thus assisting in increasing pore volume. During uniaxial
   tension experiments, the ductile failure of the semi-solid,
   intermetallic-poor, base alloy transitions to a brittle-like failure
   when a large amount of beta-intermetallics are present. In all
   post-failure microstructures, internal damage was preferentially
   orientated perpendicular to the loading direction, agreeing with prior
   experimental and numerical studies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

   performance of limestones}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Two Greek limestones with different properties were tested to determine
   their CO2 and SO2 capture performance. The reversibility of the sorbents
   for CO2 capture was investigated by performing looping cycles in
   atmospheric and pressurized thermogravimetric reactors, with synthetic
   gas mixtures containing different partial pressures of CO2 and SO2 to
   simulate flue gases. The morphological and porosity characteristics of
   the original and spent sorbent were examined by Scanning Electron
   Microscopy and Pore Sized Distribution analyses.
   Increasing pressure from atmospheric to 10 bar led to deterioration in
   CO2 capture performance. Further pressure increment had negligible
   effect on the CO2 capture performance. SO2 retention, however, improved
   with increasing pressure. For calcium looping with repeated cycles,
   sorbents sulphated via the unreacted-core mode converted more available
   calcium, but this adversely affected the reversibility of cyclic CO2
   capture. The reversibility strongly deteriorated when higher total
   pressure was combined with increased SO2 partial pressure. The CO2
   uptake of an unreacted-core sulphated sorbent, previously used for SO2
   retention, was mainly affected, apart from pore blockage or sintering,
   by the occupation of calcium. Sulphation during simultaneous capture
   resulted in higher CO2 removal efficiency for uniformly and network
   sulphated particles compared to the sulphur capture via direct
   sulphation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption-enhanced steam reforming, assisted by membrane separation of
   H-2 in a fluidized bed reactor, is simulated numerically based on a
   kinetic two-phase model. A residence time distribution function method
   is implemented to account for CO2 capture in continuous operation. The
   effects of operating pressure, total gas feed rate, solid recycle rate,
   fresh sorbent feed rate, effective membrane area, and permeate pressure
   on the performance of a continuous fluidized bed reactor are
   investigated. A CH4 conversion of >91\% for operation at 0.6 MPa and 550
   degrees C is predicted to be possible with the assistance of the sorbent
   and membranes. The reforming performance is very sensitive to the
   effective surface area of membranes. A sorbent fraction of >0.7 (by
   mass) is necessary to achieve a product with H-2 selectivity of >98\%,
   free of CO and CO2, for realistic membrane effectiveness factors. Adding
   fresh sorbent or increasing the sorbent mass fraction improves the H-2
   productivity for a moderate solids recycling rate. Effective CO2 capture
   rate depends greatly on the sorbent feed rate.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical and mineral processing industries need a nonlinear process
   monitoring method to improve the stability and economy of their
   processes. Techniques that are currently available to these industries
   are often too computationally intensive for an industrial control
   system, or they are too complex to commission. In this paper, we propose
   using supervised locally linear embedding for projection (SLLEP) as a
   new nonlinear process monitoring technique to solve these issues. In
   addition, we suggest using a commonly available tool in modern
   industrial control systems, a model predictive control, to solve the
   quadratic program of SLLEP in real-time and with minimal effort to
   commission. As a case study, we demonstrate that process monitoring with
   SLLEP can detect and diagnose the early onset of a semiautogenous
   grinding (SAG) mill overload. A SAG mill overload is a highly nonlinear
   operating situation, and we show that principal component analysis, the
   best-in-class technique currently used by the industry for monitoring an
   overload, is unable to detect the early onset of an overload.}},

Abstract = {{Whey pretreatment for protein purification is one of the main
   applications of cross-flow microfiltration before an ultrafiltration
   process. In this paper, the effects of the operating pressure and
   cross-flow velocity on the membrane performance and the individual
   resistances in microfiltration of whey for both unsteady and
   steady-state conditions were investigated for two 0.45 m mean pore size
   polymeric membranes, Polyethersulfone (PES) and Polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF). A laboratory-scale microfiltration setup with a flat rectangular
   module was used. The Reynolds number and operating pressure showed
   positive and negative effects on the amount of all resistances,
   respectively. The dominant effect of the concentration polarization and
   cake resistances was demonstrated by using a ``Resistance-in-Series{''}
   model for unsteady-state investigations, which could vary during the
   filtration time. An empirical model revealed a linear relationship
   between the Reynolds number and permeate flux and a second-order
   polynomial relationship between the transmembrane pressure and the
   permeate flux. This empirical correlation, implemented for the limited
   range of MF operating parameters tested in this article for whey
   protein, was validated with experimental data and showed good agreement
   between calculated and experimental data.}},

   N-carboxyethyl chitosanand the aldehyde groups of oxidized dextran
   undergo a cross-linking process via imine formation.In order to produce
   spherical microgels, a water-in-oil emulsion was employed in a
   microfluidic flow-focusing device for microdroplet
   generation.N-carboxyethyl chitosan(3wt\%) and oxidized dextran(3wt\%) in
   microdropletswere homogenously mixedby diffusion, resulting in
   insitucross-linking oftwo hydrogels without the use of additional
   chemicals.The average value of the Young's modulus of the cross-linked
   microgel was 1.34 +/- 0.21 kPa. For cell applications, the viability of
   3T3 cells encapsulated in the microgels was evaluated after0, 3, and 4
   days using a live/dead assay. The results demonstrated that the
   viability was well maintained at around 80\% in the culture afterfour

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feasibility study of a model-based approach to
   noninvasive and subject-specific monitoring of autonomic-cardiac
   regulation. The proposed approach is built upon individualizing a
   physiologically-based model by applying a parameter estimation method to
   routine clinical observations, thereby assuring physical transparency,
   computational efficiency, and clinical adaptability. To develop an
   efficient parameter estimation procedure, a parametric sensitivity
   analysis was performed on the autonomic-cardiac regulation model to
   identify high-sensitivity model parameters whose changes exert
   significant impacts on the system outputs. Then, a parameter estimation
   problem formulated as a nonlinear optimization was solved to estimate
   high-sensitivity model parameters associated with autonomic-cardiac
   regulation, whereas the remaining parameters were fixed at their nominal
   values. The proposed approach can potentially monitor temporal changes
   in autonomic-cardiac regulation by identifying time-varying changes in
   the autonomic-cardiac model parameters, including sympathetic and
   parasympathetic nerve activities on the heart (modulating heart rate),
   and sympathetic nerve activity on the arterial tree (modulating total
   peripheral resistance). The proof-of-concept for the proposed approach
   was tested using a number of experimental data from the MIMIC database
   and the orthostatic hypotension tests. Our finding shows that the
   proposed approach is able to provide low-variance estimates of the
   autonomic-cardiac model parameters, which are consistent with their
   anticipated behaviors inferred from the physiologic knowledge. An
   extensive comparison study must be conducted in the future to establish
   the clinical validity of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes available literature on the optimization of
   reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The objective of optimization (e. g.
   minimum cost or weight), the design variables and the constraints
   considered by different studies vary widely and therefore, different
   optimization methods have been employed to provide the optimal design of
   RC beams, whether as isolated structural components or as part of a
   structural frame. The review of literature suggests that nonlinear
   deterministic approaches can be efficiently employed to provide optimal
   design of RC beams, given the small number of variables. This paper also
   presents spreadsheet implementation of cost optimization of RC beams in
   the familiar MS Excel environment to illustrate the efficiency of the
   exhaustive enumeration method for such small discrete search spaces and
   to promote its use by engineers and researchers. Furthermore, a
   sensitivity analysis is performed on the contribution of various design
   parameters to the variability of the overall cost of RC beams.}},

   determined using an isothermal calorimetry technique in conjunction with
   hardness and mechanical property measurements. Two other Al-Si-Mg model
   alloy compositions were used to study the effects of alloy chemistry on
   microstructure response during heat treatment. The overall aim of the

Abstract = {{When a given fluid displaces another less viscous miscible one in a
   horizontal Hele-Shaw cell, the displacement is stable from the viscous
   point of view. Nevertheless, thin stripes perpendicular to the moving
   interface can be observed in the mixing zone between the fluids both in
   rectilinear and radial displacements. This instability is due to
   buoyancy effects within the gap of the cell which develop because of an
   unstable density stratification associated with the underlying
   concentration profile. To characterize this buoyancy-driven instability
   and the related striped pattern, we perform a parametric experimental
   study of viscously stable miscible displacements in a horizontal
   Hele-Shaw cell with radial injection. We analyze the influence of the
   flow rate, the thickness of the gap, and the relative physical fluid
   properties on the development and characteristics of the instability.

Abstract = {{A nonlinear extended finite element (XFEM) modeling framework under a
   stochastic cohesive zone is presented for realistic prediction of
   delamination in polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)/glass composites in mode I
   of fracture. The cohesive zone model adopts damage evolution of the
   material based on a bilinear traction-separation law, the critical
   energy release rate and the J-integral method to formulate the
   delamination interface under stochastic fracture properties. To
   demonstrate the application of the approach, numerical predictions are
   compared to experimental data using Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) tests.
   In particular, it is shown how the XFEM model can be used to capture
   test non-repeatability due to uncertain fracture properties, which is
   often the case during the characterization of composites using standard
   fracture tests.}},

Abstract = {{In this brief, a low-power high-resolution readout front end intended
   for capacitive sensors is presented, in which the circuit uses
   correlated-level-shifting (CLS) and chopper-stabilization (CS)

   that is used to reduce errors from finite operational amplifier (op-amp)
   gain, whereas CS is a classic technique that is used to reduce the
   adverse effects of dc offset and low-frequency noise associated with the
   op-amp. In this brief, the capacitive sensor is physically emulated by a
   pair of on-chip differential variable capacitors that are in the
   femtofarad range. The proposed front end is designed in a 0.8-mu m CMOS
   technology and consumes 290 mu W from a single 5-V supply. The readout

Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems can
   achieve higher throughput through interference alignment. For a small
   number of users, determining the maximum possible degrees of freedom as
   well as the feasibility of interference alignment in MIMO systems is
   well studied. However, the issues of scheduling in systems employing
   interference alignment and serving a large number of users have received
   little attention so far. In this paper, we study the problem of joint
   scheduling, interference alignment, and packet admission control in MIMO
   wireless systems with the goal of maximizing system throughput subject
   to stability constraints. We formulate a stochastic network optimization
   problem and propose a scheduling and interference alignment (SIA)
   algorithm. In each time slot, SIA schedules some users among many
   competing ones to transmit data, and determines encoding and decoding
   matrices for the selected users. Packet admission control is performed
   in each time slot. In addition, we propose a heuristic semi-distributed
   algorithm (SDSIA), which has a lower computational complexity than the
   SIA algorithm. Via simulation, we evaluate the performance of SIA and
   SDSIA for different algorithm parameters and different numbers of users.
   We also compare the performance of SDSIA with other approaches which do
   not simultaneously exploit interference}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the application of bit-interleaved coded
   modulation (BICM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   to reap the benefits of wireless multiuser network coding in practical
   frequency-selective fading channels. We propose a mapping based symbol
   level network coding (SLNC) scheme for a cooperative diversity system
   comprising multiple sources, multiple relays, and one common
   destination. A simple cooperative maximum-ratio combining scheme is used
   at the destination and is shown to successfully exploit both the full
   spatial and the full frequency diversity offered by the channel for
   arbitrary numbers of sources, arbitrary numbers of relays, and arbitrary
   linear modulation schemes. To gain analytical insight for system design,
   we derive a closed-form upper bound for the asymptotic worst-case
   pairwise error probability (PEP) and obtain the diversity gain of the
   considered SLNC scheme for BICM-OFDM systems. These analytical results
   reveal the influence of the various system parameters, such as the
   number of sources, the free distance of the code, and the frequency
   diversity of the involved links, on performance. Furthermore, we propose
   two different relay selection schemes for the considered system: a) bulk
   selection, i.e., a single best relay is selected to transmit on all
   sub-carriers, and b) per-subcarrier selection, where a best relay is
   selected on each sub-carrier. Last but not least, we exploit the derived
   PEP expression for selecting a subset of sources from the set of active
   sources when the number of active sources is larger than the number of
   available orthogonal relay channels. We study the achievable diversity
   gain for the proposed relay and source subset selection schemes.
   Numerical results corroborate the derived diversity gain expressions and
   confirm the performance gains.}},

Abstract = {{In most cases, fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) contains only one type of

   has the potential to improve the mechanical properties of concrete, and

   reinforced concrete mixes and two-fiber reinforced hybrid composite
   mixes were cast using diverse fiber combinations. Two types of

   and direct shear tests were performed and the results were analyzed to
   identify synergy, if any, associated with various fiber combinations.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an on-line adaptive metric to estimate the
   similarity between the target representation model and new image
   received at every time instant. The similarity measure, also known as
   observation likelihood, plays a crucial role in the accuracy and
   robustness of visual tracking. In this work, an L2-norm is adaptively
   weighted at every matching step to calculate the similarity between the
   target model and image descriptors. A histogram-based classifier is
   learned on-line to categorize the matching errors into three classes
   namely i) image noise, ii) significant appearance changes, and iii)
   outliers. A robust weight is assigned to each matching error based on
   the class label. Therefore, the proposed similarity measure is able to
   reject outliers and adapt to the target model by discriminating the
   appearance changes from the undesired outliers. The experimental results
   show the superiority of the proposed method with respect to accuracy and
   robustness in the presence of severe and long-term occlusion and image
   noise in comparison with commonly used robust regressors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Architectural features and other irregularities in the gravity system
   which apply gravity-induced lateral demands to the seismic force
   resisting system are being incorporated in new buildings. These
   gravity-induced demands have raised concerns due to the perceived
   potential for a ratcheting effect to occur during seismic loading. This
   paper summarizes the results of a study to identify if there are
   behavioral trends not recognized within the scope of current building
   codes. To this end, a nonlinear, parametric study was conducted in
   OpenSees to investigate the inelastic response of concrete shear wall
   buildings with a range of design characteristics, including
   gravity-induced lateral demands. The results demonstrated that a seismic
   ratcheting effect can develop and amplify inelastic displacement
   demands. The effect is significantly more prevalent in coupled shear
   walls compared with cantilevered shear walls. An irregularity class to
   address buildings with gravity-induced lateral demands on the seismic
   force resisting system is proposed for the 2015 National Building Code
   of Canada.}},

Abstract = {{The unstable network connectivity is the bottleneck of providing Gaming
   as a service (GaaS) for mobile devices. Therefore, the most critical
   technical challenge is to compress and transmit the real-time gaming
   video, so that during the gaming session, the expected server
   transmission rate over the bandwidth-limited mobile network can be
   minimized, while satisfying the quality of experience for the players.
   Inspired by the idea of peer-to-peer sharing between multiple players,
   we propose a cloudlet-assisted multiplayer cloud gaming system, in which
   the mobile devices are connected to the cloud server for real-time
   interactive game videos, while sharing the received video frames with
   their peers via an ad hoc cloudlet. Experimental results show that
   expected server transmission rate can be significantly reduced compared
   to the conventional video encoding schemes for cloud games.}},

Title = {{Validation of an MRI-Based Method to Assess Patellofemoral Joint Contact
   Areas in Loaded Knee Flexion In Vivo}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop and validate short axial and sagittal MRI scans
   (<1min) to assess in vivo patellofemoral contact areas in loaded knee
   flexion.
   Materials and MethodsContact area was assessed in four cadaver knee
   specimens from axial and sagittal scans using two contact area
   extraction techniques (delineation and intersection) and three
   calculation techniques (slice thickness multiplication, linear
   interpolation, and spline interpolation). Error was expressed as the
   mean absolute and percentage difference from a dye staining-based
   reference standard. Intrareader and intrasubject repeatability,
   expressed as the mean standard deviation, was determined.
   ResultsContact area assessments from the sagittal MRI scans using the
   delineation and slice thickness multiplication technique had the
   smallest error (47.7 38.1 mm(2) or 10.7\%). The intrareader
   repeatability from assessments using the sagittal scans was smaller than
   those using the axial scans when the delineation method was used (<9.4
   +/- 4.3 mm(2) and <15.4 +/- 14.1 mm(2), respectively). The intrasubject
   repeatability of the assessment from the sagittal scan was less than
   39.9 +/- 23.0 mm(2).
   ConclusionThis protocol yields assessments of contact area in less than
   1 minute that have errors similar to those made using scans many times
   longer and can be used in series with kinematic scans to carry out
   simultaneous assessments in vivo to study patellofemoral joint disease.

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{As integrated circuits encapsulate more functionality and complexity,
   verifying that these devices operate correctly under all scenarios is an
   increasingly difficult task. Rather than using traditional verification
   techniques such as software simulation, more and more designers are
   taking advantage of the significantly higher clock speeds that can be
   achieved by using field-programmable gate-array (FPGA)-based prototypes.
   A key challenge to these prototypes is the lack of on-chip observability
   during debugging; one popular solution is to insert trace-buffers into
   the design to record a limited set of internal signals, but modifying
   this trace configuration often requires the entire circuit to be
   recompiled. In this paper, we propose that the original circuit mapping
   is fully preserved and incremental techniques are used to eliminate the
   need for a full recompilation, thereby accelerating the debugging
   process. By exploiting two opportunities available during
   trace-insertion: the ability to connect from any point of a signal to
   any trace-pin, and the internal symmetry of the FPGA architecture, we
   find that incremental trace-insertion can be 98 times faster than a full
   recompilation, return a routing solution with a shorter wirelength, and
   have a negligible effect on the critical-path delay of the original
   circuit when reclaiming 75\% of the leftover memory capacity for
   tracing.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability assessment of water supply systems (WSSs) is an important
   aspect of WSS planning and operations. Traditionally, WSS reliability
   involves the comparison of hydraulics (e.g.,pressure or available water
   volume) and water quality (e.g.,residual chlorine) parameters with their
   desired minimum level of service under various emergency loading
   conditions. To compute hydraulic dependent parameters (e.g.,pressures,
   flow), different algorithms solve continuity and energy equations
   expressed in terms of certain independent parameters (e.g.,roughness
   parameters and nodal demands) with certainty. Similarly, transport
   equations expressed in terms of different quality parameters are solved
   deterministically to compute water quality dependent parameters
   (e.g.,residual chlorine). However, it is extremely challenging, even
   impossible, to estimate network-independent parameters with certainty.
   Therefore, estimated dependent parameters based on semiquantitative
   information bear uncertainty, which leads to a question of how reliable
   current reliability assessment results are. To address this issue, this
   paper proposes a new means of reliability assessment in which the
   reliability of a WSS is expressed in terms of utility and associated
   beliefs. The methodology developed provides an estimate of the
   uncertainties inherent in traditional reliability assessment results. It
   is expected that the proposed methodology will help municipalities to
   make informed decisions in order to increase the safety and security of
   public health.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional steel-based rubber bearings are being replaced by fiber
   reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREI) due to their high weight and
   manufacturing cost. Compared to existing rubber bearings, FREIs have
   superior performance and as a result can control the seismic response of
   structures more efficiently. This study aims to simulate the performance
   of rectangular carbon FREIs (C-FREIs) produced through a simple and
   cost-effective manufacturing process. Additionally, the effect of
   different factors including the number and the thickness of rubber
   layers, as well as the thickness of carbon fiber reinforced sheets are
   investigated on the performance of C-FREIs through sensitivity analyses
   based on the results obtained from finite element simulations. The
   results show that by increasing the number and thickness of rubber
   layers, the efficiency of C-FREIs degrades in terms of vertical strength
   and damping capacity, however, the performance improves in terms of
   lateral flexibility. Another important observation is that the
   increasing thickness of fiber-reinforced layers can increase the
   vertical rigidity of the base isolator. The vertical stiffness has the
   most sensitivity to the thickness of elastomeric layers and the
   thickness of CFR sheets while, when the number of rubber layers
   increases, the effective lateral stiffness is mostly affected.}},

Title = {{SimITK: Visual Programming of the ITK Image-Processing Library within

Abstract = {{The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) is a software
   library used for image analysis, visualization, and image-guided surgery
   applications. ITK is a collection of C++ classes that poses the
   challenge of a steep learning curve should the user not have appropriate
   C++ programming experience. To remove the programming complexities and
   facilitate rapid prototyping, an implementation of ITK within a
   higher-level visual programming environment is presented: SimITK. ITK
   functionalities are automatically wrapped into ``blocks{''} within
   Simulink, the visual programming environment of MATLAB, where these
   blocks can be connected to form workflows: visual schematics that
   closely represent the structure of a C++ program. The heavily templated
   C++ nature of ITK does not facilitate direct interaction between
   Simulink and ITK; an intermediary is required to convert respective data
   types and allow intercommunication. As such, a SimITK ``Virtual
   Block{''} has been developed that serves as a wrapper around an ITK
   class which is capable of resolving the ITK data types to native
   Simulink data types. Part of the challenge surrounding this
   implementation involves automatically capturing and storing the
   pertinent class information that need to be refined from an initial
   state prior to being reflected within the final block representation.
   The primary result from the SimITK wrapping procedure is multiple
   Simulink block libraries. From these libraries, blocks are selected and
   interconnected to demonstrate two examples: a 3D segmentation workflow
   and a 3D multimodal registration workflow. Compared to their pure-code
   equivalents, the workflows highlight ITK usability through an
   alternative visual interpretation of the code that abstracts away
   potentially confusing technicalities.}},

   Flanges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The experimental in-plane force-displacement response of unreinforced
   masonry (URM) walls with flanges (return walls) subjected to
   pseudo-static cyclic lateral loading is presented. Each wall failed in a
   diagonal tension mode followed by bed-joint sliding. The effect of wall
   flanges was an increase in the displacement capacity of the in-plane
   loaded wall, in comparison with an in-plane loaded wall without flanges.
   The measured shear strengths of the walls were compared with an
   analytical model for determining the limiting diagonal tension strength
   of the walls, with a high level of correlation. The initial stiffness of
   the shear walls before the effective yield was compared with the initial
   stiffness as determined using conventional principles of mechanics for
   homogeneous materials, and it was found that with some approximations
   the initial stiffness could be satisfactorily determined. Because the
   bed-joint sliding failure mechanism exhibited by the walls is a
   deformation-controlled action, there is further displacement capacity
   beyond the effective yield displacement, and it was found that the walls
   could sustain in-plane lateral forces to a drift of at least 0.7\%.
   Recommendations are provided for a general force-displacement
   relationship, which is consistent with the experimental data and can be
   used for modeling URM walls and improving acceptance criteria, such as
   those specified in ASCE/SEI 41-06.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Soft piezoelectric actuators are extensively used in micro- and
   nanopositioning applications. Traditional sensorless position control
   approaches use a hysteresis mapping between voltage and position in a
   voltage feedforward control scheme in order to compensate for hysteresis
   errors. However, several factors such as frequency, temperature, and
   aging influence this mapping. Recently, charge control for positioning
   is also attracting interest among researchers due to the linear
   relationship between position and charge. However, a sophisticated
   hardware design is required to minimize charge drift. In this study, a
   new sensorless position control technique is proposed which requires
   neither an accurate inverse mapping nor a sophisticated charge amplifier
   in order to compensate for hysteresis. A constitutive relationship is
   employed to infer position from charge measurement through current
   integration. To eliminate drift from the charge-based measurement, an
   observer is presented in this study which uses a second self-sensing
   position estimate that is based on the variation of effective
   piezoelectric capacitance with stroke. The proposed observer is tested
   as a position feedback sensor inside a simple integrating control loop
   and applied to step profiles of variable stroke and sinusoidal profiles
   of constant and mixed frequencies. The responses are compared with a
   laser interferometer and the maximum observer error between the laser
   and the observer is 0.89 mu m (<3\% of the maximum stroke) over a
   frequency range of 10 to 100 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Alginate nanofibers have been attractive for potential tissue
   regeneration applications due to a combination of their moisture
   retention ability and large surface area available in a nonwoven
   nanofiber form. This study aims to address several challenges in
   alginate nanofiber application, including the lack of structural
   stability in aqueous environment and limited cell attachment as compared
   to commercial wound dressings, via examining crosslinking techniques. In
   addition to the commonly performed divalent ion crosslinking, a
   glutaraldehyde double-crosslinking step and polylysine addition were
   applied to an electrospun alginate nanofiber nonwoven mat. With
   optimization of the electrospinning solution, nanofiber morphology was
   maintained after the two-stage crosslinking process. Extensibility of
   the nanofiber mat reduced after the crosslinking process. However, both
   aqueous stability and cell attachment improved after the postspinning
   modifications, as shown through degradation tests in phosphate buffered
   saline solutions and fibroblast cell culture studies, respectively. (c)

Abstract = {{Background: The objective of this analysis was to systematically review
   the evidence for virtual reality (VR) therapy in an adult post-stroke
   population in both custom built virtual environments (VE) and
   commercially available gaming systems (CG).
   Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PSYCInfo, DARE, PEDro, Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of
   Systematic Reviews were systematically searched from the earliest
   available date until April 4, 2013. Controlled trials that compared VR
   to conventional therapy were included. Population criteria included
   adults (>18) post-stroke, excluding children, cerebral palsy, and other
   neurological disorders. Included studies were reported in English.
   Quality of studies was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database
   Scale (PEDro).
   Results: Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. For body
   function outcomes, there was a significant benefit of VR therapy
   compared to conventional therapy controls, G = 0.48, 95\% CI = {[} 0.27,
   0.70], and no significant difference between VE and CG interventions (P
   = 0.38). For activity outcomes, there was a significant benefit of VR
   therapy, G = 0.58, 95\% CI = {[} 0.32, 0.85], and no significant
   difference between VE and CG interventions (P = 0.66). For participation
   outcomes, the overall effect size was G = 0.56, 95\% CI = {[} 0.02,
   1.10]. All participation outcomes came from VE studies.
   Discussion: VR rehabilitation moderately improves outcomes compared to
   conventional therapy in adults post-stroke. Current CG interventions
   have been too few and too small to assess potential benefits of CG.
   Future research in this area should aim to clearly define conventional
   therapy, report on participation measures, consider motivational
   components of therapy, and investigate commercially available systems in
   larger RCTs.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) thermodynamic model is proposed to predict the

   surfaces with desired and/or optimum wetting characteristics. The
   analysis of the various surfaces reveals the important geometrical

Abstract = {{A flexible and comprehensive model for predicting and optimizing
   separations of racemates of amino acids and other chiral metabolites in
   liquid-liquid multi-staged extraction systems is presented. Enantiomer
   partition coefficients are computed along the extraction path using
   multiple chemical equilibria theory and measured equilibrium formation
   constants for every complex formed in the two phases. The large number
   of speciation reactions typically occurring in ligand-exchange
   extraction systems requires the development of a robust numerical
   algorithm, and we present a method to rapidly and accurately solve the
   large nonlinear set of governing equations. Model performance is
   assessed through comparison to data for continuous extraction of various
   racemates within a series of hollow-fiber membrane modules. For each
   extraction, a chiral-ligand exchange selector molecule is solubilized in
   the organic phase flowing countercurrent to the aqueous phase into which
   the racemate is loaded. Enantiomer eluent profiles predicted at
   different conditions are in very good agreement with experiment. Through
   its predictive power, the model provides a useful in silicoplatform for
   optimizing these complex separations, and model results demonstrating
   this capability are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Current neck injury criteria do not include limits for lateral bending
   combined with axial compression and this has been observed as a
   clinically relevant mechanism, particularly for rollover motor vehicle
   crashes. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the
   effects of lateral eccentricity (the perpendicular distance from the
   axial force to the centre of the spine) on peak loads, kinematics, and
   spinal canal occlusions of subaxial cervical spine specimens tested in
   dynamic axial compression (0.5 m/s). Twelve 3-vertebra human cadaver
   cervical spine specimens were tested in two groups: low and high
   eccentricity with initial eccentricities of 1 and 150\% of the lateral
   diameter of the vertebral body. Six-axis loads inferior to the specimen,
   kinematics of the superior-most vertebra, and spinal canal occlusions
   were measured. High speed video was collected and acoustic emission (AE)
   sensors were used to define the time of injury. The effects of
   eccentricity on peak loads, kinematics, and canal occlusions were
   evaluated using unpaired Student t-tests. The high eccentricity group
   had lower peak axial forces (1544 +/- 629 vs. 4296 +/- 1693 N), inferior
   displacements (0.2 +/- 1.0 vs. 6.6 +/- 2.0 mm), and canal occlusions (27
   +/- 5 vs. 53 +/- 15\%) and higher peak ipsilateral bending moments (53
   +/- 17 vs. 3 +/- 18 Nm), ipsilateral bending rotations (22 +/- 3 vs. 1
   +/- 2 degrees), and ipsilateral displacements (4.5 +/- 1.4 vs. -1.0 +/-
   1.3 mm, p < 0.05 for all comparisons). These results provide new
   insights to develop prevention, recognition, and treatment strategies
   for compressive cervical spine injuries with lateral eccentricities. (C)

Abstract = {{Non-precious metal bifunctional oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution
   reaction (ORR and OER, respectively) catalysts are of great interest for
   rechargeable metal/air batteries and regenerative alkaline fuel cells.
   We investigate the initial stage activities and the electrocatalytic
   durability of bifunctional catalysts composed of MnO2 and perovskite
   (LaNiO3 or LaCoO3) in a 1:1 weight ratio. Gas diffusion electrodes (GDE)
   with a catalyst layer composed of MnO2:co-catalyst (LaNiO3 or
   LaCoO3):Vulcan XC-72 were prepared and studied in O-2 saturated 6 M KOH.
   The initial stage bifunctional activities of MnO2-LaCoO3 and MnO2-LaNiO3
   are markedly superior compared to either MnO2 or perovskite alone,
   demonstrating a synergistic effect. Furthermore, we show for the first
   time that the degradation of the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity
   of the MnO2-perovskite electrodes during extensive potential cycling can
   be fully restored by resting the electrodes at open-circuit potential in
   6 M KOH. A hypothesis is proposed to explain this catalytic promotion
   and `healing' effect based on XPS results showing potassium ion
   incorporation in the electrocatalyst structure. Lastly, a thorough
   comparison of the results obtained in the present work with those
   reported in the literature with a variety of bifunctional catalysts is
   presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MnO2-perovskite
   electrodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-solid fluidized-bed reactors are complex systems that involve
   multiple interrelated phenomena. One key phenomenon that affects reactor
   performance is the change in gas volumetric flow. The volumetric flow in
   a fluidized-bed reactor can change with height due to reaction, feed
   distribution, change of phase, selective removal/addition of species and
   changes in temperature and pressure. This paper presents results from an
   experimental program and gives a qualitative comparison with modeling
   results obtained with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A
   high-pressure two-dimensional column was used to investigate the effects
   of sudden increase/decrease in pressure on fluidization behavior by
   recording multiple bubble properties using high-speed video recording. A
   CFD model was developed to investigate the same variations in process
   conditions. Changing the volumetric flow can radically alter the bed
   hydrodynamics. The CFD code is able to predict the experimental trends
   correctly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{In sustainable urban planning, non-motorised active modes of travel such
   as walking are identified as a leading driver for a healthy, liveable
   and resource-efficient environment. To encourage walking, there is a
   need for a solid understanding of pedestrian walking behaviour. This
   understanding is central to the evaluation of measures of walking
   conditions such as comfortability and efficiency. The main purpose of
   this study is to gain an in-depth understanding of pedestrian walking
   behaviour through the investigation of the spatio-temporal gait
   parameters (step length and step frequency). This microscopic-level
   analysis provides insight into the pedestrian walking mechanisms and the
   effect of various attributes such as gender and age. This analysis
   relies on automated video-based data collection using computer vision
   techniques. The step frequency and step length are estimated based on
   oscillatory patterns in the walking speed profile. The study uses
   real-world video data collected in downtown Vancouver, BC. The results
   show that the gait parameters are influenced by factors such as
   crosswalk grade, pedestrian gender, age and group size. The step length
   was found to generally have more influence on walking speed than step
   frequency. It was also found that, compared to males, females increase
   their step frequency to increase their walking speed.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study has been carried out to numerically investigate
   the performance of a three column bridge bent retrofitted with different
   options. The bridge bent represents a typical case of vulnerable bridges
   since it was built in the early sixties with minimal seismic design
   requirements. This study evaluates four different retrofitting
   provisions, namely carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) jacketing,
   steel jacketing, concrete jacketing, and engineered cementitious
   composite (ECC) jacketing for improving the seismic performance of this
   non-seismically designed bridge bent. Finite element methods have been
   implemented in this study where each retrofitting technique has been
   modeled and numerically validated with the experimental results.
   Analytical models of those retrofitted bridge bents have been developed
   using finite element analysis tools and verified against experimental
   results. Nonlinear static pushover analyses have been performed to
   compare their performances in terms of performance criteria such as the
   displacement and base shear at cracking, yielding, and crushing.
   Incremental dynamic time history analyses have been performed to assess
   the dynamic behavior of the retrofitted bents and to generate required
   data for performance-based evaluations. The performance-based assessment
   study employed 20 near fault ground motions to compare the performance
   of these retrofitting strategies in terms of maximum drift (\%),
   residual drift, and ductility demand. The results indicated that both
   the CFRP and ECC jacketing were effective in reducing the anticipated
   damage of the retrofitted bridge bent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Evoked hemodynamic response estimation using ensemble empirical mode
   decomposition based adaptive algorithm applied to dual channel
   functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{13-25}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The quality of the functional near infrared spectroscopy
   (fNIRS) recordings is highly degraded by the presence of physiological
   interferences. It is crucial to efficiently separate the evoked
   responses (EHRs) from other background hemodynamic activities prior to
   any further processing.
   New method: This paper presents a novel algorithm for physiological
   interferences reduction from the dual channel fNIRS measurements using
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) technique. The proposed
   algorithm is comprised of two main steps: (1) decomposing reference
   signal into its constituents called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and
   (2) adaptively defining appropriate weights the corresponding IMFs to
   estimate the proportion of physiological interference in standard
   channel measurement.
   Results: Performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using both
   synthetic and semi-real brain hemodynamic data based on four parameters
   of relative mean squared error (rMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient
   (R-2), percentage estimation error of peak amplitude (E-PA) and peak
   latency (E-L).
   Comparison with existing methods: Results obtained from synthetic data
   revealed that both, the EEMD based normalized least mean squares
   (EEMD-NLMS) and EEMD based recursive least squares (EEMD-RLS) methods
   could reduce the average rMSE by at least 34\% and 49\%, respectively,
   when compared with widely used methods: block averaging, band-pass
   filtering and principal and/or independent analysis. Furthermore, the
   two proposed methods outperform the regression method in reducing rMSE
   by at least 21\% and 35\% respectively when applied to semi-real data.
   Conclusions: An effective algorithm for estimating the EHRs from raw
   fNIRS data was proposed in which no assumption about the amplitude,
   shape and duration of the responses is considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Modeling phosphorus removal and recovery from anaerobic digester
   supernatant through struvite crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The cost associated with the disposal of phosphate-rich sludge, the
   stringent regulations to limit phosphate discharge into aquatic
   environments, and resource shortages resulting from limited phosphorus
   rock reserves, have diverted attention to phosphorus recovery in the
   form of struvite (MAP: MgNH(4)PO(4 center dot)6H(2)O) crystals, which
   can essentially be used as a slow release fertilizer. Fluidized-bed
   crystallization is one of the most efficient unit processes used in
   struvite crystallization from wastewater. In this study, a comprehensive
   mathematical model, incorporating solution thermodynamics, struvite
   precipitation kinetics and reactor hydrodynamics, was developed to
   illustrate phosphorus depletion through struvite crystal growth in a
   continuous, fluidized-bed crystallizer. A thermodynamic equilibrium
   model for struvite precipitation was linked to the fluidized-bed reactor
   model. While the equilibrium model provided information on
   supersaturation generation, the reactor model captured the dynamic
   behavior of the crystal growth processes, as well as the effect of the
   reactor hydrodynamics on the overall process performance. The model was
   then used for performance evaluation of the reactor, in terms of removal
   efficiencies of struvite constituent species (Mg, NH4 and PO4), and the
   average product crystal sizes. The model also determined the variation
   of species concentration of struvite within the crystal bed height. The
   species concentrations at two extreme ends (inlet and outlet) were used
   to evaluate the reactor performance. The model predictions provided a
   reasonably good fit with the experimental results for PO4-P, NH4-N and
   Mg removals. Predicated average crystal sizes also matched fairly well
   with the experimental observations. Therefore, this model can be used as
   a tool for performance evaluation and process optimization of struvite
   crystallization in a fluidized-bed reactor. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Substitutional alloying elements significantly affect the

   We find a strong solute-grain boundary interaction for Nb, Mo, and Ti

   these alloying elements on delaying recrystallization and the
   austenite-to-ferrite transformation in low-carbon steels. In addition,
   we compute the solute-solute interactions as a function of solute pair
   distance in the grain boundary, which suggest co-segregation for these

   Triaxial Testing}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Bender element testing is used to measure shear wave velocities (V-S)
   across soil specimens in the laboratory. Conventional bender element
   testing is carried out at a few discrete points during an experiment.
   This paper presents a method which uses bender elements to monitor V-S
   continuously throughout a triaxial test. The method is based on
   monitoring the change in phase angle between a continuous trigger signal
   and a received signal. It allows the phase velocity at multiple selected
   frequencies to be monitored throughout a test. The method is described
   in detail and its use is illustrated for triaxial tests on loose
   specimens of Fraser River sand prepared by water pluviation. The
   variation of shear wave velocity is demonstrated during consolidation,
   ageing, and shearing to failure along a conventional stress path.
   Potential difficulties of interpretation are presented and discussed. In
   addition, the potential for continuous excitation of the specimen to
   alter the test results is considered and dismissed based on a comparison
   of samples tested without benders and with continuous benders at a range
   of excitation voltages. The proposed method for continuously monitoring
   bender element shear wave velocities does not use special or unique
   equipment. It results in a continuous V-S from a trigger and receiver
   element installed on opposite ends of a triaxial specimen. This method
   provides a measure of V-S during dynamic phases of an experiment that
   have not previously been observed. For example, this paper includes
   measures of V-S at the onset of creep, the onset of shearing, and over
   the phase transformation from contractive to dilative behaviour. The
   relationship between fundamental soil behaviour and V-S can now be more
   easily explored.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling of reactions in catalytic membrane reactors provides a route to
   process intensification. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and
   hydrogenation of nitrobenzene form a promising pair of processes to be
   coupled in a membrane reactor. The heat released from the hydrogenation
   side is utilized to break the endothermality on the dehydrogenation
   side, while hydrogen produced on the dehydrogenation side permeates
   through the hydrogen-selective membranes, enhances the equilibrium
   conversion of ethylbenzene and reacts with nitrobenzene on the permeate
   side to produce aniline. Mathematical reactor models are excellent tools
   to evaluate the extent of improvement before experiments are set up.
   However, a careful selection of phenomena considered by the reactor
   model is needed in order to obtain accurate model predictions.
   To investigate the effect of the intraparticle resistances on the
   performance of the cocurrent configuration of the coupling reactor, a
   heterogeneous fixed bed reactor model is developed with Fickian
   diffusion inside the catalyst pellets. For the condition of interest,
   the styrene yield is found to be 82\% by the homogenous model, 73\% by
   the heterogeneous model for isothermal pellets, and 69\% by the
   heterogeneous model with non-isothermal pellets. Hence, the homogeneous
   model overestimates the yield by 5-15\% of their actual values. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The identification of high fidelity models is a critical element in the
   implementation of high performance model predictive control (MPC)
   applications in the industry. These controllers can vary in size with
   input-ouput dimensions ranging from 5 Chi 10 to 50 Chi 100. Identifying
   models of this scale accurately is a time consuming and demanding
   exercise. We present a novel approach wherein an information rich test
   signal is generated in closed loop by maximizing the MPC objective, as
   opposed to minimization that is done in the standard controller. We show
   that the proposed input design approach is similar to T-optimal (trace
   optimal) experiment design method. Our approach automatically accounts
   for the input and output constraints and is implemented in a moving
   horizon manner. It is demonstrated through simulation examples on both
   well and ill-conditioned processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Curling of concrete remains a major concern in flatwork and its
   mitigation is critical for crack control, durability, and mechanical

   means of strain gauges placed along the length and breadth of the slab.
   In addition to the reference plain concrete mix, three fiber reinforced
   mixes were cast with cellulose microfibers incorporated at a volume
   fraction up to 0.3\%. The results show that plain concrete will crack
   and thereby ease the amount of curl whereas the addition of fibers at
   low dosage rates (<=0.2 \%) leads to crack control and consequently, a
   visible increase in curling. However, at 0.3 \% volume fraction,
   cellulose fibers were able to arrest cracking and also reduce the curl
   with respect to the reference plain mix.}},

Abstract = {{The work hardening behavior and deformed microstructure of the Cu-Ni-Si
   alloy aged at 723 K for various times and then deformed at 293 and 77 K
   were extensively investigated. The precipitate microstructure was also
   observed using transmission electron microscopy after aging treatment at
   723 K for 0.30, 3.6, 64.8 and 345.6 ks. Deformation twins were clearly
   observed by transmission electron microscopy in the under-aged specimen
   deformed by 10\% in tension at 293 K, in accordance with the enhanced
   work hardening rate observed during tensile deformation. The thickness
   of the deformation twins observed was approximately 1-40 nm. In
   addition, a significant fraction of larger deformation twins were
   observed by EBSD on the surface of the under-aged and peak-aged
   specimens tested at 77 K, for which the stress strain behavior exhibited
   a nearly constant work hardening rate, i.e., high tensile strength and
   high elongation. These results show that the deformation twins formed
   during tensile deformation at 293 K contribute to strengthening of the
   specimen as new obstacles to the dislocation slip. Moreover, the
   enhanced twinning deformation at 77 K achieves high strength and
   elongation in the under-aged and peak-aged conditions. On the other
   hand, only a few deformation twins were observed in the supersaturated
   solid solution and over-aged specimens.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Infrastructure owners or management agencies have well established
   quality control programs with the intent of achieving safe and effective
   maintenance. However, consumers are becoming more involved in economic,
   environmental, and social issues related to infrastructure. Therefore, a
   valid quality program would be more definitive by involving voice of the
   customer in the maintenance decision-process. In this paper, an
   innovative approach for achieving quality and customer satisfaction in
   infrastructure maintenance is proposed by implementing the quality
   function deployment (QFD) approach. Using bridges as an example, two
   separate applications of QFD have been proposed: (1)inspection
   prioritization, and (2)decision-making between replacement and/or
   rehabilitation scenarios. For both applications, an inspection house of
   quality is prepared for translating consumer demands (WHATs) into
   inspection requirements (HOWs) followed by prioritizing the inspection
   items (HOWs). For the inspection prioritization, hypothetical survey
   data is utilized. For the decision-making scenarios, a case study is
   furnished for a bridge located in Victoria, BC, Canada. The main
   conclusion as illustrated in the study is that QFD can be successfully
   adopted for improved management of civil infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes low Reynolds number vortices that can occur during
   the evaporation of a polymer solution inside a cavity. Confocal
   microscopy combined with image processing, micro particle image
   velocimetry, and micro laser induced fluorescence are used to measure
   the unsteady evaporation-driven velocity field and the concentration
   field in a shallow liquid film inside a microliter cavity near a wall.
   In addition to evaporation-driven flow and Marangoni flow, the velocity
   field also reveals single and multiple vortices generated by the
   creeping flow induced by evaporation. Similar to other low Reynolds
   number vortices, it is seen that the geometry strongly affects the
   presence, endurance and size of these vortices during the evaporation
   process. The bulk shear stress of the solution affects the vortex
   behavior, and no recirculation is observed at high viscosity. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{FPGA technology is commonly used to prototype new digital designs before
   entering fabrication. Whilst these physical prototypes can operate many
   orders of magnitude faster than through a logic simulator, a fundamental
   limitation is their lack of on-chip visibility when debugging. To
   counter this, trace-buffer-based instrumentation can be installed into
   the prototype, allowing designers to capture a predetermined window of
   signal data during live operation for offline analysis. However, instead
   of requiring the designer to recompile their entire circuit every time
   the window is modified, this article proposes that an overlay network is
   constructed using only spare FPGA routing multiplexers to connect all
   circuit signals through to the trace instruments. Thus, during
   debugging, designers would only need to reconfigure this network instead
   of finding a new place-and-route solution. Furthermore, we describe how
   this network can deliver signals to both the trigger and trace units of
   these instruments, which are implemented simultaneously using dual-port
   RAMs. Our results show that new network configurations connecting any
   subset of signals to 80-90\% of the available RAM capacity can be
   computed in less than 70 seconds, for a 100,000 LUT circuit, as many
   times as necessary. Our tool-QuickTrace-is available for download.}},

   isolator is subjected to a vertical pressure and unidirectional cyclic
   lateral displacement. A performance-based design flowchart is also
   provided along with a design example for determining the pre-strain and
   the radius of cross section of wires in the SMA wire-based rubber
   bearings. Results demonstrated that using ferrous SMA wires (FeNCATB)
   with 13.5\% superelastic strain in the cross configuration leads to the
   best performance since the strain induced in wires is significantly
   decreased. Seismic performance evaluation of a three-span continuous
   bridge isolated by smart HDRBs shows that using SMA wires with cross
   configuration leads to the highest energy dissipation during earthquake.
   However, implementing SMA wires into HDRBs has negligible effect and in
   some cases no effect on the pier displacement and peak deck
   acceleration. It was also observed that neither of the HDRBs nor the
   SMA-HDRBs experienced any residual deformations when they were subjected
   to three different ground motions scaled by Vancouver design response
   spectrum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Power Allocation for Conventional and Buffer-Aided Link Adaptive

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider optimal power allocation for conventional and
   buffer-aided link adaptive energy harvesting (EH) relay systems, where
   an EH source communicates with the destination via an EH
   decode-and-forward relay over fading channels. In conventional relaying,
   source and relay transmit signals in consecutive time slots whereas in
   buffer-aided link adaptive relaying, the state of the source-relay and
   relay-destination channels as well as the amounts of energy available at
   source and relay determine whether the source or the relay is selected
   for transmission. Our objective is to maximize the system throughput
   over a finite number of transmission time slots for both relaying
   protocols. In case of conventional relaying, we propose an offline and
   several online joint source and relay transmit power allocation schemes.
   For offline power allocation, we formulate a convex optimization problem
   whereas for the online case, we propose a dynamic programming (DP)
   approach to compute the optimal online transmit power. To alleviate the
   complexity inherent to DP, we also propose several suboptimal online
   power allocation schemes. For buffer-aided link adaptive relaying, we
   show that the joint offline optimization of the source and relay
   transmit powers along with the link selection results in a mixed integer
   non-linear program which we solve optimally using the spatial
   branch-and-bound method. We also propose efficient online power
   allocation schemes for buffer-aided link adaptive relaying. Simulation
   results show that buffer-aided link adaptive relaying provides
   significant performance gains compared to conventional relaying but
   requires a higher complexity for computation of the power allocation
   solution. We also show that buffer-aided link adaptive relaying is more
   robust to changes in the EH rate than conventional relaying.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a market-based approach for multi-robot cooperation.
   The approach uses auctioneering as the decision-making mechanism for
   assigning robotic tasks. A task may be carried out either by one robot
   or cooperatively by multiple robots, depending on the task requirements
   and the available robotic resources. The system autonomously determines
   the appropriate number of robots and selects the most suitable robots in
   the fleet to carry out the task, while accommodating partial or full
   failure of robots during the task execution, in an unknown, dynamic and
   unpredictable environment. The system does this efficiently by choosing
   the candidate robot that best matches the demands of the task. The
   feasibility of the developed scheme is demonstrated by implementing the

Abstract = {{Closed-cycle cooling of the cryoshroud in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
   system with a dimethyl polysiloxane heat transfer fluid has reduced
   liquid nitrogen consumption by an order of magnitude, significantly

   pumping efficacy in the MBE system has been investigated. H2O, CO, CO2,

   (-196 degrees C) in the MBE. At -78 degrees C, the operating temperature
   of the closed-cycle chiller, H2O and As-4 are pumped effectively, while
   CO and CO2 are not. The pumping speed for H2O is found to increase
   exponentially with decreasing temperature. Below similar to-40 degrees C
   and similar to-95 degrees C, the pumping speeds for As-4 and H2O
   saturate, respectively. AlGaAs layers grown with the closed-cycle-cooled

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{While neuroimaging data can provide valuable phenotypic information to
   inform genetic studies, the opposite is also true: known genotypes can
   be used to inform brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data. Here, we
   propose a framework for genetically informed group brain connectivity
   modeling. Subjects are first stratified according to their genotypes,
   and then a group regularized regression model is employed for brain
   connectivity modeling utilizing the time courses from a priori specified
   regions of interest (ROIs). With such an approach, each ROI time course
   is in turn predicted from all other ROI time courses at zero lag using a
   group regression framework which also incorporates a penalty based on
   genotypic similarity. Simulations supported such an approach when, as
   previously studies have indicated to be the case, genetic influences
   impart connectivity differences across subjects. The proposed method was
   applied to resting state fMRI data from Schizophrenia and normal control
   subjects. Genotypes were based on D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA)
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) information. With DAOA SNPs
   information integrated, the proposed approach was able to more
   accurately model the diversity in connectivity patterns. Specifically,
   connectivity with the left putamen, right posterior cingulate, and left
   middle frontal gyri were found to be jointly modulated by DAOA genotypes
   and the presence of Schizophrenia. We conclude that the proposed
   framework represents a multimodal analysis approach for incorporating
   genotypic variability into brain connectivity analysis directly.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a control strategy is presented for a high-performance
   capacitively loaded loop (LLC) multiresonant dc-dc converter in a
   two-stage smart charger for neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)

   resonant dc-dc converters in battery charging applications, such as very
   wide output voltage range while keeping the efficiency maximized,
   implementation of the current mode control at the secondary side, and
   optimization of burst mode operation for current regulation at very low
   output voltage. The proposed control scheme minimizes both low-and
   high-frequency current ripples on the battery while maintaining
   stability of the dc-dc converter, thus maximizing battery life without
   penalizing the volume of the charger. Experimental results are presented
   for a prototype unit converting 390 V from the input dc link to an
   output voltage range of 3-72 V dc at 650 W. The prototype achieves a

Abstract = {{For a radiative wave, the strength of the electric and magnetic fields

   magnetic. When an evanescent wave scatters from a subwavelength cylinder
   and is partially converted into radiation, the strength of the

Abstract = {{Many simulations of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) rely upon the
   so-called intercellular Hartree approximation (ICHA), which neglects the
   possibility of entanglement between cells. While the ICHA is useful for
   solving many QCA circuits due to its relative simplicity and
   computational efficiency, its many shortcomings make it prohibitive in
   accurately modeling the dynamics of large systems of QCA cells. On the
   other hand, solving a full Hamiltonian for each circuit, while more
   accurate, becomes computationally intractable as the number of cells
   increases. This paper aims to find an intermediate solution that exists
   somewhere in the solution space spanned by the ICHA and the full
   Hamiltonian. The development of such a solution promises to yield
   significant results within the QCA research community.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, vertical arrays of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) are

   of UV, the type of oxygen species on the surface of ZnO changes to more
   reactive negative ions. In addition, when the pressure is decreased to
   0.05 mBar, the conductivity of the NWs increases similar to 3.5 times
   due to the removal of oxygen molecules from the surface. For the first
   time, UV irradiation is used to improve the carbon monoxide (CO) sensing
   properties of ZnO NWs. When exposed to 250 mu W/cm(2) UV irradiation,
   not only the sensitivity increases more than 75\%, but also a repeatable
   and recoverable response is obtained, which is due to formation of more
   reactive oxygen ions. For the same reason, when the temperature is
   elevated, higher sensitivity to CO is achieved. The devices demonstrate
   exponential sensitivities of more than four decades when the relative
   humidity (RH) increases to 86\% at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the mitigation of intersymbol interference in a
   diffusive molecular communication system using enzymes that freely
   diffuse in the propagation environment. The enzymes form reaction
   intermediates with information molecules and then degrade them so that
   they cannot interfere with future transmissions. A lower bound
   expression on the expected number of molecules measured at the receiver
   is derived. A simple binary receiver detection scheme is proposed where
   the number of observed molecules is sampled at the time when the maximum
   number of molecules is expected. Insight is also provided into the
   selection of an appropriate bit interval. The expected bit error
   probability is derived as a function of the current and all previously
   transmitted bits. Simulation results show the accuracy of the bit error
   probability expression and the improvement in communication performance
   by having active enzymes present.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new pricing algorithm to minimize the

   that we seek to address is the energy provider's uncertainty about the
   impact of prices on users' load profiles, in particular when users are
   equipped with automated energy consumption scheduling (ECS) devices. We
   use an iterative stochastic approximation approach to design two
   real-time pricing algorithms based on finite-difference and simultaneous
   perturbation methods, respectively. We also propose the use of a system
   simulator unit (SSU) that employs approximate dynamic programming to
   simulate the operation of the ECS devices and users'
   price-responsiveness. Simulation results show that our proposed
   real-time pricing algorithms reduce the PAR in aggregate load and help
   the users to reduce their energy expenses.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to characterize the performance of a
   pilot scale downflow bubble contact (DBCA) hypolimnetic aerator, the
   Speece Cone. The effect of two key design factors, inlet water velocity
   and the ratio of gas flow rate to water flow rate on four standard units
   of oxygen transfer, was examined: (a)the oxygen transfer coefficient,
   KLa, corrected to 20 degrees C, KLa20 (h-1); (b)the standard oxygen
   transfer rate, SOTR (g O2 center dot h-1); (c)the standard aeration
   efficiency, SAE (g O2 center dot kW h-1); and (d)the standard oxygen
   transfer efficiency, SOTE (\%). Two sources of oxygen, pressure swing
   adsorption (PSA) oxygen (87\% purity oxygen) and air (similar to 21\%
   oxyzen) were compared. KLa20, SOTR, and SAE increased with an increase
   in the ratio of gas flow rate to water flow rate for both air and
   oxygen, over a range of 0.5\% to 5.0\%; while SOTE deceased. An increase
   in inlet water velocity resulted in a decrease in KLa, corrected to 20
   degrees C, SOTR, and SAE, but an increase in the SOTE.
   Experimental treatments with air showed similar, but much less dramatic
   effect of the gas flow rate to water flow rate ratio and water inlet
   velocity on KLa20, SOTE, SAE, and SOTE, when compared to treatments with
   PSA oxygen. The best oxygen transfer performance was achieved with an
   inlet water velocity of 6.9-7.6 m center dot s-1 and oxygen flow rate to
   water flow rate ratio of about 2.5\%. At this combination, the SOTE was
   about 66-72\%. Further experimentation with inlet water velocity is
   required to increase oxygen transfer performance to the >95\% range
   which has been reported in the literature for Speece Cone oxygenation
   systems.}},

Title = {{Comparative Study of the Effect of Vacuum-Ultraviolet Irradiation on
   Natural Organic Matter of Different Sources}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) present in surface water sources undergoes
   significant structural and chemical changes during the application of
   vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-based advanced oxidation process (AOP), which
   leads to the formation of undesired by-products such as aldehydes.
   Partial NOM mineralization can occur depending on the fluence received.
   In this paper, the VUV-induced degradation of NOM and the subsequent
   formation of by-products were experimentally studied. Two natural waters
   (Trepanier Creek and Capilano Reservoir, in British Columbia, Canada)
   and two synthetic waters (Suwannee River, Southern Georgia and Northern
   Florida; Nordic Reservoir, Vallsjoen, Skarnes, Norway) were used. While
   the process started with partial oxidation of NOM, extensive irradiation
   (i.e.,high UV+VUV fluence) led to complete mineralization of NOM. The
   rates of mineralization were greatly dependent on the nature of NOM and
   on the presence of inorganic compounds in the water matrix, such as
   carbonates and bicarbonates. A faster mineralization rate was obtained
   with waters containing NOM with a lower average molecular weight. Size
   exclusion chromatography analysis showed that high-molecular-weight
   (HMW) molecules were readily degraded, even from the beginning of the
   treatment. The fraction of low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds also
   reduced, but at a slower rate, largely because LMW compounds were both
   formed through partial degradation of HMW compounds and degraded by
   hydroxyl radicals. The concentration of aldehydes and trihalomethane
   formation potentials increased up to 120-700ppb, respectively, after
   receiving a UV+VUV fluences in the range of 1-3 J cm-2), but decreased
   with relatively higher UV+VUV fluencies (>4 J cm-2).}},

Abstract = {{PurposeMyelin content is a marker for nervous system pathology and is
   quantifiable by myelin water imaging using multi-echo CPMG sequence,
   which is inherently slow. One way to accelerate the scan is to utilize
   compressed sensing. However, reconstructing the images piecemeal by
   standard compressed sensing methods is not the optimal solution, because
   it only exploits intraimage spatial redundancy. It does not recognize
   that the different T2 weighted images are scans of the same anatomical
   volume and hence correlated. The purpose of this work is to test the
   feasibility of compressed sensed CPMG with group-sparsity promoting
   optimization for myelin water imaging.
   MethodsGroup-sparse reconstruction was performed at various simulated
   and actual undersampling factors for an electronic phantom, ex vivo rat
   spinal cord, and in vivo rat spinal cord. Normalized mean square error
   was used as the metric for comparison.
   ResultsFor both simulated undersampling and the actual undersampling,
   the method was found to minimally impact myelin water fraction map
   quality (normalized mean square error<0.25) when acceleration factor was
   below two.
   ConclusionCompressed sensed CPMG with group-sparse reconstruction is
   useful for achieving a shorter scan time than traditionally possible.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient, accurate, and robust template-based
   visual tracker. In this method, the target is represented by two
   heterogeneous and adaptive Gaussian-based templates which can model both
   short- and long-term changes in the target appearance. The proposed
   localization algorithm features an interactive multi-start optimization
   process that takes into account generic transformations using a
   combination of sampling- and gradient-based techniques in a unified
   probabilistic framework. Both the short- and long-term templates are
   used to find the best location of the target, simultaneously. This
   approach further increased both the efficiency and accuracy of the
   proposed tracker. The contributions of the proposed tracking method
   include: (1) Flexible multi-model target representation which in general
   can accurately and robustly handle challenging situations such as
   significant appearance and shape changes, (2) Robust template updating
   algorithm where a combination of tracking time step, a forgetting
   factor, and an uncertainty margin are used to update the mean and
   variance of the Gaussian functions, and (3) Efficient and interactive
   multi-start optimization which can improve the accuracy, robustness, and
   efficiency of the target localization by parallel searching in different
   time-varying templates. Several challenging and publicly available
   videos have been used to both demonstrate and quantify the superiority
   of the proposed tracking method in comparison with other
   state-of-the-art trackers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A manufactured aero-engine blade is commonly inspected in sections, and
   its geometric errors are evaluated from the sectional inspection data
   points. To maintain consistency in evaluating the geometric errors, in
   particular, the position and twist errors of the stacked blade sections,
   reconstruction of valid sectional airfoil profiles from the measurement
   points is preferred. Considering that inspection data points are subject
   to measurement uncertainty, profile reconstruction via
   approximation-based curve fitting, rather than interpolation-based curve
   reconstruction, is adopted in this work. The fitting error of the
   approximated airfoil profile is deemed equivalent to the measurement
   uncertainty in the inspection data points. Thus, according to a given
   measurement uncertainty value, a progressive curve fitting scheme is
   proposed to generate the airfoil profile that meets the measurement
   uncertainty constraint. A closed nonperiodic B-spline curve is utilized
   to model the reconstructed airfoil profile due to its versatility in
   closed curve approximation. Typical computational tests have been
   carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed airfoil
   profile reconstruction method, which is in fact generic and can be
   equally applied to approximating other closed sectional profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Isoelectric chromatofocusing (ICF), a mode of chromatography by which
   proteins are separated based on changes in their charge state with pH,
   is widely used at analytical scales and finding increasing interest in
   biologics manufacturing due to its exceptional resolving power. Here, a
   method is described for using simple monoprotic and diprotic buffers to
   create stable mobile phases for sample loading on a strong anion
   exchange column and for achieving an elution pH gradient of desired
   shape covering any pH range from pH 10.0 to 3. The buffers used are
   selected to satisfy cost constraints, and to permit facile detection of
   eluted biologics by UV spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The method
   exploits a new model described here that combines multiple-chemical and
   adsorption-equilibria theory to enable in silico tailoring of elution pH
   profiles using mixtures of these simple buffers. It is shown to provide
   a versatile platform for optimizing and conducting ICF of protein
   mixtures on strong anion exchange media. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111:

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for controlling the height of a mineral
   processing dry-surge ore pile between specified upper and lower levels
   by manipulating the outlet ore flow. The upper level should not be
   exceeded for safety, while the height should always be higher than the
   lowest allowable level to maintain a reserve for continuous operation
   downstream of the ore pile. However, this is a non-trivial control
   problem because the disturbance of the unpredictable discontinuous ore
   input must be attenuated in the continuous outlet ore flow. In addition,
   ore is mined from multiple sites and causes the physical properties of
   the ore to be uncertain. To deal with these issues, a control problem is
   formulated to attenuate the disturbance from the discontinuous feed and
   guarantee stability given the inaccurate process model. To solve the
   formulated control problem, a robust H height controller is developed
   using the linear matrix inequality technique. It is shown that the
   robust H controller attenuates four times more variability in outlet ore
   flow than a gain-scheduled PI controller and guarantees robust closed
   loop stability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the effect of metal artifact reduction techniques
   on dGEMRIC T-1 calculation with surgical hardware present.
   We examined the effect of stainless-steel and titanium hardware on
   dGEMRIC T-1 maps. We tested two strategies to reduce metal artifact in
   dGEMRIC: (1) saturation recovery (SR) instead of inversion recovery (IR)
   and (2) applying the metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS), in a
   gadolinium-doped agarose gel phantom and in vivo with titanium hardware.
   T-1 maps were obtained using custom curve-fitting software and phantom
   ROIs were defined to compare conditions (metal, MARS, IR, SR).
   A large area of artifact appeared in phantom IR images with metal when
   TI a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 700 ms. IR
   maps with metal had additional artifact both in vivo and in the phantom
   (shifted null points, increased mean T-1 (+151 \% IR ROIartifact) and
   decreased mean inversion efficiency (f; 0.45 ROIartifact, versus 2 for
   perfect inversion)) compared to the SR maps (ROIartifact: +13 \% T-1 SR,
   0.95 versus 1 for perfect excitation), however, SR produced noisier T-1
   maps than IR (phantom SNR: 118 SR, 212 IR). MARS subtly reduced the
   extent of artifact in the phantom (IR and SR).
   dGEMRIC measurement in the presence of surgical hardware at 3T is
   possible with appropriately applied strategies. Measurements may work
   best in the presence of titanium and are severely limited with stainless
   steel. For regions near hardware where IR produces large artifacts
   making dGEMRIC analysis impossible, SR-MARS may allow dGEMRIC
   measurements. The position and size of the IR artifact is variable, and
   must be assessed for each implant/imaging set-up.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive numerical model of the hot extrusion process for
   aluminium alloys has been developed and validated. Reflecting the
   complex thermomechanical changes effected in the alloys during
   extrusion, the model incorporated heat flow and plastic deformation
   during extrusion. This paper presents the overall numerical development
   of a hot extrusion process for AA3003 and validation of the numerical
   model, by comparison to industrial data. The plasticity module was
   developed using a commercial finite element package, DEFORM (R), a 2-D
   transient Lagrangian model which couples the thermal and deformation
   phenomena and is able to predict the temperature, strain rate and strain
   distribution in the billet/extrudate at any position in the container
   and die. A new algorithm using MATLAB was also developed so-that details
   of the material flow and formation of the transverse weld and-how it is
   affected by the feeder geometry could be quantified. Validation of the
   DEFORM model and the MATLAB algorithm of the material flow against
   industrial data indicated that it gave excellent predictions of the
   pressure and temperature history during extrusion as well as material
   flow effects such as surface cladding as one billet is fed in after
   another through the die. The results indicated that the die feeder
   design has a significant effect on the transverse weld formation with
   tapered dies showing lower transverse weld lengths compared to regular
   feeder plates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the use of two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
   frameworks based on hierarchical fuzzy inference engines for the purpose
   of assessing drinking water quality in distribution networks.
   Incommensurable and uncertain water quality parameters (WQPs) at various
   sampling locations of the water distribution network (WDN) are
   monitored. Two classes of WQPs including microbial and physicochemical
   parameters are considered. Partial, incomplete and subjective
   information on WQPs introduce uncertainty to the water quality
   assessment process. Likewise, conflicting WQPs result in a partially
   reliable assessment of the quality associated with drinking water. The
   proposed methodology is based on two hierarchical inference engines
   tuned using historical data on WQPs in the WDN and expert knowledge.
   Each inference engine acts as a decision-making agent specialized in
   assessing one aspect of quality associated with drinking water. The MCDM
   frameworks were developed to assess the microbial and physicochemical
   aspects of water quality assessment. The MCDM frameworks are based on
   either fuzzy evidential or fuzzy rule-based inference. Both frameworks
   can interpret and communicate the relative quality associated with
   drinking water, while the second is superior in capturing the nonlinear
   relationships between the WQPs and estimated water quality. More
   comprehensive rules will have to be generated prior to reliable water
   quality assessment in real-case situations. The examples presented here
   serve to demonstrate the proposed frameworks. Both frameworks were
   tested through historical data available for a WDN, and a comparison was
   made based on their performance in assessing levels of water quality at
   various sampling locations of the network.}},

   both still (static) and flowing (dynamic) water. The serpentine channel
   interface, numerically optimized, provides a constant flow and a
   constant outlet pressure condition for dynamic experiments. Tests
   conducted for evaluating the effect of the exposure time on the sensor
   performance show no change in the sensor response even after one month.
   Finally, the pH and conductivity sensors were compared against the
   common commercial sensors used for evaluating water quality. The results
   show that the pH and conductivity sensors are as precise as the
   commercial sensors in both static and dynamic conditions. However, the
   cost of the sensors presented here is significantly lower than that of
   the commercial sensors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An application of Quality Function Deployment method in engineering
   materials selection}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{912-920}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In transition from concept design to detail design, designers and
   engineers need to find specific materials to optimize performance of the
   systems. The large number of materials and the wide range of
   manufacturing processes cause engineers always to seek new materials
   selection methods. In this research work a new method so called QFD
   method, which employs materials indices, is introduced. The method
   enjoys a combination of Ashby's materials selection concepts with the
   Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool. The QFD method, which is
   modified here to fit the materials selection field, provides the
   designer with the required weighting factors for the material indices.
   Incorporation of House of Quality makes it possible to add the effects
   of the interrelationship of the material indices to the calculation of
   the required weighting factors. Also, considering the material indices
   would preserve the generality and quality of the results. The results
   show that the method can provide comparable outputs to the existing
   methods. Also, the results prove that considering materials selection
   methods like MDL and Z-transformation which employ material properties
   instead of material indices would not adversely affect the results.
   Though, some differences could be noticed and also the QFD is capable of
   analyzing much more complicated problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A well-balanced human diet includes a significant intake of non-starch
   polysaccharides, collectively termed `dietary fibre', from the cell
   walls of diverse fruits and vegetables(1). Owing to the paucity of
   alimentary enzymes encoded by the human genome(2), our ability to derive
   energy from dietary fibre depends on the saccharification and
   fermentation of complex carbohydrates by the massive microbial community
   residing in our distal gut(3,4). The xyloglucans (XyGs) are a ubiquitous
   family of highly branched plant cell wall polysaccharides(5,6) whose
   mechanism(s) of degradation in the human gut and consequent importance
   in nutrition have been unclear(1,7,8). Here we demonstrate that a
   single, complex gene locus in Bacteroides ovatus confers XyG catabolism
   in this common colonic symbiont. Through targeted gene disruption,
   biochemical analysis of all predicted glycoside hydrolases and
   carbohydrate-binding proteins, and three-dimensional structural
   determination of the vanguard endo-xyloglucanase, we reveal the
   molecular mechanisms through which XyGs are hydrolysed to component
   monosaccharides for further metabolism. We also observe that orthologous
   XyG utilization loci (XyGULs) serve as genetic markers of XyG catabolism
   in Bacteroidetes, that XyGULs are restricted to a limited number of
   phylogenetically diverse strains, and that XyGULs are ubiquitous in
   surveyed human metagenomes. Our findings reveal that the metabolism of
   even highly abundant components of dietary fibre may be mediated by
   niche species, which has immediate fundamental and practical
   implications for gut symbiont population ecology in the context of human
   diet, nutrition and health(9-12).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a simple and reproducible synthesis strategy was
   developed to fabricate mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) by using
   dual hard templates, a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane, and
   colloidal silica (Ludox TM-40). By using commercial templates, and
   removing AAO and the silica simultaneously, the synthesis procedures for
   MCNFs are greatly simplified without the need for separate preparation
   or the removal templates in sequence. With phenol resin as a carbon
   precursor, the as-prepared MCNFs material reveals not only high surface
   area and mesoporous volume but also hierarchical nanostructure composed
   of hollow macrochannels derived from the AAO template, large mesopores
   (ca. 22 nm) from the removal of silica particles and micropores from the
   carbonization of phenol resin. Such unique surface and structural
   characteristics could provide a large quantity of active sites for Li
   storage and facilitate fast mass transport. Moreover, a one-dimensional
   (1D) carbon nanofiber (CNF) nanostructure favors fast electron transfer.
   The as-prepared MCNF anode demonstrates ultrahigh lithium storage
   capacity particularly at high rates, which is much higher than that
   reported for the commercial graphite and also significantly higher than
   other nanostructured carbon materials, such as ordered mesoporous carbon
   CMK-3 and ordered multimodal porous carbon (OMPC).}},

Title = {{Pulse bubble sparging for the control of hydraulically reversible
   fouling in submerged hollow fiber membrane systems}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{153-163}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that pulse bubble sparging is more
   effective at the control of hydraulically reversible fouling than coarse
   bubble sparging in submerged hollow fiber membrane systems. However,
   some of the optimal operating set points for pulse bubble sparging
   control have not yet been identified. The present study was conducted to
   further quantify the potential benefits associated with pulse bubble
   sparging for the control of hydraulically reversible fouling. In
   particular, the effect of pulse bubble release frequency and size on the
   shear stress induced onto membranes and the resulting effect on the
   control of hydraulically reversible fouling was assessed. The shear
   stress and fouling control resulting from continuous and intermittent
   coarse bubble sparging was also considered so that the performance of
   these conventionally used sparging approaches could be compared directly
   to those for pulse bubble sparging.
   The shear stress resulting from pulse bubble sparging was significantly
   greater than that induced by continuous coarse bubble sparging, and
   similar to that induced by intermittent coarse bubble sparging. However,
   for pulse bubble sparging, the rate of fouling was significantly lower
   than for either continuous or intermittent coarse bubble sparging,
   indicating that the magnitude of the shear stress on its own cannot be
   used to assess the efficacy of different sparging approaches for the
   control of hydraulically reversible fouling.
   The pulse bubble release frequency had a significant effect on the rate
   of fouling. At lower sparging flows (i.e. lower pulse bubble release
   frequencies), the fouling rate decreased as the sparging flow increased.
   However, at the highest sparging flow considered, the rate of fouling
   was greater than that observed at the lower sparging flows, indicating
   that an optimal bubble release frequency likely exists, below which an
   increase in frequency decreases the extent of hydraulically reversible
   fouling, and above which the control of hydraulically reversible fouling
   is inhibited. For the conditions investigated, a pulse bubble release
   frequency of approximately 0.5-0.6 Hz was optimal. In addition, the
   results suggest that the optimal pulse bubble size for the control of
   hydraulically reversible fouling is likely in the 150250 mL range.
   Sparging into stagnant water also resulted in better hydraulically
   reversible fouling control than sparging when liquid upflow was
   promoted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Light-driven decomposition of Ir(acac)(3) spin-cast on a conducting
   glass substrate produces a thin conformal film of amorphous iridium
   oxide, a-IrOx. The decomposition process, which was carried out under an
   ambient atmosphere at room temperature and tracked by Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, appears to proceed by way of a
   ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process. The amorphous nature of
   the films is based on the lack of any observable Bragg reflections by
   powder X-ray diffraction techniques; the elemental composition was
   corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The
   films are found to be excellent electrocatalysts for mediating the
   oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, as evidenced by the
   onset of catalysis at 130 mV and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). These
   parameters enable current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) to be reached
   at 190 and 220 mV, respectively. Exposing the films to higher
   temperatures (500 degrees C) renders a film of crystalline iridium
   oxide, c-IrOx, which displays a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), thus
   requiring an additional SO mV to reach a current density of 1 mA cm(-2).
   The film of a-IrOx reported here is among the best OER electrocatalysts
   reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{With the aid of TEM characterization, we describe two distinct Pt
   nanostructures generated via the electroless reduction of
   Pt(NH3)(4)(NO2)(2) within Nafion. Under one set of conditions, we
   produce bundles of Pt nanorods that are 2 nm in diameter and 10-20 nm
   long. These bundled Pt nanorods, uniformly distributed within 5 mu m of
   the Nafion surface, are strikingly similar to the proposed hydrated
   nanomorphology of Nafion, and therefore strongly suggestive of Nafion
   templating. By altering the reaction environment (pH, reductant
   strength, and Nafion hydration), we can also generate nonregular
   polyhedron Pt nanoparticles that range in size from a few nanometers in
   diameter up to 20 nm. These Pt nanoparticles form a dense Pt layer
   within 100-200 nm from the Nafion surface and show a power-law

Abstract = {{The high cost of powerful, large-stroke, high-stress artificial muscles
   has combined with performance limitations such as low cycle life,
   hysteresis, and low efficiency to restrict applications. We demonstrated
   that inexpensive high-strength polymer fibers used for fishing line and
   sewing thread can be easily transformed by twist insertion to provide
   fast, scalable, nonhysteretic, long-life tensile and torsional muscles.
   Extreme twisting produces coiled muscles that can contract by 49\%, lift
   loads over 100 times heavier than can human muscle of the same length
   and weight, and generate 5.3 kilowatts of mechanical work per kilogram
   of muscle weight, similar to that produced by a jet engine. Woven
   textiles that change porosity in response to temperature and actuating
   window shutters that could help conserve energy were also demonstrated.
   Large-stroke tensile actuation was theoretically and experimentally
   shown to result from torsional actuation.}},

Abstract = {{The impedance characteristics of the ohmic loss in proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells are studied analytically, presenting a process
   model. The governing equations describing the ohmic loss and the water
   transport in the membrane and the cathode gas diffusion layer are
   analytically solved and the impedance is determined. Then, an equivalent
   circuit is presented as a function of the fuel cell properties and
   operating conditions. Various characteristics and specifications of the
   determined equivalent circuit are studied. The results obtained from the
   equivalent circuit are in agreement with the measured fuel cell
   impedances reported in the literature. It is shown that the membrane
   ohmic loss is the dominant part of the high frequency resistance, and
   the membrane and cathode gas diffusion layer water transport impacts the
   low frequency arc and the inductive loop in the Nyquist plot,
   respectively. Also, the membrane diffusion coefficient can be extracted
   from the time constant of the low frequency semi-circle in the Nyquist
   plot. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Viscoelastic properties of N,N-dimethylforrnamide (DMF) solutions of
   softwood kraft lignin (SKL) containing small amounts of poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PEO) were investigated. Of interest is the relationship between
   viscoelastic properties of the spinning solutions and their
   corresponding electrospinning behavior. Although it is well established
   that fiber diameter is critical in determining the material properties
   of nanofibers, lignin solutions have been observed to display poor
   electrospinnability in many instances. Thus, the motivation behind this
   work was to understand and exert control over the relevant fluid
   properties that control the fiber diameter of SKL/PEO fibers, The
   results of dynamic shear and capillary breakup extensional rheometry
   (CaBER) experiments indicated that SKL solutions were weakly elastic in
   shear and Newtonian in elongational flow. SKL solutions were not
   electrospinnable at concentrations of 25-45 wt \% but form fibers at 50
   wt \% concentration. The addition of PEO to SKL solutions led to an
   increase in shear moduli and pronounced strain hardening in elongational
   flow. The characteristic time scales of tensile stress growth (lambda)
   measured with CaBER were dependent on the SKI; concentration, PEO
   concentration, and PEO molecular weight. In contrast to SKL solutions,
   SKL/PEO solutions are electrospinnable over the concentration range of
   25-45 wt \% SKL depending on the combination of SKL concentration, PEO
   concentration, and PEO molecular weight. Correlation between the fiber
   diameters obtained during electrospinning and the measured value of
   lambda are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an unscented model predictive approach for the
   control of constrained nonlinear systems under uncertainty. The main
   contribution of this paper is related to incorporation of statistical
   linearization, rather than commonly used analytical linearization, of
   the process and measurement models to provide a closer approximation of
   belief space propagation. Specifically, the state transition is
   approximated using an unscented transform to obtain a Gaussian belief
   space. This approximation allows for realization of closed-form
   solutions, which are otherwise available to linear systems only.
   Subsequently, the proposed approach is used to develop a model
   predictive motion control scheme that yields optimal control policies in
   presence of nonholonomic constraints as well as state estimation and
   collision avoidance chance constraints. As an example, successful
   kinematic control of a two-wheeled mobile robot is demonstrated in
   unstructured environments. Finally, the superiority of the proposed
   unscented model predictive control (MPC) over the traditional
   linearization-based MPC is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of
   multifunctional Fe3O4/carbon nanofiber composites in the X-band region
   (8.2-12.4 GHz) is studied. Here, we examine the contributing effects of
   various parameters such as Fe3O4 content, carbonization temperature and
   thickness on total shielding efficiency (SEtotal) of different samples.
   The maximum EMI SE of 67.9 dB is obtained for composite of 5 wt.\% Fe3O4
   (0.7 mm thick) with the dominant shielding by absorption (SEA) of
   electromagnetic radiation. The enhanced electromagnetic shielding
   performance of Fe3O4/carbon nanofiber composites is attributed to the
   increment of both magnetic and dielectric losses due to the
   incorporation of magnetite nanofiller (Fe3O4) in electrically conducting
   carbon nanofiber matrix as well as the specific nanofibrous structure of
   carbon nanofiber mats, which forms a higher aspect ratio structure with
   randomly aligned nanofibers. Furthermore, we prove that the addition of
   elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a coating for carbon
   nanofiber composite strengthens the composite structure without
   interfering with its electromagnetic shielding efficiency. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A batch stirred tank device has been developed for measuring fouling
   from oil samples. The unit consists of a baffled tank equipped with a
   centrally mounted long blade stirrer, and an electrically heated rod
   located at 40\% of the radius of the tank. Heat transfer from the rod
   was first characterized. The velocity field was measured, from which the
   approach velocity to the probe was determined, which allowed the wall
   shear on the heating probe to be calculated from a literature equation.
   Fouling of a heavy oil fraction was studied in 1- to 2-day experiments
   with bulk oil temperatures typically at 320 degrees C, initial probe
   surface temperatures to 536 degrees C, and stirrer speeds of 100-900rpm.
   Micrometer-sized iron oxide particles were added to the oil, such that
   fouling was due to a combination of particle deposition and coke
   formation. Deposition rates were measured thermally from the change in
   heat transfer coefficient when fouling was relatively heavy, and by
   thickness and mass accumulation when fouling was light. Effects of oil
   type, film temperature, stirrer rotation speed (or probe wall shear
   stress), and concentration of suspended particles on deposition rate and
   deposit composition are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of surface shear stress, to represent
   air sparging employed for fouling control, on the retention of organic
   micropollutants during ultrafiltration for drinking water treatment. The
   retention of 16 different pharmaceutically-active and endocrine
   disrupting compounds was examined during ultrafiltration of three
   natural surface waters (two lake, one river) under four different
   surface shear stress regimes: no shear stress, low peak shear stress
   (representative of continuous coarse bubble sparging), sustained peak
   shear stress (representative of intermittent coarse bubble sparging),
   and high peak shear stress (representative of large pulse bubble
   sparging). Results indicate that surface shear stress does impact the
   retention of emerging contaminants; however, it is dependent on water
   matrix and compound properties. The greatest retention of
   micropollutants was observed in waters with a higher concentrations of
   organic matter, and for conditions where no surface shear stress was
   applied (average 32\% retention), and under conditions representative of
   large pulse bubble sparging (average 34\% retention). The observed
   retention under conditions of no shear stress was likely due to a heavy
   fouling layer that altered the membrane selectivity and was able to
   entrap organic micropollutants of larger molecular weight. Under
   conditions that mimicked air sparging, increasing the shear stress
   (quantified as the root mean square applied shear) resulted in increased
   retention of organic micropollutants, particularly those that are
   neutral and hydrophobic in nature. This may be related to solute-solute
   complexes, which are kept in solution when shear stress is applied, or
   related to modification of the fouling layer by the shear stress induced
   onto the membrane surface. The results suggest that there may be value
   added with respect to removal of organic micropollutants, such as
   pharmaceuticals, when employing air sparging as a fouling control
   strategy during ultrafiltration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Presence of irregularities in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings
   increases seismic vulnerability. During severe seismic shaking, such
   buildings may suffer disproportionate damage or even collapse that can
   be minimized by increasing robustness. Robustness is a desirable
   property of structural systems that can mitigate susceptible buildings
   to disproportionate collapse. In this paper, the effects of vertical
   irregularity and thickness of unreinforced masonry infill on the
   robustness of a six-story three-bay RC frame are quantified. Nonlinear
   static analysis of the frame is performed, and parametric study is
   undertaken by considering two parameters: absence of masonry infill at
   different floors (i.e., vertical irregularities) and infill thickness.
   Robustness has been quantified in terms of stiffness, base shear,
   ductility, and energy dissipation capacity of the frame. It was observed
   that the infill thickness and vertical irregularity have significant
   influence on the response of RC frame. The response surface method is
   used to develop a predictive equation for robustness as a function of
   the two parameters. The predictive equation is validated further using
   12 randomly selected computer simulations. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Impulse atomisation in helium and nitrogen and water atomisation have
   been utilised to produce powders of D2 tool steel. It was determined
   that higher cooling rates result in a lower percentage of eutectic.
   Scanning electron microscopy image analysis, along with coarsening
   model, was used to predict eutectic and primary phase undercooling of
   particles. Small particles exhibited a higher amount of undercooling.
   The particles exposed to a He atmosphere during atomisation had a larger
   amount of eutectic undercooling. The fraction of primary phase that
   solidified during the recalescence was then calculated based on the
   amount of primary phase undercooling under adiabatic conditions. In
   smaller particles, there was a larger amount of primary phase solidified
   during recalescence due to a higher amount of primary undercooling.
   Based on primary phase undercooling values, critical nuclei radius of
   austenite and assuming homogenous nucleation, the number of austenite
   unit cells in the stable nucleus was calculated.}},

Abstract = {{Non-linear state filters of different approximations and capabilities
   allow for real-time estimation of unmeasured states in non-linear
   stochastic processes. It is well known that the performance of
   non-linear filters depends on the underlying numerical and statistical
   approximations used in their design. Despite the theoretical and
   practical interest in evaluating the performance of non-linear filtering
   methods, it remains one of the most complex problems in the area of
   state estimation. We propose the use of posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound
   (PCRLB) or mean square error (MSE) inequality as a filtering performance
   benchmark. Using the PCRLB inequality, we develop assessment and
   diagnosis tools for monitoring and evaluating the performance of
   non-linear filters. Using the PCRLB inequality-based performance
   assessment tool, an optimal non-linear filter switching strategy is
   proposed for state estimation in general non-linear systems. The
   non-linear filter switching strategy is an optimal performance strategy,
   which maintains high filtering performance under all operating
   conditions. The complex, high dimensional integrals involved in the
   computation of the PCRLB inequality-based non-linear filter assessment
   and diagnosis tools are approximated using sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC)
   methods. The utility and efficacy of the developed tools are illustrated
   through a numerical example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has motivated a
   paradigm shift in patient monitoring and disease control. Epilepsy
   management is one of the areas that could especially benefit from the
   use of WSN. By using miniaturized wireless electroencephalogram (EEG)
   sensors, it is possible to perform ambulatory EEG recording and
   real-time seizure detection outside clinical settings. One major
   consideration in using such a wireless EEG-based system is the stringent
   battery energy constraint at the sensor side. Different solutions to
   reduce the power consumption at this side are therefore highly desired.
   The conventional approach incurs a high power consumption, as it
   transmits the entire EEG signals wirelessly to an external data server
   (where seizure detection is carried out). This paper examines the use of
   data reduction techniques for reducing the amount of data that has to be
   transmitted and, thereby, reducing the required power consumption at the
   sensor side. Two data reduction approaches are examined: compressive
   sensing-based EEG compression and low-complexity feature extraction.
   Their performance is evaluated in terms of seizure detection
   effectiveness and power consumption. Experimental results show that by
   performing low-complexity feature extraction at the sensor side and
   transmitting only the features that are pertinent to seizure detection
   to the server, a considerable overall saving in power is achieved. The
   battery life of the system is increased by 14 times, while the same
   seizure detection rate as the conventional approach (95\%) is
   maintained.}},

Abstract = {{During the Christchurch earthquake of February 2011, several midrise
   reinforced concrete masonry (RCM) buildings showed performance levels
   that fall in the range of life safety to near collapse. A case study of
   one of these buildings, a six-story RCM building deemed to have reached
   the near collapse performance level, is presented in this paper. The RCM
   walls on the second floor failed due to toe crushing, reducing the
   building's lateral resistance in the east west direction. A
   three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear dynamic analysis was conducted to
   simulate the development of the governing failure mechanism. Analysis
   results showed that the walls that were damaged were subjected to large
   compression loads during the earthquake, which caused an increase in
   their in-plane lateral strength but reduced their ductility capacity.
   After toe crushing failure, axial instability of the model was prevented
   by a redistribution of gravity loads.}},

Abstract = {{The Canterbury earthquakes, which involved widespread damage in the
   February 2011 event and ongoing aftershocks near the Christchurch
   central business district (CBD), presented decision makers with many
   recovery challenges. This paper identifies major government decisions,
   challenges, and lessons in the early recovery of Christchurch based on
   23 key-informant interviews conducted 15 months after the February 2011
   earthquake. It then focuses on one of the most important
   decisions-maintaining the cordon around the heavily damaged CBD-and
   investigates its impacts. The cordon displaced 50,000 central city jobs,
   raised questions about (and provided new opportunities for) the
   long-term viability of downtown, influenced the number and practice of
   building demolitions, and affected debris management. Despite being
   associated with substantial losses, the cordon was commonly viewed as
   necessary, and provided some benefits in facilitating recovery.
   Management of the cordon poses important lessons for planning for
   catastrophic urban earthquakes around the world.}},

Abstract = {{The unique chemical and physical properties of metals mean that they are
   extensively utilized by industry in a huge variety of applications,
   including electronics, materials, industrial catalysts and chemicals.
   The increased consumer demand from a growing population worldwide with
   rising aspirations for a better life has resulted in concerns over the
   security of supply and accessibility of these valuable elements. As
   such, there is a growing need to develop alternative methods to recover
   them from waste repositories, current or historic, both for hazard
   avoidance and potentially, as a new source of metals for industry.
   Phytoextraction (the use of plants for the recovery of metals from waste
   repositories) is a green and novel technique for metal recovery, which,
   if done with the goal of resource supply rather than hazard mitigation,
   is termed ``phytomining{''}. The ability for plants to form metallic
   nanoparticles as a consequence of phytoextraction could make the
   recovered metal ideally suited for utilization in green chemical
   technologies, such as catalysis. This review focuses on a
   multidisciplinary approach to elemental sustainability and highlights
   important aspects of metal lifecycle analysis, metal waste sources
   (including mine tailings), phytoextraction and potential green chemical
   applications that may result from the integration of these approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The low sound speed in water makes propagation delay (PD)-based range
   estimation attractive for underwater acoustic localization (UWAL).
   However, due to the long channel impulse response and the existence of
   reflectors, PD-based UWAL suffers from significant degradation when PD
   measurements of nonline-of-sight (NLOS) communication links are falsely
   identified as line-of-sight (LOS). In this paper, we utilize expected
   variation of PD measurements due to mobility of nodes and present an
   algorithm to classify the former into LOS and NLOS links. First, by
   comparing signal strength-based and PD-based range measurements, we
   identify object-related NLOS (ONLOS) links, where signals are reflected
   from objects with high reflection loss, for example, ships hull, docks,
   rocks and so on. In the second step, excluding PD measurements related
   to ONLOS links, we use a constrained expectation-maximization algorithm
   to classify PD measurements into two classes: LOS and sea-related NLOS
   (SNLOS), and to estimate the statistical parameters of each class. Since
   our classifier relies on models for the underwater acoustic channel,
   which are often simplified, alongside simulation results, we validate
   the performance of our classifier based on measurements from three sea
   trials. Both our simulation and sea trial results demonstrate a high
   detection rate of ONLOS links, and accurate classification of PD
   measurements into LOS and SNLOS.}},

Abstract = {{Civil infrastructure systems are critical assets that are subjected to
   damage, service-life deterioration, and increasing maintenance and
   rehabilitation cost. Effective infrastructure management and principles
   of sustainable development can help to find an optimal compromise
   between economic growth and environmental protection for all
   stakeholders. Colloquially, sustainability refers to meeting
   triple-bottom-line (TBL) performance objectives including environmental
   protection, economic prosperity, and social acceptability and equity as
   a result of short- and long-term policy decisions. In this paper, a
   comprehensive framework based on the integration of emergy synthesis and
   life cycle assessment (LCA) has been investigated for a public
   infrastructure system. The main purpose of the applied method,
   emergy-based LCA (Em-LCA), is to facilitate an informed decision making
   process for different asset management scenarios, by identifying and
   quantifying the attributes of TBL impacts over the life cycle of a civil
   infrastructure system. As a case study, Em-LCA framework has been
   applied to evaluate the sustainability of two different scenarios for a
   road construction project in interior British Columbia, Canada. The
   results indicate that Em-LCA offers a good understanding to address
   sustainability issues in infrastructure systems and provides
   quantitative and transparent results to facilitate informed decision
   making for asset management.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems is
   compromised by atmospheric fading and pointing errors. The pointing
   errors are widely considered as a combination of two components:
   boresight and jitter. A statistical model is investigated for pointing
   errors with nonzero boresight by taking into account the laser
   beamwidth, detector aperture size, and jitter variance. A novel
   closed-form probability density function (PDF) is derived for this new
   nonzero boresight pointing error model. Furthermore, we obtain
   closed-form PDF for the composite lognormal turbulence channels and
   finite series approximate PDF for the composite Gamma-Gamma turbulence
   channels, which is suitable for terrestrial FSO applications impaired by
   building sway. We conduct error rate analysis of on-off keying signaling
   with intensity modulation and direct detection over the lognormal and
   Gamma-Gamma fading channels. Asymptotic error rate analysis and outage
   probability of such a system are also presented based on the derived
   composite PDFs. It is shown that the boresight can only affect the
   coding gain, while the diversity order is determined by the atmospheric
   fading effect as well as the pointing error effect.}},

Abstract = {{Although relatively simple exact error rate expressions are available
   for selection combining (SC) and equal gain combining (EGC) with
   independent fading channels, results for correlated channels are highly
   complex, requiring multiple levels of integration when more than two
   branches are considered. Asymptotic analysis has been used to derive
   simple error expressions valid in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   region. However, it is not clear at what SNR value the asymptotic
   results are an accurate approximation of the exact solution. In this
   paper, we derive asymptotic results for SC and EGC in correlated
   generalized Rician fading channels. Furthermore, the asymptotic results
   for SC are expanded into an exact infinite series. Although this series
   grows quickly in complexity as more terms are included, truncation to
   even two or three terms has much greater accuracy than the first
   (asymptotic) term alone. Finally, we derive asymptotically tight lower
   and upper bounds on the error rate for EGC. Using these bounds, we are
   able to show at what SNR value the asymptotic results are valid.}},

Abstract = {{Node localization is a difficult task in sensor networks in which the
   ranging measurements are subject to errors and anchor positions are
   subject to uncertainty. In this paper, the robust localization problem
   is formulated using the maximum likelihood criterion under an unbounded
   uncertainty model for the anchor positions. To overcome the
   non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem, a convex relaxation
   leading to second order cone programming (SOCP) is devised. Furthermore,
   an analysis is performed in order to identify the set of nodes which are
   accurately positioned using robust SOCP, and to establish a relation
   between the solution of the proposed robust SOCP optimization and the
   existing robust optimization using semidefinite programming (SDP). Based
   on this analysis, a mixed robust SDP-SOCP localization framework is
   proposed which benefits from the better accuracy of SDP and the lower
   complexity of SOCP. Since the centralized optimization involves a high
   computational complexity in large networks, we also derive the
   distributed implementation of the proposed robust SOCP convex
   relaxation. Finally, we propose an iterative optimization based on the
   expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the cases where anchor
   uncertainty parameters are unavailable. Simulations confirm that the
   robust SOCP and mixed robust SDP-SOCP provide tradeoffs between
   localization accuracy and computational complexity that render them
   attractive solutions, especially in networks with a large number of
   nodes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the trade-off between performance and energy efficiency
   in cooperative cognitive underlay systems. By cooperating, cognitive
   base stations mitigate the interference and serve their users more
   effectively at the cost of spending more power. With a flexible
   cooperation scheme, we thus jointly optimize the clustering and the
   beamforming to minimize the overall power consumption while satisfying
   the secondary users' quality of service and respecting the primary
   users' interference limits. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer
   nonlinear program and decompose it into a master problem and a
   beamforming subproblem. Then, we derive an iterative algorithm based on
   the generalized Benders decomposition method to find an optimal
   solution. Moreover, we propose simple techniques to speed up its
   convergence. When the clusters are fixed and non-overlapping, we also
   propose a decentralized algorithm with limited signaling schemes using
   the alternating direction method of multipliers. In contrast to previous
   works, our distributed algorithm handles the total interference power
   constraints coupling the cognitive base stations. Through simulations,
   we analyze the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithms

Abstract = {{The combined pressure-decay technique with rheometry is developed to
   measure the diffusivity of carbon dioxide (CO2) in bitumen at
   temperatures of 30, 50, and 70 degrees C and pressures of 2 and 4 MPa.
   Mixing due to shear imposed by a rheometer allows rapid direct
   measurement of the equilibrium pressure in CO2 bitumen systems
   accurately. The comparison of the measured equilibrium pressures with
   the values obtained from the data regression demonstrates significant
   discrepancies, which can lead to a great deviation in the diffusivity,
   up to 5-fold different than the true values. The measured values for the
   diffusivity of CO2 into the bitumen increase with temperature, following
   the Arrhenius equation. By changing the temperature from 30 C to 70
   degrees C, the diffusivity increases by 88\% at 2 MPa and 54\% at 4 MPa.
   The diffusivity also increases with the pressure, suggesting the ease of
   diffusion at the presence of the CO2 molecules in the liquid phase. The
   effect of pressure is more dominant at lower temperatures while the
   diffusivity increase is 53\% at 30 degrees C, compared to 25\% at 70
   degrees C. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that the CO2-bitumen
   system does not follow any constant pattern in the
   diffusivity-viscosity-temperature relationships, which is due to the
   ongoing phase change at the studied temperature range.}},

Abstract = {{Cerussite (PbCO3) concentrates may be recovered from oxidized lead ores.
   A hydro-electrometallurgical process to treat cerussite concentrate by
   methanesulfonic acid (MSA) is proposed. Cerussite concentrate was first
   leached with MSA. The parameters of temperature, stirring speed, acid
   concentration, particle size and solid to liquid ratio were considered
   in this study. After the primary leach, the remaining lead (mainly as
   anglesite in the residue) was extracted through a desulfurization step
   using Na2CO3 and a re-leach step with MSA usage. An overall lead
   extraction of 98\% was finally obtained. In the subsequent lead
   electrowinning process from MSA based electrolyte, the individual and
   synergistic effects of four additives, including two ligninsulfonate
   salts and two glycoltype agents, on the lead deposit quality were
   investigated. The individual use of calcium ligninsulfonate most
   effectively benefited the morphology of lead deposit. The operating
   parameters in the lead electrowinning process (i.e. temperature, current
   density, concentrations of lead ion and protons) had a widely acceptable
   range. The cathodic current efficiency and specific energy consumption
   were around 99\% and 0.53 kWh/kg, respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The demand for rich multimedia services over mobile networks has been
   soaring at a tremendous pace over recent years. However, due to the
   centralized architecture of current cellular networks, the wireless link
   capacity as well as the bandwidth of the radio access networks and the
   backhaul network cannot practically cope with the explosive growth in
   mobile traffic. Recently, we have observed the emergence of promising
   mobile content caching and delivery techniques, by which popular
   contents are cached in the intermediate servers (or middleboxes,
   gateways, or routers) so that demands from users for the same content
   can be accommodated easily without duplicate transmissions from remote
   servers; hence, redundant traffic can be significantly eliminated. In
   this article, we first study techniques related to caching in current
   mobile networks, and discuss potential techniques for caching in 5G
   mobile networks, including evolved packet core network caching and radio
   access network caching. A novel edge caching scheme based on the concept
   of content-centric networking or information-centric networking is
   proposed. Using trace-driven simulations, we evaluate the performance of
   the proposed scheme and validate the various advantages of the
   utilization of caching content in 5G mobile networks. Furthermore, we
   conclude the article by exploring new relevant opportunities and
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of a robust proportional-integral
   derivative (PID) controller for propofol infusion in children and
   presents the results of clinical evaluation of this closed-loop system
   during endoscopic investigations in children age 6-17. The controller
   design is based on a set of models that describes the interpatient
   variability in the response to propofol infusion in the study
   population. The PID controller is tuned to achieve sufficient robustness
   margins for the identified uncertainty. 108 children were enrolled in
   this study, and anesthesia was closed-loop controlled in 102 of these
   cases. Clinical evaluation of the system shows that closed-loop control
   of both induction and maintenance of anesthesia in children based on the
   WAV(CNS) index as a measure of clinical effect is feasible. A robustly
   tuned PID controller can accommodate the interpatient variability in
   children and spontaneous breathing can be maintained in most subjects.}},

Abstract = {{The multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radio-frequency (RF)
   identification system applies the RF backscattering principle, and its
   physical channel exhibits a special kind of cascaded structure different
   from conventional wireless channels and other cascaded channels (e.g.,
   the keyhole MIMO channel). In this paper, we provide a general
   formulation to study orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) for RF
   backscattering with different fading assumptions and then analytically
   study the symbol-error-rate (SER) performances for this channel under
   Rician fading and Nakagami-m fading. We find that the diversity order
   achieves L for Rician fading and achieves Lmin(m(f), Nm(b)) for
   Nakagami-m fading. Two receiving antennas (N = 2) can capture most of
   the receiving side gain regardless of the number of tag antennas L for
   Rician fading, and this is also applicable to Nakagami-m fading if the
   two links of the cascaded structure have similar channel conditions.
   More interestingly, we show that the performance of the this channel is
   more sensitive to the channel condition (the K factor or the m
   parameter) of the forward link than that of the backscattering link.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative communications has received tremendous interests in wireless
   systems. The communication performance of a single source-destination
   pair can be enhanced via the help of relays in traditional cooperative
   communications. Recent advances in interference cancelation (IC) can
   further enhance the performance of parallel cooperative transmissions
   between multiple source-destination pairs. Although some works have been
   done on cooperative communications, most existing works are focused on
   link-level physical-layer issues. Consequently, the potential benefits
   of cooperative communications on network-level upper layer issues, such
   as topology control, are largely ignored in existing works. In this
   paper, we study the impacts of cooperative communications, particularly
   IC-based cooperative communications, on topology control in wireless ad
   hoc networks (WANETs). We propose a distributed cooperative topology
   control scheme with opportunistic IC (COIC) to improve network capacity
   in WANETs by jointly considering both upper layer network capacity and
   physical-layer cooperative communications with IC. We show that the
   benefits brought by cooperative communications are opportunistic, which
   rely on network structures and channel conditions. These opportunistic
   advantages have significant impacts on network capacity, and our
   proposed COIC can effectively capture these opportunities to
   substantially improve network capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Kakkalide and irisolidone, the main isoflavones of Flos Puerariae,
   exhibit a wide spectrum of bioactivities. Intestinal bacteria
   biotransformation plays an important role in the metabolic pathways of
   flavones, and is directly related to the bioactivities of the prodrugs
   after oral administration. To the best of our knowledge, the metabolic
   pathways of kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro have not been
   comprehensively studied yet. This paper describes the strategy using
   ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF MS) for the rapid analysis of the
   metabolic profiles of kakkalide and irisolidone after incubated with
   human and rat intestinal bacteria. Bacteria incubated samples were
   prepared and analyzed after incubated under anaerobic conditions for 48
   h. A total of 17 metabolites, including parent compounds, were detected
   in human and rat intestinal bacteria incubated samples. The results
   obtained indicate that hydrolysis, dehydroxylation, demethoxylation,
   demethylation, hydroxylation, decarbonylation, and reduction were the
   detected metabolic pathways of kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro. The
   conversion rate of irisolidone in human and rat bacteria was 8.57\% and
   6.51\%, respectively. Biochanin A was the relatively main metabolite of
   irisolidone, and the content of biochanin A in human and rat bacteria
   was 3.68\% and 4.25\%, respectively. The conversion rate of kakkalide in
   human and rat bacteria was 99.92\% and 98.58\%, respectively.
   Irisolidone was the main metabolite of kakkalide, and the content of
   irisolidone in human and rat bacteria was 89.58\% and 89.38\%,
   respectively. This work not only provides the evidence of kakkalide and
   irisolidone metabolites in vivo, but also demonstrates a simple, fast,
   sensitive, and inexpensive method for identification of metabolites of
   other compounds transformed by intestinal bacteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The influence of the beta-Al5FeSi intermetallic phase on permeability
   evolution during solidification in an Al-Si-Cu alloy with a columnar
   dendritic microstructure has been numerically studied at solid fractions
   between 0.10 and 0.85. The fluid flow simulations were performed on a
   semisolid microstructure extracted directly from a single solidifying
   specimen, enabling the first study of permeability variation on an
   individual microstructure morphology that is evolving in solid fraction.
   The 3-D geometries were imaged at the TOMCAT beamline using 4-D (3-D +
   time) in situ synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. The
   results illustrate the major effect of intermetallic particles on flow
   blockage and permeability. Intermetallics that grow normal to the flow
   direction were found to have a greater impact on the flow field in
   comparison to intermetallics in the parallel flow direction. An
   analytical expression, based on the anisotropic Blake-Kozeny model, was
   developed with a particle blockage term that takes into account the
   effects of intermetallic particles on permeability. In the regime of
   primary-phase solidification, a good fit between the analytical
   expression and the simulation results is found. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Alamouti-type space-time block coding is studied for optical wireless
   communication systems using coherent detection over atmospheric
   turbulence channels. Atmospheric turbulence-induced fading and phase
   noise are known to impair the performance of coherent optical wireless
   systems. Two new Alamouti-type space-time coded architectures are
   proposed to overcome turbulence-induced fading and phase noise from
   transmitter lasers, receiver local oscillators, and turbulence channels.
   Their error rate performance is analyzed for a wide range of turbulence
   conditions. With developed analytical error rate expressions, the
   usefulness of the proposed Alamouti-type space-time block coding is
   demonstrated for coherent optical wireless communication systems.
   Numerical results confirm the performance improvements of the proposed
   systems over that of single-input-single-output systems.}},

Title = {{A critical review on solvent extraction of rare earths from aqueous
   solutions}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{10-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Rare earth elements have unique physicochemical properties that make
   them essential elements in many high-tech components. Bastnesite (La,
   Ce)FCO3, monazite, (Ce, La, Y, Th)PO4, and xenotime, YPO4, are the main
   commercial sources of rare earths. Rare earth minerals are usually
   beneficiated by flotation or gravity or magnetic processes to produce
   concentrates that are subsequently leached with aqueous inorganic acids,
   such as HCl, H2SO4, or HNO3. After filtration or counter current
   decantation (CCD), solvent extraction is usually used to separate
   individual rare earths or produce mixed rare earth solutions or
   compounds. Rare earth producers follow similar principles and schemes
   when selecting specific solvent extraction routes. The use of cation
   exchangers, solvation extractants, and anion exchangers, for separating
   rare earths has been extensively studied. The choice of extractants and
   aqueous solutions is influenced by both cost considerations and
   requirements of technical performance. Commercially, D2EHPA, HEHEHP,
   Versatic 10, TBP, and Aliquat 336 have been widely used in rare earth
   solvent extraction processes. Up to hundreds of stages of mixers and
   settlers may be assembled together to achieve the necessary separations.
   This paper reviews the chemistry of different solvent extractants and
   typical configurations for rare earth separations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Although quasi-static and quasi-linear viscoelastic properties of the
   spinal cord have been reported previously, there are no published
   studies that have investigated the fully (strain-dependent) nonlinear
   viscoelastic properties of the spinal cord. In this study, stress
   relaxation experiments and dynamic cycling were performed on six fresh
   porcine lumbar cord specimens to examine their viscoelastic mechanical
   properties. The stress relaxation data were fitted to a modified
   superposition formulation and a novel finite ramp time correction
   technique was applied. The parameters obtained from this fitting
   methodology were used to predict the average dynamic cyclic viscoelastic
   behavior of the porcine cord. The data indicate that the porcine spinal
   cord exhibited fully nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. The average
   weighted root mean squared error for a Heaviside ramp fit was 2.8 kPa,
   which was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than that of the nonlinear
   (comprehensive viscoelastic characterization method) fit (0.365 kPa).
   Further, the nonlinear mechanical parameters obtained were able to
   accurately predict the dynamic behavior, thus exemplifying the
   reliability of the obtained nonlinear parameters. These parameters will
   be important for future studies investigating various damage mechanisms
   of the spinal cord and studies developing high-resolution finite
   elements models of the spine. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   Removal Method for the Fully Automated Processing of Raman Spectra}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{185-191}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Charge-coupled device detectors are vulnerable to cosmic rays that can
   contaminate Raman spectra with positive going spikes. Because spikes can
   adversely affect spectral processing and data analyses, they must be
   removed. Although both hardware-based and software-based spike removal
   methods exist, they typically require parameter and threshold
   specification dependent on well-considered user input. Here, we present
   a fully automated spike removal algorithm that proceeds without
   requiring user input. It is minimally dependent on sample attributes,
   and those that are required (e.g., standard deviation of spectral noise)
   can be determined with other fully automated procedures. At the core of
   the method is the identification and location of spikes with coincident
   second derivatives along both the spectral and spatio-temporal
   dimensions of two-dimensional datasets. The method can be applied to
   spectra that are relatively inhomogeneous because it provides fairly
   effective and selective targeting of spikes resulting in minimal
   distortion of spectra. Relatively effective spike removal obtained with
   full automation could provide substantial benefits to users where large
   numbers of spectra must be processed.}},

Title = {{The effect of light polarization on the interband transition spectra of

Journal = {{PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS \& NANOSTRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Although the optical absorption spectra of carbon nanotubes with
   perpendicularly polarized light are known to be suppressed due to the
   depolarization effect, peaks with significant magnitudes have been
   reported in photoluminescence absorption spectra of single-walled
   nanotubes under perpendicular polarization. We study the effect of light
   polarization on the interband optical transition spectra of nanotubes,
   independently from the depolarization effect. We employ the density
   functional theory to calculate the absorption spectra of periodic zigzag
   carbon nanotubes for parallel and perpendicular polarization of light in
   a wide, infrared-visible-ultraviolet range (0-11 eV). We have chosen
   (4,0), (8,0), and (16,0) nanotubes with diameters of similar to 0.34,
   similar to 0.63, and similar to 1.27 nm, respectively, to also
   investigate the dependence of the polarization effect on nanotube
   diameter. Although the overall spectrum for perpendicular polarization
   is sparse compared to the one for parallel polarization, the transition
   probability can be quite significant at certain photon energies for
   perpendicular polarization. For an (8,0) nanotube, for example, we
   observe sharp peaks at 1.2 eV, 1.8 eV and 10.6 eV. As the nanotube
   diameter decreases, parallel polarization seems to become progressively
   more favorable for absorption than perpendicular polarization in the
   infrared/visible range. Surprisingly, in the ultraviolet region, this
   trend is reversed; for nanotubes with small diameter, we notice a higher
   probability of absorption for ultraviolet light with perpendicular
   polarization compared to the one with parallel polarization. This can be
   important in optoelectronic applications of carbon nanotubes for
   ultraviolet absorption and emission. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   for a given scenario earthquake using models with and without Georgia
   basin sediments. The chosen peak motion metric is the geometric mean of
   the two orthogonal horizontal components of motion. The ratio between
   predicted peak ground velocity (PGV) for the two simulations is applied
   here as a quantitative measure of amplification due to 3D basin
   structure. A total of 10 deep subducting JdF plate earthquakes are

   propagating surface waves by shallow (< 1 km) basin structure increases
   ground motion in a localized region of south Greater Vancouver; hence,

   earthquakes are simulated within 100 km of Greater Vancouver. Overall,
   predicted ground motions are higher in the down-dip direction of each
   epicenter due to the source radiation pattern; hence, scenario
   earthquakes located south of Vancouver produce the highest motions in
   the city. The average maximum PGV at stiff soil sites across Greater
   Vancouver considering all eight scenario earthquakes is 17: 8 cm/s

Abstract = {{The effect of annealing temperature on the structure of unsupported
   Co-promoted MoS2 nanosheets, prepared by mechanical activation of MoO3,
   S and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O followed by annealing in an Ar
   atmosphere, is reported. An increase in annealing temperature reduced
   the catalyst surface area but increased the MoS2 stack height. Annealing
   temperatures above 600 A degrees C also produced segregated CoxSy
   phases. The dibenzothiophene hydrodesulphurization activity and the
   direct desulfurization (DDS) to hydrogenation product ratio of the
   Co-MoS2 catalysts was significantly higher than for MoS2. Moreover, the
   DDS product selectivity of the Co-MoS2 catalysts was enhanced with
   increased annealing temperature up to 600 A degrees C. Above 600 A
   degrees C, the loss in activity and selectivity was due to segregation
   of CoxSy species and significant sintering of the MoS2 crystallites.
   Similar effects of high temperature sintering on the activity of MoS2
   were also observed.}},

Abstract = {{Porous calcium polyphosphate (CPP) structures proposed as
   bone-substitute implants and made by sintering CPP powders to form
   bending test samples of approximately 35 vol \% porosity were machined
   from preformed blocks made either by additive manufacturing (AM) or
   conventional gravity sintering (CS) methods and the structure and
   mechanical characteristics of samples so made were compared. AM-made
   samples displayed higher bending strengths (approximate to 1.2-1.4 times
   greater than CS-made samples), whereas elastic constant (i.e., effective
   elastic modulus of the porous structures) that is determined by material
   elastic modulus and structural geometry of the samples was approximate
   to 1.9-2.3 times greater for AM-made samples. X-ray diffraction analysis
   showed that samples made by either method displayed the same crystal
   structure forming -CPP after sinter annealing. The material elastic
   modulus, E, determined using nanoindentation tests also showed the same
   value for both sample types (i.e., E approximate to 64 GPa). Examination
   of the porous structures indicated that significantly larger sinter
   necks resulted in the AM-made samples which presumably resulted in the
   higher mechanical properties. The development of mechanical properties
   was attributed to the different sinter anneal procedures required to
   make 35 vol \% porous samples by the two methods. A primary objective of
   the present study, in addition to reporting on bending strength and
   sample stiffness (elastic constant) characteristics, was to determine
   why the two processes resulted in the observed mechanical property
   differences for samples of equivalent volume percentage of porosity. An
   understanding of the fundamental reason(s) for the observed effect is
   considered important for developing improved processes for preparation
   of porous CPP implants as bone substitutes for use in high load-bearing
   skeletal sites. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{8-18}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and isotopic biosignatures
   associated with autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial processes in
   freshwater microbialites exposed to seasonal and spatial gradients in
   Pavilion Lake, British Columbia were investigated. The PLFA biosignature
   profiles of the microbialite associated microbial communities were
   dominated by saturated and monoenoic PLFAs and showed no resolvable
   response to variation in light or temperature down to a water depth of
   33 m and across seasons. Microbialite mean delta C-13(org) values (-26.0
   +/- 3.8 parts per thousand) and Delta delta C-13(DIC-org) discrimination
   of ca. 25 parts per thousand supported non-CO2 limited photosynthesis.
   More abundant and C-13-depleted PLFAs (Delta delta C-13 7-14 parts per
   thousand vs. bulk organic matter) were indicative of autotrophic
   microbes. Less abundant and C-13-depleted PLFAs (Delta delta C-13 3-4\%)
   were indicative of heterotrophic organisms, particularly branched
   (iso/anteiso15: 0 and 10me16: 0) PLFAs. Dark coloured microbialites from
   the bottom of the lake (below 46 m water depth) had comparatively low
   biomass and a higher proportion of branched PLFAs, including biomarkers
   for sulfate reducing bacteria. Bulk delta C-13(carb) values of
   microbialite carbonate at 6 and 11 m water depth were up to ca. 2 parts
   per thousand more C-13 enriched than the value predicted for
   precipitation from ambient dissolved inorganic carbon and had increased
   biomass in summer, indicating a preserved biosignature of photosynthetic
   activity. Other delta C-13(carb) values were generally within the range
   predicted for equilibrium precipitation. Estimated precipitation
   temperature values from delta O-18(carb) were consistent with measured
   late summer water values. While both autotrophic and heterotrophic
   processes occurred at all depths, preservation of an enriched C-13
   biosignature was only detected at shallow depths where photosynthetic
   activity and biomass production were relatively high. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel multimodal evolutionary optimization
   algorithm for the complex problem of concurrent and integrated design of
   a mechatronic system, with the objective of realizing the best topology
   and the best parameters from a multicriteria viewpoint and with
   different preferences. The associated search space can be large and
   complex due to the existence of different classes of configurations,
   possible topologies, and the parameter values of the elements. The
   proposed algorithm efficiently explores the search space to find several
   elite configurations for different preferences, with more detailed
   competition by incorporating the domain knowledge of experts and
   considering some criteria that are not included in the course of regular
   evolutionary optimization. The developed approach consists of a two-loop
   optimization. For each topology, a genetic algorithm-based optimization
   is performed to find an elite representative of the topology. The elites
   will compete with each other to become the best design. A strategy of
   restricted competition selection is employed in the competition of
   topologies, with the aim of finding alternative elites from which the
   one that best satisfies the customer preference may be chosen. The
   designer may incorporate a higher level competition between elites in
   order to obtain the global optimum.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{To ensure customer satisfaction and greater market acceptance, voice
   over Wi-Fi networks must ensure voice quality under various network
   parameters, configurations and traffic conditions, and other practical
   effects, e. g., channel noise, and capturing effects. An accurate voice
   capacity estimation model considering these factors can greatly assist
   network designers. In the current work, we propose an analytical model
   to estimate voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capacity over Wi-Fi
   networks addressing these issues. We employ widely used ITU-T E-model to
   assess voice quality and VoIP call capacity is presented in the form of
   an optimization problem with voice quality requirement as a constraint.
   In particular, we analyze delay and loss in channel access and queue,
   and their impacts on voice quality. The proposed capacity model is first
   developed for a single hop wireless local area network (WLAN) and then
   extended for multihop scenarios. To model real network scenario closely,
   we also consider channel noise and capture effect, and analyze the
   impacts of transmission range, interference range, and WLAN radius. In
   absence of any existing call capacity model that considers all the above
   factors concomitantly, our proposed model will be extremely useful to
   network designers and voice capacity planners.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) continuum nonlinear
   analysis of the Meloland Road Overpass (MRO) near El Centro, California.
   The modeling methodology and the computational tools are discussed in
   detail. The performance of the computational model is evaluated by
   comparing the computed responses with the responses recorded at the
   bridge site during the 1979 Imperial Valley and 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah
   earthquakes. Amongst the recorded earthquake events at the bridge site,
   these two events caused the strongest shaking. The comparison shows that
   the 3D model is potentially an effective tool for detailed analysis of a
   full bridge system including foundation soils, pile foundations,
   embankments, supporting columns, and the bridge structure itself in a
   unified system without relying on any ancillary models such as Winkler
   springs. Additional response parameters such as displacements, rockings,
   and bending moments are also evaluated although none of these was
   measured during the seismic events. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Dielectrophoretic deposition of carbon nanotubes: The role of field
   frequency and its dependence on solution conductivity}},

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoretic deposition is ubiquitous in the fabrication of
   nanoscale devices and, in particular, carbon nanotubes from solutions.
   The physical properties of the solution play a major role in determining
   the nanotube patterns deposited using this technique; the non-uniform
   temperature profile generated by the passage of current can create
   forces in the solution, which result in agitations and can interfere
   with the dielectrophoresis force.
   The forces that induce movement in the solution, as well as the
   dielectrophoresis force, all vary with frequency in different manners.
   In this work, experiments and simulations are used in order to
   investigate the interplay between the solution conductivity and the
   frequency of the applied voltage, and their effects on the deposition
   patterns. We demonstrate that changes in the frequency affect solutions
   with different physical properties differently: while the frequency
   directly influences the number of deposited carbon nanotubes when using
   solutions with low conductivity, it is almost of no consequence in the
   case of solutions that include surfactants and thus have a higher
   conductivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental building blocks of hierarchically structured bone tissue
   are mineralized collagen fibrils with calcium phosphate nanocrystals
   that are biologically engineered through biomineralization. In this
   study, we demonstrate an original invention of dicalcium phosphate
   anhydrate (DCPA)/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composite nanofibers, which
   mimics the mineralized collagen fibrils via biomimetic in situ synthesis
   and electrospinning for hard tissue regenerative medicines. The
   interaction of the Ca2+ ions and the carbonyl groups in the PLA provides
   nucleation sites for DCPA during the in situ synthesis process. This
   resulted in the improved dispersion of DCPA nanocrystallites in the
   intrananoporous PLA nanofibers through electrospinning, compared to the
   severely agglomerated clusters of DCPA nanoparticles fabricated by
   conventional mechanical blending/electrospinning methods. The addition
   of poly(ethylene glycol), as a copolymer source, generated more stable
   and efficient electrospun jets and aided in the electrospinability of
   the PLA nanofibers incorporating the nanocrystallites. It is expected
   that the uniformly distributed DCPA nanocrystallites and its unique
   nanocomposite fibrous topography will enhance the biological performance
   and the structural stability of the scaffolds used for hard tissue
   reconstruction and regeneration. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{In this study, a microstructured reactor with catalytic nickel plates is
   newly designed and developed for proper heat management in an exothermic
   water gas shift WGS reaction. The reactor is designed to increase the
   reactor capacity simply by numbering-up a set of a catalyst layers and
   heat exchanger layers. The WGS reactor is built up with two sets of a
   catalyst layers and heat exchanger layers. The performance of the
   reactor is verified by WGS testing with the variation of the furnace
   temperatures, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and coolant (N-2) flow
   rate. At a GHSV of 10,000 h(-1), CO conversion reaches the equilibrium
   value with a CH4 selectivity of <= 0.5\% at the furnace temperature of
   >= 375 degrees C. At high GHSV (40,000 h(-1)), CO conversion decreases
   considerably because of the heat from the exothermic WGS reaction at a
   large reactants mass. By increasing the coolant flow rate, the heat from
   the WGS reaction is properly managed, leading an increase of the CO
   conversion to the equilibrium value at GHSV of 40,000 h(-1). (C) 2013

   distributed PV system comprised of the proposed dc/dc converters
   confirms the stable operation even with a large number of deployed

Abstract = {{This paper presents a boundary control scheme for dual active bridge
   (DAB) converters using the natural switching surface (NSS). The
   implementation of a curved switching surface for DAB converters is a new
   area of research undertaken in this paper. The proposed technique brings
   the benefit of unprecedented dynamic performance, already developed for
   nonisolated topologies (e. g., buck and boost), to this more complex
   isolated topology. The analysis provides insight into the natural
   trajectories of the DAB converters and creates an accurate framework in
   the normalized geometrical domain. As a result, the physical limits of
   the converter under study become evident. Those physical limits are
   exploited by employing the NSS to obtain fast transient response under
   start-up, sudden load transients, and reference change. In addition,
   fixed-frequency operation is one of the key features of the proposed
   control scheme, which allows optimizing the design of the high-frequency
   transformer. Experimental results are presented to validate the NSS for
   DAB converters and illustrate the benefits of the normalization
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the use of a high-performance boundary controller
   for the full-bridge zero-voltage-switching topology. An enhanced dynamic
   response is obtained by employing the natural switching surface (SS),

   the generality for any combination of parameters, and the mathematical
   simplicity. Recently, nonisolated basic topologies have benefited from
   advancements in boundary control. The analysis and derivation in this
   work bring the benefit of outstanding dynamic performance to this
   isolated topology. As demonstrated in this work, the relationship
   between the leakage and output filter inductances makes the formulation
   of the natural trajectories for isolated converters possible. The
   resulting SS provides an excellent dynamic response during start-up,

Abstract = {{A biomechanical model of the female pelvic support system was developed
   to explore the contribution of pelvic floor muscle defect to the
   development of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). From a pool of 135
   patients, clinical data of 26 patients with pelvic muscular defect were
   used in modelling. The model was employed to estimate the parameters
   that describe the stiffness properties of the vaginal wall and ligament
   tissues for individual patients. The parameters were then implemented
   into the model to evaluate for each patient the impact of pelvic
   muscular defect on the vaginal apex support and the bladder neck
   support, a factor that relates to the onset of SUI. For the modelling
   analysis, the compromise of pelvic muscular support was demonstrated to
   contribute to vaginal apex prolapse and bladder neck prolapse, a
   condition commonly seen in SUI patients, while simulated conditions of
   restored muscular support were shown to help re-establish both vaginal
   apex and bladder neck supports. The findings illustrate the significance
   of pelvic muscle strength to vaginal support and urinary continence;
   therefore, the clinical recommendation of pelvic muscle strengthening,
   such as Kegel exercises, has been shown to be an effective treatment for
   patients with SUI symptoms.}},

Title = {{Estimating Respiratory and Heart Rates from the Correntropy Spectral
   Density of the Photoplethysmogram}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{The photoplethysmogram (PPG) obtained from pulse oximetry measures local
   variations of blood volume in tissues, reflecting the peripheral pulse
   modulated by heart activity, respiration and other physiological
   effects. We propose an algorithm based on the correntropy spectral
   density (CSD) as a novel way to estimate respiratory rate (RR) and heart
   rate (HR) from the PPG. Time-varying CSD, a technique particularly
   well-suited for modulated signal patterns, is applied to the PPG. The
   respiratory and cardiac frequency peaks detected at extended respiratory
   (8 to 60 breaths/min) and cardiac (30 to 180 beats/min) frequency bands
   provide RR and HR estimations. The CSD-based algorithm was tested
   against the Capnobase benchmark dataset, a dataset from 42 subjects
   containing PPG and capnometric signals and expert labeled reference RR
   and HR. The RR and HR estimation accuracy was assessed using the
   unnormalized root mean square (RMS) error. We investigated two window
   sizes (60 and 120 s) on the Capnobase calibration dataset to explore the
   time resolution of the CSD-based algorithm. A longer window decreases
   the RR error, for 120-s windows, the median RMS error (quartiles)
   obtained for RR was 0.95 (0.27, 6.20) breaths/min and for HR was 0.76
   (0.34, 1.45) beats/min. Our experiments show that in addition to a high
   degree of accuracy and robustness, the CSD facilitates simultaneous and
   efficient estimation of RR and HR. Providing RR every minute, expands
   the functionality of pulse oximeters and provides additional diagnostic
   power to this non-invasive monitoring tool.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to quantify the
   Forster-mediated exciton migration rate and the exciton population decay
   rate in drop-cast solid emulsions of PbSe colloidal nanocrystals
   emitting near 1.5 mu m from 77 to 300 K. For both unimodal and bimodal
   emulsions, at a fixed temperature in a given sample the measured time
   constants that characterize the fast transient decay (blue side of the
   spectrum) and buildup (red side of the spectrum) vary considerably with
   :emission wavelength, but the average fast time constant, similar to 25
   ns, varies little (i.e., within <25\%) With temperature: from 77 to 300
   K. Over the same temperature range, the exciton population lifetime,
   ascribed to nonradiative decay, decreases by similar to 5 times but is
   always longer than the Forster time constant. The increase of the
   Forster-mediated efficacy of exciton redistribution at low temperatures
   before they decay is therefore almost all due to the variation of the
   nonradiative decay rate. By analyzing the temporally resolved and
   steady-state emission spectra, it is noted that the time required for
   the exciton population to equilibrate is non exponential and
   considerably longer (similar to 150 ns) than the rapid decay and buildup
   time constants extracted from the decay curves at fixed wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{Canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are promising as
   donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). It has been
   suggested that different cell cultures possess different capacities to
   support pre-implantation development of SCNT embryos. The aim of this
   study is to investigate whether two culture medium (RCMEP, Dulbecco's
   modified Eagle's medium {[}DMEM]) affect gene expression of ASCs,
   subsequent development of interspecies SCNT (iSCNT) and gene expression
   of cloned embryos. The RCMEP-cultured cells contained significantly
   greater amounts of SOX2, NANOG, OCT4, DNMT1, and MeCP2 than
   DMEM-cultured cells (P < 0.05). In iSCNT, the use of DMEM medium for
   culturing cells resulted in similar development to the blastocyst stage
   than those derived from RCMEP cultured cells (4.5\% and 3.2\%,
   respectively; P > 0.05). The expression of all transcripts except for
   DNMT1 in cloned blastocysts from RCMEP cultured cells followed those of
   cloned blastocysts derived from DMEM cultured cells. The alteration of
   gene expression in ASCs by culture medium was not manifested in the
   iSCNT embryos derived from these cells. Although the culture medium can
   induce changes of gene expression by ASCs, such alterations in donor
   cells did not affect the developmental competence or gene expression
   patterns of iSCNT embryos. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the significance of fluid flow hydrodynamics on the membrane
   surface, pulsatile flow was investigated as a functional approach to
   promote membrane performance. As a turbulence promoter, pulsatile flow
   in the membrane channel and its effects on the membrane performance were
   experimentally and numerically studied. A three-dimensional
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to simulate cross-flow
   microfiltration process and fluid flow, including porous media by
   solving Navier-Stocks equations coupled with the Darcy's law. Two
   different boundary conditions were imposed at the module entrance:
   simple continuous fluid flow and pulsatile flow. Permeate flux,
   resistances, and shear forces were calculated in different operating
   conditions in which the experimental and simulated data showed a good
   agreement. It was found that shear force was the highest at the entrance
   region and then decayed along the flow direction for both continuous and
   pulsatile flow. Besides, two different types of pulsatile flow were
   considered; sinusoidal pulse flow and step function flow in which the
   latter led to higher shear forces and consequently higher permeate flux
   was obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eight oil sands ores were tested in order to quantify the levels of
   humic acids in these samples through the alkali extraction test
   originally developed to determine the oxidation of bituminous
   metallurgical coals. The test gives a concentration of humic acids
   released from ores, which in combination with the measurement of the
   total organic carbon (TOC) content in the alkali extracts provides a
   measure of ore/bitumen weathering. It was found that poor ores (low
   bitumen and high fines contents) exhibited the highest tendency to leach
   large amounts of humic acids per gram of bitumen in the samples. It was
   also shown that the absorbance at 520 nm obtained from the UV/visible
   spectra of the alkali extracted solutions correlated very well with the
   quality of the ores, with the highest absorbance obtained from the
   extracts produced by the poor ores. A comparison between the UV/Visible
   spectra of solutions obtained from the alkali-extraction tests and
   spectra of solutions of commercial humic acids also indicated that the
   total organic carbon content of the extracts of good ores primarily
   originated from compounds other than humic acids while the organic
   matter released by poor ores was dominated by humic acids.
   The results of contact angle measurements on fresh and oxidized bitumen
   samples indicated that contact angles decreased and bitumen became more
   hydrophilic as pH increased. It was also shown that the hydrophobicity
   of bitumen drastically decreased when the sample was artificially
   oxidized, although the amount of humic acids generated in bitumen during
   the oxidation process was small. Additionally, the effect of added humic
   acids on the wettability of bitumen was also evaluated. It was found
   that the contact angle of bitumen significantly decreased in the
   presence of humic acids at pH 3, but the effect of humic acids was not
   significant at higher pH values (7 and 10). At pH 7 the effect of humic
   acids on bitumen wettability was minor compared to the effect of
   artificial oxidation of bitumen. These results suggest that humic acids
   make bitumen hydrophilic if they are part of internal/surface bitumen
   structure. However, if they are added as free chemicals their effect is
   minor, particularly under neutral and alkaline pH conditions, which also
   indicates that adsorption of humic acids from solution onto bitumen is
   low. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The processability of four oil sand ores was evaluated through batch
   flotation experiments under different conditions of pH and temperature.
   The data of bitumen recovery were accurately modeled using a first-order
   kinetic equation assuming that the total amount of bitumen in the system
   consisted of two bitumen components, i.e., a fully-liberated bitumen
   fraction, f, characterized by a high flotation rate constant (k(f)), and
   poorly-liberated bitumen fraction, s, of a low flotation rate constant
   (k(s)) so that f + s = 1. The role of humic acids naturally present in
   the ores was basically that of a depressant of bitumen since poor ores
   contained the highest proportion of humic acids per gram of bitumen. The
   recovery of bitumen from oil sand ores correlated very well with the
   absorbance at 520 nm of the alkali extracts produced from the ores. High
   bitumen recovery was achieved for ores characterized by a low absorbance
   value of the extract, while low bitumen recoveries were obtained for
   ores producing a high absorbance value in the alkali extraction test.
   Power draw measurements ahead of the bitumen flotation/extraction stage
   showed that power drawn by slurries of poor processing ores was not
   affected by pH and temperature, which was attributed to the low amount
   of bitumen and low degree of bitumen liberation in these ores. In
   contrast, good ores required more power for mixing under conditions of
   low pH and low temperature than under conditions of high pH and high
   temperature. Gradual bitumen liberation at higher temperature and pH
   improved the dispersion of the slurries and led to lower power
   requirements for mixing. Additionally, extraction data indicated that
   bitumen recovery was proportional to the power draw Measured during feed
   conditioning. Poor ores produced slurries of lower viscosities than
   slurries prepared from good ores. As a result, higher power consumption
   was required during conditioning of good ores to promote bitumen
   liberation and to increase bitumen recovery.
   Overall, it is possible to assess the processability of oil sand ores by
   quantifying the occurrence of humic acids in the ores, and to correlate
   ore processability with the rheology of ore slurries. Although poor ores
   are characterized by lower viscosities and lower power requirements
   during mixing, the presence of humic acids in these ores and their
   depressing action also contribute to lower bitumen recoveries. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{For exploring the effects of alkali metal ions on the dissociations of
   peptides with different side chains in the gas phase, the complexes of
   Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ with pentapeptides, Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser(S5),
   Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu (L5) and Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys (K5), were chosen to
   investigate the fragmentation reaction pathways by mass spectrometry.
   The experimental results indicated that alkali metal ions and S5, L5, K5
   can form 1: 1 and 2: 1 non-covalent complexes in the gas phase, and the
   binding strength between alkali metal ions and pentapeptides descend
   with the increasing of the radii of alkali metal ions. Quantitative
   analyses of mass spectra demonstrated that the binding constants for the
   complexes of K+ with S5, L5 and K5 are 8. 94x10(4), 2. 83x10(4) and 2.
   50x10(3) L/mol, respectively, revealing that the binding strength of
   complexes decrease in order of S5, L5 and K5. The analyses of the
   fragment ions arising from the complexes of alkali metal ions with
   pentapeptides showed that the dissociations mainly occur in the
   backbones of the peptides. Among three pentapeptides, the complexes of
   pentaserines are the easiest to fragment, pentaleucines take second
   place, while pentalysines are the hardest. The dissociations also occur
   in the side chains, and there are significant differences among the
   three complexes. Moreover, the relationships among various fragment ions
   arising from the complex of Na+ with L5 were tested. Based on the
   theoretical model of Dunbar, it was proposed that in the fragmentation
   process, the alkali metal ion may shift to the N- or C-terminal of the
   pentapeptide. In 2: 1 complex, the first alkali metal ion may conjugate
   to the carbonyl groups of four amides, while the second one may
   conjugate to the oxygen atoms of carboxyl group of the pentapeptide.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration promises to be an important
   predictor of clinical outcome for a range of cancers. Established CTC
   enumeration methods primarily rely on affinity capture of cell surface
   antigens, and have been criticized for underestimation of CTC numbers
   due to antigenic bias. Emerging CTC capture strategies typically
   distinguish these cells based on their assumed biomechanical
   characteristics, which are often validated using cultured cancer cells.
   In this study, we developed a software tool to investigate the
   morphological properties of CTCs from patients with castrate resistant
   prostate cancer and cultured prostate cancer cells in order to establish
   whether the latter is an appropriate model for the former. We isolated
   both CTCs and cultured cancer cells from whole blood using the
   CellSearch (R) system and examined various cytomorphological
   characteristics. In contrast with cultured cancer cells, CTCs enriched
   by CellSearch (R) system were found to have significantly smaller size,
   larger nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and more elongated shape. These CTCs
   were also found to exhibit significantly more variability than cultured
   cancer cells in nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and shape profile.}},

Title = {{Numerical investigation of the impact of two-phase flow maldistribution

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Flow maldistribution usually happens in PEM fuel cells when using common
   inlet and exit headers to supply reactant gases to multiple channels. As
   a result, some channels are flooded with more water and have less air
   flow while other channels are filled with less water but have excessive
   air flow. To investigate the impact of two-phase flow maldistribution on
   PEM fuel cell performance, a Volume of Fluid (VOF) model coupled with a
   1D MEA model was employed to simulate two parallel channels. The slug
   flow pattern is mainly observed in the flow channels under different
   flow maldistribution conditions, and it significantly increases the gas
   diffusion layer (GDL) surface water coverage over the whole range of
   simulated current densities, which directly leads to poor fuel cell
   performance. Therefore, it is recommended that liquid and gas flow
   maldistribution in parallel channels should be avoided if possible over
   the whole range of operation. Increasing the gas stoichiometric flow
   ratio is not an effective method to mitigate the gas flow
   maldistribution, but adding a gas inlet resistance to the flow channel
   is effective in mitigating maldistribution. With a carefully selected
   value of the flow resistance coefficient, both the fuel cell performance
   and the gas flow distribution can be significantly improved without
   causing too much extra pressure drop. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{The intrinsic viscosities of six carboxymethyl celluloses (CMC) of
   different degrees of substitution, molecular weights, and molecular
   weight distributions (MWDs) were measured as a function of pH, ionic

   determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. It was demonstrated that
   the raw viscosity data could be represented by the Fedors equation
   allowing for accurate determination of the intrinsic viscosity. Ionic
   strength, rather than pH or temperature had the strongest effect on the
   conformation of CMC. An estimate of the Mark-Houwink-Kuhn-Sakurada
   exponent (alpha=0.83) and calculations of chain flexibility and
   expansion factors indicated that CMC has semi-flexible, randomly coiling
   chains in solution with persistence lengths on the order of 8.8-24.5 nm
   in distilled water and 11.3-14.8 nm in 0.01 mol/L sodium chloride. It
   was also found that the lowest molecular weight CMC was most flexible

   the 0.13-mu m CMOS monitoring circuit that is embedded on the stent and
   reads and transmits the sensory data from the pressure sensors which are
   also embedded on the stent. An auxiliary circuit is introduced to
   facilitate the alignment of the external reader with the stent. The
   alignment circuit starts operating from a rectified supply of 500 mV
   drawing 8.3 mu A from the harvested supply voltage. The main transmitter
   which sends the sensory data operates from a rectified supply voltage of
   880 mV while drawing similar to 178 mu A. The monitoring system provides
   a sensitivity of 555 kHz/fF. In-vitro measurement results confirm the

Abstract = {{Model-based controllers based on incorrect estimates of the true plant
   behaviour can be expected to perform badly. This work quantifies the
   performance deterioration for a certain class of MIMO systems.
   Performance is measured using a Minimum Variance index and a closely
   related user-specified criterion. Under reasonable conditions, the
   performance of each output component in a MIMO system can be analysed
   independently. We define a sensitivity measure that relates system
   performance to model-plant mismatch, and use it to explore this
   sensitivity for three realistic types of parametric modelling errors.
   Next, we suggest a quantitative method that compares a system's actual
   output to its desired response in a transient setting. The performance
   of the transient response is demonstrably more sensitive to the
   model-plant mismatch than the steady state performance. The results are
   illustrated on industrial paper machine data.}},

Abstract = {{Macrocell base stations are mainly aiming to serve outdoor mobile users
   thus indoor mobile users may suffer from weak signals because of the
   outdoor-to-indoor wall penetration loss and indoor obstacles. Recently,
   in order to improve indoor performance, femtocell networks have been
   receiving a great deal of attention. However, since the femtocell and
   macrocell share the same frequency band, co-channel interference (CCI)
   between them is one of serious problems in femtocell networks. In order
   to reduce co-channel interference, this paper proposes a novel CCI
   avoidance scheme using the control channel information based on location
   information for the downlink of Long Term Evolution (LTE) femtocell
   networks. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms
   other schemes in terms of the outage probability and system throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is one of the most popular methods for
   fabricating devices based on nanotubes and nanowires. During a typical
   dielectrophoretic deposition experiment, several forces other than the
   DEP force itself could play important roles; however, their effects have
   often been neglected. Here, a particle tracing approach is used to
   follow the path of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from suspension in the
   solution to deposition on the substrate surface, taking into account
   several influential factors: the DEP force, the movement of the solution
   itself, and the Brownian movement of the CNTs. The mechanisms involved
   in the deposition of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, as well as
   the extent of effectiveness of each force in various scenarios during
   deposition, are explored. We show that the Brownian and electrothermal
   forces are by no means negligible in many cases and, in fact, can be of
   primary importance in the final results.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to calculate the output current-voltage
   characteristics of a light induced thermionic emission device. This
   approach improves on the existing methods by having both a higher
   precision and higher range in evaluating the associated integrals,
   resulting in simulated device characteristics with a wider range of
   parameters. This method represents a significant step towards the
   characterization of emergent devices due to the unknowns involved in
   their internal parameters. More importantly, its high numerical
   precision and flexibility allow one to solve the reverse problem and
   evaluate the internal parameters of the device such as workfunction,
   from experimental current-voltage curves. As an experimental case, a
   carbon nanotube forest was used as the emitter of a thermionic device
   and locally heated to about 2,000 K using a 50-mW focused laser light.
   The current-voltage characteristics were measured and fitted to
   simulation data to obtain the internal parameters of the device. The
   obtained parameters were consistent with the values obtained with other
   methods. The estimation of these parameters was previously not feasible
   with one single type of experiment.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the sensor scheduling problem where a decision maker can
   choose from a finite set of sampling intervals to pick the next time to
   observe the noisy state of Markovian target. The aim is to optimize an
   objective comprising of false alarm, delay cost and cumulative
   measurement sampling cost. Taking more frequent measurements yields
   accurate estimates but incurs a higher measurement cost. Making an
   erroneous decision too soon incurs a false alarm penalty. Waiting too
   long to declare the target state incurs a delay penalty. The problem is
   an instance of a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP).
   This paper reviews structural results in POMDPs. The paper then shows
   that under reasonable conditions, the optimal strategy has the following
   intuitive structure: when the posterior distribution of the Markov chain
   is away from the target state, look less frequently; while if the
   posterior is close to the target state, look more frequently.}},

Abstract = {{An ultra-low-power CMOS voltage-controlled ring oscillator (VCRO) for
   passive ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID)
   tags is presented. The gates of the complementary CMOS transistors in
   pseudo-differential (PD) delay cells are biased through quasi-floating
   gate (QFG) technique. The boosted gate-drive voltage enables operation
   of the differential delay cells with supply voltages smaller than the
   minimum required overdrive voltage of the two stacked transistors and
   accordingly facilitates the oscillation at ultra-low-power regime. QFG
   biasing technique also offers an additional control knob to tune the
   output frequency of the ring oscillator. The proposed two-stage PD-VCRO
   is designed and laid-out in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS technology. A
   voltage level converter is also presented to interface the output of the
   proposed VCRO with the succeeding circuitry. The entire VCRO core
   occupies an area of 25 mu mx20 mu m. For a supply voltage of as low as
   140 mV, an output frequency of 4 MHz is achieved at 3.6 nW power
   consumption. Although the intended application for the proposed VCRO is
   passive RFID tags, the architecture can be used in other ultra-low-power
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{While graphics processing units (GPUs) have gained wide adoption as
   accelerators for general-purpose applications (GPGPU), the end-to-end
   reliability implications of their use have not been quantified. Fault
   injection is a widely used method for evaluating the reliability of
   applications. However, building a fault injector for GPGPU applications
   is challenging due to their massive parallelism, which makes it
   difficult to achieve representativeness while being time-efficient.
   This paper makes three key contributions. First, it presents the design
   of a fault-injection methodology to evaluate end-to-end reliability
   properties of application kernels running on GPUs. Second, it introduces
   a fault-injection tool that uses real GPU hardware and offers a good
   balance between the representativeness and the efficiency of the fault
   injection experiments. Third, this paper characterizes the error
   resilience characteristics of twelve GPGPU applications.}},

Abstract = {{The ever increasing traffic demand becomes a serious concern of mobile
   network operators. To solve this traffic explosion problem, there have
   been many efforts to offload the traffic from cellular links to direct
   communications among users. In this paper, we propose the framework of
   Traffic Offloading assisted by Social network services (SNS) via
   opportunistic Sharing in mobile social networks, TOSS, to offload
   SNS-based cellular traffic by user-to-user sharing. First we select a
   subset of users who are to receive the same content as initial seeds
   depending on their content spreading impacts in online SNSs and their
   mobility patterns in offline mobile social networks (MSNs). Then users
   share the content via opportunistic local connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth,
   Wi-Fi Direct, Device-to-device in LTE) with each other. The observation
   of SNS user activities reveals that individual users have distinct
   access patterns, which allows TOSS to exploit the user-dependent access
   delay between the content generation time and each user's access time
   for traffic offloading purposes. We model and analyze the traffic
   offloading and content spreading among users by taking into account
   various options in linking SNS and MSN trace data. The trace-driven
   evaluation demonstrates that TOSS can reduce up to 86.5\% of the
   cellular traffic while satisfying the access delay requirements of all
   users.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology for modeling and updating the in-process workpiece
   geometry in milling is presented in this paper. The methodology is
   developed for general milling processes, in which the cutter can be any
   shape and follow any tool path trajectory even with self-intersections.
   And the in-process workpiece is updated with retained sharp features.
   The associated procedure starts by modeling both the cutter and the
   workpiece as closed manifold triangle meshes. The mesh model of the
   cutter swept volume is then generated from repeatedly sampled mesh
   vertices of the cutter along its trajectory using the ball-pivoting
   algorithm. The workpiece is updated by a subtraction Boolean operation
   between the workpiece and the cutter swept volume. An octree space
   partitioning algorithm is adopted in order to efficiently obtain the
   exact triangle-to-triangle intersection points. As the last step, a
   filling operation is performed around the intersection points to
   establish the closed manifold updated workpiece geometry. Several case
   studies have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of circumferential inflow swirl on the instability of the
   shear layer formed between the core and bypass flows discharged from an
   axisymmetric twelve-lobed mixer is studied through a combined
   experimental and computational investigation. A series of unsteady
   Navier-Stokes simulations are performed with 0 and 31 degrees of
   circumferential swirl specified in the core stream of the lobed mixer.
   Comparison of the axial-and swirling-inflow cases highlights the effect
   of swirl on the instability-driven transient flow structures that
   develop within and downstream of the lobed mixer. Medium- and
   large-scale unsteady motions are captured by the fine spatial and
   temporal resolution of the unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations. The
   simulations are validated against four-wire thermal anemometry
   measurements in a scaled lobed-mixer wind-tunnel model with turbulent,
   swirling inflow conditions. The simulation results illustrate that while
   the axial-inflow case develops layers-of streamwise vorticity uniformly
   along the lobe walls, the core flow in the swirling-inflow case
   separates from the suction side of the lobe wall near the lobe trough.
   Roll-up and axial stretching of the separated flow produces A-shaped
   vortical structures upstream of the discharge plane. The A-shaped
   structures interact with the shear layers discharged from the lobe
   trailing edge and accelerate the breakdown of the shear layer in the
   swirling-inflow case relative to the axial-inflow case. The extent of
   this interaction is shown to strongly affect the streamwise mixing rate
   of the flow downstream of the discharge plane.}},

Abstract = {{Centrifugal compressor surge and stall are an instabilities flow and
   system phenomenon, which can lead to a loss of engine power, large
   pressure transients and, in some cases, failure of the compressor and
   bearing system. Three-dimensional, compressible, unsteady Navier-Stokes
   equations are solved, using the sliding mesh at the interface between
   the moving and stationary parts. The investigated computational domain
   is composed of inlet pipe, inlet bell, impeller followed by a diffuser.
   The impeller side cavities are included in the computational domain, to
   make the simulation more close to the actual case. The present article
   focuses on the unsteady pressure and velocity results within the
   impeller and diffuser, at an operating condition close to the surge of
   the compressor. The computational data compares favorably with the
   measured data, from literature, for the same compressor and operational
   point. The pressure fluctuation results are analyzed for the surge and
   design operating conditions. Through the acquisition of both velocity
   and transient pressure data, the time evaluation of the unsteady flow
   during surge is revealed.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent hardware faults are hard to diagnose as they occur
   non-deterministically at the same location. Hardware-only diagnosis
   techniques incur significant power and area overheads. On the other
   hand, software-only diagnosis techniques have low power and area
   overheads, but have limited visibility into many micro-architectural
   structures and hence cannot diagnose faults in them.
   To overcome these limitations, we propose a hardware-software integrated
   framework for diagnosing intermittent faults. The hardware part of our
   framework, called SCRIBE continuously records the resource usage
   information of every instruction in the processor, and exposes it to the
   software layer. SCRIBE incurs a performance overhead of 12\% and power
   overhead of 9\%, on average. The software part of our framework is
   called SIED and uses backtracking from the program's crash dump to find
   the faulty micro- architectural resource. Our technique has an average
   accuracy of 84\% in diagnosing the faulty resource, which in turn
   enables fine-grained deconfiguration with less than 2\% performance loss
   after deconfiguration.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware errors are on the rise with reducing feature sizes, however
   tolerating them in hardware is expensive. Researchers have explored
   software-based techniques for building error resilient applications.
   Many of these techniques leverage application-specific resilience
   characteristics to keep overheads low. Understanding
   application-specific resilience characteristics requires software
   fault-injection mechanisms that are both accurate and capable of
   operating at a high-level of abstraction to allow developers to reason
   about error resilience.
   In this paper, we quantify the accuracy of high-level software fault
   injection mechanisms vis-a-vis those that operate at the assembly or
   machine code levels. To represent high-level injection mechanisms, we
   built a fault injector tool based on the LLVM compiler, called LLFI.
   LLFI performs fault injection at the LLVM intermediate code level of the
   application, which is close to the source code. We quantitatively
   evaluate the accuracy of LLFI with respect to assembly level fault
   injection, and understand the reasons for the differences.}},

   be harvested in IA networks. In addition, we show that, to improve the
   performance of wireless power transfer and information transmission,
   users should be dynamically selected as energy harvesting or information

Abstract = {{This study presents a numerical simulation of precursors and
   characteristics of rotating stall in a centrifugal compressor with vaned
   diffuser. The aim is to further understand the causes of stall
   inception, characteristics of stall process and to investigate reliable
   simulation of stall control methods and aid in their optimization.
   Initial numerical results show that the tip leakage flow and early
   separation in the impeller blades are causing weakness of radial
   velocity and deviation of fluid angle at impeller exit.
   Also, results show that the vaneless region between impeller and
   diffuser near shroud surface is the key factor of developing radial
   velocity deficiency into stall cells leading to pressure fluctuations on

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the role of air injection method in stabilization
   and stall control in centrifugal compressors. The main aim is to find
   the best arrangement of air injection parameters such as injection angle
   and injection mass flow rate in order to optimize the injection
   performance for stabilizing the compressor and increasing the surge
   margin. Numerical model was built to simulate high speed transonic
   centrifugal compressor working at an operating point close to surge. Air
   was injected at 12 locations at the vaneless region between the impeller
   and the diffuser at shroud surface with 5 different injection angles and
   3 different injection mass flow rates. Results showed that the best
   injection method is when using an injection angle of 30 with injection
   mass flow rate of 1.5\% of the design mass flow rate and the worst
   injection method is the injection at angle of 180 (reverse tangent
   injection). Results also indicated that by using air injection, the
   number of stalled diffuser passages is decreased compared to the case of
   no injection. The most significant result of this paper is that using an
   angle of injection around twice the value of the diffuser vane angle
   gives the best results and makes the ideal correction of the fluid
   kinetic energy and fluid angle at the diffuser inlet. It was found that
   injecting air at an angle less than the diffuser vane angle weakens the
   effect of injection and doesn't increase kinetic energy of the fluid at
   diffuser inlet. It was also found that injecting air at an angle larger
   than the diffuser vane angle corrects the fluid direction but, at the
   same time, decreases the fluid kinetic energy at diffuser inlet.}},

Abstract = {{Silent Data Corruption (SDC) is a serious reliability issue in many
   domains, including embedded systems. However, current protection
   techniques are brittle, and do not allow programmers to trade off
   performance for SDC coverage. Further, many of them require tens of
   thousands of fault injection experiments, which are highly
   time-intensive. In this paper, we propose an empirical model to predict
   the SDC proneness of a program's data called SDCTune. SDCTune is based
   on static and dynamic features of the program alone, and does not
   require fault injections to be performed. We then develop an algorithm
   using SDCTune to selectively protect the most SDC-prone data in the
   program subject to a given performance overhead bound. Our results show
   that our technique is highly accurate at predicting the relative SDC
   rate of an application, and outperforms full duplication by a factor of
   0.83 to 1.87x in efficiency of detection (i.e., ratio of SDC coverage
   provided to performance overhead).}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a numerical simulation of the formation of rotating
   stall and the initiation of surge in order to study the connection
   between stall and surge in centrifugal compressors. Also, the current
   paper introduces an optimization of the air injection method as a way to
   increase the surge margin. Results showed that during stall, the
   compressor is exposed to velocity and pressure fluctuations varying with
   time, and these fluctuations are increased suddenly and causing surge
   initiation. The major part which is responsible for the sudden increase
   in fluctuations is the vaneless region because it was found that the
   problem starts at the impeller exit near the shroud surface and then
   transfers to the impeller inlet. Results also showed that during surge,
   forces on the impeller blades increase to nearly double of its initial
   value and then decrease again. By using air injection at the vaneless
   region with different injection angles, it was found that injection with
   angle of 30 degrees has a good effect on preventing surge and minimizing
   the pressure fluctuations comparing to other injection angles results.
   Results showed finally that the surge margin can be increased by using
   the injection with angle of 30 degrees and with injection mass flow rate
   of 1\% of the design inlet mass flow rate and this causes the surge
   limit to shift from 4 kg/s to 3.9 kg/s.}},

   simulations and presents a study of the role of air injection method in

   separation at low mass flow rates and due to the increase of the
   turbulence level and the absence of fluid orientation guidance at the
   vaneless region. The flow weakness causes back flow that results in the
   formation of the tip leakage flow which causes stall development with
   time. Results also showed that using air injection at specified
   locations at the vaneless shroud surface at injection angle of 20
   degrees and with injection mass flow rate of 1.5\% of the inlet design
   mass flow rate, can delay the stall onset to happen at lower mass flow

Abstract = {{A new automatic method for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation
   in multi-channel 3D MR images is presented. The main novelty of the
   method is that it learns the spatial image features needed for training
   a supervised classifier entirely from unlabeled data. This is in
   contrast to other current supervised methods, which typically require
   the user to preselect or design the features to be used. Our method can
   learn an extensive set of image features with minimal user effort and
   bias. In addition, by separating the feature learning from the
   classifier training that uses labeled (pre-segmented data), the feature
   learning can take advantage of the typically much more available
   unlabeled data. Our method uses deep learning for feature learning and a
   random forest for supervised classification, but potentially any
   supervised classifier can be used. Quantitative validation is carried
   out using 1450 T2-weighted and PD-weighted pairs of MRIs of MS patients,
   with 1400 pairs used for feature learning (100 of those for labeled
   training), and 50 for testing. The results demonstrate that the learned
   features are highly competitive with hand-crafted features in terms of
   segmentation accuracy, and that segmentation performance increases with
   the amount of unlabeled data used, even when the number of labeled
   images is fixed.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptable control system within and on-board a network of interacting
   satellites is an important module which is desired for unmanned space
   vehicles. However, such a control system is not easy to develop since it
   is the core of the network's operation and all the earth-linked
   operational information is reviewed and analyzed through it. Due to
   multipurpose missions of satellites, several decisions are made
   simultaneously about necessary changes to the satellite's operational
   parameters (i.e., orbit, inclination, etc.). In this paper, a neural
   network model-based control scheme is developed for a network of
   interacting satellites. The proposed neural control scheme refers to a
   methodology in which the controller is assumed as a neural network and
   the dynamical model of the system is identified through the training
   stages of the neural model. The simulation results show that the neural
   control method can be effectively applied in monitoring and controlling
   the satellite networks, without the necessity of determining the
   mathematical model of the system.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, unequal droplet splitting is performed simply by
   modifying the electrode geometry: an electrode is divided into four
   small squares or four narrow sub-electrodes which are surrounded by
   regular spatial electrodes. Two possible configurations are studied for
   the narrower modified electrodes in which the narrow sub-electrodes are
   i) parallel, and ii) perpendicular to the flow direction. By actuating
   one (or more) sub-electrodes on one side and a spatial electrode on the
   other side of the droplet reproducible unequal splitting was achieved
   without a need for a complicated control system. In addition to
   reproducibility, the proposed approach offers a great deal of
   flexibility by splitting the droplet (or dispense a droplet) to
   different volumes based on the number of the actuated sub-electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{The tasks of maintenance and repair without optimal planning can be
   costly and result in prolonged maintenance times, reduced availability
   and possible flight delays. Aircraft manufacturers and maintainers see
   significant benefits in constantly improving Health Management and
   Maintenance (HMM) practices by deploying the most effective maintenance
   planning strategies. The planning of the maintenance and repair is a
   complex task due to chain dependency of engines to aircraft, and
   aircraft to the flight schedules. This paper presents a scheduling
   method for determining the time of maintenance based on the historical
   engine operation data in order to maximize the use of estimated
   remaining useful life of the engines as well as lowering the cost and
   duration of the downtime. The Time-on-Wing (TOW) data is used in
   conjunction with probability density functions to determine the shape of
   the respective distribution of the time of maintenance to minimize the
   loss of expected remaining useful life. Data from each engine with most
   chance of failure is then selected and fed into an extended Branch and
   Bound (B\&B) routine to determine the best optimum sequence for entering
   the facility in order to minimize the waiting time.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the leakage current of a proton exchange membrane fuel
   cell is determined from the polarization curve and impedance
   measurements. The ohmic loss is specified from the high frequency
   resistance in the Nyquist plot. The polarization curve is then rotated
   counter-clockwise to nullify the effects of the ohmic loss. Considering
   the negligible mass transport loss in low current densities, the
   activation loss is then determined as a function of the current density.
   Employing the Tafel assumption, the leakage current can be determined
   from the best logarithmic fit. The method is then experimentally
   verified by measuring the polarization curves and Nyquist plots of a
   cell including the Nafion 212 as the membrane. Tests are conducted using
   four different gas diffusion layers for all of which the same current
   leakage is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, power converters have become more efficient
   (>96\%), offering higher power density at reduced cost. This achievement
   is due to effective topologies, new components, and the deployment of
   embedded controls. One of the popular topologies for DC to DC conversion
   is the LLC resonant topology. Regulation of the LLC converter,
   operarting over wide range of frequencies, with high bandwidth and
   sufficient disturbance rejection capabilities is not without challenges
   due to varying dynamics behavior of the LLC. This calls for non-linear
   and/or adaptive control deployment through embedded controls. Extensive
   research has been done, to date, in describing state space modeling for
   the LLC topology. In this paper, a popular approach of Extended
   Describing Functions is applied to the LLC converter is analyzed. A new
   approach of estimation of the LLC dynamics based on Least Squares Method
   is proposed The proposed algorithm is applied to the simulation model of
   the LLC. The paper presents the modelling approach, simulation results
   and assesses the results for future development of adaptive control.}},

Abstract = {{DC distribution is becoming increasingly important in telecom and
   buildings' power systems. The main building blocks of DC power systems
   are switching power converters and rectifiers that have nonlinear
   characteristics. When the voltages are tightly regulated, the converters
   will act as constant power loads (CPLs). The CPL is known to exhibit the
   negative incremental impedance and may cause the dynamic instability of
   the system. The problem associated with CPLs is traditionally tackled
   using passive damping which has serious drawbacks such as increased
   size, decreased reliability and efficiency of the system.
   This paper introduces an active method to inject damping current into
   the power bus employing an auxiliary power circuit. The proposed
   approach ensures that the system operates with sufficient stability
   margin in a small-signal sense. Comparing with previous works, the
   advantage of the proposed damping circuit is that the absorbed energy
   for damping is transferred into a neighboring bus with minimal energy
   losses.}},

   informing of the changes in operation. This paper presents a strategy
   based on a pre-energized auxiliary power circuit to suppress fast
   transients from electronic loads. Since the transient-occurrence time
   will be informed by the load, the auxiliary circuit will pre-energize
   the dc bus and will inject additional current to counteract the change
   in load and in this way smooth the transient. In this paper, the design
   and operation principle of the proposed auxiliary circuit is explained.
   The proposed approach is verified in a dc microgrid model with 380 VDC

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a systematic approach for the synthesis of
   multiple-input multiple-output converters (MIMOCs). The proposed MIMOCs
   can interface sources with different voltage-current characteristics,
   and supply multiple loads with different voltage levels. Compared to the
   traditional architecture of exchanging power between multiple ports via
   separate single-input single-output converters, the MIMOCs possess
   advantages of simpler structure, fewer components, lower cost, and
   higher efficiency. With the MIMOCs decomposed into three stages, namely,
   input stage, energy buffer stage, and output stage, a set of synthesis
   rules for MIMOCs are proposed. Consequently, two families of MIMOCs are
   generated, where the inductor and capacitor are employed as the central
   energy buffer elements, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Visible Light Communication (VLC) using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
   within the existing lighting infrastructure would reduce the
   implementation cost and may operate at higher throughput than RF or
   Infrared (IR) based wireless systems. One of the major concerns in VLC
   implementation is developing resource allocation schemes that maintain
   or increase channel throughput, ensure fairness and fast link recovery
   while reducing delay. To address this challenge, the characteristics of
   VLC channel is modeled in detail mathematically and the resource
   allocation problem is formulated for a centrally controlled indoor VLC
   system in this paper. We focus on a VLC system providing location based
   services and it is shown that the resource allocation problem can be
   solved by optimal scheduling, and the solution has to consider different
   transmission scenarios based on different transmitters and receivers'
   locations. Specifically, a scheduling algorithm using proportional fair
   principle is proposed and the simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm outperform the maximum rate scheduling and round
   robin by balancing the user throughput and fairness among users. A
   prototype of the VLC system is currently under development to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is an emerging technology for interference
   management. However, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio (SINR) may decrease in IA. Opportunistic IA (OIA) schemes can
   provide more opportunities for the users to access the network and
   improve the performance; nevertheless, the unselected users remain idle,
   which is a waste of resource. Thus in this paper, simultaneous wireless
   information and power transfer (SWIPT) in OIA networks is studied. As
   the unselected users in OIA networks can be treated as energy harvesting
   (EH) terminals, an OIA user selection (OIAUS) algorithm is proposed to
   optimize the SWIPT performance through user selection, according to the
   information-transmission (IT) and EH performance as well as the
   requirements of users. To further reduce the complexity, a random
   complexity-reduced OIAUS algorithm is designed to make a tradeoff
   between performance and complexity. Simulation results are presented to
   show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{For large-scale software-development endeavors, agility is enabled by
   architecture, and vice versa. The iterative, risk-driven life cycle
   inherent in agile approaches allows developers to focus early on key
   architectural decisions, spread these decisions over time, and validate
   architectural solutions early. Conversely, an early focus on
   architecture allows a large agile project to define an implementation
   structure that drives an organization into small teams, some focusing on
   common elements and their key relationships and some working more
   autonomously on features. Architects in agile software development
   typically work on three distinct but interdependent structures:
   architecture of the system, the structure of the development
   organization, and the production infrastructure. Architectural work
   supports the implementation of high-priority business features without
   risking excessive redesign later or requiring heavy coordination between
   teams. Architectural tactics provide a framework for identifying key
   concerns and guide the alignment of these three structures throughout
   the development life cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The normal operation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)
   can induce significant temperature, humidity, pressure or concentration
   gradients across the cell's active area. The overall performance and

   We report on diagnostic techniques and methodologies to characterize
   PEMFC material properties and the inhomogeneities across the active area
   of a working cell. Specifically, we describe in-situ techniques for the
   spatially-resolved characterization of PEMFC performance. Our testing
   hardware features sixteen fully isolated segments over a 49 cm(2) active
   area, reference electrode capabilities, and individual segment control.
   The techniques are applied to the in-situ characterization of effective

   The abstraction hides the details of a set of algorithms which
   specialise either in different estimations of pose (e.g. articulated,

   Users describe the conditions of their problem, which is used to select
   the most suitable algorithm (and automatically set up the parameters).
   The task-based control is evaluated with images described using the

Abstract = {{Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC)-reinforced sodium alginate-based
   biodegradable films were prepared by solution casting. The MFC content
   of the alginate films varied from 3\% to 20\% by weight. The tensile
   strength, tensile modulus, stretch, and tear resistance of the neat
   alginate films were found to be 52 MPa, 2.15 GPa, 6.8\%, and 243 mN
   respectively. It was found that for 10\% loading of MFC in alginate
   films, the strength of the films increased by 57.7\%, but the alginate
   films kept their inherent transparency. Surface morphologies of the
   prepared films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and suggested homogeneous mixing of MFC with sodium alginate in
   aqueous media. Results revealed that MFC acted as a strong reinforcing
   agent for sodium alginate-based biodegradable films for packaging
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The melting/dissolution behaviour of a solid in liquid titanium has been
   investigated with the aid of an Electron Beam Button Furnace (EBBF) to
   understand the phenomena contributing to the melting/dissolution of
   exogenous solids introduced into liquid titanium during melt processing
   and casting. To begin, cylindrical rods of commercial purity (CP)
   titanium were dipped into a molten CP titanium pool for various periods
   of time to investigate the melting/dissolution behaviour in the absence
   of compositional effects. The dimensions of the dipped rods were
   measured before and after various immersion times allowing
   quantification of the evolution of the solid/liquid interface and
   melting rate. The temperature within the dipped rod was also measured
   during melting to provide additional quantitative data on heat transport
   for analysis. The results show that the molten titanium initially
   solidifies onto the cold rod. The solid/solid interface formed between
   the rod and solidified titanium was found to significantly reduce the
   heat transfer to the rod. After a short period of time, the solidified
   titanium re-melts followed by melting and dissolution of the rod.
   Analysis with the model has confirmed that both thermally induced
   buoyancy and, in particular, thermally induced Marangoni forces
   contribute significantly to the melting/dissolution process. A numerical
   model has been developed to describe the solidification and melting
   process, the results of which are shown to correlate well with
   experimentally obtained data.}},

   propose pre/post-rake processing in conjunction with optimized filtering

   introduced, namely (a) a convex optimization problem formulation with
   closed-form solutions and (b) the more general case, which is a
   non-convex problem solvable via an alternating optimization algorithm.
   For both design alternatives widely linear formulations are devised. The
   presented numerical results demonstrate the capability of the proposed
   designs to establish reliable two-way communication links between nodes
   with limited signal processing power and in the absence of a direct

Abstract = {{A mobile, autonomous searcher is tasked with finding the source node of
   a broadcast message in a randomly deployed network of location-agnostic
   wireless sensor nodes. Messages are assumed to propagate by flooding,
   with random node-to-node delays. In networks of this type, the hop count
   of the broadcast message, given the distance from the source node, can
   be approximated by a simple parametric distribution. The mobile searcher
   can interrogate a nearby sensor node to obtain, with a given success
   probability, the hop count of the broadcast message. We model the search
   as an infinite-horizon, undiscounted cost, online POMDP and solve it
   approximately through policy rollout. The cost-to-go at the rollout
   horizon is approximated by a heuristic based on an optimal search plan
   in which path constraints and assumptions about future information gain
   are relaxed. This cost can be computed efficiently, which is essential
   for the application of Monte Carlo methods, such as rollout, to
   stochastic planning problems. Finally, we demonstrate that our rollout
   approach outperforms a popular method of target search based on a
   myopic, mutual information utility.}},

   advantages achieved by cooperative transmission and its associated power
   consumption that may affect the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. A
   simple but efficient pre-coding scheme is proposed to reduce the
   computation complexity of cooperative transmission, thus lowering the

   developed to benchmark the various sources of energy consumption in
   C-RAN. Through detailed simulation, an early performance evaluation of

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is widely used to improve traffic
   safety. However, the V2V link is easily blocked due to the low antenna
   height. The vehicular obstructions also lead to strong shadowing effect,
   which has been ignored in the V2V system performance evaluation. By
   incorporating channel state transition with a measurement-based
   dual-slope path loss model, a light-of-sight (LOS) blocked model is
   presented for the V2V highway scenarios. The joint effects of radio
   environment and traffic flow on link connectivity are investigated to
   represent the obstruction probability and inter-vehicle connectivity
   probability. All the analytical results are validated by extensive
   simulations under a measurement-based propagation model. The results can
   be used for the system design and development of a channel simulator for

   We also present the problem of computing the Reference Signal Received

   relates closely to the problem of determining the serving cell. We
   present two RSRP computation models that account for the effects of SSPs
   and evaluate their performance through system-level simulations. We
   observe that the behaviour of the 3D MIMO Channel Model is significantly

   fading channels. Then, we propose a combined power allocation strategy
   in order to minimize the outage probabilities in the cooperative
   communications. For regenerative system, we give a closed-form
   expression for the power allocation by taking into account the
   characteristics of the fading channels. For non-regenerative system, we
   utilize pattern search algorithm to solve the optimization problem since
   the objective function is complex and uneasy to be figured out directly.
   Numerical results show that the system performances with optimum power
   allocation outperform those with uniform power allocation whereas lower
   outage probabilities can be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed antenna systems (DASs) are promising for future wireless
   systems to provide high data transmission rates. So far, most works on
   resource allocation schemes for DASs have not considered the Quality of
   Services (QoS) and fairness of mobile users simultaneously. This paper
   investigates and presents an optimal max-min fair resource allocation
   scheme for min-rate guaranteed services in downlink multiuser DASs. By
   exploring the properties of the optimization problem, we transform it
   into an equivalent convex optimization problem. Then we propose an
   iterative allocation algorithm to solve the problem and get the optimal

Abstract = {{We propose a new bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)-based
   cooperative communication system where different BICM modules can be
   optimized jointly considering the average signal to noise ratios of the
   direct and the two-hop Rayleigh fading channels. As such, the full
   benefit of BICM can be exploited in the context of cooperative
   communication. Our design considers cooperative communication systems
   with so called max-min relay selection scheme that has no loss in
   performance in terms of diversity-multiplexing trade off in orthogonal
   cooperation. The presented numerical results for rate 1/2 convolutional
   code with 8-ary pulse amplitude modulation equivalently 64-ary
   quadrature amplitude modulation show that the proposed design can offer
   gains up to 1.4 dB over the traditional BICM design for a target bit
   error rate of 10(-6). Moreover the results show that the amount of gain
   depends on the relays' positions and increases with the number of relays
   available for selection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) motion planning and
   control scheme for an automated firefighting system. The proposed
   automated firefighting system consists of unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) cooperating to detect,
   localize, and handle the wildfire. In this automated cooperative
   framework, the UGVs have to reach to the fire (target) in an optimal
   way, optimal in the sense that the operation time and fuel consumption
   are minimized. Meanwhile, the UAVs gather and report the localization
   data to the system. Furthermore, the UAVs motions are intended to reduce
   the system uncertainty. The proposed motion planning scheme is designed
   to handle various sources of uncertainty as well as environment
   constraints through incorporating them to the conventional nonlinear
   model predictive control. Numerical simulations have been carried out to
   study the performance of the proposed MPC motion planning and control
   scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is
   able to design an optimal trajectory while handling the system
   uncertainties and constraints.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless energy harvesting protocol is proposed for a
   decode-and-forward relay-assisted secondary user (SU) network in a
   cognitive spectrum sharing paradigm. An expression for the outage
   probability of the relay-assisted cognitive network is derived subject
   to the following power constraints: 1) the maximum power that the source
   and the relay in the SU network can transmit from the harvested energy,
   2) the peak interference power from the source and the relay in the SU
   network at the primary user (PU) network, and 3) the interference power
   of the PU network at the relay-assisted SU network. The results show
   that as the energy harvesting conversion efficiency improves, the
   relay-assisted network with the proposed wireless energy harvesting
   protocol can operate with outage probabilities below 20\% for some
   practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional video has recently gained great popularity as it
   enhances the viewing experience. Streaming of 3D video over IP networks
   will soon become a common means of multimedia consumption, thanks to the
   recent standardization efforts such as MPEG-DASH and 3D-HEVC. To this
   end, rate adaptation techniques are required to overcome the unreliable
   nature of IP networks. In this paper, we propose a rate adaptation
   approach for streaming multiview plus depth (MVD) video by exploring the
   effects of the number of views and the quality of views on the quality
   of experience. Specifically, we show that concurrently decreasing the
   distance between virtual camera positions and reducing the number of
   views help maintain an acceptable perceptual quality level when the
   network resources are scarce.}},

   workfunction reduction was estimated to be about 0.7 eV. Current-voltage
   characteristics were obtained at several incident light powers.
   Thermionic emission of potassium ions from the surface of the forest was
   observed at lower biases. In another set of experiments, in-situ
   intercalation of carbon nanotube forests was accomplished. The
   current-voltage characteristics were captured at different times during
   a period of 72 hours. It was observed that the workfunction has been
   reduced by 1.1 eV.}},

   Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) have been designed based on the
   statistical properties of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) videos and are not

   In this study, we investigate the performance of the latest LDR video
   compression standard, HEVC, as well as the recent widely commercially
   used video compression standard, H.264/AVC, on HDR content. Subjective
   evaluations of results on an HDR display show that viewers clearly
   prefer the videos coded via an HEVC-based encoder to the ones encoded
   using an H.264/AVC encoder. In particular, HEVC outperforms H.264/AVC by
   an average of 10.18\% in terms of mean opinion score and 25.08\% in
   terms of bit rate savings.}},

Abstract = {{High Dynamic Range (HDR) technologies have demonstrated that they can
   play an influential role in the design of camera and consumer display
   products. Understanding the human visual experience of viewing HDR
   content is a crucial aspect of such systems. Although the visual
   experience of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) technologies have been well
   explored, there are limited comparable studies for HDR content. In this
   paper, we present a study that evaluates the viewing experience of HDR
   and LDR content as measured both subjectively, and objectively vis-a-vis
   eye-tracking data. The eye-tracking data was collected while individuals
   viewed HDR or LDR videos in a freeviewing task. Our study shows a clear
   subjective preference for HDR content when individuals are given a
   choice between HDR and LDR displays, but this preference does not
   translate into a reliable difference in the subjective or objective eye
   movement measures when the displays are viewed sequentially, suggesting
   that objective performance measures are not the foundation upon which
   subjective preferences are based. Our findings should help in developing
   new visual attention models for the role of HDR and LDR content on
   subjective and objective experience and performance.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of e-commerce, a growing number of people prefer to
   purchase medicine online for the sake of convenience. However, it is a
   serious issue to purchase medicine blindly without necessary medication
   guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based medicine
   recommendation, which can recommend users with top-N related medicines
   according to symptoms. Firstly, we cluster the drugs into several groups
   according to the functional description information, and design a basic
   personalized medicine recommendation based on user collaborative
   filtering. Then, considering the shortcomings of collaborative filtering
   algorithm, such as computing expensive, cold start, and data sparsity,
   we propose a cloud-based approach for enriching end-user Quality of
   Experience (QoE) of medicine recommendation, by modeling and
   representing the relationship of the user, symptom and medicine via
   tensor decomposition. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated with
   experimental study based on a real dataset crawled from Internet.}},

Abstract = {{A mobile, autonomous platform is assisted by a wireless sensor network
   in its task of inferring a map of the spatial distribution of a physical
   quantity that is measured by the sensor nodes. Sensor nodes initiate a
   broadcast in the network, when the measured quantity assumes a value in
   the range of interest. Specifically, we consider randomly deployed
   networks of location-agnostic wireless sensor nodes, which broadcast
   messages by flooding. The node-to-node delays are assumed to be random.
   In networks of this type, the hop count of a broadcast message, given
   the distance from the source node, can be approximated by a simple
   parametric distribution. The mobile platform can interrogate a nearby
   sensor node to obtain, with a given success probability, the hop counts
   of the broadcast messages originating from different source nodes. By
   fusing successive hop count observations, the mobile platform infers the
   locations of the source nodes and thereby, the spatial distribution of
   the quantity of interest. The path taken by the mobile platform should
   minimize the resulting mapping error as quickly as possible. We propose
   an information-driven path planning approach, in which the mobile
   platform acts by maximizing a weighted sum of myopic, mutual information
   gains. We show by simulation, that suitable control of the weights is
   effective at reducing the error between the true and the inferred map,
   by preventing the information gain to be dominated by only a few source
   nodes.}},

Abstract = {{In-vehicle communication is becoming more important as the need to
   ensure reliable and efficient communications with the increasing number
   of x-by-wire applications. In order to well maintain in-vehicle
   communications, it is necessary to evolve protocols for managing
   communications and, in particular, for granting bus access for real-time
   applications. In this paper, we describe a demonstration of the
   multi-channel random access protocol that we have developed for VPLC
   using OMNeT++. The proposed solution uses a combination of time and
   frequency multiplexing and consists of two key features: (i) multiple
   access channels to prioritize transmissions and (ii) a distributed
   collision resolution algorithm that allows each node to compete for the
   use of its selected channel. The live demonstration illustrates the
   contention resolution procedure of in-vehicle communications with
   different service classes, shows simulation results to validate the
   advantages of the proposed protocol and provides useful guidelines for
   developing a robust contention-based protocol for vehicular power line
   communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{In order to effective pre-assessment on the potential danger of the rock
   burst to the coal working face, a multivariate Analytic Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) is proposed based on the hazard zone and the hazard
   extents. The influencing factors of rock burst can divided to five
   sections, including mining depths, coal and rock structure, geological
   structures, overlying strata spatial structure and pillar induce. In
   this paper, a model was established using AHP. To define the single
   factor, a judgment matrix was constructed. To evaluate the single factor
   on a specific working face several methods were adopted, for example the
   theory of mining pressure and strata control, the project analogy method
   and the numerical simulation analysis. First, through the evaluation of
   single factor using a proper method, the hazard zone formed by a single
   factor was defined. Then, the interaction relationships among these
   impact factors in inducing rock burst were comprehensive analyzed. When
   a zone was simultaneously affected by several factors, the multi-factor
   coupling evaluation method was used to assess the hazard zones and the
   hazard extents. The proposed model was applied to evaluate the risk of
   rock burst, using the No. 5305 working face in Jisan Coal Mine as a case
   study. The hazardous zones with different extents were confirmed. The
   prevention and control measures were used in advance and received a good
   effect. The feasibility and validity of the model for hazardous zones
   and hazard extents of rock burst was tested and verified.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical guidelines, such as the Integrated Management of Childhood
   Illness (IMCI), are used worldwide to support community health workers
   in the assessment of severely ill children. These guidelines are
   distributed in paper form, complicating their use at the point-of-care.
   We have developed a framework for building advanced clinical guideline
   applications for the Android mobile phone OS. The framework transfers
   clinical guidelines into a flexible and interactive electronic format
   using an XML interpreter. The resulting application supports intuitive
   navigation of guidelines while assessing the patient, easy integration
   of patient management tools, and logging of performed assessments and
   treatments. The novel approach transforms clinical guidelines from a
   mere paper dictionary into a working tool that integrates into the daily
   workflow of community health workers and simplifies their task at the
   care and administrative levels.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of regularity in the oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) signal
   has been suggested for use in identifying subjects with sleep disordered
   breathing (SDB). Previous work has shown that children with SDB have
   lower SpO(2) regularity than subjects without SDB (NonSDB). Regularity
   was measured using non-linear methods like approximate entropy (ApEn),
   sample entropy (SamEn) and Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity. Different
   manufacturer's pulse oximeters provide SpO(2) at various resolutions and
   the effect of this resolution difference on SpO(2) regularity, has not
   been studied. To investigate this effect, we used the SpO(2) signal of
   children with and without SDB, recorded from the Phone Oximeter (0.1\%
   resolution) and the same SpO(2) signal rounded to the nearest integer
   (artificial 1\% resolution). To further validate the effect of rounding,
   we also used the SpO(2) signal (1\% resolution) recorded simultaneously
   from polysomnography (PSG), as a control signal. We estimated SpO(2)
   regularity by computing the ApEn, SamEn and LZ complexity, using a 5-min
   sliding window and showed that different resolutions provided
   significantly different results. The regularity calculated using 0.1\%
   SpO(2) resolution provided no significant differences between SDB and
   NonSDB. However, the artificial 1\% resolution SpO(2) provided
   significant differences between SDB and NonSDB, showing a more random
   SpO(2) pattern (lower SpO(2) regularity) in SDB children, as suggested
   in the past. Similar results were obtained with the SpO(2) recorded from
   PSG (1\% resolution), which further validated that this SpO(2)
   regularity change was due to the rounding effect. Therefore, the SpO(2)
   resolution has a great influence in regularity measurements like ApEn,
   SamEn and LZ complexity that should be considered when studying the
   SpO(2) pattern in children with SDB.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of physiological responses provides an objective measure of a
   person's affective state and has been proposed as a way to evaluate
   motivation and engagement of therapy clients during robot-assisted
   therapy regimens. This paper presents the analysis of three
   physiological responses to different levels of error amplification in a
   robotic reaching task to understand the feasibility of using
   physiological signals in order to modify therapy exercises to achieve
   higher participant attentiveness. In a pilot study with 22 healthy
   participants, we analyzed skin conductance, skin temperature, and
   respiration signals, with two main goals: 1) to compare physiological
   parameters between baseline (rest) and error-amplified reaching motion
   periods; and 2) to compare physiological parameters between reaching
   motion periods with different levels of error amplification. Results
   show that features extracted from skin conductance and respiration
   signals show significant differences between different error
   amplification levels. Features extracted from the skin temperature
   signal are not as reliable as measures of skin conductance and
   respiration, however they can provide supplementary information.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the FEATHERS (Functional Engagement in Assisted Therapy
   Through Exercise Robotics) project, two motion tracking and one social
   networking applications were developed for upper limb rehabilitation of
   stroke survivors and teenagers with cerebral palsy. The project aims to
   improve the engagement of clients during therapy by using video games
   and a social media platform. The applications allow users to control a
   cursor on a personal computer through bimanual motions, and to interact
   with their peers and therapists through the social media. The tracking
   applications use either a Microsoft Kinect or a PlayStation Eye camera,
   and the social media application was developed on Facebook. This paper
   presents a usability testing of these applications that was conducted
   with therapists from two rehabilitation clinics. The ``Cognitive
   Walkthrough{''} and ``Think Aloud{''} methods were used. The objectives
   of the study were to investigate the ease of use and potential issues or
   improvements of the applications, as well as the factors that facilitate
   and impede the adoption of technology in current rehabilitation

Abstract = {{We present a study investigating the suitability of a respiratory rate
   estimation algorithm applied to photoplethysmographic imaging on a
   mobile phone. The algorithm consists of a cascade of previously
   developed signal processing methods to detect features and extract
   respiratory induced variations in photoplethysmogram signals to estimate
   respiratory rate. With custom-built software on an Android phone (Camera
   Oximeter), contact photoplethysmographic imaging videos were recorded
   using the integrated camera from 19 healthy adults breathing
   spontaneously at respiratory rates between 6 and 40 breaths/min.
   Capnometry was simultaneously recorded to obtain reference respiratory
   rates. Two hundred and ninety-eight Camera Oximeter recordings were
   available for analysis. The algorithm detected 22 recordings with poor
   photoplethysmogram quality and 46 recordings with insufficient
   respiratory information. Of the 232 remaining recordings, a root mean
   square error of 5.9 breaths/min and a median absolute error of 2.3
   breaths/min was obtained. The study showed that it is feasible to
   estimate respiratory rates by placing a finger on a mobile phone camera,
   but that it becomes increasingly challenging at respiratory rates higher
