Abstract = {{High-pressure plasmas have historically been used in thermionic energy
   converters both to reduce the electrode workfunctions and to mitigate
   the space-charge effect. The behavior of such devices has been studied
   extensively, but low-pressure thermionic converters are far less
   understood. Advances in nanotechnology, such as the possibility to
   intercalate nanomaterials-based electrodes with alkali metals in order
   to reduce workfunction, may alleviate the need for high gas pressures;
   low-pressure devices may thus play a significant role in future if they
   can address the space-charge problem. Here, we develop the physics of
   low-pressure thermionic converters by solving the Vlasov-Poisson system
   of equations self-consistently. We demonstrate that various
   possibilities arise due to intricate interactions between the spatially
   varying electron and ion concentrations, leading to phenomena such as
   plasma oscillations at higher ion fluxes. We show that even a relatively
   low ion flux density (similar to 5 x 10(-4) times the flux density of
   electrons) reduces space-charge significantly and increases the electron
   current density by a factor of 7. We further extend the model by
   including electron and ion emission from both the cathode and anode
   electrodes. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{In the military environment, injured soldiers undergoing medical
   evacuation via helicopter or mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle
   (MRAP) are subjected to vibration and shock inherent to the transport
   vehicle. We conducted the present study to assess the consequences of
   such vibration on the acutely injured spinal cord. We used a porcine
   model of spinal cord injury (SCI). After a T10 contusion-compression
   injury, animals were subjected to 1) no vibration (n=7-8), 2) whole body
   vibration at frequencies and amplitudes simulating helicopter transport
   (n=8), or 3) whole body vibration simulating ground transportation in an
   MRAP ambulance (n=7). Hindlimb locomotor function (using Porcine
   Thoracic Injury Behavior Scale {[}PTIBS]), Eriochrome Cyanine
   histochemistry and biochemical analysis of inflammatory and neural
   damage markers were analyzed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) expression
   levels for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin
   (IL)-6, IL-8, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were similar
   between the helicopter or MRAP group and the unvibrated controls. Spared
   white/gray matter tended to be lower in the MRAP-vibrated animals than
   in the unvibrated controls, especially rostral to the epicenter.
   However, spared white/gray matter in the helicopter-vibrated group
   appeared normal. Although there was a relationship between the extent of
   sparing and the extent of locomotor recovery, no significant differences
   were found in PTIBS scores between the groups. In summary, exposures to
   vibration in the context of ground (MRAP) or aeromedical (helicopter)
   transportation did not significantly impair functional outcome in our
   large animal model of SCI. However, MRAP vibration was associated with
   increased tissue damage around the injury site, warranting caution
   around exposure to vehicle vibration acutely after SCI.}},

Abstract = {{A transportable fluidization column, operating under identical

   characterization of gas-fluidized beds. This paper compares measurements
   of solids mass and momentum flux obtained by radioactive particle
   tracking at the Ecole Polytechnique, positron emission particle tracking
   at University of Birmingham, and borescopic high speed particle image
   velocimetry at PSRI, carried out with FCC particles of mean diameter 107
   mu m. These techniques provided broadly similar time-average solids flux
   profiles, but there were significant quantitative differences. Analysis
   of the results, focusing on the fundamentals of each measurement
   technique, provides valuable insights into the reasons for the
   discrepancies. The results also add to a unique hydrodynamic database

Abstract = {{This work considers secure downlink transmission in indoor
   multiple-input, single-output visible-light communication (VLC) links.
   In particular, we study the design of transmit beamformers that maximize
   the achievable secrecy rate subject to amplitude constraints imposed by
   the limited dynamic range of the light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Such
   constraints render the design problem nonconvex and difficult to solve.
   We show, however, that this nonconvex problem can be transformed into a
   solvable quasi-convex line search problem. We also consider the more
   realistic case of imperfect channel information regarding the receiver's
   and eavesdropper's links. We tackle the worst-case secrecy rate
   maximization problem, again subject to amplitude constraints. In our
   treatment, uncertainty in the receiver's channel is due to limited
   feedback, and is modeled by spherical sets. On the other hand, there is
   no feedback from the eavesdropper, and the transmitter shall utilize the
   line-of-sight channel gain equation to map the eavesdropper's nominal
   location and orientation into an estimate of the channel gain. Thus, we
   derive uncertainty sets based on inaccurate information regarding the
   eavesdropper's location and orientation, as well as the emission pattern
   of the LEDs. We also consider channel mismatches caused by the uncertain
   non-line-of-sight components. We provide numerical examples to
   demonstrate the performance gain of the optimal beamformer compared with
   the suboptimal schemes, and the robust beamformer compared with its
   nonrobust counterparts. We also evaluate the worst-case secrecy rate
   performance of the robust beamformer in a typical VLC scenario along
   with the aforementioned uncertainty sources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a sequential likelihood ratio test (SLRT) detector
   for spectrum sensing scenarios in cognitive radios (CRs). Similar to
   other CR detectors, we exploit the structure of the sample covariance
   matrix of the received signal to achieve detection with minimal
   information regarding the signal. Unlike the majority of
   covariance-based CR detectors, the SLRT is a sequential detector that
   allows for smaller detection delays, which is a prized asset in CR
   systems. Using methods borrowed from the theory of continuous-time
   diffusion processes, we derive the statistical properties of the SLRT
   detector and compare it with an eigenvalue-based sequential detector,
   which has been presented in previous work for CR systems. The comparison
   also includes detection scenarios with non-Gaussian noise to illustrate
   the robustness of the proposed detector in these situations.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{270-284}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Batch drying was performed in the pulsed fluidized bed with various
   species of biomass particles as an indicator of gas-solid contact
   efficiency and mass transfer rate under different operating conditions
   including pulsation duty cycle and particle size distribution. The
   fluidization of cohesive biomass particles benefited from the shorter
   opening time of pulsed gas flow and increased peak pressure drop. The
   presence of fines enhanced gas-solid contact of large and irregular
   biomass particles, as well as the mass transfer efficiency. A drying
   model based on two-phase theory was proposed, from which effective
   diffusivity was calculated for various gas flow rates, temperature and
   pulsation frequency. Intricate relationship was discovered between
   pulsation frequency and effective diffusivity, as mass transfer was
   deeply connected with the hydrodynamics. Effective diffusivity was also
   found to be proportional to gas flow rate and drying temperature.
   Operating near the natural frequency of the system also favored drying
   and mass transfer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly crystalline poly(hydroxybutyrate) suffers from high melting point
   and entanglement molecular weight. This leads to low melt strength,
   limits processing through regular techniques, and precludes many
   applications. In this work we report a series of racemic and enantiopure
   zinc catalysts supported by variously substituted diaminophenolate
   ancillary ligands which form high melt strength PHBs with different
   molecular weights and microstructure. These complexes are active for the
   highly controlled polymerization of beta-butyrolactone (BBL); some can
   polymerize 2000 equiv of BBL in less than 30 min. Changing the steric
   bulk of the ligand forms PHBs of varied syndiotacticity (P-r = 0.7.5 to
   0.5.5). These are highly robust systems capable of polymerizing an
   unprecedented 20000 equiv of BBL in the presence of 5000 equiv of benzyl
   alcohol. Therrnorheological investigations reveal that the synthesized
   PHBs have surprisingly high melt strength at above the melting point.
   For processable PHBs, high density of entanglements and relatively low
   crystallinity are crucial. We show that the best PHBs should have high
   molecular weight and moderate syndiotacticity.}},

   silicon-on-insulator MRR based filter with bent contra-directional

   and experimentally demonstrated. Also, using bent contra-directional
   couplers in the couping regions of MRRs allowed us to achieve larger
   side-mode suppressions than MRRs with straight CDCs. The fabricated
   filter has a minimum suppression ratio of more than 15 dB, a
   3dB-bandwidth of similar to 23 GHz, an extinction ratio of similar to 18
   dB, and a drop-port insertion loss of similar to 1 dB. High-speed data
   transmission through our filter is also demonstrated at data rates of

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Existing studies have demonstrated the potential threat of bacteria to
   copper and gold flotation when mineral processing operatiohs use
   bacteria-laden water, such as treated sewage effluent, as an alternative
   water source. Once being introduced into a mine water system,
   water-borne bacteria may experience cell disruption causing the release
   of constituent organic molecules into process water. However, little is
   known about the potential impact of these organic molecules released
   from disrupted bacteria cells on flotation performance. In this study,
   using the same representative system as previously used with intact
   cells, we investigated the effect of disrupted cells on flotation. This
   representative system consists of E. coli cells disrupted by sonication
   (also called lysed cells) as the model bacterium and three
   copper-containing mineral systems of increasing complexity as the ore
   model. It was found that the disrupted cells had a negative effect on
   copper flotation, which tended to weaken as ore composition became more
   complex. The negative effect of the disrupted cells on copper flotation
   was more pronounced than that of the intact cells. Flotation of gold and
   pyrite was found to be depressed as well possibly due to the
   preferential adhesion of the lysed cells on pyrite. Findings in this
   study enhance understanding and management of the risk posed by
   bacteria-laden water which is being increasingly used as an alternative
   water source for mineral processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{How network monitoring and reinforcement learning can improve tcp
   fairness in wireless multi-hop networks}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Wireless mesh network (WMN) is an emerging technology for the last-mile
   Internet access. Despite extensive research and the commercial
   implementations of WMNs, there are still serious fairness issues in the
   transport layer, where the transmission control protocol (TCP) favors
   flows with a smaller number of hops to flows with a larger number of
   hops. TCP unfair behavior is a known anomaly over WMN that attracts much
   attention in recent years and is the focus of this paper. In this
   article, we propose a distributed network monitoring mechanism using a
   cross-layer approach that deploys reinforcement learning techniques (RL)
   to achieve fair resource allocation for nodes within the wireless mesh
   setting. In our approach, we deploy Q-learning, a reinforcement learning
   mechanism, to monitor the dynamics of the network. The Q-learning agent
   creates a state map of the network based on the medium access control
   (MAC) parameters and takes actions to enhance TCP fairness and
   throughput of the starved flows in the network. The proposal creates a
   distributed cooperative mechanism where each node hosting a TCP source
   monitors the network and adjusts its TCP parameters based on the network
   dynamics. Extensive simulation results and testbed analysis demonstrate
   that the proposed method significantly improves the TCP fairness in a
   multi-hop wireless environment.}},

Abstract = {{Campylobacter jejuni is a microaerophilic pathogen and leading cause of
   human gastroenteritis. The presence of C jejuni encased in biofilms
   found in meat and poultry processing facilities may be the major
   strategy for its survival and dissemination in aerobic environment. In
   this study, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, or Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa was mixed with C jejuni F38011 as a culture to form
   dual-species biofilms. After 4 days' exposure to aerobic stress, no
   viable C jejuni cells could be detected from mono-species C jejuni
   biofilm. In contrast, at least 4.7 log CFU/cm(2) of viable C jejuni
   cells existed in some dual-species biofilms. To elucidate the mechanism
   of protection mode, chemical, physical and morphological features of
   biofilms were characterized. Dual-species biofilms contained a higher
   level of extracellular polymeric substances with a more diversified
   chemical composition, especially for polysaccharides and proteins, than
   mono-species C jejuni biofilm. Structure of dual-species biofilms was
   more compact and their surface was >8 times smoother than mono-species
   C. jejuni biofilm, as indicated by atomic force microscopy. Under
   desiccation stress, water content of dual-species biofilms decreased
   slowly and remained at higher levels for a longer time than mono-species
   C jejuni biofilm. The surface of all biofilms was hydrophilic, but total
   surface energy of dual-species biofilms (ranging from 52.5 to 56.2
   mJ/m(2)) was lower than that of mono-species C jejuni biofilm, leading
   to more resistance to wetting by polar liquids. This knowledge can aid
   in developing intervention strategies to decrease the survival and
   dispersal of C. jejuni into foods or environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   a junction is formation of a low-pressure zone with recirculating flow
   (with high sedimentation potential) accompanied by a high-velocity zone
   (with high erosion potential). A comprehensive numerical research study
   was done on submerged vanes to investigate their effect on flow pattern.
   This research was done in order to reduce sedimentation as well as
   erosion potential at the junction of bending and straight channels.
   Firstly, the numerical model was validated by previous studies.
   Secondly, flow pattern in a junction of bending and straight channels
   was evaluated numerically. Following that, effects of some geometrical
   characteristics, number and height of vanes and installation angle, were
   evaluated in relation to improved flow pattern. Finally, performance of
   vanes was investigated in terms of reducing maximum velocity after the
   junction with various discharge ratios. The results showed a
   comprehensive reduction in sedimentation of the junction as well as
   partial reduction of erosion potential. Evaluation of the results led to
   the recommendation of using two submerged vanes of height of 0.2h-0.3h
   and installation angle of 20 degrees-30 degrees in this type of channel.
   Results also determined that an installation angle of more than 40
   degrees and application of submerged vanes in channels by discharge
   ratios larger than 0.58 are not suggested.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a numerical investigation of active surge
   control and performance improvement for an aero engine centrifugal
   compressor (NASA CO) using self-recirculating bleed slots with different
   bleeding positions. This investigation considers an unsteady
   three-dimensional numerical simulation based on large eddy simulation.
   Three bleeding slots positions are studied and compared with a
   compressor without surge control. The aim of the recirculating bleed
   slots is to remove some of the reversed flow during surge inception from
   the impeller inducer, which influences the stable operating range and
   compressor pressure ratio. The effects of the three bleeding slot
   positions on the internal flow and performance of the compressor are
   highlighted by a detailed analysis of the impeller flow field. The surge
   event stages are detected well inside the impeller and diffuser. The
   results show that an effective flow bleeding system can increase the
   surge limit compared with a classical compressor without a bleeding
   system. A comparison of the cases investigated in this study indicates
   that the surge limit increases by 8\% for the bleeding slots located
   closer to the main blade leading edge, with lower increase in the surge
   limit for slots near the split blade's leading edge. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As a popular signal modeling technique, sparse representation (SR) has
   achieved great success in image fusion over the last few years with a
   number of effective algorithms being proposed. However, due to the
   patch-based manner applied in sparse coding, most existing SR-based
   fusion methods suffer from two drawbacks, namely, limited ability in
   detail preservation and high sensitivity to misregistration, while these
   two issues are of great concern in image fusion. In this letter, we
   introduce a recently emerged signal decomposition model known as
   convolutional sparse representation (CSR) into image fusion to address
   this problem, which is motivated by the observation that the CSR model
   can effectively overcome the above two drawbacks. We propose a CSR-based
   image fusion framework, in which each source image is decomposed into a
   base layer and a detail layer, for multifocus image fusion and
   multimodal image fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed fusion methods clearly outperform the SR-based methods in terms
   of both objective assessment and visual quality.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been proven to be an effective process for
   the treatment of wastewater sludge. However, it produces high levels of
   ammonia in the digester effluent, which may jeopardize meeting stringent
   nutrient discharge limits. In this study, the effect of a sequential
   anaerobic/aerobic (AN/AERO) digestion and a single-stage conventional AN
   digestion (as control) was investigated on mixed (primary + secondary)
   sludge generated by the Annacis Island wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
   (BC, Canada). An overall sludge retention time (SRT) of 22.5 days under
   three different scenarios was chosen based on the current operational
   SRT of the digesters at the Annacis Island WWTP. The steady state
   results have shown that sequential AN/AERO digestion configurations
   achieved up to 11\% higher volatile solids (VS) removal and 72\% lower
   ammonia generation over single-stage conventional AN digestion.
   Furthermore, sequential AN/AERO system also showed enhanced
   dewaterability, improved fecal coliform destruction and reduced digested
   cake odors over control digesters.}},

Abstract = {{With the dense deployment of small cell networks, the powering and
   backhaul problem of small cell base stations (SBSs) has attracted great
   attention, and energy harvesting technology and self-backhaul technology
   have been proposed as promising solutions. Although some excellent works
   have been done on energy harvesting and self-backhaul in small cell
   networks, most existing works do not consider them jointly. In this
   paper, we aim at green small cell networks by jointly achieving
   self-backhaul and energy harvesting. In addition, full-duplex and
   massive multiple-input and multiple-output technologies are also
   exploited to enhance the system performance. In order to improve the
   energy efficiency (EE) further, a novel precoding scheme is designed to
   eliminate both the inter-tier and multi-user interference. Based on the
   proposed precoding scheme, we formulate the cell association and power
   allocation problem as an optimization problem to optimize the system EE
   performance, with the energy arrival rate and remaining battery energy
   in SBSs involved. The formulated optimization problem implies a sleep
   mechanism to control the ON/OFF of SBSs, which will further reduce the
   energy consumption of small cell networks. In addition, to reduce the
   computation complexity to solve this non-convex problem, we propose to
   transform the original problem into a difference of convex program,
   which can be efficiently solved via a constrained concave convex
   procedure-based algorithm. Extensive simulation results are presented to
   justify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with different system
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient energy harvesting has emerged as a promising technique to
   improve the energy efficiency and reduce the total greenhouse gas
   emissions for green wireless communications. Energy management for
   throughput maximization under random energy arrivals has been studied
   extensively in energy harvesting relay communication networks with
   either finite-size data buffer or finite-size energy storage. However,
   the problem is still open when the energy harvesting relay node is
   subject to both finite-size data and energy storage. In this paper, we
   study the transmission policy of joint time scheduling and power
   allocation under a transmission deadline, which maximizes the end-to-end
   system throughput in a two-hop relay communication network where the
   energy harvesting relay node is equipped with finite-size data buffer
   and battery. In particular, we first formulate the throughput
   maximization problem as a convex optimization problem under an offline
   optimization framework, and obtain the optimal offline time scheduling
   and power allocation by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions based on the
   full knowledge of energy arrivals and channel states. Then, we formulate
   the throughput maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic programming
   problem under the online optimization framework, and obtain the optimal
   online time scheduling and power allocation by solving a series of
   convex optimizations based on the casual knowledge of energy arrivals
   and channel states. Finally, to reduce the computation complexity, we
   further propose two suboptimal online transmission policies. Numerical
   results show the impacts of battery capacity and buffer size on the
   maximum throughput of the proposed policies, as well as the balance
   between the spectrum efficiency and the delay sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we study relay selection strategies for file transfer in

   of a token as an approximate sign of the possibility for packet
   reception and forwarding by a relay, we propose a context (specifically,
   channel, energy, and queue state)-aware relay selection strategy, which
   dynamically defines a scheduling rule at each time slot, based on the
   channel states, residual energies, and queue sizes. At each time slot,
   the scheduling rule specifies which of the source or relay nodes should
   use the channel for packet transmission. Numerical results confirm that
   the proposed strategy generally provides a higher number of packet
   transfers and a lower file transfer time compared with existing

Abstract = {{Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) as a promising and cost-efficient
   cellular architecture has been proposed to meet the increasing demand of
   wireless data traffic. The main concept of C-RAN is to decouple the
   baseband unit (BBU) and the remote radio head (RRH), and place the BBUs
   in a data center for centralized control and processing. In this paper,
   we study the resource sharing problem in a fronthaul constrained C-RAN,
   where multiple service providers lease radio resources from a network
   operator to serve their subscribers. To provide isolation among
   different service providers, we introduce a threshold-based policy to
   control the interference among RRHs, and define a new metric to provide
   minimum resource guarantee for service providers. By leveraging a
   mobility prediction method, the user locations are predicted for traffic
   demand estimation and interference control. We propose a multi-timescale
   resource sharing mechanism, which consists of a global resource
   allocation process and multiple local resource allocation processes that
   are performed at different time scales. Simulation results show that the
   proposed mechanism achieves efficient resource sharing and isolation
   among service providers.}},

Abstract = {{The security issue of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is very prominent
   since WSNs are often deployed in an open and even hostile environment.
   Data are vulnerable to attack in the process of data aggregation.
   Consequently, the design of secure data aggregation protocols is one of
   the most important issues in WSNs. The secure data aggregation in WSNs
   faces many challenges due to its intrinsic properties. Aiming to provide
   a review of recent developments about secure data aggregation in WSNs,
   this paper first analyzed the typical security schemes of data
   aggregation in recent years, with views from data confidentiality and
   data integrity. Then this paper further compares and summarizes
   different secure data aggregation schemes based on the key technique
   utilized and the performance (e.g., communication cost, computation
   cost, accuracy, delay, attacks resisted, etc.) achieved. Open research
   issues about secure data aggregation in WSNs are also presented. We hope
   this work can provide a guidance for researchers who are interested in
   exploring secure data aggregation in WSNs.}},

Journal = {{BIOSENSORS-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biomedical signals contain features that represent physiological events,
   and each of these events has peaks. The analysis of biomedical signals
   for monitoring or diagnosing diseases requires the detection of these
   peaks, making event detection a crucial step in biomedical signal
   processing. Many researchers have difficulty detecting these peaks to
   investigate, interpret and analyze their corresponding events. To date,
   there is no generic framework that captures these events in a robust,
   efficient and consistent manner. A new method referred to for the first
   time as two event-related moving averages ({''}TERMA{''}) involves
   event-related moving averages and detects events in biomedical signals.
   The TERMA framework is flexible and universal and consists of six
   independent LEGO building bricks to achieve high accuracy detection of
   biomedical events. Results recommend that the window sizes for the two
   moving averages (W-1 and W-2) have to follow the inequality (8 x W-1) >=
   W-2 >= (2 x W-1). Moreover, TERMA is a simple yet efficient event
   detector that is suitable for wearable devices, point-of-care devices,
   fitness trackers and smart watches, compared to more complex machine
   learning solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Many cities worldwide are recognizing the important role that cycling
   plays in creating green and livable communities. However, vulnerable
   road users such as cyclists are usually subjected to an elevated level
   of injury risk which discourages many road users to cycle. This paper
   studies cyclist-vehicle collisions at 134 traffic analysis zones in the
   city of Vancouver to assess the impact of bike network structure on
   cyclist safety. Several network indicators were developed using Graph
   theory and their effect on cyclist safety was investigated. The
   indicators included measures of connectivity, directness, and topography
   of the bike network. The study developed several macro-level (zonal)
   collision prediction models that explicitly incorporated bike network
   indicators as explanatory variables. As well, the models incorporated
   the actual cyclist exposure (bike kilometers travelled) as opposed to
   relying on proxies such as population or bike network length. The
   macro-level collision prediction models were developed using generalized
   linear regression and full Bayesian techniqueS, with and Without spatial
   effects. The models showed that cyclist collisions were positively
   associated with bike and vehicle exposure. The exponents of the exposure
   variables were less than one which supports the ``safety in numbers{''}
   hypothesis. Moreover, the models showed positive associations between
   cyclist collisions and the bike network connectivity and linearity
   indicators. In contrast, negative associations were found between
   cyclist collisions and the bike network continuity and topography
   indicators. The spatial effects were statistically significant in all of
   the developed models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a detailed investigation is carried out on copper oxide,
   in the form of cupric oxide (CuO) nanocrystals. Particular attention is
   paid to the bandstructure and ultrafast charge-carrier dynamics.
   Transient absorption spectroscopy is carried out with an above-bandgap
   pump beam and below-bandgap probe beam to glean insight on the
   relaxation and recombination dynamics of the CuO nano crystals at
   various pump fluences. Three time constants are apparent. The first time
   constant varies with pump fluence from 330 to 630 fs, and it is
   attributed to momentum relaxation via carrier carrier scattering in the
   valence band as well as exciton exciton annihilation. The second time
   constant is constant at 2 ps, and it is attributed to energy relaxation
   via carrier-phonon scattering within the valence band. The third time
   constant is constant at SO ps, and it is attributed to trapping and
   recombination, due to the high density of trap states within the CuO
   nanocrystals. Such findings lay the foundation for future studies and
   applications of the emerging CuO material system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents analytic and experimental results for
   high-efficiency GaN HEMT class-F and inverse class-F (class-F-1)
   synchronous rectifiers. The rectifier designs are based on time-reversed
   duals of corresponding class-F amplifiers. A detailed analysis of the
   power efficiency of a class-F rectifier is presented. The analysis shows
   that, unlike the amplifier dual, the rectifier configuration does not
   have significant overlap loss because of device constraints in terms of
   operation in quadrant III. Consequently, the power efficiency of the
   class-F rectifier is slightly higher than the amplifier circuit under
   equal source power conditions. Experimental measurements are shown,
   which compare the rectification efficiency of a class-F rectifier with
   class-F-1 rectifiers. It is shown that operation of the rectifiers under
   back-off conditions mimics the power efficiency of an amplifier with
   envelope tracking. Based on this paper, it is concluded that the
   class-F-1 mode has better rectification efficiency compared with that of
   class-F, both at peak power and under back-off conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In vehicular networks, information dissemination/sharing among vehicles
   is of salient importance. Although diverse mechanisms have been proposed
   in the existing literature, the related information credibility issues
   have not been investigated. Against this background, in this paper, we
   propose a credible information-sharing mechanism capable of ensuring
   that the vehicles do share genuine road traffic information (RTI). We
   commence with the outage-probability analysis of information sharing in
   vehicular networks under both a general scenario and a specific highway
   scenario. Closed-form expressions are derived for both scenarios, given
   the specific channel settings. Based on the outage-probability
   expressions, we formulate the utility of RTI sharing and design an
   algorithm for promoting the sharing of genuine RTI. To verify our
   theoretical analysis and the proposed mechanism, we invoke a real-world
   dataset containing the locations of Beijing taxis to conduct our
   simulations. Explicitly, our simulation results show that the spatial
   distribution of the vehicles obeys a Poisson point process (PPP), and
   our proposed credible RTI sharing mechanism is capable of ensuring that
   all vehicles indeed do share genuine RTI with each other.}},

Abstract = {{When incorporating machine-to-machine (M2M) communications into the
   Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)
   networks, one of the challenges is the traffic overload since many
   machine-type communication (MTC) devices activated in a short period of
   time may require access to an evolved node B (eNodeB) simultaneously.
   One approach to tackle this problem is by using an access class barring
   (ACB) mechanism with an ACB factor to defer some activated MTC devices
   transmitting their access requests. In this paper, we first present an
   analytical model to determine the expected total service time, i.e., the
   time used by all MTC devices to successfully access the eNodeB. In the
   ideal case that the eNodeB is aware of the number of backlogged MTC
   devices, we determine the optimal value of the ACB factor to reduce
   traffic overload. To better utilize the random access resources shared
   among human users and MTC devices in LTE networks, we propose to
   dynamically allocate a number of random access preambles for MTC
   devices. We further propose two dynamic ACB (D-ACB) algorithms for fixed
   and dynamic preamble allocation schemes to determine the ACB factors
   without a priori knowledge of the system backlog. Simulation results
   show that the proposed D-ACB algorithms achieve almost the same
   performance as the optimal performance obtained in the ideal case. The
   proposed D-ACB for dynamic preamble allocation algorithm can reduce both
   the total time to serve all MTC devices and the average number of random
   access opportunities required by each MTC device.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel scheme of feature selection, which employs a
   modified genetic algorithm that uses a variable-range searching strategy
   and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Combined with support vector
   machines (SVMs), a new pattern recognition method for electrocardiograph
   (ECG) is developed. First, the ECG signal is decomposed into intrinsic
   mode functions (IMFs) that represent signal characteristics with sample
   oscillatory modes. Then, the modified genetic algorithm with
   variable-range encoding and dynamic searching strategy is used to
   optimize statistical feature subsets. Next, a statistical model based on
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is developed to select
   the dominant features. Finally, the SVM-based pattern recognition model
   is used to classify different ECG patterns. Comparative studies with
   peer-reviewed results and two other well-known feature selection methods
   demonstrate that the proposed method can select dominant features in
   processing ECG signal, and achieve better classification performance
   with lower feature dimensionality. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Stretchable helical architecture inorganic-organic hetero thermoelectric
   generator}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{691-699}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To achieve higher power output from a thermoelectric generator (TEG),
   one needs to maintain a larger temperature difference between hot and
   cold end. In that regard, a stretchable TEG can be interesting to
   adaptively control the temperature difference. Here we show, the
   development of simple yet versatile and highly stretchable
   thermoelectric generators (TEGs), by combining well-known inorganic
   thermoelectric materials Bismuth Telluride and Antimony Telluride
   (Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3) with organic substrates (Off-Stoichiometry
   Thiol-Enes polymer platform - OSTE, polyimide or paper) and novel
   helical architecture (double-arm spiral/helix) to achieve over 100\%
   stretchability. First, an OSTE-based TEG design demonstrates higher open
   circuit voltage generation at 100\% strain than at rest, although it
   exhibits high internal resistance and a relatively complex fabrication
   process. The second, simpler TEG design, achieves a significant
   resistance reduction and two different structural substrates (PI and
   paper) are compared. The paper-based TEG generates 17 nW (Delta T=75
   degrees C) at 60\% strain, which represents more than twice the power
   generation while at rest (zero strain). On the other hand, polyimide
   produces more conductive TE films and higher power (similar to 35 nW at
   Delta T-75 degrees C) but due to its higher thermal conductivity, power
   does not increase at stretch. In conclusion, highly stretchable TEGs can
   lead to higher temperature gradients (thus higher power generation),
   given that thermal conductivity of the structural material is low
   enough. Furthermore, either horizontal or vertical displacement can be
   achieved with double-arm helical architecture, hence allowing to extend
   the device to any nearby and mobile heat sink for continuous,
   effectively higher power generation.}},

Abstract = {{The electrolysis of CO, to syngas (CO + H-2) using nonprecious metal
   electrocatalysts was studied in bipolar membrane -based electrochemical
   cells. Electrolysis was carried out using aqueous bicarbonate and
   humidified gaseous CO, on the cathode side of the cell, with Ag or
   Bi/ionic liquid cathode electrocatalysts. In both cases, stable currents
   were observed over a period of hours with an aqueous alkaline
   electrolyte and NiFeOx electrocatalyst on the anode side of the cell. In
   contrast, the performance of the cells degraded rapidly when
   conventional anion and cation-exchange membranes were used in place of
   the bipolar membrane. In agreement with earlier reports, the Faradaic
   efficiency for CO, reduction to CO was high at low overpotential. In the
   liquid-phase bipolar membrane cell, the Faradaic efficiency was stable
   at about 50\% at 30 mA/cm(2) current density. In the gas-phase cell,
   current densities up to 200 mA/cm(2) could be obtained, albeit at lower
   Faradaic efficiency for CO production. At low overpotentials in the
   gas-phase cathode cell, the Faradaic efficiency for CO production was
   initially high but dropped within 1 h, most likely because of dewetting
   of the ionic liquid from the Bi catalyst surface. The effective
   management of protons in bipolar membrane cells enables stable operation
   and the possibility of practical CO, electrolysis at high current
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the problem of a single heavier solid particle settling in a
   yield stress fluid that behaves as a classical Bingham plastic. The flow
   configuration we are interested in is the transient dynamics from a
   particle settling in a Newtonian fluid to a Bingham plastic. Depending
   on the magnitude of the yield stress (or dimensionlessly the Bingham
   number), the particle and the surrounding fluid may return to rest in a
   finite time or reach another steady but lower settling velocity. At the
   analytical level, we write the total kinetic energy decay of the system.
   We evidence the existence of a critical Bingham number beyond which
   motion is suppressed and derive upper bounds for the finite stopping
   time as well as the maximum path length. These estimates can be obtained
   in 2D only while the extension to 3D remains an open question. At the
   numerical level, we design a robust and efficient Lagrange multiplier
   based algorithm that enables us to compute actual finite time decay. The
   algorithm combines an Augmented Lagrangian outer loop to treat the exact
   Bingham law to a Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain inner
   loop to account for freely-moving particles. We show that the ability to
   compute the balance between net weight (weight plus buoyancy) and yield
   stress resistance is the key point. The algorithm is implemented
   together with a Finite Volume/Staggered. Grid algorithm in the numerical
   platform PeliGRIFF. We investigate 2D configurations with the following
   particle shape: (i) a circular disc and (ii) a 2:1 rectangle. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We study the invasion of a Newtonian fluid into a vertical column of
   yield stress fluid through a small hole, using both experimental and
   computational methods. This serves as a simplified model for
   understanding invasion of gas into cemented wellbores. We find that the
   invasion pressure must exceed the static pressure by an amount that
   depends linearly on the yield stress of the fluid and that (for
   sufficiently deep columns) is observed to increases with the height of
   the yield stress column. However, invasion pressures far less than the
   Poiseuille-flow limit are able to yield the fluid, for sufficiently
   small hole sizes. Observed experimental behaviours in yielding/invasion
   show a complex sequence of stages, starting with a mixing stage, through
   invasion and transition, to fracture propagation and eventual stopping
   of the flow. Precise detection of invasion and transition pressures is
   difficult. Invasion proceeds initially via the formation of a dome of
   invaded fluid that grows in the transition stage. The transition stage
   appears to represent a form of stress relaxation, sometimes allowing for
   a stable dome to persist and at other times leading directly to a
   fracturing of the gel. The passage from initial invasion through to
   transition dome is suggestive of elasto-plastic yielding, followed by a
   brittle fracture. Computed results give qualitative insight into the
   invasion process and also show clearly the evolution of the stress field
   as we change from local to non-local yielding. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Newtonian fluids initially at rest, begin to flow under the action of
   any force that creates a shear stress. The flow onset is immediate upon
   the action of such forces. Purely viscous generalised Newtonian fluids
   follow the same pattern. For such fluids stationary states are
   dynamically rather dull, being governed by the equations of
   hydrostatics. In contrast, yield stress fluids in the same situations
   display a rich variety of behaviours. Yield stress fluids allow
   stationary solutions while under shear. It is shown that such solutions
   are globally energy stable and that flow onset may be immediate, delayed
   or it may never take place. We identify the main dynamic features and
   illustrate how they depend upon the applied force, yield stress and
   purely viscous forces, for two classes of flows. First, we consider
   flows in enclosures driven by forces that are independent of the flow
   solution. Second we consider flows for which the body force is coupled
   with the flow field, taking natural convection as an example. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Developing cardiac surgical skills and experience takes years of
   practice. Cardiac trainees need to develop technical proficiency in
   order to enhance quality of care and patient safety. Simulation-based
   models are common resources for teaching procedural skills in both
   undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Suitable and
   accessible educational platforms can play a progressively important role
   in the training process for young surgeons in the area of cardiac
   surgery. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery consists of a wide
   range of pathologic anatomies and surgical techniques. In this paper we
   introduce a novel, synthetic, biomimetic platform that allows for the
   realistic practice of the CABG surgery. The prototype uses a polyvinyl
   alcohol hydrogel which has been designed to mimic the geometric
   properties of vasculature. The proposed models look and feel like human
   tissue and possess somewhat consistent mechanical properties. In this
   study, we apply the platform to simulate a case of autogenous saphenous
   vein bypass grafting of a patient. An autogenous saphenous vein graft is
   placed from the aorta to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
   The standard procedures of the coronary artery bypass surgery were
   successfully simulated. Using the proposed technology, other complicated
   surgeries such as end to end, side to end, and sequential anastomoses
   can be simulated such that these models lend themselves very well to
   various types of anastomoses.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal needle injections are guided by fluoroscopy or palpation,

   Consequently, guiding these procedures with live ultrasound has become
   more popular, but images are still challenging to interpret. We
   introduce a guidance system based on augmentation of ultrasound images
   with a patient-specific 3-D surface model of the lumbar spine. We
   assessed the feasibility of the system in a study on 12 patients. The
   system could accurately provide augmentations of the epidural space and
   the facet joint for all subjects. Following conventional,
   fluoroscopy-guided needle placement, augmentation accuracy was
   determined according to the electromagnetically tracked final position
   of the needle. In 9 of 12 cases, the accuracy was considered sufficient
   for successfully delivering anesthesia. The unsuccessful cases can be
   attributed to errors in the electromagnetic tracking reference, which
   can be avoided by a setup reducing the influence of the metal C-arm.

Abstract = {{The building industry has regularly been criticized for resource
   exploitation, energy use, waste production, greenhouse gas emissions,
   and impacts on the landscape. The growing population demands more built
   environment to accommodate the socioeconomic wellbeing. Adopting
   conventional construction practices would continue the aforementioned
   issues. Therefore, it is important to integrate life cycle thinking into
   building construction to minimize its social, environmental, and
   economic impacts. The objective of this study is to assess the life
   cycle impact of commonly used wall-roof systems for low rise commercial
   building construction in Canada. A framework is developed to assess
   different building alternatives using the triple bottom line of
   sustainability. Identified environmental and socioeconomic impact
   indicators are eventually aggregated to develop a life cycle impact
   index. Material quantities of six wall-roof combinations for a
   single-storey commercial building were obtained from industrial
   partners. State-of-the-art life cycle assessment software is used to
   assess the life cycle impacts of different wall-roof systems. To
   accommodate decision makers' preferences of sustainability, wall-roof
   combinations are assessed for three potential scenarios namely,
   eco-centric, neutral, and economy-centric using multi-criteria decision
   analysis. The framework has also been implemented on a case study of low
   rise building in Calgary (Alberta, Canada) to evaluate its practicality.
   The study results revealed that the concrete-steel building is the most
   sustainable alternative in neutral and economy-centric scenario while
   steel-wood building is the most sustainable building in eco-centric
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The wide adoption of graphics processing units (GPUs) as accelerators
   for general-purpose applications makes the end-to-end reliability
   implications of their use increasingly significant. Fault injection is a
   widely adopted method to evaluate the resilience of applications.
   However, building a fault injector for general-purpose GPU applications
   is challenging due to their massive parallelism, which makes it
   difficult to achieve representativeness while being time-efficient. This
   paper makes four key contributions. First, it presents a fault-injection
   methodology to evaluate the end-to-end reliability properties of
   application kernels running on GPUs. Second, it introduces GPU-Qin, a
   fault-injection tool that uses real GPU hardware and offers a tunable
   and efficient balance between the representativeness and the cost of a
   fault-injection campaign. Third, it characterizes the error resilience
   characteristics of seventeen application kernels. Finally, it provides
   preliminary insights on correlations between the algorithmic properties
   of applications and their error resilience.}},

Abstract = {{We develop several critical concepts that should be considered when
   interpreting, modelling and designing future experiments for flows over
   sloping terrain. Vertical buoyancy fluxes in katabatic flows can be
   positive and a source of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) despite the
   statically stable, thermal stratification that drives these flows. This
   phenomenon occurs when the ratio of along-slope to slope-normal
   kinematic heat fluxes is greater than the cotangent of the slope angle,
   suggesting a critical value of slope-angle steepness found in earlier
   studies. We provide field-data-based evidence that the along-slope heat
   flux may dominate the variables in this inequality, and therefore in
   generating buoyant TKE production or suppression over a steep slope.
   These data show the along-slope heat flux can be more variable and
   significantly larger in magnitude than the slope-normal component. The
   gradient Richardson number does not include the effects of the
   along-slope buoyancy; furthermore, none of the canonical stability
   parameters can properly reflect the TKE redistribution from turbulent
   transport divergence and the sink of TKE in cases of counter-gradient
   momentum fluxes, which we frequently observe near the peak of the
   katabatic jet. In such cases, canonical stability parameters
   inadequately represent the physical mechanisms associated with
   stability. These results have broad implications related to accurately
   modelling turbulence and surface exchanges over sloping terrain and
   illustrate the need to more thoroughly investigate the along-slope heat
   flux and its drivers, the meaning and definitions of stability, and the
   effects of non-local turbulent transport.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based seismic design aims to dictate the structural
   performance in a predetermined fashion given the possible seismic hazard
   scenarios the structure is likely to experience. Identifying and
   assessing the probable performance is an integral part of
   performance-based design. Before implementation, accurate and practical
   definitions of different performance levels and corresponding limit
   states must be determined. This study aims to develop performance-based
   damage states for shape memory alloy (SMA)-reinforced concrete (RC)
   bridge piers considering different types of SMAs and seismic hazard
   scenarios. Using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), this study develops
   quantitative damage states corresponding to different performance levels
   (cracking, yielding, and strength degradation) and specific
   probabilistic distributions for RC bridge piers reinforced with
   different types of SMAs. Based on an extensive numerical study, this
   study also proposes residual drift-based damage states for SMA-RC piers.
   Finally, an analytical expression is proposed to estimate the residual
   drift of SMA-reinforced concrete elements as a function of the expected
   maximum drift and superelastic strain of SMA. Comparison with
   experimental results revealed that the proposed equation could very well
   predict the residual drift obtained from the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The use of roundabouts is gaining popularity in North America for their
   safety, capacity, and environmental benefits. Studies have shown that
   roundabouts can significantly reduce injury collisions compared to stop
   control and traffic signals. As more roundabouts are constructed, there
   will be an increased need for a detailed analysis of their safety
   performance. Traditional road-safety analysis of roundabouts has relied
   on the use of historical collision records. This approach offers a
   less-complete understanding of roundabouts safety and their effects on
   the behavior of drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. This paper
   represents a case study where automated video-based traffic conflicts
   analysis is used to diagnose safety issues at a roundabout in Vancouver,
   British Columbia, Canada. Traffic conflicts are automatically identified
   and analyzed to develop an in-depth understanding of the behavior of
   road users and the causes of traffic conflicts. Conflicts contributing
   factors were identified and safety countermeasures are presented.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Size reduction is an unavoidable operation for preparing biomass for
   biofuels and bioproduct conversion. Yet, there is considerable
   uncertainty in power input requirement and the uniformity of ground
   biomass. Considerable gains are possible if the required power input for
   a size reduction ratio is estimated accurately. In this research, three
   well-known mechanistic equations attributed to Rittinger, Kick, and Bond
   available for predicting energy input for grinding pine wood chips by
   hammer mill were tested against experimental grinding data. Prior to
   testing, samples of pine wood chips were conditioned to 11.7 \% wb,
   moisture content. The wood chips were successively ground in a hammer
   mill using screen sizes of 25.4, 10, 6.4, and 3.2 mm. The input power
   and the flow of material into the hammer mill were recorded
   continuously. The recorded power input vs. mean particle size showed
   that the Rittinger equation had the best fit to the experimental data.
   The ground particle sizes were four to seven times smaller than the size
   of the installed screen. Geometric mean size of particles were
   calculated using two methods: (1) Tyler sieves and using particle size
   analysis and (2) Sauter mean diameter calculated from the ratio of
   volume to surface that were estimated from measured length and width.
   The two mean diameters agreed well, pointing to the fact that either
   mechanical sieving or particle imaging can be used to characterize
   particle size. Specific energy input to the hammer mill increased from
   1.4 kWh t(-1) (5.2 J g(-1)) for large 25.1-mm screen to 25 kWh t(-1)
   (90.4 J g(-1)) for small 3.2-mm screen.}},

Abstract = {{Compressibility behavior of soil is an important parameter that implies
   the change in volume under applied stress, on other words, it is the
   relationship between void ratio and effective stress. Depending on the
   type of soil and their origin, the compressibility behavior varies over
   a wide range. Researchers presented numerous void ratio-effective stress
   relationships consist of different sets of equations which produce a
   good fit with their consolidation test data. These sets of equations for
   different types of soils become complex for understanding its
   consolidation behavior using a specific model. This paper introduces a
   new equation, developed by statistical analysis, to represent the
   compressibility behavior of both natural soils and soft soils. Results
   obtained from the statistical analysis in terms of coefficient of
   determination (R-2), a measurement of the goodness of fit, indicate the
   acceptability and validity of the proposed equation. Experimental data
   from literature are generated for the statistical analysis and an
   elaborate discussion is presented for the applicability of the proposed
   universal compressibility equation. Finally, this research opens the
   opportunity for parametric study of the coefficients of the proposed
   equation that may lead to develop a relationship between the
   compressibility and index properties of soil.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical and electronic products have become an integral part of the
   current economy and, with the development of newer technologies, the
   life span of these products are getting shorter. As a consequence, the
   volume of electronic waste is increasing drastically around the globe.
   With the implementation of new rules, regulations, and policies by the
   government, the landfilling of electronic waste has been reduced. The
   presence of valuable metals in the e-waste stream provides a major
   economic benefit for recycling industries but, due to the presence of
   hazardous materials, a proper recycling technique is required prior to
   the disposal of the e-waste. The total e-waste generated in Canada was
   725 kt in 2014. There are several organizations currently working in
   various provinces to deal with the collection and recycling of e-waste.
   These organizations collected nearly 20\% of the total e-waste generated
   in 2014. The collection rate for e-waste can be boosted by increasing
   awareness and by creating more centers to collect all kinds of e-waste.
   The collected e-waste is processed at local processing facilities mostly
   dealing with dismantling and hazardous material removal processes and
   then shipping the remaining material to a central location for
   subsequent processing.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of zero purely elastic range in stress space within the
   framework of bounding surface plasticity is applied to sand constitutive
   modelling. The yield surface shrinks to zero and becomes identical to
   the stress point itself, and plastic loading occurs for any direction of
   the stress ratio rate on which the loading and plastic strain rate
   directions now depend, rendering the model incrementally non-linear. The
   simplicity of the conceptual structure of the model is particularly
   attractive as it consists of only one surface, the bounding/failure
   surface, and the stress point itself in the stress ratio p-plane. The
   image stress point on the bounding surface is defined analytically in
   terms of the direction of the rate of the stress ratio, with the latter
   being inside, on, or outside the surface, so that the model can address
   consistently hardening, softening and critical state response. An
   updating scheme of the initial value of stress ratio at
   unloading-reloading events is proposed in order to avoid the
   overshooting phenomenon. The model follows the basic premises of the
   SANISAND family of models that unify the description for any pressure
   and density within critical state theory. The simulating capabilities of
   the model are shown to be comparable with those of classical models with
   very small yield surfaces, and additional simulations of unorthodox
   loading paths such as rotational shear are successfully compared with
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Dermal fibrosis is characterized by a high deposition of extracellular
   matrix (ECM) and tissue cellularity. Unfortunately all means of treating
   this condition are unsatisfactory. We have previously reported the
   anti-fibrotic effects of Kynurenine (Kyn), a tryptophan metabolite, in
   fibrotic rabbit ear model. Here, we report the mechanism by which Kyn
   modulates the expression of key ECM components in dermal fibroblasts.
   The results showed that Kyn activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
   nuclear translocation and up-regulates cytochromeP450 (CYP1A-1)
   expression, the AHR target gene. A specific AHR antagonist,
   6,2',4'-trimethoxyflavone, inhibited the Kyn-dependent modulation of
   CYP1A-1, MMP-1, and type-I collagen expression. Establishing the
   anti-fibrogenic effect of Kyn and its mechanism of action, we then
   developed nano-fibrous Kyn slow-releasing dressings and examined their
   anti-fibrotic efficacy in vitro and in a rat model. Our results showed
   the feasibility of incorporating Kyn into PVA/PLGA nanofibers,
   prolonging the Kyn release up to 4 days tested. Application of
   medicated-dressings significantly improved the dermal fibrosis indicated
   by MMP-1 induction, alpha-smooth muscle actin and type-I collagen
   suppression, and reduced tissue cellularity, T-cells and myofibroblasts.
   This study clarifies the mechanism by which Kyn modulates ECM expression
   and reports the development of a new slow-releasing anti-fibrogenic
   dressing. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the effect of fiber orientation on the
   flexural behavior of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete
   (UHPFRC) under quasi-static and impact loadings. Two placement methods
   and two specimen sizes were considered to provide different fiber
   orientations, and image analysis was carried out to quantitatively
   evaluate the fiber orientation. Quasi-static flexural tests were
   performed according to ASTM standard, while impact tests were performed
   with two different potential energies (0.48 and 1.13 kJ) using a
   drop-weight impact test machine. Test results indicated that under
   quasi-static loading conditions, higher flexural strength, normalized
   deflection capacity, and toughness were obtained in the beams that
   contained better fiber orientation in the direction of the tensile load
   compared to those with poor fiber orientation; however, no obvious
   difference in the first-cracking properties was observed with respect to
   the fiber orientation. Under impact loading conditions, the flexural
   strength and energy absorption capacity were both increased with better
   fiber orientation, and a greater increase in the flexural strength with
   strain-rate was obtained in the beams with better fiber orientation at
   an identical potential energy (relative to their counterparts with
   poorer orientation). Therefore, providing good fiber orientation can be
   an effective way to improve the impact resistance of UHPFRC beams. (C)

Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{197-206}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation into
   the behaviour of braided CFRP tubes subjected to quasi-static and
   dynamic axial crushing. Tubes of six different geometries, with round,
   rectangular or square cross-sections, with 2-4 plies of triaxial braids,
   were tested. Two types of square tubes were also tested with a plug
   initiator. Comparisons were made by examining the failure modes,
   load-displacement curves, specific energy absorption (SEA), and the
   ratio of the peak load to the average progressive crush load. When
   tested without a plug initiator, the crush characteristics of these
   tubes differed significantly under the two loading rates. Under
   quasi-static crush, tubes showed a greater tendency to fail in an
   unstable manner, characterized by global buckling, folding of the walls
   and crushing at both ends of the tube. Therefore, quasi-static crush
   testing should be used with caution when evaluating dynamic response of
   a structure. In dynamic testing, seven out of the eight configurations
   failed in a stable manner, with damage initiating at the bottom and
   propagating up the length of the tube in a splaying type failure mode.
   The smaller square and the round tubes performed the best, displaying
   higher SEA and lower load ratio values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A user-defined solver integrating the solid-gas surface reactions and

   DFB can form automatically and the bed height is about 1 m. The voidage
   gradually increases along the height of the bed zone in the bubbling
   fluidized bed (BFB) of the DFB. The U-bend and cyclone can separate the
   syngas in the BFB and the flue gas in the circulating fluidized bed. The
   concentration of the gasification products is relatively higher in the
   conical transition section, and the dry and nitrogen-free syngas at the

Abstract = {{Partnership with other organizations could improve companies'
   performance. However, partnerships have a high failure rate according to
   the literature. Therefore, monitoring the performance of a partnership
   and evaluating the components that affect its performance are essential.
   Joint decision-making, information sharing, risk/reward sharing,
   relationship-specific assets, trust and commitment are identified as the
   major components that affect the performance of an ongoing partnership.
   However, no previous study evaluated the components of an ongoing
   partnership over time. In this study, a multi-criteria decision support
   model is proposed to assess the components that influence the
   performance of an ongoing partnership. Multiple indicators are used to
   assess each component. The interdependency and importance of the
   components and their indicators are incorporated into the model using
   the Warshall's Algorithm and Analytic Network Process (ANP),
   respectively. The importance of each component and indicator, and a
   single number for the overall level of partnership components in each
   period, named as Partnership Component Index (PCI) here, are the outputs
   of the proposed model. PCI is a quantitative multi-dimensional index. A
   partnership between a forest company and a sawmill in British Columbia,
   Canada is used as a case study to test the model. The components of the
   partnership is assessed in three different periods using PCI. The
   results are validated by the managers and sensitivity analysis is also
   performed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial bamboo chips were pre-treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
   solutions to completely extract silica and partially extract
   hemicelluloses prior to kraft pulping. Reaction temperatures of 80-100
   degrees C, times of 1-5 h, and NaOH charges of 6-18\% were explored.
   With increasing pre-extraction severity, all silica and up to 50\% of
   hemicelluloses in raw chips could be extracted without degrading
   cellulose and lignin. The chips from select extractions were cooked
   using the kraft process with varying effective alkali (EA) charges.
   Pre-extraction resulted in significant improvement in the
   delignification of chips during subsequent kraft pulping, offering an
   option to reduce the EA charge or the H-factor. The pulp yield was
   similar to the control while the drainage resistance of pulp from
   pre-extracted chips was slightly improved. Physical strength properties
   of pulps made from pre-extracted chips showed lower tensile index and
   higher tear index as compared with the control runs. Moreover, silica
   was no more a problem for chemical recovery and production of high-grade
   pulp. Extracted silica and hemicelluloses in the alkaline extraction
   liquor (AEL) can be used as a potential raw material for value-added
   products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The laminar and transitional flow through a planar sudden expansion with
   various expansion ratios is studied using two-dimensional direct
   numerical simulations at flow Reynolds numbers up to 5000 and expansion
   ratios in the range of 1.33 to 4.00. Results show the relationship
   between the reattachment length and the flow Reynolds number and
   expansion ratio. Correlations are developed for the non-dimensional
   reattachment length and the maximum velocity magnitude in the
   reverse-flow region in terms of Reynolds numbers and expansion ratios.
   The correlations and computed results achieve excellent agreement with
   published literature. Bifurcation phenomena resulting in the loss of
   flow symmetry downstream of the sudden expansion is observed and
   critical Reynolds numbers for the onset of bifurcation for various
   expansion ratios are identified. The initiation mechanism for
   bifurcation is attributed to the amplification of streamwise velocity
   disturbances at a spatial location that depends on the flow Reynolds
   number. For Reynolds numbers near the critical value for bifurcation
   onset, the disturbances grow from the sudden expansion, while for
   Reynolds numbers well above the critical value, the disturbances grow
   from the location of flow reattachment that occurred in the symmetric
   condition prior to bifurcation. Finally, the effect of the bifurcation
   phenomena on the development of flow unsteadiness and transition to
   turbulence downstream of the sudden expansion is linked to the
   successive formation of smaller-scale, steady recirculation zones.
   Transition is initiated by inviscid instability of the inflectional
   velocity profiles associated with these smaller-scale zones. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to develop a reliable truncation error
   estimator for finite-volume schemes and to use this truncation error
   estimate to correct the output functional of interest. The rough modes
   in the truncation error for unstructured mesh are dominant and if
   p-truncation error estimation is used, functional correction has a poor
   performance. So, we are trying to obtain a smooth estimate of the
   truncation error to improve the performance of output error estimation.
   The correction term is based on the truncation error and the adjoint
   solution. Both discrete and continuous adjoint solutions are used for
   correcting the functional. Our results for a variety of governing
   equations suggest that the smoothing scheme can improve the correction
   process significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors investigate the downlink area spectral
   efficiency (ASE) of infrastructure relay enhanced cellular systems. ASE
   for cellular systems is defined as the maximum achievable data rate per
   unit bandwidth per unit area supported by a base station. In relay
   enhanced systems, ASE can serve as an attractive performance metric by
   capturing the benefit of the relatively smaller spatial footprint of
   relay transmission and the resulting lower co-channel interference. In
   this study, by applying a moment generating function based approach, the
   authors first derive the general closed-form statistics of the total
   interference from dominant co-channel cells over Rayleigh fading
   channels. These interference statistics are readily applied to the
   calculation of the resulting ASE. The authors also propose a novel
   in-cell frequency reuse scheme to further exploit the smaller
   transmission power of relay stations (RSs). Through selected numerical
   examples, the authors show that in relay enhanced systems, the cell
   size, transmission power and RS positions should be properly selected to
   gain better ASE performance than the conventional systems without
   relays.}},

Abstract = {{N-Halamine-based antibacterial materials play a significant role in
   controlling microbial contamination, but their practical applications
   are limited because of their complicated synthetic process and
   indistinct antibacterial actions. In this study, novel antibacterial
   N-halamine-containing polymer fibers were synthesized via an one-step
   electrospinning of N-halamine-containing polymers without any additives.
   By adjusting the concentration of precursor and the molecular weight of
   polymers, the morphology and size of the as-spun N-halamine-containing
   fibers can be regulated. The as-spun fibers showed antibacterial
   activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. After an
   antibacterial assessment using different biochemical techniques, a
   combined mechanism of contact/release co-determined killing action was
   evidenced for the as-spun N-halamine-containing fibers. With the aid of
   contact action and/or release action, this combined mechanism can allow
   N-halamines to attack bacteria, making the as spun fibers wide in the
   application of antibacterial fields, whatever it is in dry or wet
   environment. Also, a recycle antibacterial test demonstrated that the
   as-spun fibers can still offer antibacterial property after five recycle

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{12031-12038}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{An experimental and theoretical investigation is conducted to understand
   the role of compressibility on the quasi-static expansion and
   contraction of a bubble that is pinned at the opening of a small
   capillary. The results show that there are two regimes of expansion and
   contraction depending on the values of two dimensionless parameters
   which correspond to a dimensionless volume and maximum capillary
   pressure. In one regime, not all bubble sizes are accessible during
   expansion and contraction, and the bubbles exhibit a hysteretic behavior
   when cycling through expansion and contraction. We call this the bubble
   shape hysteresis. The magnitude of the bubble shape hysteresis is
   computed for a realistic range of the nondimensional parameters. In the
   other regime, the bubble size can be varied continuously, but
   compressibility can still make it difficult to smoothly control the size
   of the bubble. The theoretical analysis shows that compressibility
   affects the evolution of the bubbles, even when the bubble is smaller
   than a hemispherical cap. The analysis also provides the infusion and
   withdrawal rates that a syringe pump must supply to expand and contract
   the bubble at a desired rate, accounting for compressibility. The
   validity of the assumptions used in the model is verified by comparison
   against experimental data.}},

   distributions and its application to lignocellulosic biomass}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{211-221}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel model is presented that incorporates the Arrhenius integral into
   one of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions to describe the
   pyrolysis of complex feedstocks. The model differs in structure from
   distributed activation energy models (DAEM), and its self-variable
   differs from Weibull mixture models. It is found that all first order
   reactions, regardless of their activation energies and pre-exponential
   factors, can be best modeled by a unified Frechet (inverse Weibull)
   minima distribution versus a reaction progress factor, followed by the
   Gumbel maxima and classical Weibull minima distributions. When applied
   to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the peak temperature is linked to a
   characteristic reaction progress factor, which largely accounts for the
   increase of peak temperatures with increasing heating rate. The model is
   able to deconvolute the contributions of multiple components in the
   sample and to estimate kinetic parameters for individual components by
   least squares regression. A correlation derived from the model can be
   used to evaluate apparent activation energy based on the shift in peak
   temperature as the heating rate varies, similar to the Kissinger method
   and its variants. The present work provides not only a different model
   framework, but also new perspective on the interactions between the
   statistical distribution of material properties and reactivity. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{During standing balance, vestibular signals encode head movement and are
   transformed into coordinates that are relevant to maintaining upright
   posture of the whole body. This transformation must account for
   head-on-body orientation as well as the muscle actions generating the
   postural response. Here, we investigate whether this transformation is
   dependent upon a muscle's ability to stabilize the body along the
   direction of a vestibular disturbance. Subjects were braced on top of a
   robotic balance system that simulated the mechanics of standing while
   being exposed to an electrical vestibular stimulus that evoked a
   craniocentric vestibular error of head roll. The balance system was
   limited to move in a single plane while the vestibular error direction
   was manipulated by having subjects rotate their head in yaw.
   Vestibular-evoked muscle responses were greatest when the vestibular
   error was aligned with the balance direction and decreased to zero as
   the two directions became orthogonal. This demonstrates that muscles
   respond only to the component of the error that is aligned with the
   balance direction and thus relevant to the balance task, not to the
   cumulative afferent activity, as expected for vestibulospinal reflex
   loops. When we reversed the relationship between balancing motor
   commands and associated vestibular sensory feedback, the direction of
   vestibular-evoked ankle compensatory responses was also reversed. This
   implies that the nervous system quickly reassociates new relationships
   between vestibular sensory signals and motor commands related to
   maintaining balance. These results indicate that vestibular-evoked
   muscle activity is a highly flexible balance response organized to
   compensate for vestibular disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{The overarching goal of CFD is to compute solutions with low numerical
   error. For finite-volume schemes, this error originates as error in the
   flux integral. For diffusion problems on unstructured meshes, the
   diffusive flux (computed from reconstructed gradients) is one order less
   accurate than the reconstructed solution. Worse, the gradient errors are
   not smooth, and so no error cancellation accompanies the flux
   integration, reducing the flux integral to zero order for the
   second-order schemes. Our aim is to compute the gradient and flux more
   accurately at the cell boundaries and hence obtain a better flux
   integral for a slight increase in computational cost. We propose a novel
   reconstruction method and flux discretization to improve diffusive flux
   accuracy on cell-centered, isotropic unstructured meshes. Our approach
   uses a modified least-squares system to reconstruct the solution to
   second-order accuracy in the H-1 norm instead of the prevalent L-2 norm,
   thus ensuring second-order accurate gradients. Either circumcenters or
   containment centers are chosen as the control-volume reference points
   based on a criteria to facilitate calculation of second-order gradients
   at flux quadrature points using a linear interpolation scheme along with
   a high-accuracy jump term to enhance stability of the system. Numerical
   results show a significant improvement in the order of accuracy of the
   computed diffusive flux as well as the flux integral. When applied to a
   channel flow advection-diffusion problem, the scheme resulted in an
   increased order of accuracy for the flux integral along with gains in
   solution accuracy by a factor of two. Similar gains in solution accuracy
   are also seen when applied to an incompressible Navier-Stokes problem.

Abstract = {{Silicon carbide (SiC) based power semiconductor devices are now
   considered as key components for future power applications where high
   power density, high temperature, and high ruggedness against radiation
   are key parameters, thanks to the exceptional material properties
   including lower conduction and switching losses offered by the SiC
   devices. This paper deals with static and dynamic measurements performed
   for SiC-based bipolar junction transistors power modules with voltage
   rating 1200 V and current rating 800 A. The power modules are fabricated
   in flexible half-bridge configuration in order to allow either full
   power module with 2400 V and 800 A as one power switch or by using two
   parallel 1200 V and 400 A half-bridge legs. Results from engineering
   samples show overall good confidence as promised by the manufacturer for
   most of the transistor samples. A 40-50\% reduction in the current gain
   was observed when temperature was increased to 475K as expected. Bipolar
   devices have been found out fairly stable under continuous static
   operation at nominal current levels.}},

Title = {{Microfluidic enrichment of circulating tumor cells in patients with

Abstract = {{Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTC) have become an important tool
   in the monitoring of patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC). The
   role of CTC in localized disease has been addressed by only few studies.
   However, results of CTC analyses are strongly dependent on the platform
   used for CTC enrichment and detection. In the present study, a
   microfluidic platform allowing for antigen independent enrichment of CTC
   was investigated for its ability to detect CTC in patients with
   clinically localized PC.
   Patients and methods: Blood (2 ml) was collected preoperatively from 50
   consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically
   localized PC. CTC were enriched using a microfluidic ratchet mechanism
   allowing separation of CTC from white blood cells based on differences
   in size and deformability. Enriched cells were stained for
   immunofluorescence with antibodies targeting pancytokeratin, epithelial
   cell adhesion molecule, and CD45. hi 21 patients, we performed staining
   for the androgen receptor. CTC counts were correlated with clinical and
   pathological parameters using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for
   continuous parameters and Chi-square test for categorical parameters.
   Results: CTC were detected in 25 (50\%) patients. The median number of
   CTC in CTC-positive patients was 9 CTC/2 ml (range: 1-417).
   Pancytokeratin positive CTC showed expression of androgen the receptor.
   We observed no correlation between CTC counts and prostate-specific
   antigen concentration, tumor stage, lymph node stage, or Gleason grade.
   Conclusion: hi a representative cohort of patients with clinically
   localized PC, CTC can be detected in a considerable proportion of
   patients when using a new microfluidic ratchet mechanism. This
   encourages further studies assessing the prognostic effect of
   antigen-independent enriched CTC in patients with PC. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Power flow analysis is one of the tools that is required in most of the

   systems is the load unbalance in the phases and a three-phase power flow

   (3LPF) formulation is derived based on the fact that in a typical
   distribution system, voltage angles and magnitudes vary within
   relatively narrow boundaries. The accuracy of the proposed 3LPF is
   verified using several test cases. Potential applications of the
   proposed method are in distribution systems state estimation and

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Embedded Systems (CPESs) are distributed embedded systems
   integrated with various actuators and sensors. When it comes to the
   issue of CPES security, the most significant problem is the security of
   Embedded Sensor Networks (ESNs). With the continuous growth of ESNs, the
   security of transferring data from sensors to their destinations has
   become an important research area. Due to the limitations in power,
   storage, and processing capabilities, existing security mechanisms for
   wired or wireless networks cannot apply directly to ESNs. Meanwhile,
   ESNs are likely to be attacked by different kinds of attacks in
   industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these
   problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID)
   techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect
   malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence
   of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to
   achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing
   detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems
   (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In
   addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium
   and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can
   both reduce energy consumption by up to 50\% compared with the existing
   All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10\% to
   15\% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model.}},

Abstract = {{The information extracted from monitoring of rotary blasthole drills
   helps to optimize the overall mining operation. Rock hardness,
   drillability, blastability and specific energy of drilling are examples
   of parameters that have been estimated in the past using measurement
   while drilling techniques. In order to be able to properly utilize
   measurement while drilling techniques, it is important to properly
   collect, analyze and interpret extracted data. This paper deals with
   processing of measurement while drilling data such as rate of
   penetration, rotary speed, rotary torque and pulldown force collected
   from rotary blasthole drills. Different methods are discussed to
   calculate a true rate of penetration which is the most important
   monitored drill variable for use in rock mass characterization. Then
   specific energy of drilling is defined and calculated based on
   electrical and mechanical inputs and the results are compared. The
   results show that specific energy of drilling can be estimated using the
   drill's primary drive systems' electrical responses with good accuracy

Abstract = {{We determine the Raman spectra corresponding to a number of
   thin-film-carbon/substrate systems. The process of baseline correction
   and means of peak fitting are discussed. It is observed that the
   traditional two-peak fit, with both D- and G-peaks, leads to deviations
   between the fit and the baseline corrected experimental data considered
   in this analysis. A third peak at 1490 cm(-1), which we refer to as the
   S-peak, is introduced in order to create a more satisfying fit with the
   results of experiment. The Raman spectrum of the
   thin-film-carbon/substrate system grown through the use of a silicon
   interlayer at higher deposition pressures (between 300 and 400 mTorr) is
   found to exhibit a peculiar nature, wherein its baseline must be
   determined through means that deviate from the norm. We have acquired
   evidence, although this is not explicitly shown within this paper, that
   suggests that this peculiarity may be due to the higher deposition
   pressures that are employed for the sample preparations considered for
   the purposes of this analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Failure mechanisms of the rock mass in the regions of maximum stress
   concentrations around a longwall face were assessed. In this respect,
   seismic events that result from changes in the stress field were
   analyzed to gain more knowledge about rock failure mechanisms in the
   proximity of the face area. A deep longwall mine developed at depths of
   about 3-3.5 km in South Africa was selected as a case study. Seismic
   moment tensor solutions were obtained for 32 seismic events with moment
   magnitudes in the range of 0.49 and 2.10. Through moment tensor
   decomposition, the dominant failure mechanisms were investigated by
   drawing focal mechanism plots. Further analysis was implemented by
   depicting the corresponding 3D radiation patterns of P-wave particle
   motions. Although the results cover various failure mechanisms, the
   dominant mechanisms are shear, implosional, and compressional failures.
   According to the results, most of the maximum principal stresses in the
   mine are compressive and oriented nearly vertical, which are in
   accordance with the gravitational collapses of the mined out areas. The
   results obtained from this research show that measuring and analyzing
   mining-induced seismicity can be a reliable measure to characterize the
   dominant failure mechanisms in a nondestructive manner and to provide a
   useful assessment of the stability of the longwall face in advance of
   extraction.}},

Abstract = {{The use of artificial intelligence methods in different hydraulic
   sciences has become conventional in recent years. In this study, two
   artificial neural networks (ANN), namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) and
   radial basis function (RBF) models were modified with decision trees
   (DT) and designed as two new hybrid models, namely DT-MLP and DT-RBF.
   The performance of the proposed hybrid (DT-MLP and DT-RBF) and simple
   (MLP and RBF) models was compared for velocity and water surface
   prediction in sharp 90 degrees bends. The experimental data for 5
   different hydraulic conditions in a sharp 90 degrees bend were used to
   train and test the models. In velocity prediction, the mean absolute
   error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and relative error (delta)
   values decreased with the DT-MLP model compared to the MLP model by
   16\%, 9\% and 0.17\% and the values of DT-RBF reduced by 11\%, 7\% and
   0.11\% compared to the RBF model, respectively. For water surface
   prediction, the MAE, RMSE and delta errors decreased with the DT-MLP
   model by 5.2\%, 5.5\% and 0.095\% compared with MLP and with the DT-RBF
   model the errors decreased by 20\%, 23\% and 0.5\% compared with RBF,
   respectively. Using the new proposed hybrid algorithms based on decision
   trees enhanced the simple MLP and RBF models' performance. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Effective capacity is defined as the maximum constant traffic arrival
   rate that a communication channel can support in order to guarantee a
   certain statistical delay constraint. We investigate the effective
   capacity performance of the optical wireless communications employing
   the coherent detection and polarization multiplexing over the
   Gamma-Gamma turbulence fading channels with pointing errors. We consider
   two different power adaptation techniques, namely, independent power
   adaptation and joint power adaptation. Closed-form effective capacity
   expressions are developed for both power adaptation schemes. Asymptotic
   analyses provide the increments of the effective capacities in the high
   signal-to-noise ratio regimes, in both nonstringent and stringent
   statistical delay constraints, for every 1 dB increase of the average
   transmit optical power. Our analysis reveals the superiority of the
   joint power-adaptation technique in order to support the stringent
   statistical delay constraint services over the optical wireless
   communication channels impaired by the strong turbulence fading and/or
   large pointing errors. However, the numerical results demonstrate that
   the performance gap between the joint and independent power adaptations
   becomes significantly reduced as the statistical delay constraints
   become loose and/or the channel impairments (i. e., turbulence fading
   and/or pointing error) become weak.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors provide excellent capability for the
   structural health monitoring (SHM) of load-bearing structures by
   allowing for local internal strain measurements within structures.
   However, the integration of these sensors to composite materials is
   associated with several challenges that have to be addressed to have the
   correct strain measurement and in turn to perform reliable SHM. One of
   the most important issues is the presence of uneven strain fields around
   FBGs, which significantly affect the response of the sensors and hence
   the reliability of the acquired data. The uniformity of the strain
   fields around sensors is important for dependable data acquisition;
   however, to generate such a condition, tow width-to-FBG length
   relationship, optical fiber configuration with respect to reinforcement
   fiber orientation, and crack density resulting from fatigue loading are
   very important factors that have to be considered. In this paper, these
   issues are addressed by investigating the signal properties of FBG
   sensors with 1 and 10 mm lengths embedded within the composite specimens
   during the manufacturing process. After fatigue testing of the
   specimens, it is shown that 1-mm-long FBGs embedded in-line with
   adjacent reinforcement fibers with tow widths of similar to 2 mm provide
   much more reliable signals than 10-mm-long FBGs embedded perpendicular
   to adjacent tows.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Missed detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis contamination
   in platelet (PLT) storage bags by the standard 24-hour-postcollection
   BacT/ALERT screening test has been documented. A slow growth rate and
   the strong tendency of this bacterium to adhere to surfaces can
   contribute to missed detection of the pathogen.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Topography of two different PLT storage bag
   surfaces, textured (rough) and smooth surfaces of Terumo 80440 bags
   (designated A15), was studied. Adhesion of biofilm-positive and
   -negative S. epidermidis strains on these surfaces was evaluated under
   static conditions. Quality of stored PLTs in A15 bags under blood bank
   conditions was compared for two different bag orientations (rough vs.
   smooth surface down) on Days 2, 5, and 7 of storage. PLT adhesion on the
   surfaces was evaluated after 7 days of storage.
   RESULTS: Bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation were significantly
   higher on the rough surfaces of A15 bags compared to the smooth
   surfaces. After 7 days of storage in A15 bags, PLTs showed similar
   metabolite levels, pH, and response capacity in the bags with different
   orientation and more PLT adhesion and aggregation was observed on rough
   surfaces.
   CONCLUSION: Higher bacterial adhesion on rough surfaces can contribute
   to missed detection of bacterial strains that tend to adhere on
   surfaces. PLT adhesion and aggregation on rough surfaces can affect the
   quality and safety of PLTs by promoting more bacterial adhesion and
   biofilm formation on surfaces.}},

   were synthesized by using CaO-based pellets as cores and different
   mesoporous metal oxides (e.g. alumina, ceria, and yttrium-stabilized
   zirconia) as shells through a repeated wet impregnation coating process.
   Cyclic CO2 capture performance of the obtained sorbents was investigated
   using a thermogravimetric analyzer. Among all the core/shell sorbents
   under study, the pellets coated with a layer of alumina exhibit the best
   performance in the retention of CO2 uptake over 20 cycles with the
   lowest activity loss of only 30.4\%, attributed to the existence of the
   thermal stable porous alumina shell which prevents the sintering and the
   aggregation of the CaO grains. Moreover, the attrition study using an
   air-jet apparatus and a standard test method reveals that such sorbents
   exhibit enhanced attrition resistance due to the protection of the
   porous shell providing them with a great potential for application in
   fluidized bed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of a series of Co/Al2O3 and Re-Co/Al2O3 Fischer-Tropsch
   (FT) catalysts, with varying Co particle size, was measured in a
   continuous flow, stirred tank reactor operated at 220 degrees C, 2.1 MPa
   and with a H-2/CO = 2/1 synthesis gas for periods up to 190 h
   time-on-stream (TOS). Results showed that catalyst stability was
   dependent upon the Co particle size, the degree-of-reduction (DOR) of
   the catalyst precursor, and the CO conversion. At the chosen operating
   conditions, carbon deposition was the main cause of catalyst
   deactivation and the initial rate of carbon deposition per active Co
   site increased with increased Co particle size (d(Co) = 2-22 nm) when
   measured at approximately the same CO conversion level. On the 15 wt \%
   Co/Al2O3 catalyst the initial rate of carbon deposition increased with
   CO conversion (CO conversion <= 40\%) whereas, on the 1.2 wt \%Re-12 wt
   \%Co/Al2O3 catalyst, the initial rate of carbon deposition decreased
   with increased CO conversion (CO conversions >60\%) due to high

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{We consider a K link multiple-input multiple-output interference channel
   where each link consists of two fullduplex (FD) nodes. Two transmit
   beamforming design problems are solved: 1) sum-power minimization
   problem subject to rate constraints and 2) energy-efficiency
   maximization problem subject to individual power constraints. To tackle
   the sum-power minimization problem, we first generalize the well-known
   relationship between weighted-sum-rate (WSR) and weighted
   minimum-mean-squared-error (WMMSE) problems, originally used to solve
   the sum-rate maximization problems, and then propose a low complexity
   centralized algorithm, which converges to a stationary point. To
   decrease the exchange of a huge amount of data and excessive signaling
   traffic among the nodes, a distributed algorithm is also proposed. For
   the energy-efficiency maximization problem, the original fractional form
   optimization problem is first transformed into an equivalent
   subtractive-form optimization problem by exploiting the properties of
   fractional programming, and then performs a dual-layer optimization
   scheme. In the outer layer, the energy-efficiency parameter is searched
   using a simple 1-D search, and in the inner layer, the relationship
   between WSR and WMMSE is exploited to solve the subtractive form
   optimization problem. Since the proposed algorithms require perfect
   channel-state-information, which is difficult to acquire in practice, we
   also propose a robust design, by taking the imperfect channel knowledge
   into consideration. It is shown in the simulations that the sum-power
   achieved in FD mode depends heavily on the transmitter/receiver
   distortion. Also the energy-efficiency of FD systems is lower than that
   of halfduplex systems, as FD nodes need to overcome self-interference
   and increased inter-user interference, which leads to high power
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{a We study the optimal resource allocation in the wireless powered
   underground sensor network (WPUSN) for throughput maximization. The
   WPUSN is a new networking paradigm where underground sensors can be
   replenished by a radio frequency energy harvesting technique and
   transmit geological data to the nearby aboveground access point in real
   time. In this paradigm, the underground portion of the wireless
   communication link suffers from severe path loss. Moreover, different
   underground sensors may have diverse data traffic demands. In this
   paper, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the throughput
   in WPUSNs with the quality of service (QoS) consideration in terms of
   communication reliability and diverse data traffic demands.
   Specifically, we map the QoS requirements to signal-to-noise ratio
   thresholds and transform our problem into a convex optimization problem
   with linear constraints. We then present a closed-form solution for the
   transformed problem through a problem decomposition of the
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our closed-form solution uncovers the
   insights that how the wireless channel states, reliability requirements,
   and data traffic demands affect the optimal resource allocation in the
   WPUSN. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
   by running simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Tomlinson-Harashima precoding with frequency-domain equalization
   (THP-FDE) is a promising approach for multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) single-carrier broadband systems. By performing interference
   cancelation at the transmitter, THP-FDE performs better than
   frequency-domain decision-feedback equalization (FD-DFE) via eliminating
   the error propagation problem resulting from incorrect symbol decisions.
   One of the drawbacks for MIMO THP-FDE systems is that the spatial stream
   with the largest mean square error (MSE) dominates the error
   performance. To alleviate this problem, conventional design adopts a
   sorting algorithm (a permutation matrix) to minimize the worst-case
   stream MSE. Since the difference of stream MSEs roots in the nonequal
   diagonal entries of the MSE matrix in the time domain, we are motivated
   to apply a general linear precoder based on geometric-mean decomposition
   to balance these MSEs. By jointly optimizing the precoder and equalizer,
   we are able to minimize the arithmetic MSE, geometric MSE, and the worst
   stream MSE simultaneously for the MIMO THP-FDE system. Simulation
   results are presented to demonstrate the superior bit-error-rate (BER)
   performance of the proposed transceiver architecture for MIMO THP-FDE

Abstract = {{Uncertainties are ubiquitous and unavoidable in process design and
   modeling while they can significantly affect safety, reliability, and
   economic decisions. The large number of uncertainties in complex
   chemical processes make the well-known Monte-Carlo and polynomial chaos
   approaches for uncertainty quantification computationally expensive and
   even infeasible. This study focused on the uncertainty quantification
   and sensitivity analysis of complex chemical processes with a large
   number of uncertainties. An efficient method was proposed using a
   compressed sensing technique to overcome the computational limitations
   for complex and large scale systems. In the proposed method, compressive
   sparse polynomial chaos surrogates were constructed and applied to
   quantify the uncertainties and reflect their propagation effect on
   process design. Rigorous case studies were provided by the interface
   between MATLAB (TM) and Aspen HYSYS (TM) for a propylene glycol
   production process and lean thy gas processing plant. The proposed
   methodology was compared with traditional Monte-Carlo/Quasi Monte-Carlo
   sampling-based and standard polynomial chaos approaches to highlight its
   advantages in terms of computational efficiency. The proposed approach
   could mitigate the simulation costs significantly using an accurate,
   efficient-to evaluate polynomial chaos that can be used in place of
   expensive simulations. In addition, the global sensitivity indices,
   which show the relative importance of uncertain inputs on the process
   output, could be derived analytically from the obtained polynomial chaos
   surrogate model. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

Abstract = {{High salinity of local groundwater and the thermal gradient present
   within the deep geological repository environment make it necessary to
   investigate the effect of the pore fluid salinity on the
   hydro-mechanical behavior engineered barriers at different degrees of
   saturation. This study examines the impact of CaCl2 salt solution at two
   concentrations, i.e., 100 and 250 g/L on the compressibility and shear
   strength behavior of the bentonite-sand buffer (BSB) within a range of
   saturations. Both as-compacted and desiccated BSB specimens were
   studied. Desiccated specimens were prepared in a constant-suction
   environment using the vapor equilibrium technique, and high-pressure
   cells were used to carry out the triaxial shear experiments.
   Experimental results were compared with the available data from the
   literature for BSB materials prepared with distilled water in order to
   get a better understanding of the impact of the salinity. The comparison
   shows that the existence of salt in the specimens has notable effect on
   the total suction levels, compressibility and shear strength of the
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Due to environmental concerns of rising energy consumption caused by
   explosive growth in the demands of wireless multimedia services, energy
   efficiency has become an important consideration in the design of future
   wireless communication systems. In this paper, we investigate and
   propose an energy-efficient scheme of joint antenna-subcarrier-power
   allocation for min-rate guaranteed services in the downlink multiuser
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing distributed antenna systems
   (OFDM-DASs) with limited backhaul capacity. Our aim is to maximize the
   energy efficiency in an OFDM-DAS based on the constraints of users'
   Quality of Service, subcarrier reuse, backhaul capacity, and remote
   antenna units' transmit power. By exploring the properties of the
   complex nonconvex energy efficiency optimization problem, we transform
   the problem into an equivalent problem based on fractional programming,
   and then, use the alternating direction multiplier method to decompose
   the problem into a series of simpler subproblems, where their optimal or
   suboptimal solutions can be easily achieved. We propose the
   corresponding low-complexity methods to solve the subproblems and, then,
   the whole problem. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed low-complexity energy-efficient scheme and illustrate
   the fundamental tradeoff among energy consumption, spectral efficiency,
   and energy efficiency.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A multidisciplinary design method is developed in this paper to
   optimally evolve and synthesize multi domain engineering systems. The
   design methodology utilizes two navigated optimization loops to handle
   the optimization of both topology and parameters. In the topology
   optimization, which is the outer loop, the proposed artificial immune
   system (AIS) tool, which contains a clonal selection algorithm (CLONALG)
   and negative selection techniques, is utilized to synthesize the number
   and the structure of the elements. A novel concept of ``artificial
   vaccination{''} is developed, which is responsible for the incorporation
   of domain knowledge. In the inner loop, an optimization tool that
   incorporates simple AIS is utilized for parameter tuning in any
   generated topology. By acquiring knowledge and learning from prior
   trials, the evolution parameters are automatically and intelligently
   tuned to make the design model more reliable and to facilitate more
   effective navigation. Numerical study on the design of a hydraulic
   engine mount is presented. The results indicate that the proposed design
   flowchart enables the designers to successfully modify (specifically,
   extend or reduce) the initial colony in order to obtain the optimal

Abstract = {{To predict the flexural behavior of ultra-high-performance
   fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) beams including straight steel fibers
   with various lengths, micromechanics-based sectional analysis was
   performed. A linear compressive modeling was adopted on the basis of
   experiments. The tensile behavior was modeled by considering both pre-
   and post-cracking tensile behaviors. Pre-cracking behavior was modeled
   by the rule of mixture. Post-cracking behavior was modeled by a bilinear
   matrix softening curve and fiber bridging curves, considering three
   different probability density functions (PDFs) for fiber orientation,
   i.e., the actual PDF from image analysis and PDFs assuming either random
   two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) fiber orientation.
   Analytical predictions using the fiber bridging curves with the actual
   PDF or the PDF assuming 2-D random fiber orientation showed fairly good
   agreement with the experimental results, whereas analysis using the PDF
   assuming 3-D random fiber orientation greatly underestimated the
   experimental results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper machine cross-directional (CD) process is a large-scale
   spatially distributed system. It is known to be severely ill-conditioned
   as the gain rolls down to zero for some of the process directions. Model
   uncertainties in the process are inevitable resulting in a challenging
   robust control design problem. CD actuators are subject to min-max
   constraints while slice lip actuators are subject to additional bending
   moment limits. Because of the large number of input constraints, the
   industrial practice is to tune the CD controller assuming inactive
   constraints. The robustness of CD feedback loops to model uncertainties
   under constrained internal model control satisfies an integral quadratic
   inequality. This work develops an automatic tuning algorithm that
   guarantees robust stability and performance of the constrained CD
   feedback loop. Spatial response models are identified in a prediction
   error frame delivering bounds on the CD process pseudo-singular values.
   The CD controller is synthesized online through a linear matrix
   inequalities feasibility problem taking into consideration the modal
   space uncertainty rising from the uncertainties in the estimated
   parameters and the expected variations in the dynamic response. The
   developed tuning technique is suitable for paper machines producing
   different grades of paper as the CD process spatial and dynamic
   responses change for each grade. The performance of the tuned
   constrained internal model control controller is validated through
   comparing it to an industrial CD controller that has been implemented in
   paper mills as part of a commercial product. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recent research and advances in the automation of anesthesia
   are driving the need to better understand electroencephalogram (EEG)
   based anesthesia end points and to test the performance of anesthesia
   monitors. This effort is currently limited by the need to collect raw
   EEG data directly from patients.
   METHODS: A procedural method to synthesize EEG signals was implemented
   in a mobile software application. The application is capable of sending
   the simulated signal to an anesthesia depth of hypnosis monitor.
   Systematic sweeps of the simulator generate functional monitor response
   profiles reminiscent of how network analyzers are used to test
   electronic components.
   RESULTS: Three commercial anesthesia monitors (Entropy, NeuroSENSE, and
   BIS) Were compared with this new technology, and significant response
   and feature variations between the monitor models were observed; this
   includes reproducible, nonmonotonic apparent multistate behavior and
   significant hysteresis at light levels of anesthesia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia monitor response to a procedural simulator can
   reveal significant differences in internal signal processing algorithms.
   The ability to synthesize EEG signals at different anesthetic depths
   potentially provides a new method for systematically testing EEG based
   monitors and automated anesthesia systems with all sensor hardware fully
   operational before human trials.}},

Abstract = {{We use large scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to
   study the kinetics of polymer melt crystallization. For monodisperse
   polymer melts of several chain lengths under various cooling protocols,
   we show that short chains have a higher terminal crystallinity value
   compared to longer ones. They align at the early stages and then cease
   evolving. Long chains, however, align, fold into lamella structures and
   then slowly optimize their dangling ends for the remaining simulation
   time. We then identify the mechanism behind bidisperse blend
   crystallization. To this end, we introduce a new algorithm (called
   Individual Chain Crystallinity) that allows the calculation of the
   crystallinity separately for short and long chains in the blend. We find
   that, in general, bidispersity hinders crystallization significantly. At
   first the crystallinity of the long chain components exceeds that of the
   monodisperse melt, but subsequently falls below the corresponding
   monodisperse melt curve after a certain ``crossover time.{''} The time
   of the crossover can be attributed to the time required for the full
   crystallization of the short chains. This indicates that at the early
   stages the short chains are helping long chains to crystallize. However,
   after all short chains have crystallized they start to hinder the
   crystallization of the long chains by obstructing their motion. Lastly,
   polymer crystallization upon various thermodynamic protocols is studied.
   Slower cooling is found to increase the crystallinity value. Upon an
   instantaneous deep quench and subsequent isothermal relaxation, the
   crystallinity grows rapidly with time at early stages and subsequently
   saturates. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element analysis (FEA) of bones scanned with Quantitative
   Computed Tomography (QCT) can improve early detection of osteoporosis.
   The accuracy of these models partially depends on the assigned material
   properties, but anisotropy of the trabecular bone cannot be fully
   captured due to insufficient resolution of QCT. The inclusion of
   anisotropy measured from high resolution peripheral QCT (HR-pQCT) could
   potentially improve QCT-based FEA of the femur, although no improvements
   have yet been demonstrated in previous experimental studies.
   This study analyzed the effects of adding anisotropy to clinical
   resolution femur models by constructing six sets of FE models (two
   isotropic and four anisotropic) for each specimen from a set of sixteen
   femurs that were experimentally tested in sideways fall loading with a
   strain gauge on the superior femoral neck. Two different modulus-density
   relationships were tested, both with and without anisotropy derived from
   mean intercept length analysis of HR-pQCT scans.
   Comparing iso- and anisotropic models to the experimental data resulted
   in nearly identical correlation and highly similar linear regressions
   for both whole bone stiffness and strain gauge measurements. Anisotropic
   models contained consistently greater principal compressive strains,
   approximately 14\% in magnitude, in certain internal elements located in
   the femoral neck, greater trochanter, and femoral head.
   In summary, anisotropy had minimal impact on macroscopic measurements,
   but did alter internal strain behavior. This suggests that organ level
   QCT-based FE models measuring femoral stiffness have little to gain from
   the addition of anisotropy, but studies considering failure of internal
   structures should consider including anisotropy to their models. (C)

Title = {{Gain and Polarization Properties of a Large Radio Telescope from

Journal = {{PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{969}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Measurement of the brightness temperature of extended radio emission
   demands knowledge of the gain (or aperture efficiency) of the telescope
   and measurement of the polarized component of the emission requires
   correction for the conversion of unpolarized emission from sky and
   ground to apparently polarized signal. Radiation properties of the John
   A. Galt Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory were
   studied through analysis and measurement in order to provide absolute
   calibration of a survey of polarized emission from the entire northern
   sky from 1280 to 1750 MHz, and to understand the polarization
   performance of the telescope. Electromagnetic simulation packages CST
   and GRASP-10 were used to compute complete radiation patterns of the
   telescope in all Stokes parameters, and thereby to establish gain and
   aperture efficiency. Aperture efficiency was also evaluated using
   geometrical optics and ray tracing analysis and was measured based on
   the known flux density of Cyg A. Measured aperture efficiency varied
   smoothly with frequency between values of 0.49 and 0.54; GRASP-10
   yielded values 6.5\% higher but with closely similar variation with
   frequency. Overall error across the frequency band is 3\%, but values at
   any two frequencies are relatively correct to similar to 1\%. Dominant
   influences on aperture efficiency are the illumination taper of the feed
   radiation pattern and the shadowing of the reflector from the feed by
   the feed-support struts. A model of emission from the ground was
   developed based on measurements and on empirical data obtained from
   remote sensing of the Earth from satellite-borne telescopes. This model
   was convolved with the computed antenna response to estimate conversion
   of ground emission into spurious polarized signal. The computed spurious
   signal is comparable to measured values, but is not accurate enough to
   be used to correct observations. A simpler model, in which the ground is
   considered as an unpolarized emitter with a brightness temperature of
   similar to 240 K, is shown to have useful accuracy when compared to
   measurements.}},

Title = {{Characterization and dynamic charge dependent modeling of conducting

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Trilayer bending actuators are charge driven devices that have the
   ability to function in air and provide large mechanical amplification.
   The electronic and mechanical properties of these actuators are known to
   be functions of their charge state making prediction of their responses
   more difficult when they operate over their full range of deformation.
   In this work, a combination of state space representation and a
   two-dimensional RC transmission line model are used to implement a
   nonlinear time variant model for conducting polymer-based trilayer
   actuators. Electrical conductivity and Young's modulus of
   electromechanically active PEDOT conducting polymer containing films as
   a function of applied voltage were measured and incorporated into the
   model. A 16\% drop in Young's modulus and 24 times increase in
   conductivity are observed by oxidizing the PEDOT. A closed form
   formulation for radius of curvature of trilayer actuators considering
   asymmetric and location dependent Young's modulus and conductivity in
   the conducting polymer layers is derived and implemented in the model.
   The nonlinear model shows the capability to predict the radius of
   curvature as a function of time and position with reasonable consistency
   (within 4\%). The formulation is useful for general trilayer
   configurations to calculate the radius of curvature as a function of
   time. The proposed electrochemical modeling approach may also be useful
   for modeling energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates commercially available granular phase change
   materials (PCMs) with different transition temperatures for the use of
   thermal-energy storage systems in fluidized beds. The hydrodynamic
   characteristics of granular PCMs were tested in cylindrical-3D and
   planar-2D fluidized beds. The density, particle size distribution and
   angle of repose were measured for various PCM materials. Further
   attrition studies were conducted with changes in particle surface from
   abrasion, which were characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope
   (SEM). The results indicate that some materials with smaller particle
   size and thinner supporting structure can lose the paraffin during the
   fluidization process, when paraffin is in a liquid state. As a
   consequence, the particles agglomerate, and the bed defluidizes. For all
   of the tested materials, only GR50 (with a transition temperature of 50
   degrees C) properly fluidizes when the paraffin is in the liquid state
   and has shown to endure >75 h of continuous operation and 15
   melting-solidification cycles in a fluidized bed. Additional
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the cycled
   particles did not show a decrease in energy storage capacity of the
   granular PCM, which corroborates that there is no loss of material after
   >75 h of fluidization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Among different types of video manipulations, video inter-frame forgery
   is a powerful and common tampering operation. Several forensic and
   anti-forensic techniques have been proposed to deal with this challenge.
   In this paper, we first improve an existing video frame deletion
   detection algorithm. The improvement is attributed to the combination of
   two properties resulted from video frame deletion, the periodicity and
   the magnitude of the fingerprint in the P-frame prediction error. We
   then analyze a typical anti-forensic method of video frame deletion, and
   prove that the fingerprint of frame deletion still can be discovered
   after being anti-forensically modified. We thus further propose a
   counter anti-forensics approach by estimating the true prediction error
   and comparing it with the prediction error stored in videos. We show
   that the detection algorithm is not only useful in detecting video frame
   deletion, but also useful for detecting video frame insertion. Compared
   with the existing counter anti-forensics, our proposed approach is
   robust when different motion estimation algorithms are used in the
   initial compression. Furthermore, the forensics and counter
   anti-forensics are combined to perform a two-phase test to detect video
   inter-frame forgery. A Video Inter-frame Forgery (VIF) game, which is
   zero-sum, simultaneous-move, is defined to analyze the interplay between
   the forger and the investigator. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is
   introduced to solve the VIF game and we can obtain the optimal
   strategies for both players. Experimental results show that the proposed
   forensic and counter anti-forensic methods not only outperform existing
   methods in detecting frame deletion and anti-forensics, but also
   outperform them in the VIF game.}},

Abstract = {{In order to prevent the occurrence of accidents in iron and steel
   enterprises, it is essential to change the risk management pattern from
   post-emergenby response to hazard control and prevention. Based on the
   characteristics of iron and steel enterprises, this paper investigates
   the early warning system for accidents for iron and steel enterprises,
   aiming for the adoption of accident prevention and hazard control. An
   early warning index system and an early warning model were constructed
   based on production types and accident statistics of the enterprises. On
   account of the factors that influence accidents, this early warning
   index system contains 3 hierarchies with 5 composite indexes and 22
   thematic indexes. The indexes have been quantified, regularized, and
   their weights were determined using a combination weighting method based
   on the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Entropy Weight Methbd. The
   early warning index model was established according to Grey System
   Theory GM (1,1), and the comprehensive early warning indexes were
   calculated by Multi-objective Linear Weighted Function. The thresholds
   were then determined, the early warning levels were identified, and the
   early warning signals were output accordingly. The feasibility and
   validity of the proposed early warning model was tested and verified
   through its application in a functioning industrial plant. (C) 2016

Title = {{Evaluation of substructuring method for seismic soil-structure
   interaction analysis of bridges}},
Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{112-127}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the commonly used substructuring method for
   analysis of bridge systems where the bridge is divided into two
   sub-systems: the bridge superstructure and the substructure including
   the pile foundations, abutments, and soil. Modeling of the
   soil-structure interaction (SSI) in the system Is simplified by
   replacing the pile foundations, abutments, and soil with sets of
   independent equivalent linear springs and dashpots at the base of the
   superstructure. The main objective of the paper is to examine how well
   the substructuring method simulates the seismic response of a bridge
   system. The baseline data required for the evaluation process is derived
   from analyzing a fully-coupled continuum bridge model, already validated
   for the instrumented two-span Meloland Road Overpass. The same bridge
   system is also simulated using the substructuring method. The results
   from both approaches are compared, and it is shown that the differences
   between them can be significant. The substructuring method consistently
   overestimates the pier base shear forces and bending moments and the
   pier top deflections. Moreover, the spectral response of the bridge
   structure is mispredicted. The analyses are repeated for a three-span
   bridge system subjected to several ground motions, leading to a similar
   observation as before. Hence, the current state of practice for
   simulating seismic SSI in bridges using the substructure model is shown
   to be too simplified to capture the major mechanisms involved in SSI.

Title = {{Integrated oxidation membrane filtration process - NOM rejection and
   membrane fouling}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{418-424}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The extent and mechanisms by which organic matter in a solution can be
   retained and foul a membrane largely depends on the molecular weight of
   the material being filtered and the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of
   the membrane. The present study investigated the effect of the MWCO of a
   membrane and the molecular weight distribution of natural organic matter
   (NOM) in a source water on the increase in resistance to the permeate
   flux over time. Of particular interest was the effect of oxidation,
   applied prior to membrane filtration, on the predominant fouling
   mechanism. Oxidation can change the molecular weight distribution of
   organic matter in raw water, and therefore the ability of a membrane to
   retain this organic matter.
   Oxidation, using both ozonation and UV/H2O2, could effectively reduce
   the extent of fouling for higher MWCO membranes. However, neither
   oxidation approaches could effectively reduce the extent of fouling for
   lower MWCO membranes, likely because oxidation could not effectively
   oxidize lower molecular weight organic matter. Althoug the data
   indicated that the extent of fouling is increasing with the amount of
   DOC retained by the membrane, no statistically significant correlation
   was observed between these parameters. The results suggest that
   oxidation did not affect the predominant fouling mechanism. However, it
   did affect the molecular weight distribution of the organic matter
   retained by the membranes, and as a result, the resistance offered by
   the foulant cake layer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional model for biomass steam gasification in dual fluidized

   circulation flux (S-cf) and the flow rate of the additional methane.
   burnt in the riser (F-m). Under the benchmark conditions, the mole
   fractions of H-2 and CO2 increase along the height of the bubbling
   fluidized bed (BFB), while those of CO and CH4 decrease. The
   gasification temperature decreases slightly against the height in the
   bed zone, but increases in the freeboard zone. The superficial velocity
   slightly increases and the bubbles grow against the height in the BFB.
   Increasing both F-bio and R-sb restricts the gasification process,
   increasing S-cf only slightly affects the gasification results, and
   increasing F-m promotes the gasification process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The average shear wave velocity of the near-surface materials down to a
   depth of 30 m (V-s(30)) is essential for seismic site characterization
   to estimate the local amplification factor of the seismic waves during
   an earthquake. Chittagong City is one of the highest risk cities of
   Bangladesh for its seismic vulnerability. In the present study, the
   V-s(30) is estimated for Chittagong City using the multichannel analysis
   of surface waves (MASW), small scale microtremor measurement (SSMM),
   downhole seismic (DS), and correlation between the shear wave velocity
   (V-s) and standard penetration test blow count (SPT-N). The V-s(30) of
   the near-surface materials of the city varies from 123 m/s to 420 m/s. A
   VI map is prepared from the V-s(30) of each 30 m grid using the
   relationship between the Holocene soil thickness and the V-s(30). Based
   on the V-s(30), the near-surface materials of Chittagong City are
   classified as site classes C, D, and E according to the National
   Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), USA and as site classes B,
   C, and D according to the Eurocode 8. The V-s(30) map can be used for
   seismic microzonation, future planning, and development of the city to
   improve the earthquake resiliency of the city. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The research presented in this paper examines the shear resistance
   performance of self-tapping screws (STS) in three-ply cross-laminated
   timber (CLT) panels. Specifically, the feasibility of using innovative
   STS assemblies with double inclination of fasteners was investigated for
   the shear connection of CLT panels. The specimens (1.5x1.5m) were
   subjected to quasi-static and reversed-cyclic loading. The tests were
   set up to approximate pure shear loading, with three-panel CLT
   assemblies connected with STS. The resulting load-displacement and
   hysteretic curves were used to determine an equivalent energy
   elastic-plastic curve to estimate assembly capacity, yield load, yield
   displacement, ductility ratio, stiffness, and damping. Excellent
   structural performance in terms of capacity and stiffness was obtained
   while still providing the required ductility for the system to be used
   in seismic applications. The average static and cyclic yield loads were
   6.0kN/screw and 5.9kN/screw, respectively. Average static and cyclic and
   ductility ratios were 7.7 and 4.1, respectively, allowing the connection
   to be classified as highly ductile under quasi-static loading and
   moderately ductile under reversed cyclic loading. The data obtained
   allow engineers to specify an innovative connection assembly with double
   inclination of fasteners for lateral load-resisting systems of CLT
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of lithium-ion batteries are complex and are often
   approximated by models consisting of partial differential equations
   (PDEs) relating the internal ionic concentrations and potentials. The
   Pseudo two-dimensional model (P2D) is one model that performs
   sufficiently accurately under various operating conditions and battery
   chemistries. Despite its widespread use for prediction, this model is
   too complex for standard estimation and control applications. This
   article presents an original algorithm for state-of charge estimation
   using the P2D model. Partial differential equations are discretized
   using implicit stable algorithms and reformulated into a nonlinear
   state-space model. This discrete, high-dimensional model (consisting of
   tens to hundreds of states) contains implicit, nonlinear algebraic
   equations. The uncertainty in the model is characterized by additive
   Gaussian noise. By exploiting the special structure of the pseudo
   two-dimensional model, a novel particle filter algorithm that sweeps in
   time and spatial coordinates independently is developed. This algorithm
   circumvents the degeneracy problems associated with high-dimensional
   state estimation and avoids the repetitive solution of implicit
   equations by defining a `tether' particle. The approach is illustrated
   through extensive simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A three-dimensional transient thermal-fluid flow-compositional study of
   ingot casting during electron beam remelting of Ti-6Al-4V}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Electron beam cold hearth remelting (EBCHR) is a consolidation and
   refining process capable of consolidating titanium scrap and sponge
   material into high quality titanium alloy ingots. During the final stage
   of casting in the EBCHR process, operators must balance the potential to
   form large shrinkage voids, caused by turning off the electron beam
   heating, against the tendency to evaporate alloying additions, which
   occurs if the top surface remains molten. A comprehensive understanding
   of the evaporation and fluid flow conditions occurring during the final
   stage of EBCHR is required in order to optimize ingot production. This
   research focused on developing a coupled thermal, fluid flow and
   composition model, capable of predicting the temperature, fluid flow and
   composition fields within an EBCHR cast, Ti-6Al-4V ingot. The physical
   phenomena of thermal and compositional buoyancy, mushy zone flow
   attenuation and aluminum evaporation were incorporated in the model
   formulation. Industrial scale experiments were carried out at the
   production facilities of a leading industrial producer of titanium to
   provide data and measurements for model verification. Model predictions
   for liquid pool profile, last liquid to solidify and composition fields
   are in good agreement with the industrially measured results. A
   sensitivity analysis was performed with the model to study the effects
   of variation of electron beam power input and hot top time duration on
   the evaporative losses and position of solidification voids. For the
   cases examined, there was a strong correlation between electron beam
   power and alloying element losses, while hot top duration variation
   results indicated a stronger dependence on last liquid to solidify than
   on alloying element losses. Therefore a classic optimization problem
   arises between balancing hot top duration with alloying element losses.

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{531-546}},

Abstract = {{Material properties, amount of longitudinal and transverse steel,
   external confinement, axial load and shear span-depth ratio affect the
   lateral load capacity, ductility and failure mode of retrofitted bridge
   piers under seismic load. These parameters are considerably different in
   old reinforced concrete (RC) bridge piers compared to the seismically
   designed bridges. This research investigates the effects of these
   factors and their interactions on the limit states of carbon fiber
   reinforced polymer (CFRP) confined seismically deficient RC circular
   bridge piers using fractional factorial design method. CFRP-confined
   bridge piers are modelled using a fiber modelling approach and nonlinear
   static pushover analyses of the bridge piers are conducted in order to
   determine the sequence of different limit states such as yielding,
   buckling and fracture of reinforcement, and concrete crushing along with
   ductility capacity of the piers. This study shows that the shear
   span-depth ratio, yield strength and longitudinal reinforcement ratio,
   axial load and CFRP confinement significantly affect the lateral load
   capacity, ductility and the failure mode of retrofitted bridge piers

Abstract = {{Size, shape and density of biomass particles influence their
   transportation, fluidization, rates of drying and thermal decomposition.
   Pelleting wood particles increases the particle density and reduces the
   variability of physical properties among biomass particles. In this
   study, pine chips prepared for pulping and commercially produced pine
   pellets were ground in a hammer mill using grinder screens of 3.2, 6.3,
   12.7 and 25.4 mm perforations. Pellets consumed about 7 times lower
   specific grinding energy than chips to produce the same size of
   particles. Grinding pellets produced the smaller particles with narrower
   size distribution than grinding chips. Derived shape factors in digital
   image analysis showed that chip particles were rectangular and had the
   aspect ratios about one third of pellet particles. Pellet particles were
   more circular shape. The mechanical sieving underestimated the actual
   particle size and did not represent the size of particles correctly.
   Instead, digital imaging is preferred. Angle of repose and
   compressibility tests represented the flow properties of ground
   particles. Pellet particles made a less compacted bulk, had lower
   cohesion and did flow easier in a pile of particles. Particle shape
   affected the flow properties more than particle size. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{Ice hockey body checks involving direct shoulder-to-head contact
   frequently result in head injury. In the current study, we examined the
   effect of shoulder pad style on the likelihood of head injury from a
   shoulder-to-head check. Shoulder-to-head body checks were simulated by
   swinging a modified Hybrid-III anthropomorphic test device (ATD) with
   and without shoulder pads into a stationary Hybrid-III ATD at 21km/h.
   Tests were conducted with three different styles of shoulder pads
   (traditional, integrated and tethered) and without shoulder pads for the
   purpose of control. Head response kinematics for the stationary ATD were
   measured. Compared to the case of no shoulder pads, the three different
   pad styles significantly (p<0.05) reduced peak resultant linear head
   accelerations of the stationary ATD by 35-56\%. The integrated shoulder
   pads reduced linear head accelerations by an additional 18-21\% beyond
   the other two styles of shoulder pads. The data presented here suggest
   that shoulder pads can be designed to help protect the head of the

   report a novel strategy to ``engineer{''} controlled 3D nanocomposite
   fibrous matrix of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and silk fibroin (SF)
   for an artificial dermis application. Using a custom-designed cold-plate
   electrospinning and automatic magnet agitation system, up to 6 mm of the
   thickness was achieved resulting from the accumulation of ice crystal
   layers on the PCL nanofibers surface-modified with the SF particles. The
   sacrificed ice crystals induced interconnected macro-pores ranging from
   tens to hundreds pm. The agitation system introduced uniform
   distribution of the SF protein within/on the nanofibers, preventing the
   particles from precipitation and agglomeration. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts
   proliferated in vitro on the PCL and PCL/SF scaffolds for 7 days, but
   there was no statistical difference between the groups. Conversely, In
   vivo rat model studies revealed that the wound healing rate and collagen
   deposition increased with the SF content within the nanocomposites. The
   unique 3D construct with the PCL/SF nanocomposite fibers provided
   desirable spatial cues, surface topography, and surface chemistry for
   the native cells to infiltrate into the scaffolds. The wound healing
   potential of the nanocomposites was comparable to the commercial
   Matriderm (R) artificial dermis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The phase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties of FeSO4 center dot
   7H(2)O in the FeSO4 center dot Ti(SO4) (2)center dot H2SO4 center dot
   H2O system are of critical significance because iron removal is one of
   the most important stages in the sulfate process for titania production.
   The solubility of the FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O in the FeSO4 center dot
   Ti(SO4) (2)center dot H2SO4 center dot H2O system was measured over the
   temperature range from 278 to 298 K using a dynamic method. The initial
   concentrations of Ti(SO4)(2) and H2SO4 were 0.2-1.0 mol.kg(-1) and
   2.0-3.5 mol.kg(-1), respectively. It was found that the solubility of
   FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O significantly increased with the temperature
   throughout the entire concentration ranges of H2SO4 and Ti(SO4)(2). A
   new chemical model was developed by obtaining the parameters of the
   mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE) model via regression of the solubility
   data of FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O in the Ti (SO4)(2)center dot H2SO4
   center dot H2O system. The model with the newly obtained parameters was
   successfully applied to predict the sulfate speciation in both FeSO4
   center dot H2SO4 center dot H2O and FeSO4 center dot Ti(SO4)(2)center
   dot H2SO4 center dot H2O systems and the crystallization behavior of
   FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O. The results will provide fundamental data and
   thermodynamic information for improving the existing sulfate process for
   the production of titanium dioxide pigment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of plastic as an alternative coarse
   aggregate on various fresh and harden properties of concrete.
   Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a thermoplastic polymer, is considered
   as an alternative aggregate and replaced with natural coarse aggregate,
   such as brick chips. The PET aggregate is obtained by shredding, melting
   and crushing the collected waste PET bottles. The primary focus of the
   work is to observe compressive strength and unit weight of PET aggregate
   concrete (PAC) along with their workability in comparison with the
   natural aggregate concrete (NAC). With the increase in PET replacement
   ratio and w/c ratio lower unit weights and compressive strengths are
   observed for PAC compare to NAC. Compressive strength for 20\% PET
   replaced PAC at 0.42 w/c ratio is 30.3 MPa which is only 9\% less than
   the NAC. However, PAC has significantly high workability as 1.8 cm slump
   value is observed for 20\% PET replaced PAC at 0.42 w/c ratio.
   Therefore, PET replaced concrete with low w/c ratio and high workability
   can be used for structural concrete member. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Si-Ge interdiffusion with phosphorus doping was investigated by both
   experiments and modeling. Ge/Si1-xGex/Ge multi-layer structures with
   0.75 < x(Ge) < 1, a mid-10(18) to low-10(19) cm(-3) P doping, and a
   dislocation density of 10(8) to 10(9) cm(-2) range were studied. The
   P-doped sample shows an accelerated Si-Ge interdiffusivity, which is 2-8
   times of that of the undoped sample. The doping dependence of the Si-Ge
   interdiffusion was modelled by a Fermi-enhancement factor. The results
   show that the Si-Ge interdiffusion coefficient is proportional to
   n(2)/n(i)(2) for the conditions studied, which indicates that the
   interdiffusion in a high Ge fraction range with n-type doping is
   dominated by V2- defects. The Fermi-enhancement factor was shown to have
   a relatively weak dependence on the temperature and the Ge fraction. The
   results are relevant to the structure and thermal processing condition
   design of n-type doped Ge/Si and Ge/SiGe based devices such as Ge/Si
   lasers. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out a combined study using surface tension, phase-sensitive
   frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy, and MD simulations
   to investigate the industrially relevant zwitterionic surfactant
   N-dodecyl-N, N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate (DDAPS) on water
   surface. The SFG Im(chi((2))) spectra showed that the interaction
   between DDAPS and water was different from those between biologically
   relevant zwitterionic phospholipids and water. While zwitterionic
   phospholipids were found to be anionic-like and flipped water molecules
   with their OHs pointing toward the air, DDAPS oriented water molecules
   with their OHs mostly pointing toward the liquid water. We built a new
   force field for the MD simulation which produced the correct surface
   tension of water with various DDPAS coverage. The MD simulation showed
   that the head groups of DDPAS were nearly parallel to the water surface.
   When the surface coverage of DDPAS was increased, the averaged tilting
   angle of DDPAS's tails decreased, but it had little effect on the
   orientation of the headgroup. The sulfobetaine zwitterionic surfactant
   was found to be more cationic-like because the positively charged group
   was more capable of orienting interfacial water.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the temporal and spatial correlations of sensor readings in
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs), this paper develops a clustered
   spatio-temporal compression scheme by integrating network coding (NC),
   compressed sensing (CS) and spatio-temporal compression for correlated
   data. The proper selection of NC coefficients and measurement matrix is
   investigated for this scheme. This design ensures successful
   reconstruction of original data with a considerably high probability and
   enables successful deployment of NC and CS in a real field. Moreover, in
   contrast to other spatio-temporal schemes with the same computational
   complexity, the proposed scheme possesses lower reconstruction error by
   employing independent encoding in each sensor node (including the
   cluster head nodes) and joint decoding in the sink node. In order to
   further reduce the reconstruction error, we construct a new optimization
   model of reconstruction error for the clustered spatio-temporal
   compression scheme. A distributed algorithm is developed to iteratively
   determine the optimal solution. Finally, simulation results verify that
   the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme outperforms other two
   categories of compression schemes significantly in terms of recovery
   error and compression gain and the distributed algorithm converges to
   the optimal solution with a fast and stable speed. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Insight into the evolution of the proton concentration during
   autohydrolysis and dilute-acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: During pretreatment, hemicellulose is removed from biomass
   via proton-catalyzed hydrolysis to produce soluble poly-and
   mono-saccharides. Many kinetic models have been proposed but the
   dependence of rate on proton concentration is not well-defined;
   autohydrolysis and dilute-acid hydrolysis models apply very different
   treatments despite having similar chemistries. In this work, evolution
   of proton concentration is examined during both autohydrolysis and
   dilute-acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose from green bamboo. An
   approximate mathematical model, or ``toy model{''}, to describe proton
   concentration based upon conservation of mass and charge during
   deacetylation and ash neutralization coupled with a number of competing
   equilibria, was derived. The model was qualitatively compared to
   experiments where pH was measured as a function of time, temperature,
   and initial acid level. Proton evolution was also examined at room
   temperature to decouple the effect of ash neutralization from
   deacetylation.
   Results: The toy model predicts the existence of a steady-state proton
   concentration dictated by equilibrium constants, initial acetyl groups,
   and initial added acid. At room temperature, it was found that pH
   remains essentially constant both at low initial pH and autohydrolysis
   conditions. Acid is likely in excess of the neutralization potential of
   the ash, in the former case, and the kinetics of neutralization become
   exceedingly small in the latter case due to the low proton
   concentration. Finally, when the hydrolysis reaction proceeded at
   elevated temperatures, one case of non-monotonic behavior in which the
   pH initially increased, and then decreased at longer times, was found.
   This is likely due to the difference in rates between neutralization and
   deacetylation.
   Conclusions: The model and experimental work demonstrate that the
   evolution of proton concentration during hydrolysis follows complex
   behavior that depends upon the acetyl group and ash content of biomass,
   initial acid levels and temperature. In the limit of excess added acid,
   pH varies very weakly with time. Below this limit, complex schemes are
   found primarily related to the selectivity of deacetylation in
   comparison to neutralization. These findings indicate that a more
   rigorous approach to models of hemicellulose hydrolysis is needed.
   Improved models will lead to more efficient acid utilization and
   facilitate process scale-up.}},

   waveguide metamaterials}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{A metamaterial composed of stacked plasmonic waveguides which support
   backward propagation along the layers has been shown to exhibit a nearly
   spherical equifrequency contour (EFC) in which the Floquet-Blochwave
   vector k(FB) and Poynting vector S point in opposite directions
   everywhere on this surface. Experiments performed on this structure have
   also shown that polarized light beams incident from free space refract
   to the same side of normal over a wide range of incidence angles.
   Together, these observations have led researchers to describe this
   structure as a homogeneous medium with three-dimensionally isotropic
   negative refractive index; however, a close inspection of the fields
   throughout the structure as provided in this paper would suggest
   otherwise. Here, we rigorously analyze the relationship between phase
   and power flow within the structure by introducing a method to calculate
   the power flow of all Floquet-Bloch harmonics, information which cannot
   be obtained from either conventional analysis of EFCs or effective
   medium theory. Access to power flow of all harmonics enables us to
   demonstrate the origin of backward power (defined with respect to the
   direction of kFB), and in doing so, verify the validity of the claimed
   three-dimensionally isotropic left-handed response and the validity of
   describing the medium by a simple negative effective index of refraction
   n = -1. Knowledge regarding the distribution of power flow across the
   harmonics can also be used to design highly efficient methods to couple
   light into and out of these structures. As an example, we show that
   tailored wave excitation can achieve coupling efficiencies of up to
   96\%, over 5 times greater than that achieved by normal-incidence
   plane-wave excitation.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{144-156}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Water utilities often rely on water main failure prediction models to
   develop an effective maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement (M/R/R)
   action plan. However, the understanding of water main failure becomes
   difficult due to various uncertainties. In this study, a Bayesian
   updating based water main failure prediction framework is developed to
   update the performance of the Bayesian Weibull proportional hazard
   (BWPHM) model. Applicability of the proposed framework is illustrated
   with modeling failure prediction of cast iron and ductile iron pipes of
   the water distribution network of the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
   The Bayesian updating models have effectively improved the water main
   failure prediction whenever new data or information becomes available.
   The proposed framework can assess the model performance in the light of
   uncertain and evolving information and will help the water utility
   authorities to attain an acceptable level of service considering
   financial constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Molecular Dynamics Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) provide a stable platform for
   modeling the dynamics and order of biological membranes where the
   tethers mimic the cytoskeletal supports present in biological cell
   membranes. In this paper coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) is
   applied to study the effects of tethers on lipid membrane properties.
   Using results from the CGMD model and the overdamped Fokker-Planck
   equation, we show that the diffusion tensor and particle density of
   water in the tBLM is spatially dependent. Further, it is shown that the
   membrane thickness, lipid diffusion, defect density, free energy of
   lipid flip-flop, and membrane dielectric permittivity are all dependent
   on the tether density. The numerically computed results from the CGMD
   model are in agreement with the experimentally measured results from
   tBLMs containing different tether densities and lipids derived from
   Archaebacteria. Additionally, using experimental measurements from
   Escherichia coli bacteria and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae yeast tethered
   membranes, we illustrate how previous molecular dynamics results can be
   combined with the proposed model to estimate the dielectric permittivity
   and defect density of these membranes as a function of tether density.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{380}},
Pages = {{242-266}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{We study the interaction among dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder
   effects in the context of wave transmission through a discrete periodic
   structure, subjected to continuous harmonic excitation in its stop band.
   We consider a damped nonlinear periodic structure of finite length with
   disorder. Disorder is introduced throughout the structure by small
   changes in the stiffness parameters drawn from a uniform statistical
   distribution. Dispersion effects forbid wave transmission within the
   stop band of the linear periodic structure. However, nonlinearity leads
   to supratransmission phenomenon, by which enhanced wave transmission
   occurs within the stop band of the periodic structure when forced at an
   amplitude exceeding a certain threshold. The frequency components of the
   transmitted waves lie within the pass band of the linear structure,
   where disorder is known to cause Anderson localization. There is
   therefore a competition between dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder
   in the context of supratransmission. We show that supratransmission
   persists in the presence of disorder. The influence of disorder
   decreases in general as the forcing frequency moves away from the pass
   band edge, reminiscent of dispersion effects subsuming disorder effects
   in linear periodic structures. We compute the dependence of the
   supratransmission force threshold on nonlinearity and strength of
   coupling between units. We observe that nonlinear forces are confined to
   the driven unit for weakly coupled systems. This observation, together
   with the truncation of higher order nonlinear terms, permits us to
   develop closed-form expressions for the supra transmission force
   threshold. In sum, in the frequency range studied here, disorder does
   not influence the supratransmission force threshold in the
   ensemble-average sense, but it does reduce the average transmitted wave
   energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of precipitation-hardened stainless steels
   rely on a complex multi-scale microstructure developed during a sequence
   of quenching after austenitization, followed by a precipitation heat
   treatment. Important features of the resulting microstructure include
   the microstructure of martensite, retained and reverted austenite,
   nanoscale precipitation and the homogeneity of the Cr concentration. In
   this paper, the microstructure of a Cu-bearing 15-5PH steel is
   thoroughly characterized along the precipitation heat treatment, using a
   combination of transmission electron microscopy with phase and
   orientation mapping, atom probe tomography, in-situ small-angle X-ray
   scattering and X-ray diffraction. The fraction of austenite is observed
   to increase during the ageing treatment, together with the precipitation
   of the Cu precipitates, which present a core-shell structure with a
   shell enriched in Ni, Mn and Si. After heat treatment, the Cr
   concentration is found to be slightly inhomogeneous in the matrix, with
   some segregations at the dislocations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We consider secure resource allocations for orthogonal frequency

   (WSNs). The joint problem of subcarrier (SC) assignment, SC pairing and
   power allocations, is formulated under scenarios of using and not using
   cooperative jamming (CJ) to maximize the secrecy sum rate subject to
   limited power budget at the relay station (RS) and orthogonal SC
   allocation policies. The optimization problems are shown to be mixed
   integer programming and nonconvex. For the scenario without CJ, we
   propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm based on the dual
   decomposition method and a suboptimal algorithm with lower complexity.
   For the scenario with CJ, the resulting optimization problem is
   nonconvex, and we propose a heuristic algorithm based on alternating
   optimization. Finally, the proposed schemes are evaluated by simulations
   and compared with the existing schemes.}},

Title = {{International Benchmark on Numerical Simulations for 1D, Nonlinear Site
   Response (PRENOLIN): Verification Phase Based on Canonical Cases}},

Abstract = {{PREdiction of NOn-LINear soil behavior (PRENOLIN) is an international
   benchmark aiming to test multiple numerical simulation codes that are
   capable of predicting nonlinear seismic site response with various
   constitutive models. One of the objectives of this project is the
   assessment of the uncertainties associated with nonlinear simulation of
   1D site effects. A first verification phase (i.e., comparison between
   numerical codes on simple idealistic cases) will be followed by a
   validation phase, comparing the predictions of such numerical
   estimations with actual strong-motion recordings obtained at well-known
   sites. The benchmark presently involves 21 teams and 23 different
   computational codes.
   We present here the main results of the verification phase dealing with
   simple cases. Three different idealized soil profiles were tested over a
   wide range of shear strains with different input motions and different
   boundary conditions at the sediment/bedrock interface. A first iteration
   focusing on the elastic and viscoelastic cases was proved to be useful
   to ensure a common understanding and to identify numerical issues before
   pursuing the nonlinear modeling. Besides minor mistakes in the
   implementation of input parameters and output units, the initial
   discrepancies between the numerical results can be attributed to (1)
   different understanding of the expression ``input motion{''} in
   different communities, and (2) different implementations of material
   damping and possible numerical energy dissipation. The second round of
   computations thus allowed a convergence of all teams to the
   Haskell-Thomson analytical solution in elastic and viscoelastic cases.
   For nonlinear computations, we investigate the epistemic uncertainties
   related only to wave propagation modeling using different nonlinear
   constitutive models. Such epistemic uncertainties are shown to increase
   with the strain level and to reach values around 0.2 (log 10 scale) for
   a peak ground acceleration of 5 m/s(2) at the base of the soil column,
   which may be reduced by almost 50\% when the various constitutive models
   used the same shear strength and damping implementation.}},

   uniform grain size (107.3 +/- 20.2 nm) was deposited on the surface of
   fabricated lignin carbon nanofibers (LCNFs) through their thickness.
   Various characterization techniques including X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Pd deposition rate, and water contact
   angle measurements suggested the potential of Pd-coated LCNFs in the
   removal of pollutants based on its strong oxidation capability. The
   application of this material is expected to broaden because of its light
   weight, hydrophilicity, flexibility, and superior performance over
   traditional metal catalyst substrates.}},

Abstract = {{A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) paste was extruded using a capillary
   rheometer at various temperatures through dies of different reduction
   ratios. Uniaxial tensile experiments have been performed on the
   collected extrudates using the Sentmanat Extensional Rheometer (SER) at
   different temperatures and Hencky strain rates. A nonlinear viscoelastic
   model is used to model the transient tensile results. A model is also
   developed to predict the tensile ultimate strength as a function of
   processing conditions such as temperature and die reduction ratio, as
   well as the testing operating conditions i.e. temperature and Hencky
   strain rate. The results show that the ultimate strength increases with
   extrusion temperature and die reduction ratio and decreases with testing
   temperature. Moreover, the relative density of the extrudates upon
   stretching is studied and it is found that it decreases by increasing
   the level of stretching. A simple mathematical model which accounts for
   the Poisson's ratio and elastic strain recovery is also developed to
   model the data. It is shown that the experimental findings are in
   agreement with the fibril structure/morphology obtained from SEM
   micrographs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to particle size, biomass density influences heat and mass
   transfer rates during the thermal treatment processes. In this research,
   thermal behaviour of ground pine chip particles and ground pine pellet
   particles in the range of 0.25-5mm was investigated. A single particle
   from ground pellets was almost 3 to 4 times denser than a single
   particle from ground chips at a similar size and volume of particle.
   Temperature was ramped up from room temperature (approximate to 25
   degrees C) to 600 degrees C with heating rates of 10, 20, 30, and 50
   degrees C/min. Pellet particles took 25-88\% longer time to dry than the
   chip particles. Microscopic examination of 3mm and larger chip particles
   showed cracks during drying. No cracks were observed for pellet
   particles. The mass loss due to treatment at temperatures higher than
   200 degrees C was about 80\% both for chip and pellet particles. It took
   4min for chip and pellet particles to lose roughly 63\% of their dry
   mass at a heating rate of 50 degrees C/min. The SEM structural analysis
   showed enlarged pores and cracks in cell walls of the pyrolyzed wood
   chips. These pores were not observed in pyrolyzed pellet particles.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of metallic nickel particles in sulphuric acid solutions
   has been studied in this work. The effect of temperature, sulphuric acid
   concentration, and oxidant type has been assessed. In the presence of
   hydrogen peroxide or dissolved oxygen the dissolution of nickel was
   fast. A shrinking particle model was used to fit the experimental data
   and estimate kinetic parameters. The apparent reaction rate constants
   calculated at 55 degrees C when dissolved oxygen, ferric sulphate, and
   hydrogen peroxide were used as oxidants were, respectively, 0.17, 0.02,
   and 7.13ms(-1). The dissolution of Ni in the presence of ferric sulphate
   occurred under surface chemical control, with an activation energy of
   82.3kJ/mol, while in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and dissolved
   oxygen the reaction seemed to have been mass transfer controlled. The
   dissolution of Ni in ferric sulphate solutions was also pH sensitive,
   possibly due to the formation of NiFe2O4 or NiO that was prevented when
   sulphuric acid concentration was 1mol/L. The dissolution rate in ferric
   sulphate-free solutions was affected negatively by temperature due to a
   decrease in O-2 solubility.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a data rate fairness optimal cooperative
   beamforming technique for a cognitive radio system with multiple
   secondary receivers (SRs) and multiple primary receivers (PRs) in the
   presence of asynchronous interferences. In particular, the data rate
   fairness beamforming design is formulated as an optimization problem to
   maximize the minimum data rate of the SRs subject to transmission power
   constraints at the secondary cooperative transmitters (SCTs) and
   asynchronous interference power constraints at the PRs. The optimal
   beamforming design is a quadratically constrained quadratic program
   max-min optimization problem, which is non-convex and non-linear.
   Therefore, we reformulate the optimal beamforming design as a
   quasi-convex problem using the semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation,
   which can be solved using the SDP solvers and bisection method. The
   complexity of the optimal beamforming scheme stands against its
   practical implementation. So, we study important properties of the
   optimization problem. By exploiting these properties, we also propose
   low complexity suboptimal beamforming techniques. Furthermore, we extend
   the beamforming techniques to incorporate the uncertainties in channel
   and propagation delay estimation between SCTs and PRs.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the high density of vehicles and various types of vehicular
   services, it is challenging to guarantee the quality of vehicular
   services in currentLong-Term Evolution (LTE) networks in a
   cost-efficient manner. Fortunately, with the development of
   fifth-generation (5G) technology, the installation of a large number of
   small cells is foreseen as one of the practical ways to achieve the
   low-delay requirement in vehicular environments. However, it may cause a
   huge operating expense and capital expenditure to mobile network
   operators due to the limited backhaul capacity and the explosion of
   signaling. In this paper, we integrate software-defined networking and
   radio resource virtualization into an LTE system for vehicular networks,
   i.e., software-defined heterogeneous vehicular network (SERVICE). Based
   on this proposed system framework, a delay-optimal virtualized radio
   resource scheduling scheme is proposed via stochastic learning. The
   delay optimal problemis formulated as an infinite-horizon average-cost
   partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). Then, an equivalent
   Bellman equation is derived to solve it. The proposed scheme can be
   divided into two stages, i.e., macro virtualization resource allocation
   (MaVRA) and micro virtualization resource allocation (MiVRA). The former
   is executed based on large timescale variables (traffic density),
   whereas the latter is operated according to short timescale variables
   (channel state and queue state). Simulation results show that the
   proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) provide an effective solution to address
   the increasing demand for spectrum resources. The cooperation among
   secondary users (SUs) improves the sensing performance and spectrum
   efficiency. In this paper, we study the traffic-demand-based cooperation
   strategy of SUs in multichannel CRNs, in which each SU makes its own
   cooperative sensing decision according to its traffic demand. When an SU
   has high traffic demand, it can choose to sense multiple channels in the
   sensing period and obtain more chances to use spectrum resources. If an
   SU has no data to transmit, it can choose not to perform spectrum
   sensing. We formulate this problem as a nontransferable utility (NTU)
   overlapping coalitional game. In this game, each SU implements a
   cooperation strategy according to its expected payoff, which takes into
   account the expected throughput and energy efficiency. We propose two
   different algorithms, namely, an overlapping coalition formation (OCF)
   algorithm and a sequential coalition formation (SCF) algorithm, to
   obtain a coalition structure. The OCF algorithm guarantees that the
   coalition structure is stable, whereas the SCF algorithm has lower
   computational complexity and less information exchange among SUs.
   Moreover, when being assigned a certain channel, SU implements an
   adaptive transmission power control scheme to further improve its energy
   efficiency. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms achieve
   a higher aggregate throughput than the disjoint coalition formation
   algorithm from the literature, where each SU can join only one
   coalition.}},

Abstract = {{One significant challenge of wireless virtualization is how to allocate
   the virtual resources efficiently with various constraints and
   requirements. Most existing works have not considered relaying in
   wireless virtualization. However, relaying is regarded as one of the key
   components of future wireless networks. Furthermore, recent advances in
   self-interference cancelation techniques enable full-duplex relaying
   (FDR) systems, which transmit and receive simultaneously in the same
   frequency band with high spectrum efficiency. Different from existing
   works, we first introduce the idea of wireless virtualization into FDR
   networks and propose a virtual resource management architecture for
   virtualized FDR networks. Then, we formulate the virtual resource
   allocation as an optimization problem while taking the residual
   self-interference due to FDR and the requirements of wireless
   virtualization into account. Since the formulated problem is a mixed
   combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem, it involves high
   computational complexity to solve it. To solve it efficiently, we
   transform the original problem to a convex optimization problem, and an
   efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based
   distributed virtual resource allocation algorithm is developed to solve
   the convex problem. Extensive simulations are presented to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It is demonstrated that the
   proposed virtualized FDR network is able to exploit the advantages of
   FDR and wireless virtualization.}},

Abstract = {{In Long-Term Evolution (LTE) random access (RA) systems, upon an access
   failure, the user equipment not only performs a backoff to randomly
   spread the retransmission attempt over a certain time period but also
   increases the transmission power for the retransmission, which is called
   a power ramping (PR) scheme. This paper analyzes the RA performance of
   LTE-based two-tier small-cell networks, in which the PR scheme may be a
   source of uplink cross-tier interference to the macrocell and small
   cells. To reduce cross-tier interference, we propose a scheme for
   partial sharing (PS) of orthogonal random access preambles (RAPs), in
   which small cells are allowed to use a subset of RAPs, whereas the
   macrocell uses the whole set of RAPs. We compare the PS scheme with a
   full-sharing scheme, in which the entire set of RAPs is shared by the
   macrocell and small cells. Our study characterizes the RA performances
   of LTE-based two-tier small-cell networks in terms of throughput, access
   delay, mean power consumption, and RAP-dropping probability and shows
   the benefits of the PS scheme and its trade-off between throughput and
   access delay of small cells.}},

Abstract = {{The extrudate swell of an industrial grade high molecular weight
   high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in capillary dies is studied using the
   integral K-BKZ constitutive model. The non-linear viscoelastic flow
   properties of the polymer resin are studied for a broad range of large
   step shear strains and high shear rates using the cone partitioned plate
   (CPP) geometry of the stress/strain controlled rotational rheometer.
   This allowed the determination of the rheological parameters accurately,
   in particular the damping function, which is proven to be the most
   important in simulating transient flows such as extrudate swell. A
   series of simulations performed using the integral K-BKZ Wagner model
   with different values of the Wagner exponent n, ranging from n=0.15-0.5,
   demonstrates that the extrudate swell predictions are extremely
   sensitive to the Wagner damping function exponent. Using the correct
   n-value resulted in extrudate swell predictions that are in excellent
   agreement with experimental measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Developing evasive action-based indicators for identifying pedestrian
   conflicts in less organized traffic environments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1193-1208}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There has been a growing interest in using surrogate safety measures
   such as traffic conflicts to analyse road safety from a broader
   perspective than collision data alone. This growing interest has been
   aided by recent advances in automated video-based traffic conflict
   analysis. The automation enables accurate calculation of various
   conflict indicators such as time-to-collision and post-encroachment
   time. These indicators rely on road users getting within specific
   temporal and spatial proximity from each other and therefore assume that
   proximity is a surrogate for conflict severity. However, this assumption
   may not be valid in many driving environments where close interactions
   between road users are common. The objective of this paper is to
   investigate the applicability of time proximity conflict indicators for
   evaluating pedestrian safety in less-organized traffic environments with
   a high mix of road users. Several alternative behavioural conflict
   indicators based on detecting pedestrian evasive actions are recommended
   to better measure traffic conflicts in such traffic environments. These
   indicators represent variations in the spatio-temporal gait parameters
   (step length, step frequency and walk ratio) immediately before the
   conflict point. A highly congested shared intersection in Shanghai,
   China, with frequent pedestrian conflicts is used as a case study.
   Traffic conflicts are analysed with the use of automated video-based
   analysis techniques. The results showed that evasive action-based
   indicators have higher potential to identify pedestrian conflicts and
   measure their severity in high mix less organized traffic environments
   than time proximity measures such as time-to-collision and
   post-encroachment time. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the microbial communities native to
   surface-deposited pyritic oil sands tailings, an environment where acid
   rock drainage (ARD) could occur. The goal of this study was to enrich
   sulfur-oxidizing organisms from these tailings and determine whether
   different populations exist at pH levels 7, 4.5, and 2.5. Using
   growth-based methods provides model organisms for use in the future to
   predict potential activities and limitations of these organisms and to
   develop possible control methods. Thiosulfate-fed enrichment cultures
   were monitored for approximately 1 year. The results showed that the
   enrichments at pH 4.5 and 7 were established quicker than at pH 2.5.
   Different microbial community structures were found among the 3 pH
   environments. The sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms identified were most
   closely related to Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, Achromobacter spp.,
   and Curtobacterium spp. While microorganisms related to Chitinophagaceae
   and Acidocella spp. were identified as the only possible iron-oxidizing
   and -reducing microbes. These results contribute to the general
   knowledge of the relatively understudied microbial communities that
   exist in pyritic oil sands tailings and indicate these communities may
   have a potential role in ARD generation, which may have implications for
   future tailings management.}},

Abstract = {{A floating energy harvester using the piezoelectric effect is developed
   to harvest the energy from intermediate and deep water waves. The
   harvester is made of a mass-spring system used for transferring wave
   motions to mechanical vibrations and two piezoelectricity-lever devices
   used for amplifying and transferring the collected mechanical vibration
   to electrical power. A mathematic model is established based on the
   Lagrangian-Euler method and solved by the iteration method to calculate
   the root mean square value of the generated electric power. The
   harvested power is found to increase with an increase in the ocean wave
   amplitude, mass of the mass-spring system, sizes and Young's modulus of
   the lever, and a decrease in the ocean wave period. The results show
   that a power up to 103 W can be harvested for a practical floating
   energy harvester with a width, height, length, mass of the mass-spring
   system of 1 m, 0.5 m, 1 m, 100 kg, and an amplitude and period of a sea

Abstract = {{Studying interactions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) signals between discrete brain loci is increasingly
   recognized as important for understanding normal brain function and may
   provide insights into many neurodegenerative disorders such as
   Parkinson's disease (PD). Though much work has been done investigating
   ways to infer brain connectivity networks, the temporal dynamics of
   brain coupling has been less well studied. Assuming that brain
   connections are purely static or purely dynamic is assuredly
   unrealistic, as the brain must strike a balance between stability and
   flexibility. In this paper, we propose making joint inference of
   time-invariant connections as well as time-varying coupling patterns by
   employing a multitask learning model followed by a least-squares
   approach to accurately estimate the connectivity coefficients. We
   applied this method to resting state fMRI data from PD and control
   subjects and estimated the eigenconnectivity networks to obtain the
   representative patterns of both static and dynamic brain connectivity
   features. We found lower network variations in the PD group, which were
   partially normalized with L-dopa medication, consistent with previous
   studies suggesting that cognitive inflexibility is characteristic of PD.}},

Abstract = {{3-D High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is a new emerging video
   compression standard for multiview video applications. This standard
   utilizes advanced interview prediction characteristics in addition to
   the prediction features of the HEVC standard for efficient encoding of
   multiview video content. While using combined features improves the
   compression performance by utilizing the correlation between the views
   captured from slightly different angles of the same scene, they also
   increase coding complexity. The focus of this paper is on developing an
   efficient complexity reduction scheme for 3D-HEVC, with the intention to
   facilitate the adoption of this upcoming standard, especially for
   real-time applications. In this regard, first, we introduce two ways to
   decrease the complexity of the inter-/intra-mode search process of the
   to-be-encoded blocks in the dependent texture views (DV(t)s) of 3D-HEVC.
   Then, we propose a hybrid complexity reduction scheme that utilizes the
   two-mode prediction approaches, motion information of the base texture
   view (BVt), and the rate distortion cost of the already encoded blocks
   in the BVt and DVt. The performance of our proposed scheme is tested for
   the case with two views (i.e., base view + dependent view). The
   evaluations confirm that our proposed hybrid complexity reduction scheme
   reduces the 3D-HEVC codec complexity by 67.70\% on average for the DVt
   compared with the unmodified 3D-HEVC encoder, while maintaining the
   overall video quality. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, it
   reduces complexity by 25.74\% on average.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{254-268}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Experiments are performed for a rigid, high-aspect-ratio, rectangular
   channel with a portion of one wall replaced by a flexible membrane (a
   ``2D{''} Starling resistor). The fluid is air, which is driven by a
   pressure drop up to 300 Pa, producing Reynolds numbers up to 22,000. The
   experiments include pressure measurements, at 6 locations along the
   channel, 1 velocity measurement, and high speed video of the membrane
   which is analyzed to extract the membrane motion.
   The primary variables considered are membrane tension, inlet pressure,
   and area of the side-wall gap. Steady and unsteady behaviors are
   observed for the 3 membrane tensions considered. The unsteady behaviors
   are categorized as ``traveling{''}, ``mode 2{''}, or ``complex{''}
   oscillations, which may be recognized by the spectral characteristics of
   their pressure signal. Hysteresis is clearly observed depending on how
   the inlet pressure is adjusted. The side-wall gap, which permits air
   leakage around the membrane, is an important factor, and is
   characterized as a function of membrane tension and inlet pressure. (C)

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{249}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The low voltage operation and relatively high strain response of
   conducting polymer actuators has made their use in tubular actuators
   such as actively steerable catheter tips of interest. Previous work has
   shown that bending can be achieved by simply coating a commercial
   catheter with conducting polymer and patterning. However, these
   actuators require an external electrolyte to operate. This work presents
   instead a self-contained tubular actuator in which all ion conduction
   between active polymer layers occurs internally.
   The conducting polymer PEDOT provides the active deformation to control
   its maneuverability and actuation. To form the body of the actuator and
   an electrolyte medium to enable transfer of ions during the actuation of
   conducting polymer, a highly ionically conductive interpenetrating
   polymer network composed of ionically conductive polyethylene oxide and
   stretchable nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) is used. This compliant
   medium also enables a tight radius of curvature. Laser micromachining is
   used to pattern PEDOT on the surface. A 0.95 mm diameter device is shown
   to achieve a 22 mm radius of curvatures under activation of 2 V. A
   closed form beam bending model for tubular trilayer actuators is derived
   which predicts the radius of curvature as a function of applied voltage
   and free strain. This model enables easy prediction of deflection, as is
   demonstrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of various oxygen passivation treatments on a 15 wt\%
   MoP/SiO2 and a 15 wt\% Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst is reported. Approximately 85
   \% of the MoP was re-oxidized when the MoP/SiO2 catalyst was passivated
   or simply exposed to air, whereas only about 40 \% of the Ni2P was
   re-oxidized when the Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst was treated similarly. A second
   reduction of the catalysts after the passivation, followed by CO uptake
   measurements, showed an increase in CO uptake in the case of the
   MoP/SiO2 and a significant loss in CO uptake on the Ni2P/SiO2 when
   compared to the CO uptake measurements of the corresponding
   non-passivated samples. The oxidized species that resulted from the
   passivation of the Ni2P/SiO2 were much more easily reduced than those on
   the MoP/SiO2. The loss in CO uptake observed in the case of the
   Ni2P/SiO2 is attributed to sintering and/or restructuring of the Ni2P
   during the second reduction step.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The feasibility of using ion exchange resins in stirred (suspended) mode
   operation for the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from surface
   water was investigated. Resins were compared in terms of their NOM
   removal capacity, kinetics, and regeneration efficiency under batch and
   consecutive batch loading conditions. The dominant mechanism for NOM
   removal with the strong basic A860 resin was ion exchange whereas a
   combination of ion exchange and surface adsorption governed the removal
   with the weak basic A847. The estimated limiting capacity (qm) and the
   equilibrium constant () for A860 were higher than the ones for A847,
   showing greater affinity of A860 for natural organic matter. Also, under
   consecutive batch loadings, the strong basic resin showed greater
   removal (approximate to 10\% higher) compared to A847. Different
   regeneration scenarios were also examined and A860 resin showed a
   superior regeneration efficiency (approximate to 20\%) compared to A847.
   Overall, findings indicated the strong basic resin as a better candidate
   for the removal of NOM from surface water. This paper proposes an
   evaluation scheme for the selection of appropriate ion exchange resins

   resolution (CPL4\_1d and CLP5\_1d). The results show that all models
   have better intraseasonal characteristics in U850 than in OLR. The
   uncoupled model CAM4 has lower fidelity than the coupled models in
   characterizing MJO basic features including the temporal and spatial
   intraseasonal variability and the eastward propagation. With ocean
   feedback, the coherence of convection and circulation is improved in the
   coupled models. The higher resolution is helpful in improving ISV
   spatial distribution and eliminating low frequency bias in the
   frequency-wavenumber spectra although it has little improvement to
   MJO-band variance (power) in frequency-wavenumber spectra. The new
   shallow convection scheme in CAM5 improves the moisture process of the
   lower troposphere so that CPL5\_2d and CPL5\_1d have more realistic
   eastward propagation speed in the boreal winter and better northward
   propagation in the boreal summer than other models. However, the
   strength of the convective MJO signal in CPL5\_2d and CPL5\_1d are
   weaker than other models and observations, which is probably one of the
   most spurious features in CPL5\_2d and CPL5\_1d experiments, suggesting
   that the CAM5 has a weaker convection activity than its predecessor.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile/spatial crowdsourcing is a class of crowdsourcing applications in
   which workers travel to specific locations in order to perform tasks. As
   workers may possess different levels of competence, a major research
   challenge for spatial crowdsourcing is to control the quality of the
   results obtained. Although existing mobile crowdsourcing systems are
   able to track a wide range of performance related data for the
   participating workers, there stilt lacks an automated mechanism to help
   requesters make key task allocation decisions including: 1) to whom
   should a task to allocated; 2) how much to pay for the result provided
   by each worker; and 3) when to stop looking for additional workers for a
   task. In this paper, we propose a budget-aware task allocation approach
   for spatial crowdsourcing (Budget-TASC) to help requesters make these
   three decisions jointly. It considers the workers' reputation and
   proximity to the task locations to maximize the expected quality of the
   results while staying within a limited budget. Furthermore, it supports
   payments to workers based on how their track records. Extensive
   experimental evaluations based on a large-scale real-world dataset
   demonstrate that Budget-TASC outperforms the state-of-the-art
   significantly in terms of reduction in the average error rate and
   savings on the budget. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{813-822}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that wavelet transform can effectively be used
   for noise reduction in the context of partial discharge (PD) signal
   detection and classification. Several thresholding approaches for
   wavelet denoising have been reported in the literature. In this study, a
   novel wavelet threshold estimation method, named energy
   conservation-based thresholding (ECBT), is introduced. The proposed
   thresholding function is capable of conserving a significant portion of
   the original signal energy, while the threshold value is determined
   based on the relative difference between the original and noisy signal
   energies. The proposed method is first applied to PD signals
   contaminated with different levels of simulated noise. Results show that
   ECBT produces a denoised PD signal with higher signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) and less distortion than PDs produced by the existing wavelet
   methods. Then, ECBT is modified to address actual PD signals corrupted
   with real noise, where a robust SNR estimation method is derived to
   estimate the noise level embedded in the measured PD signals. The
   denoised PD signals indicate that the proposed method yields higher
   reduction in noise levels than other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To compare the cyclic fatigue resistance of HyFlex CM, Twisted Files
   (TF), K3XF, Race, and K3, and evaluate the effect of autoclave
   sterilization on the cyclic fatigue resistance of these instruments both
   before and after the files were cycled.
   Methodology Five types of NiTi instruments with similar size 30, .06
   taper were selected: HyFlex CM, TF, K3XF, Race and K3. Files were tested
   in a simulated canal with a curvature of 60 degrees and a radius of 3mm.
   The number of cycles to failure of each instrument was determined to
   evaluate cyclic fatigue resistance. Each type of instruments was
   randomly divided into four experimental groups: group 1 (n=20),
   unsterilized instruments; group 2 (n=20), pre-sterilized instruments
   subjected to 10 cycles of autoclave sterilization; group 3 (n=20),
   instruments tested were sterilized at 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of the mean
   cycles to failure as determined in group 1, and then cycled to failure;
   group 4 (n=20), instruments cycled in the same manner as group 3 but
   without sterilization. The fracture surfaces of instruments were
   examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   Results HyFlex CM, TF and K3XF had significantly higher cyclic fatigue
   resistance than Race and K3 in the unsterilized group 1 (P<0.05).
   Autoclave sterilization significantly increased the MCF of HyFlex CM and
   K3XF (P<0.05) both before and after the files were cycled. SEM
   examination revealed a typical pattern of cyclic fatigue fracture in all
   instruments.
   Conclusions HyFlex CM, TF and K3XF instruments composed of new
   thermal-treated alloy were more resistant to fatigue failure than Race
   and K3. Autoclaving extended the cyclic fatigue life of HyFlex CM and
   K3XF.}},

   analytical Pinching4 hysteretic model. Furthermore, the Pinching4
   hysteretic models were calibrated with the reverse-cyclic loading test
   results. Utility of the Pinching4 hysteretic models was shown with

Abstract = {{A comprehensive investigation into the mechanical properties of
   ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC), considering
   various influential factors, is imperative in order to obtain
   fundamental information for its practical utilization. Therefore, this
   paper reviewed the early-age strength (or setting) development and
   mechanical properties of hardened UHPFRC. In connection with the latter,
   the effects of the curing conditions, coarse aggregate, mineral
   admixtures, fiber properties, specimen size, and strain-rate on the
   mechanical performance of UHPFRC were specifically investigated. It was
   obvious that (1) heat treatment accelerates the hydration process,
   leading to higher strength; (2) a portion of the silica fume can be
   replaced by fly ash, slag, and rice husk ash in mechanical perspective;
   (3) the use of deformed (hooked and twisted) or long straight steel
   fibers improves the mechanical properties at a static rate; and (4) high
   rate loading provides a noticeable increase in the mechanical
   properties. Alternatively, there are some disagreements between the
   results from various `size effect' tests and the effectiveness of using
   twisted steel fibers at static and high rate loadings. Further research
   to reduce the production cost of UHPFRC is also addressed in an attempt
   to make its widespread use more practical. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A modified version of the Least-Square QR-factorisation (LSQR) algorithm
   has been implemented in conjunction with Conditional Source-term
   Estimation (CSE) for lean, turbulent premixed methane-air combustion via
   Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The iterative solver can reduce
   computational times by an order of magnitude during the inversion phase
   of CSE in comparison with the conventional LU-decomposition method. The
   advantages of iterative and parallel iterative solvers become more
   prominent as the size of the system increases. The ensemble selection
   procedure for computing averages within localised regions of the
   simulation domain has also been updated to a dynamic routine. This
   allows for more flexible and efficient allocation of computational
   resources along with reduced input from the user, especially for complex
   geometries. Preliminary LES calculations have shown that the
   implementation of an iterative solver and a dynamic ensemble selection
   algorithm will reduce computational times significantly with negligible
   error contribution for one-condition CSE, which is applicable to purely
   premixed or non-premixed turbulent combustion problems. In addition,
   these algorithms provide the foundation for exceptional computational
   cost savings for the inversion in two-condition CSE, or Doubly
   Conditional Source-term Estimation (DCSE), which has shown promise for
   predicting partially-premixed combustion. Parallel computation of the
   inverse solution is particularly beneficial to DCSE as the computational
   cost of the inversion process is considerably larger than in
   one-condition CSE.}},

Abstract = {{Solid waste backfilling techniques are widely employed in the coal
   mining industry and the pressure propagation characteristics of solid
   waste backfilling materials are important considerations in evaluating a
   techniques overall effectiveness. This paper presents an experiment that
   evaluates the pressure propagation characteristics of backfilling
   materials of different particle sizes. The results show that backfilling
   materials with larger particle sizes have higher pressure propagation
   properties, while backfilling materials with smaller particle sizes are
   less capable of transferring pressure. Analysis indicates that there is
   an exponential relationship between influence factor (I) and vertical
   distance (Z/D), where Z/D is the depth below the center of the loading
   platen divided by the loading platen diameter. There is also a GaussAmp
   relationship between I and horizontal displacement (L/R), where L/R is
   the abscissa divided by the loading platen radius. The results indicate
   that more than 70 \% of loading pressure is dissipated in the Z/D range
   of 0-2.75 and virtually all pressure is dissipated within the L/R range
   of 0-5. The results were applied in the Wugou coal mine to evaluate the
   effectiveness of backfilling compaction methods and the evaluate results
   show the backfilling compaction mechanism can work effectively.}},

Abstract = {{We study non-inertial flows of single-phase yield stress fluids along
   uneven/rough-walled channels, e.g. approximating a fracture, with two
   main objectives. First, we re-examine the usual approaches to providing
   a (nonlinear) Darcy-type flow law and show that significant errors arise
   due to self-selection of the flowing region/fouling of the walls. This
   is a new type of non-Darcy effect not previously explored in depth.
   Second, we study the details of flow as the limiting pressure gradient
   is approached, deriving approximate expressions for the limiting
   pressure gradient valid over a range of different geometries. Our
   approach is computational, solving the two-dimensional Stokes problem
   along the fracture, then upscaling. The computations also reveal
   interesting features of the flow for more complex fracture geometries,
   providing hints about how to extend Darcy-type approaches effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum speed limits are usually set to inform drivers of the highest
   speed that it is safe and appropriate for ideal traffic, road and
   weather conditions. Many previous studies were conducted to investigate
   the relationship between changed speed limits and safety. The results of
   these studies generally show that relaxing speed limits can negatively
   affect safety, especially with regard to fatal and injury crashes.
   Despite these results, several road jurisdictions in North America
   continue to raise the maximum speed limits. In 2013, the British
   Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure initiated a speed
   limits review. The review found that the 85th percentile speed on many
   highway segments was 10 km/h higher than corresponding posted speed
   limits and 1300 km of rural provincial highway segments were recommended
   for higher speed limits. Most of the highway segments had 10 km/h speed
   limit increase with a small section having 20 km/h speed limit increase.
   As speed limit changes can have a substantial impact on safety, the main
   objective of this study is to estimate the effect of the increased speed
   limits on crash occurrence. A before-after evaluation was undertaken
   with the full Bayesian technique. Overall, the evaluation showed that
   changed speed limits led to a statistically significant increase in
   fatal-plus-injury (severe) crashes of 11.1\%. A crash modification
   function that includes changes in the treatment effect over time showed
   that the initial increase of the first post-implementation period may
   slightly decrease over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper the effects of anionic surfactant sodium octyl
   sulphate (SOS) on the electrodeposition of manganese from sulphate
   solutions were studied. It was observed that addition of SOS increases
   the current efficiency and hence decreases the energy consumption during
   electrodeposition of manganese. High quality manganese deposits with
   smooth and compact surfaces were deposited on 316 grade stainless steel
   substrate in the presence of SOS. The concentration of this anionic
   surfactant was varied over a relatively broad range to assess its effect
   on current efficiency, energy consumption, crystallographic orientations
   and deposit morphology of the electrodeposited manganese metal. The
   addition of SOS increased the cathodic efficiency of manganese metal
   from 59\% to 67\% when 20 mg.L-1 SOS was introduced into the
   electrolytic bath. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that (330,411)
   planes are the most preferred planes of crystal growth during manganese
   electrodeposition at a current density of 500 A . na(-2) resembling
   alpha-manganese irrespective of the concentration of additive. Scanning
   electron micrographs showed smooth, bright and uniform deposit
   morphologies when manganese was electrodeposited in the presence of 20
   mg . L-1 SOS. Linear sweep voltammetry showed polarisation of the
   cathode indicating additive adsorption on it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The dissolution of chalcopyrite has been studied from an integrated
   point of view where the thermodynamics, dissolution kinetics and
   electrochemical behavior have been considered together.
   The variations in mixed potential and dissolution current density were
   interpreted considering the aqueous speciation of the electrolyte and
   the semiconductor properties of the chalcopyrite. This leads to the
   conclusion that CuFeS2 dissolution rates are not a simple function of
   the nominal ferric concentration or of the nominal ratio of ferric to
   ferrous.
   The differences observed in the anodic charge transfer coefficient for
   the dissolution of chalcopyrite and the limiting current densities
   observed in potentiodynamic experiments at different temperatures have
   been explained in terms of the semiconductor properties of chalcopyrite
   (and/or its reaction product surface film). The differences between
   studying the electrochemistry of chalcopyrite by imposing an electrode
   potential using a potentiostat and by using a solution of known redox
   potential, as well as the differences in the interpretation of
   experimental results when redox potential is used instead of mixed
   potential are also discussed. It is shown that extrapolation of
   electrochemically-obtained results to leaching operations should be done
   with care. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation of composites of cellulose acetate, triphenyl phosphate
   and poly (acrylic acid) (M), coated with polyaniline (M-PAni) or
   polypyrrole (M-PPy), including tests of the adsorptivity of complexes of
   copper-iodide, are presented in this work. Characterization of M-PAni
   and M-PPy by FT-IR and TGA before and after being exposed to natural
   weathering conditions are done to study the effects that environmental
   conditions have on them. In solutions, with Cu only, the M-PAni
   presented 51.6\% Cu adsorption and M-PPy presented 10.7\%. SEM analysis,
   EDS, XPS and ATR-FTIR of M-PAni and M-PPy before and after of Cu
   adsorption are included. In the presence of gold-iodide complex, M-PAni
   shows 47.4\% Cu adsorption, six times higher than the M-PPy, 7.2\%; this
   result is attributed to better interaction between the PAni and the
   copper-iodide complex than PPy and the copper-iodide. The adsorption
   equilibrium data of copper-iodide complex fits the Langmuir isotherm
   model for both M-PAni and M-PPy, suggesting the formation of an adsorbed
   monolayer. Desorption process for Au is more effective in the two
   materials, 34.1\% with M-PAni and 86.6\% with M-PPy, than for Cu with
   1.0\% and 2.6\% respectively. The present method, which uses iodide as a
   single leaching agent for Au and Cu and M-PAni and M-PPy as adsorbents
   is recommended. These composites are suitable selective materials. (C)

Abstract = {{The residential building sector in Canada consumes 17\% of the total
   energy and contributes to 15\% of the total greenhouse gas emissions.
   Predominantly, the energy demand for cooling in the residential sector
   is increasing due to large occupancy floor area and high usage of
   air-conditioning. Minimizing energy use and associated emissions is one
   of the highest priority goals set for national energy management
   strategies in developed countries, including Canada. In this research, a
   probabilistic feasibility evaluation framework is developed to: i)
   evaluate the techno-economic performance of different snow storage
   systems, namely conventional snow storage, watertight snow storage,
   high-density snow storage, and ii) compare the performance of snow
   storage systems with the conventional chiller system. The technical and
   economic performances of all the building cooling system alternatives
   are evaluated in terms of the coefficient of performance and the total
   cooling cost per kilowatt-hour at the facility, respectively.
   Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to address the uncertainties
   involved in the techno-economic parameters. The framework has also been
   implemented on a low-rise residential building in Kelowna (British
   Columbia, Canada) to appraise its practicality. The study results
   verified that overall snow storage systems are more energy efficient and
   cost effective options for building cooling systems. This research will
   support decision-makers in future for selecting sustainable options for
   building cooling systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Expected changes in European biofuel regulations lead to uncertainty in
   supply chain planning for second generation biofuel industries. Previous
   studies used optimization to design biofuels supply chains and a few of
   them analyzed the impact of selected biofuel policy instruments on
   sustainability targets. This study presents a mixed integer programming
   model for the optimal design of second generation biofuel supply chains
   considering all policy instruments of European biofuel regulations. The
   model maximizes the net present value of second generation biofuel
   supply chains considering time dependent quotas for biofuel market
   shares and greenhouse gas emission savings. The model includes multiple
   counting of second generation biofuel towards meeting biofuel market
   share targets and captures all greenhouse gas emissions of the second
   generation biofuel supply chain including land use change emissions. We
   demonstrated the use of the model through the case study of second
   generation biodiesel in a German region, and evaluated the sensitivity
   of the optimal solution to model parameters and policy instruments'
   levels. A set of remarks were made regarding the impact of policy
   instruments on the performance of second generation biodiesel supply
   chain under study. Future work entails the application of the analysis
   to the aggregate level in the European Union. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Impact of human operational factors on drinking water quality in small
   systems: an exploratory analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{681-690}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Small distribution systems face numerous challenges in drinking water
   production because of financial insufficiency. In these systems, where
   treatment installation is often based on a simple step of disinfection,
   every element of water production and monitoring is under the
   responsibility of local operators. As a result, drinking water quality
   in small systems becomes more sensible to operators' interventions,
   which should be considered in the comprehension of the variability of
   water quality. The objective of this study is to define the impact of
   human operational factors on drinking water quality. Observations and
   individual interviews were conducted with operators of 21 small systems
   in two Canadian provinces. Drinking water quality was sampled at the
   same time in the systems under study. A first analysis allowed to
   categorize systems according to their human operational factors and to
   identify factors contributing the most to drinking water quality.
   Results suggest that the most important human operational factor is
   experience, which has a positive correlation with other factors, as
   motivation and autonomy. In order to determine the relative influence of
   human operational factors, raw water quality and the applied treatment
   were also considered. Multi-level analysis has revealed that global
   human operational factors do not explain global drinking water quality,
   as raw water quality and treatment are the main explanatory parameters.
   However, when drinking water quality was assessed daily, only the
   variability of human operational factors could explain the variability
   of drinking water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Intra-utility performance management model (In-UPM) for the
   sustainability of small to medium sized water utilities:
   Conceptualization to development}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{133}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Small to medium sized water utilities face serious challenges to meet
   broad sustainability objectives, because of technical, human and
   financial constraints and limited involvement in the inter-utility
   benchmarking. Most of these utilities are unable to address the
   performance gaps for various functional components, such as personnel,
   operational, financial, etc., of their water supply systems and rely on
   emergency response. Even if the information obtained from such
   benchmarking process is available, the outcome (indices) showing
   performance of these components, at the utility level, is useful for top
   level management. The operations management is more interested in the
   performance of subcomponents (under each functional component) of the
   water supply systems within the utility. An hierchical intra-utility
   performance management model is conceptualized and developed for
   effective decision making at both the levels. A hierarchical based
   top-down approach initiates from overall sustainability objectives at
   the top, followed by primary and secondary performance measures of the
   sub-components, and indicators (basic building blocks) receive inputs
   from data/decision variables at the bottom. The model assesses the
   performance of each component and sub-component as `high', `medium', or
   `low'. Fuzzy based technique has been employed to deal with uncertainty
   issues due to data limitations and vagueness in expert knowledge.
   Sensitivity analysis helped to rank the indicators for their
   contribution in decision making. The model is implemented for a medium
   sized utility containing three sub-systems in the Okanagan Basin (BC,
   Canada). The results demonstrate the model's practicality to efficiently
   achieve sustainable performance in small to medium sized water
   utilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},

Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{530-556}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We develop a sublinear-scaling method, referred to as MacroDFT, for the
   study of crystal defects using ab-initio Density Functional Theory
   (DFT). The sublinear scaling is achieved using a combination of the
   Linear Scaling Spectral Gauss Quadrature method (LSSGQ) and a
   Coarse-Graining approach (CG) based on the quasi-continuum method. LSSGQ
   reformulates DFT and evaluates the electron density without computing
   individual orbitals. This direct evaluation is possible by recourse to
   Gaussian quadrature over the spectrum of the linearized Hamiltonian
   operator. Furthermore, the nodes and weights of the quadrature can be
   computed independently for each point in the domain. This property is
   exploited in CG, where fields of interest are computed at selected nodes
   and interpolated elsewhere. In this paper, we present the MacroDFT
   method, its parallel implementation and an assessment of convergence and
   performance by means of test cases concerned with point defects in
   magnesium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability using an external
   electric field has been the subject of many studies. However, most of
   these studies are focused on early stages of the evolution. In this
   work, the long-term evolution of the instability is investigated,
   focusing on the forces acting on the interface between the two fluids.
   To this end, numerical simulations are carried out at various electric
   permittivity and conductivity ratios as well as electric field
   intensities using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. The electric
   field is applied in parallel to gravity to maintain unstable evolution.
   The results show that increasing top-to-bottom permittivity ratio
   increases the rising velocity of the bubble while hindering the spike
   descent. The opposite trend is observed for increasing top-to-bottom
   conductivity ratio. These effects are amplified at larger electric field
   intensities, resulting in narrower structures as the response to the
   excitation is non-uniform along the interface.}},

Title = {{Direct resolution of differential pressure fluctuations to characterize

Abstract = {{A direct resolution approach was proposed to decompose differential
   pressure signals from a gas fluidized bed into macro- and super-imposing
   components, which were further subjected to structure density function
   analysis (SDF analysis) to study dynamics of multi-scale structures in
   flow. Direct resolution performed well in extracting feature information
   of multi-scale structures, especially macro- and meso-scale structures
   whose dynamic behaviors majorly affected hydrodynamics in bed, from
   measured differential pressure fluctuations. With the assistance of
   Gaussian fitting and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, SDF analysis divided the
   probability distribution of multiple structures with respect to their
   amplitude scale r into four feature regions (Regions B-I, B-II, B-III
   and Region A). Parameter K-SDF derived from slope of Region B-II
   quantified frequency of various meso-scale structures in flow, and well
   followed the tendency of flow patterns transition after being normalized
   by bubble (slug) rising velocity U-b(sl). Frequency of macro scale
   structures in slugging flow depended greatly on rising velocity of
   slugs, so SDFmacro increased with increased fluidization velocity.
   Developed turbulent flow had a high SDFmacro exceeded 0.8 Hz due to the
   fast passage and split/integration of large voids. Structures localized
   in Region A mainly represented noise from measurements, other measurable
   micro-scale disturbances in single phases or phase-interfaces, and had
   an occurring frequency increased with increase of fluidization velocity.

   machine model combined with the parameter-varying coordinated

Abstract = {{Mobile robots that integrate visual servo control for facilitating
   autonomous grasping and manipulation are the focus of this paper. In
   view of mobility, they have wider application than traditional
   fixed-based robots with visual servoing. Visual servoing is widely used
   in mobile robot navigation. However, there are not so many report for
   applying it to mobile manipulation. In this paper, challenges and
   limitations of applying visual servoing in mobile manipulation are
   discussed. Next, two classical approaches (image-based visual servoing
   (IBVS) and position-based visual servoing (PBVS)) are introduced aloing
   with their advantages and disadvantages. Simulations in Matlab are
   carried out using the two methods, there advantages and drawbacks are
   illustrated and discussed. On this basis, a suggested system in mobile
   manipulation is proposed including an IBVS with an eye-in-hand camera
   configuration system. Simulations and experimentations are carried with
   this robot configuration in a search and rescue scenario, which show
   good performance.}},

Abstract = {{A green electrorefining process for production of pure lead from
   methanesulfonic acid (MSA) medium was studied. The conductivities of
   lead - MSA solutions have been measured and modeled to characterize the
   electrorefining medium. The effects of current density, electrode
   spacing, electrorefining temperature, lead concentration, free-MSA
   concentration and electrorefining time on the electrorefining process
   were investigated. The cell voltage and specific energy consumption of
   the electrorefining process increase with an increase of current
   density, electrode spacing and electrorefining time, and decrease with
   an increase of electrorefining temperature, lead concentration and
   free-MSA concentration. The operating parameters of the electrorefining
   process for production of pure lead from MSA medium in this study have a
   widely acceptable range as follows: current density 150-250 A/m(2),
   electrode spacing 3.0-6.0 cm, electrorefining temperature 293.5-313.5 K,
   lead concentration 60-150 g/L and a free-MSA concentration 100 g/L. The
   cathodic current efficiency was in excess of 99\% and the specific
   energy consumption was below 110 kW h/t-Pb. The lead content of the
   cathodic lead was in excess of 99.99\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Demulsification techniques of water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions in

Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{377-407}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The difficulties associated with transportation and refining of crude
   oil emulsions and produced water discharge limitations are among the
   conspicuous clues that have led the oilfield researchers to probe into
   practical demulsification methods for many decades. Inconsistent
   research outcomes observed in the literature for a particular
   demulsification method of a typical emulsion (i.e., water-in-oil or
   oil-in-water) arise not only from the varied influential parameters
   associated (such as salinity, temperature, pH, dispersed phase content,
   emulsifier/demulsifier concentration, and droplet size) but also from
   the diverse types of emulsion constituents (namely oil, surfactant,
   salt, alkali, polymer, fine solids, and/or other chemicals/impurities).
   Being the main component in formation of stabilizing interfacial film
   surrounding the dispersed phase droplets, surfactant is the most
   predominant contributor to emulsion stability, extent of which depends
   on its nature (being ionic or nonionic, and its degree of
   hydrophilicity/lipophilicity), concentration, and interaction with other
   surface-active agents in the emulsion as well as on the salinity,
   temperature, and pH of the system. In this paper, it is endeavored to
   overview some of the most commonly exploited demulsification techniques
   (i.e., chemical, biological, membrane, electrical, and microwave
   irradiation) of both oilfield and synthetic emulsions, taking into
   account the emulsion-stabilizing and-destabilizing effects with regard
   to the dominant parameters plus the emulsion composition. Further, the
   variations occurring in interfacial properties of emulsions by
   demulsification process are discussed. Finally, the mechanism(s)
   involved in emulsions resolution achieved by each method is elucidated.
   Clearly, the most efficient demulsification approach is the one able to
   attain desirable separation efficiency while complying with the
   environmental regulations and imposing the least economic burden on the
   petroleum industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of heavy metals (HMs) in soils is potentially hazardous
   to human, livestock and plant species. HMs in the combined pollution
   soils and indigenous plants were investigated in a non-ferrous
   metal-smelting area. The purpose of this study was to determine the HMs
   in the contaminated soil and different plant species found growing on
   it, as well as calculation of bioaccumulation coefficients (BACs).
   Representative sampling sites were identified according to the land-use
   types. A total of 12 surface soil samples and 32 plant samples were
   collected. HMs were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry. The levels of soil pollution were assessed using Nemerow's
   synthetical contamination index method. The synthetical index was in the
   range of 16.81-198.11. This result indicated a heavy burden on local
   environment. HM concentrations in plants were directly related with soil
   concentrations. The average BACs of five metals were found in the order
   of Cd (0.309)>Zn (0.178)approximate to Pb (0.160)>Cu (0.105)>Sb
   (0.0672). Spontaneous weeds including Chenopodium album Linn, Kochia
   scoparia and trees of Leuce, Ulmus pumila were deemed HM accumulators.
   The results provided a practical basis for phytoremediation of
   HM-contaminated soils using accumulator species.}},

Abstract = {{Spreading depression (SD), a slow propagating depolarization wave, plays
   an important role in pathophysiology of different neurological
   disorders. Yet, research into SD-related disorders has been hampered by
   the lack of non-invasive recording techniques of SD. Here we compared
   the manifestations of SD in continuous non-invasive electroencephalogram
   (EEG) recordings to invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in
   order to obtain further insights into generator structures and
   electrogenic mechanisms of surface recording of SD. SD was induced by
   KCl application and simultaneous SD recordings were performed by scalp
   EEG as well as ECoG electrodes of somatosensory neocortex of rats using
   a novel homemade EEG amplifier, AgCl recording electrodes, and high
   chloride conductive gel. Different methods were used to analyze the
   data; including the spectrogram, bi-spectrogram, pattern distribution,
   relative spectrum power, and multivariable Gaussian fit analysis. The
   negative direct current (DC) shifts recorded by scalp electrodes
   exhibited a high homogeneity to those recorded by ECoG electrodes.
   Furthermore, this novel method of recording and analysis was able to
   separate SD recorded by scalp electrodes from non-neuronal DC shifts
   induced by other potential generators, such as the skin, muscles,
   arteries, dura, etc. These data suggest a novel application for
   continuous non-invasive monitoring of DC potential changes, such as SD.
   Non-invasive monitoring of SD would allow early intervention and improve
   outcome in SD-related neurological disorders. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published

Title = {{Engineered biochar from microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of
   switchgrass for increasing water-holding capacity and fertility of sandy
   soil}},

Abstract = {{Engineered biochars produced from microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis
   of switchgrass have been evaluated in terms of their ability on
   improving water holding capacity(WHC), cation exchange capacity (CEC)
   and fertility of loamy sand soil. The addition of K3PO4, clinoptilolite
   and/or bentonite as catalysts during the pyrolysis process increased
   biochar surface area and plant nutrient contents. Adding biochar
   produced with 10 wt.\% K3PO4 + 10 wt.\% clinoptilolite as catalysts to
   the soil at 2 wt\% load increased soil WHC by 98\% and 57\% compared to
   the treatments without biochar (control) and with 10 wt.\%
   clinoptilolite, respectively. Synergistic effects on increased soil WHC
   were manifested for biochars produced from combinations of two additives
   compared to single additive, which may be the result of increased
   biochar microporosity due to increased microwave heating rate. Biochar
   produced from microwave catalytic pyrolysis was more efficient in
   increasing the soil WHC due to its high porosity in comparison with the
   biochar produced from conventional pyrolysis at the same conditions. The
   increases in soil CEC varied widely compared to the control soil,
   ranging from 17 to 220\% for the treatments with biochars produced with
   10 wt\% clinoptilolite at 400 degrees C, and 30 wt\% K3PO4 at 300
   degrees C, respectively. Strong positive correlations also exist among
   soil WHC with CEC and biochar micropore area. Biochar from
   microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis appears to be a novel approach
   for producing biochar with high sorption affinity and high CEC. These
   catalysts remaining in the biochar product would provide essential
   nutrients for the growth of bioenergy and food crops. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Boiling heat transfer experiments were performed in a small rectangular
   channel (hydraulic diameter, De = 3.0 mm) with water and methanol. The
   channel size represents the tube configurations in plate fin heat
   exchangers, which are commonly used for generating hydrogen from
   hydrogen-rich liquid fuels. The tested mass flux ranged from 6.59 to
   21.97 kg m(-2) s, heat flux from 13.3 to 30.1 kW m(-2) and inlet
   temperatures from ambient to 80 degrees C. Tests were carried out at
   atmospheric pressure. Local heat transfer coefficients were determined
   experimentally as a function of vapor quantity along the length of the
   test section. Insights into heat transfer mechanisms in small channels
   are presented over a range of Reynolds number from 38 to 263.
   Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art predictive
   correlations are presented. The Chen correlation was found to be most
   suitable for predictions of water boiling heat transfer under the
   recommended application range for minichannels. For methanol, the Shah
   correlation was more sound over the range with Re larger than 50, while
   the Gungor-Winterton equation was more accurate when Re was smaller than
   50. In addition, flow boiling instability in minichannels was detected
   when the flow was dominated by subcooled boiling. However, the periodic
   oscillations of temperature and pressure disappeared when the heat
   transfer became dominated by saturated boiling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{374-383}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Xanthan gum (XG) and gelatin B (GB) interact synergistically in aqueous
   solution (0.2\% XG, 1.0\% GB (wt/vol)) and form gels with an elastic
   modulus G0 almost 30 times superior to a pure 0.2\% XG solution. G0
   reaches a maximum at pH 5.5, near the isoelectric point of GB, and
   subsequently decreases with increasing pH, while it decreases
   significantly with salt addition due to charge screening. A delicate
   balance is hence needed between electrostatic attraction and repulsion
   to maximize the rheological properties of mixed XG/GB gels. In addition,
   the gels display time-dependent properties originating from hydrogen
   bonding between gelatin molecules, as shown by full heat-reversibility
   behavior. The mixtures' macroscopic rheological properties correlate
   well with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) microstructure
   analysis: GB forms large aggregates at pH 5.0 and a network structure at
   pH >= 5.5, while XG forms a network at pH 5.5 which disappears with
   increasing pH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of conventional hydrogen fuel cell catalyst layers
   suffers from a poor understanding of their composite nanostructure
   during both initial preparation and its evolution during use. We
   demonstrate how highly active, ultralow loading platinum (Pt) catalyst
   layers can be fabricated in a single, solution-processable step using
   electroless deposition. Growing Pt nanoparticles directly in the surface
   of a polyelectrolyte Nafion membrane yields a mechanically robust film
   with tunable optical reflectance and electronic conductivity. Small
   changes in the polymer hydration and Pt film thickness critically
   modulate nanoparticle interconnectivity near the percolation threshold.
   Conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy reveal
   how the film's dynamic nanoscale morphology allows control over bulk
   electrochemical and optical properties. Well-defined composition and
   structure make these layers an experimentally accessible model system
   for studying thin-film electrocatalyst architectures.}},

Abstract = {{As a renewable and non-polluting energy source, wind is used to produce
   electricity via large-diameter horizontal or vertical axis wind
   turbines. Such large wind turbines have been well designed and widely
   applied in industry. However, little attention has been paid to the
   design and development of miniature wind energy harvesters, which have
   great potential to be applied to the HVAC (heating, ventilating and air
   conditions) ventilation exhaust systems and household personal
   properties. In this work, 10 air-driven electromagnetic energy
   harvesters are fabricated using 3D printing technology. Parametric
   measurements are then conducted to study the effects of (1) the blade
   number, (2) its geometric size, (3) aspect ratio, presence or absence of
   (4) solid central shaft, (5) end plates, and (6) blade orientation. The
   maximum electrical power is 0.305 W. To demonstrate its practical
   application, the electricity generated is used to power 4 LED
   (light-emitting diode) lights. The maximum overall efficiency eta(max)
   is approximately 6.59\%. The cut-in and minimum operating Reynolds
   numbers are measured. The present study reveals that the 3D printed
   miniature energy harvesters provide a more efficient platform for
   harnessing `wind power'. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Incorporating social benefits in multi-objective optimization of

Abstract = {{Utilization of forest and wood residues to produce bioenergy and
   biofuels could generate additional revenue streams for forestry
   companies, reduce their environmental impacts and generate new
   development opportunities for forest-dependent communities. Further
   development of forest-based biorefineries entails addressing
   complexities and challenges related to biomass procurement, logistics,
   technologies, and sustainability. Numerous optimization models have been
   proposed for the economic and environmental design of
   biomass-to-bioenergy or biofuel supply chains. A few of them also
   maximized the job creation potential of the supply chain through the use
   of employment multipliers. The use of a total job creation indicator as
   the social optimization objective implies that all new jobs generate the
   same level of social benefit. In this paper, we quantify the potential
   social benefit of new forest-based biorefinery supply chains considering
   different impacts of new jobs based on their type and location. This
   social benefit is incorporated into a multi-objective mixed integer
   linear programming model that maximizes the social benefit, net present
   value and greenhouse gas emission saving potential of a forest based
   biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the model is illustrated
   through a case study in the interior region of British Columbia, Canada
   where different utilization paths for available forest and wood residues
   are investigated. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using
   a Pareto-generating method. The analysis of the generated set of
   Pareto-optimal solutions show a trade-off between the net present value
   of the supply chain and the other two investigated objectives. Moreover,
   there is a positive correlation between the potential to generate high
   impact jobs in the region and its potential to generate greenhouse gas
   emission savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolite is an exciting natural material due to its unique capability of
   ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) adsorption in water. In this study,
   multifunctional hybrid composites of zeolite/palladium (Ze/Pd) on

   nanoparticles were uniformly distributed and deposited on the
   nanofibers. NH3-N recovery rate was increased from 23 to 92\% when
   palladium coated zeolite was embedded on the nanofiber. Multifunctional
   nanofibers of Ze/Pd membranes were able to adsorb NH3-N on the zeolites
   placed on the surface of fibers and palladium catalysts were capable of
   selective oxidation of NH3-N to N-2 gas. The cycling of NH3-N
   adsorption-oxidation, high flux, hydrophilicity, and flexibility of the

Abstract = {{Zinc Oxide Nano Wires (ZNWs) has been considered as a promising material
   for purification and disinfection of water and remediation of hazardous
   waste owing to its high activity and lower cost. In this study,
   three-dimensional (3D) structured palladium (Pd)/ZNWs were synthesized
   on the fabricated electrospun nanofibers and explored for enhancement of
   organic matter (OM) removal efficiency in water by suppressing electron
   hole recombination during photocatalytic activity and increased surface
   area. The densely populated ZNWs were fabricated on the electrospun
   nanofiber by electroless plating (EP) and hydrothermal synthesis. In
   order to improve photocatalytic efficiency, a thin layer of Pd was
   coated prior to ZNWs growth to induce suppression of electron hole
   recombination produced during catalyst activity. The creation of a
   highly porous network of nanofibers decorated with ZNWs resulted in an
   increase of specific removal rate (SRR) of OM from 0.0249 to 0.0377 mg
   CODCr removed/mg ZNWs-hr when ZNW were grown on a Pd layer. It is
   believed that the demonstration of OM removal in the water through
   Pd/ZNWs membrane and enhanced photocatalytic activity under UV
   irradiation from layered structure can broaden potential applicability
   of Pd/ZNWs membranes for various photo catalytic water treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, the size effect on the flexural behavior of amorphous
   metallic fiber reinforced concrete (AMFRC) was investigated. For this,
   several AM-FRC beams having three different sizes were fabricated with
   different values of water-to-cementitious material (w/cm) ratio and
   fiber volume fraction. In order to estimate the implication of fiber
   type on the size effect, steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) having
   the same mixture proportion as that of the AM-FRC and 0.75\% by volume
   of hooked-end steel fibers were also fabricated and tested. The
   experimental results showed that lower flexural performance including
   flexural strength, normalized deflection capacity, and normalized
   toughness was obtained with an increase in the specimen size, regardless
   of w/cm ratio and volume content and type of fibers. High strength
   concrete was more sensitive to the size effect on flexural strength than
   normal-strength concrete, whereas less sensitivity to the size effect
   was observed with an increase in the fiber volume content. The
   effectiveness of using hooked-end steel fibers in reducing the size
   effect was greater for high strength concrete compared to
   normal-strength concrete, due to the better fiber bond performance. (C)

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{71-76}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Multi-story buildings are usually instrumented at a limited number of
   floors. Consequently, the structural response (e.g., acceleration,
   displacement) at the non-instrumented floors remains unknown and needs
   to be estimated using the acceleration data recorded at the instrumented
   floors. The prevailing way to estimate the unknown structural response
   is to interpolate the recorded data over the height of the building.
   Other methods such as the Mode Shape Based Estimation (MSBE) and
   Timoshenko Beam Based Estimation (TBBE) methods, on the other hand, use
   the mode shapes of bending, shear and Timoshenko beam modeling to
   estimate the unknown structural response. The Factor Building at the
   UCLA campus in Los Angeles, California, USA is utilized to test the
   performance of these methods, and the results are compared with
   conventional interpolation methods (e.g., linear or cubic spline
   interpolations). The results show clearly that both the MSBE and the
   TBBE methods provide a better estimation of unknown structural response
   than both linear interpolation methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{A novel procedure, Gravity Release Analysis (GRA), is introduced for
   performance prediction of continuous centrifugal concentration, using
   lab-scale batch tests. Also, linked with the GRA, the Gravity Release
   Index (GRI) was developed for ranking the ore amenability to centrifugal
   gravity concentration. Ore samples from the flotation circuit of Myra
   Falls concentrator were subjected to Multi Pass Test and Gravity
   Amenability Test for comparison with GRA. Recovery kinetics of batch
   centrifugal concentration was analysed to establish the Gravity Release
   Index (GRI). Both Gravity Amenability Test and Multi Pass Test failed to
   cover the broader mass yield range of continuous centrifugal
   concentration and this was the main drawback in performance prediction
   of larger units from lab-scale data. GRA covered a wider mass yield
   range, yielding better performance prediction of larger continuous
   units. From the gravity recovery kinetics of the batch unit, varying GRI
   values for Au, Fe, Zn, Fe and S were obtained, with Au having the
   highest- GRI and amenability to centrifugal gravity concentration.
   Varying amenabilities for different Au forms (free Au particles, Au
   bearing sulphides) to centrifugal gravity concentration could also be
   distinguished. SEM analysis on recovered gold entities justified the
   prediction by the GRI. Overall, GRA could effectively predict continuous
   centrifugal concentration using small amounts of feed with lab-scale
   batch units. Determination of the GRI for targeted metals would provide
   further precision for bench-marking and scaling-up of continuous
   centrifugal concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is a widely available copper mineral and like
   other transition metal sulfides it may be a suitable material for energy
   storage applications. In this preliminary study, a composite electrode
   was built from synthetic CuFeS2 sandwiched between graphite. Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analyses revealed that the
   post-synthesis CuFeS2 consisted of microspheres with sulfide (S-2 ,
   S-2(2) and S-n(2) ) surface species. The nature of the charge
   distribution within this composite electrode was determined and compared
   with a graphite felt (CF) electrode in 0.2M H2SO4 solution at 25 degrees
   C. The total current response was partitioned into non-faradaic and
   faradaic components by charging (under-potential deposition) and
   discharging through cyclic voltammetric analysis. A large amount of the
   specific current response (93.5\%) of the composite electrode was
   faradaic in nature. The pseudocapacitive under potential
   adsorption/desorption of H+ ions was reversible and a relatively higher
   specific capacitance of 1.265 F g(-1) was achieved at 0.1 A g(-1) (as
   compared to the 0.588 F g(-1) obtained from the CF electrode).
   Potentiostatic impedance spectroscopy (0 >= eta >= -0.9 V) within the
   charging regime and cathodic potentiodynamic polarization scans revealed
   that the graphite fibers exhibited catalytic behavior. The large
   polarization, higher pseudocapacitance (phi(p)) and faradaic parallel
   resistance (R-p) within the potential region (E-OCP > E > E
   degrees(+)(H) / (H2)) confirmed the generation of an intermediate (H-o)
   species in the CF electrode. The `internal charge mediator' character of
   the graphite felt in the composite electrode, therefore, provided a
   large faradaic current response. Finally, based on the electrochemical
   analysis, the charge/discharge mechanism of the composite electrode is
   proposed. The addition of CuFeS2 in CF increased the specific
   capacitance and maintained the columbic efficiency of similar to 98\%.
   However, confirmation of its potential use as an active electrode
   material in energy storage devices requires further research. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A correlation has been proposed for predicting local bed-to-surface heat
   transfer coefficients in conical spouted beds based on an experimental
   study conducted using beds made up of sand, sawdust, and their mixtures
   under various operating conditions, namely, different static bed heights

   with those obtained using the correlations in the literature proved that
   they provide very poor predictions and, furthermore, they are not able
   to predict local coefficients in the bed. Based on a statistical
   analysis, the significant moduli have been identified in the relevant
   literature correlations and two new moduli related to the radial and
   longitudinal positions have been contemplated. The analysis identified
   two groups of heat transfer coefficients: those within the bed and those
   on its surface. The correlation proposed is specifically suitable for
   ascertaining the best location of heat transfer devices within the

Abstract = {{Statistical inference using social sensors is an area that has witnessed
   remarkable progress in the last decade. It is relevant in a variety of
   applications including localizing events for targeted advertising,
   marketing, localization of natural disasters and predicting sentiment of
   investors in financial markets. This paper presents a tutorial
   description of three important aspects of sensing-based information
   diffusion in social networks from a communications/signal processing
   perspective. First, diffusion models for information exchange in large
   scale social networks together with social sensing via social media
   networks such as Twitter is considered. Second, Bayesian social learning
   models in online reputation systems are presented. Finally, the
   principle of revealed preferences arising in micro-economics theory is
   used to parse datasets to determine if social sensors are utility
   maximizers and then determine their utility functions. All three topics
   are explained in the context of actual experimental datasets from health
   networks, social media and psychological experiments. Also, algorithms
   are given that exploit the above models to infer underlying events based
   on social sensing. The overview, insights, models and algorithms
   presented in this paper stem from recent developments in
   computer-science, economics, psychology and electrical engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a measurement-based method to compute the
   power flow Jacobian matrix, from which we can infer pertinent
   information about the system topology in near real-time. A salient
   feature of our approach is that it readily adapts to changes in system
   operating point and topology; this is desirable as it provides power
   system operators with a way to update, as the system evolves, the models
   used in many reliability analysis tools. The method uses high-speed
   synchronized voltage and current phasor data collected from phasor
   measurement units to estimate entries of the Jacobian matrix through
   linear total least-squares (TLS) estimation. In addition to centralized
   TLS-based algorithms, we provide distributed alternatives aimed at
   reducing computational burden. Through numerical case studies, we
   illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed Jacobian-matrix estimation
   approach as compared with the conventional model-based one.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the compressive and flexural behaviors of
   amorphous metallic fiber-reinforced concrete according to the
   water-cementitious materials ratio (w/cm) and fiber content. Three
   different w/cm (0.6, 0.45, and 0.35) and four different volume fractions
   of amorphous metallic fibers (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75\%) were considered.
   Test results indicated that higher compressive strength and elastic
   modulus were obtained with lower w/cm. Strain capacity and post-peak
   ductility were improved with an increase in the amorphous metallic fiber
   content. Flexural performances-that is, load-carrying capacity and
   deflection capacity- and fracture energy increased almost linearly with
   the reinforcing index. In particular, the concrete with a w/cm of 0.45
   (average compressive strength of 44.2 MPa {[}6.4 ksi]) showed the
   highest fracture energy for all fiber contents. Finally, a generalized
   tension-softening curve (TSC) was suggested on the basis of inverse
   analysis and dimensionless parameters. The predicted values from finite
   element analyses incorporating the proposed TSC exhibited good agreement
   with the test results, including the load-carrying capacity, deflection
   capacity, and post-peak softening response.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes security vulnerabilities in bandwidth allocation
   and request mechanisms that are specified in the IEEE 802.16 Standard,
   and introduces a bandwidth request adversary model called UL-BRA based
   on these vulnerabilities. The goal of UL-BRA is to abuse the bandwidth
   request/grant operation of a WiMAX network, resulting in a significant
   decrease of the overall uplink transmission performance of the network.
   To overcome the challenge caused by the vulnerabilities of the standard,
   we propose a security patch incorporating a real-time anomaly detection
   and restoration (RADR) mechanism, which combines an MCDR scheme with an
   ATD scheme in order to eliminate the impacts of UL-BRA in real-time. We
   verify the effectiveness of RADR under UL-BRA threats via simulations,
   and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed patch in mitigating
   the threats of UL-BRA.}},

Abstract = {{Over the lastfew decades, research on the abatement of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) gas has gained momentum, due to its increasing atmospheric levels.
   This study investigated thigh-temperature steam only gasification of
   woody biomass for the production of high purity hydrogen integrated with
   CO2 capture in a moving-bed gasifier. Extensive process modelling and
   simulation were performed using the superior solid handling features of
   the Aspen Plus process simulator software. After validating the model
   with experimental data from a demonstration plant available in the open
   literature, a reversible carbonation-calcination reaction of calcium
   oxide (CaO) with CO2 was added to the system. Sensitivity analyses were
   conducted to verify the predictive accuracy of the model. The effects of
   steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio on the resulting gas composition were
   thoroughly studied to delineate the complex process of gasification.
   Beyond the mitigation of CO2 emissions, the introduction of a CaO-based
   sorbent in the process simulation significantly enhanced hydrogen
   production by simultaneously promoting the forward water-gas shift
   reaction and reducing tars through increased tar cracking reactions. The
   results show that hydrogen of a higher purity was produced with the
   inclusion of dry sorption CO2 capture in the gasification process.
   Moreover, the addition of the sorbent increased the higher heating
   values (HHV) by 3 times and improved the cold gas efficiency by 34 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the combustible nature of hydrocarbons, accurate safety
   information for their safe utilization and transport is essential. The
   autoignition temperature (AIT) is an important safety parameter. In this
   study, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach
   was utilized to present a predictive model for the estimation of the AIT
   of 813 hydrocarbons from 69 different chemical families. A unified
   three-parameter model was constructed combining multivariate linear
   regression (MLR) and a genetic algorithm (GA). In order to investigate
   the complex performance of the selected molecular parameters an
   optimized artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed. The
   resulting models showed good prediction ability. Although the ANN
   prediction results are more accurate than the GA-MLR model, the
   application of the latter is more convenient. (C) 2016 Institution of

Abstract = {{A number of depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs in Alberta, Canada provide
   an opportunity for enhanced CO2 storage density because the reservoir
   conditions favor CO2 gas hydrate crystal formation. A laboratory
   simulation study was conducted to study this process and assess the
   impact of injection method, presence of additives and salinity on the
   CO2 storage density. Results indicated constant flow rate followed by
   constant pressure CO2 injection enhanced CO2 hydrate formation compared
   to constant pressure gas injection. It was noted that 85 \% of the
   original water in the reservoir formed CO2 hydrate after 24 h
   experiments and that figure rose to 90 \% after a 120 h period. Certain
   amount of tapioca starch and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) added to the
   water prevented the hydrate formation in the earlier stage (delay of the
   onset of hydrate nucleation but subsequently more CO2 was stored as
   hydrate in the reservoir compared to the inhibitor-free systems. Hydrate
   formation in saline reservoirs was reduced compared to pure water
   conditions. The hydrate technology provides an improved CO2 storage
   density. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) are used to manage the risk of gas
   hydrate plug formation in oil and gas transmission pipelines and
   facilities. However, under severe conditions, hydrates can be formed in
   the presence of these additives. It is important to understand how these
   inhibitors would affect gas hydrate remediation. Here, the impact of
   different concentrations of polyvinylcaprolactam (PVCap), Luvicap((R))
   Bio and type III antifreeze proteins (AFP III) on the dissociation of
   propane hydrate formed in the presence of these additives has been
   evaluated using a high pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter.
   Remarkably, hydrates formed in the presence of these inhibitors were
   dissociated at different temperatures than those expected from hydrate
   equilibrium calculations as well as at higher temperatures. However, gas
   hydrates formed in KHI-free solution melted at the equilibrium
   temperature and multiple melting points were not observed.
   Interestingly, an increase in inhibitor concentration decreased the
   amount of gas hydrate that dissociated at the equilibrium temperature.
   Consequently, larger amounts of hydrate were dissociated at higher
   temperatures. These results indicate that since remediation of hydrates
   in the presence of KHIs requires higher melting temperatures, more
   energy is required to remove hydrates under these conditions. Such an
   effect should be considered in the design of processes for flow
   assurance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microdroplets have been widely used in various biomedical applications.
   During droplet generation, parameters are manually adjusted to achieve
   the desired size of droplets. This process is tedious and
   time-consuming. In this paper, we present a fully automated system for
   controlling the size of droplets to optimize droplet generation
   parameters in a microfluidic flow-focusing device. The developed system
   employed a novel image processing program to measure the diameter of
   droplets from recorded video clips and correspondingly adjust the flow
   rates of syringe pumps to obtain the required diameter of droplets. The
   system was tested to generate phosphate-buffered saline and 8\%
   polyethylene (glycol) diacrylate prepolymer droplets and regulate its
   diameters at various flow rates. Experimental results demonstrated that
   the difference between droplet diameters from the image processing and
   manual measurement is not statistically significant and the results are
   consistent over five repetitions. Taking the advantages of the accurate
   image processing method, the size of the droplets can be optimized in a
   precise and robust manner via automatically adjusting flow rates by the
   feedback control. The system was used to acquire quantitative data to
   examine the effects of viscosity and flow rates. Droplet-based
   experiments can be greatly facilitated by the automatic droplet
   generation and optimization system. Moreover, the system is able to
   provide quantitative data for the modelling and application of droplets
   with various conditions in a high-throughput way. Published by AIP

   systems using Lightpath 352140 and 352150 as objective lens were
   analyzed. A custom objective module that includes Lightpath 355392 and
   two customized corrective lenses was designed. Their performances were
   compared by wavefront error, field curvature, astigmatism, F-theta
   error, and tolerance in Zemax simulation. Tolerance analysis predicted
   the focal spot size to be 1.13, 1.19 and 0.83 mu m, respectively.
   Lightpath 352140 and 352150 were implemented in experiment and the
   measured lateral resolution was 1.22 and 1.3 mu m, respectively, which
   matched with the prediction. MPM imaging by the handheld probe were
   conducted on leaf, fish scale and rat tail tendon. The MPM resolution

Abstract = {{Photonic-based instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) of unknown
   microwave signals offers improved flexibility and frequency range as
   compared with electronic solutions. However, no photonic platform has
   ever demonstrated the key capability to perform dynamic IFM, as required
   in real-world applications. In addition, all demonstrations to date
   employ bulky components or need high optical power for operation. Here
   we demonstrate an integrated photonic IFM system that can identify
   frequency-varying signals in a dynamic manner, without any need for fast
   measurement instrumentation. The system is based on a fully linear,
   ultracompact system based on a waveguide Bragg grating on silicon, only
   65-mu m long and operating up to similar to 30 GHz with carrier power
   below 10 mW, significantly outperforming present technologies. These
   results open a solid path towards identification of dynamically changing
   signals over tens of GHz bandwidths using a practical, low-cost on-chip
   implementation for applications from broadband communications to
   biomedical, astronomy and more.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive single particle model of biomass drying and pyrolysis is
   coupled with an ideal reactor model of a bubbling fluidized bed with
   nitrogen as the fluidizing gas. To predict biomass pyrolysis products
   yield and composition under steady-state operation, a two-step biomass
   pyrolysis kinetic mechanism is adopted with primary pyrolysis described
   by two different reaction kinetic schemes: (a) Three parallel
   first-order reactions producing primary pyrolysis products
   (non-condensable gas, tar/bio-oil and char), and (b) a detailed solid
   state kinetics mechanism based on multiple reactions of lignin,
   cellulose, and hemicellulose contents of two specific types of biomass
   (poplar and lodgepole pine). Secondary pyrolysis is modeled by two
   parallel reactions describing homogeneous thermal cracking of tar to
   non-condensable gas and char. In addition to the yields of pyrolysis
   products often modeled as lumped species, this model addresses an
   existing gap of knowledge in predicting the proportions of major
   compounds in the pyrolysis gas based on a few simplifying assumptions
   and CHO elemental balances. This predictive model is a useful tool to
   relate biomass pyrolysis products yield and composition to process
   operating parameters such as biomass ultimate analysis, reactor
   temperature, gas residence time, mean solids residence time inside the
   reactor, as well as biomass particle size and moisture content. Model
   predictions for the two kinetic schemes are in good agreement with
   available experimental data from the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{With quality of experience (QoE) taking a center stage in the evaluation
   of wireless telecommunication system, optimizing the performance of
   heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) is in need of taking service QoE
   into consideration. End to end QoE of video services in HWN is
   determined by not only the network but also the video characteristics.
   In this paper, a metric termed as QoE coverage is proposed to evaluate
   the coverage performance of HWNs for video services. First, subjective
   quality test is performed to improve the existing video quality
   prediction model, and the expression of QoE coverage is derived by
   combining video and network parameters. Second, two QoE provisioning
   schemes, i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous quality thresholds of HWN
   are analyzed to show the mathematic properties. Third, a Monte Carlo
   simulation is performed to show its differences to SINR coverage.
   Compared with state-of-the-art SINR coverage, QoE coverage takes both
   physical layer and application layer parameters into consideration and
   provides more realistic user satisfactory. Results show that QoE
   coverage can be well maintained by adjusting target QoE thresholds,
   modulation and coding schemes with different videos.}},

Title = {{Modular Switched Multiported SRAM-Based Memories}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Multiported RAMs are essential for high-performance parallel computation
   systems. VLIW and vector processors, CGRAs, DSPs, CMPs, and other
   processing systems often rely upon multiported memories for parallel
   access. Although memories with a large number of read and write ports
   are important, their high implementation cost means that they are used
   sparingly. As a result, FPGA vendors only provide dual-ported block RAMs
   (BRAMs) to handle the majority of usage patterns. Furthermore, recent
   attempts to create FPGA-based multiported memories suffer from low
   storage utilization. Whereas most approaches provide simple
   unidirectional ports with a fixed read or write, others propose true
   bidirectional ports where each port dynamically switches read and write.
   True RAM ports are useful for systems with transceivers and provide high
   RAM flexibility; however, this flexibility incurs high BRAM consumption.
   In this article, a novel, modular, and BRAM-based switched multiported
   RAM architecture is proposed. In addition to unidirectional ports with
   fixed read/write, this switched architecture allows a group of write
   ports to switch with another group of read ports dynamically, hence
   altering the number of active ports. The proposed switched-ports
   architecture is less flexible than a true-multiported RAM where each
   port is switched individually. Nevertheless, switched memories can
   dramatically reduce BRAM consumption compared to true ports for systems
   with alternating port requirements. Previous live-value-table (LVT) and
   XOR approaches are merged and optimized into a generalized and modular
   structure that we call an invalidation-based live-value-table (I-LVT).
   Like a regular LVT, the I-LVT determines the correct bank to read from,
   but it differs in how updates to the table are made; the LVT approach
   requires multiple write ports, often leading to an area-intensive
   register-based implementation, whereas the XOR approach suffers from
   excessive storage overhead since wider memories are required to
   accommodate the XOR-ed data. Two specific I-LVT implementations are
   proposed and evaluated: binary and thermometer coding. The I-LVT
   approach is especially suitable for deep memories because the table is
   implemented only in SRAM cells. The I-LVT method gives higher
   performance while occupying fewer BRAMs than earlier approaches: for
   several configurations, BRAM usage is reduced by greater than 44\% and
   clock speed is improved by greater than 76\%. The I-LVT can be used with
   fixed ports, true ports, or the proposed switched ports architectures.
   Formal proofs for the suggested methods, resources consumption analysis,
   usage guidelines, and analytic comparison to other methods are provided.
   A fully parameterized Verilog implementation is released as an open
   source library. The library has been extensively tested using Altera's
   EDA tools.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present PolyBlaze, a scalable and configurable

   PolyBlaze is an extension of the MicroBlaze soft processor, leveraging
   the configurability of the MicroBlaze and bringing it into the multicore
   era with Linux Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) support. This work
   details the hardware modifications required for the MicroBlaze processor
   and its software stack to enable fully validated SMP operations,
   including atomic operation support, shared interrupts and timers, and
   exception handling. New in this work, we present a scalable and flexible
   memory hierarchy optimized for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs),
   which manages atomic operations and provides support for future flexible
   memory hierarchies and heterogeneous systems. Also new is an in-depth
   analysis of key performance characteristics, including memory bandwidth,
   latency, and resource usage. For all system configurations, bandwidth is
   found to scale linearly with the addition of processor cores until the
   memory interface is saturated. Additionally, average memory latency
   remains constant until the memory interface is saturated; after which,
   it scales linearly with each additional processor core.

Abstract = {{Due to the compression performance of the latest coding standard known
   as high efficiency video coding (HEVC), there has been a significant
   interest in developing a scalable version to address industry's demand
   for cost effective universal access of digital media. One of the issues
   with the scalable extension of HEVC (known as SHVC) is its computational
   complexity. The focus of this study is on developing complexity
   reduction schemes for SHVC encoder with quality/fidelity scalability. In
   this paper, we propose a complexity reduction scheme for quality
   scalable extension of HEVC with two enhancement layers. The proposed
   scheme potentially can make coding/transmission of several
   different-quality versions of the same video content in one bit-stream
   an attractive proposition for the content delivery industry, allowing
   for cost effective digital media delivery to a variety of playback
   display devices. Performance evaluations confirm that the proposed
   complexity reduction scheme reduces total SHVC's encoding time by up to
   51.95\% while maintaining the overall quality of the coded streams.}},

Abstract = {{Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for the
   fifth generation mobile communication due to its high spectral
   efficiency. By applying superposition coding and successive interference
   cancellation techniques at the receiver, multiple users can be
   multiplexed on the same subchannel in NOMA systems. Previous works focus
   on subchannel assignment and power allocation to achieve the
   maximization of sum rate; however, the energy-efficient resource
   allocation problem has not been well studied for NOMA systems. In this
   paper, we aim to optimize subchannel assignment and power allocation to
   maximize the energy efficiency for the downlink NOMA network. Assuming
   perfect knowledge of the channel state information at base station, we
   propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which includes
   energy-efficient subchannel assignment and power proportional factors
   determination for subchannel multiplexed users. We also propose a novel
   power allocation across subchannels to further maximize energy
   efficiency. Since both optimization problems are non-convex, difference
   of convex programming is used to transform and approximate the original
   non-convex problems to convex optimization problems. Solutions to the
   resulting optimization problems can be obtained by solving the convex
   sub-problems iteratively. Simulation results show that the NOMA system
   equipped with the proposed algorithms yields much better sum rate and
   energy efficiency performance than the conventional orthogonal frequency
   division multiple access scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce in-band full duplexing (IBFD) for broadband

   in digital subscriber lines, Ethernet, cable communication, and recently

   requirements for a successful IBFD implementation in BB-PLC. We propose
   a two-stage IBFD structure consisting of an initial analog isolation
   using an active hybrid circuit, and a simplified mixed-domain digital
   echo cancellation procedure to suppress the self-interference.
   Furthermore, we enhance the digital cancellation filter to better adapt
   to linear periodically time-varying channel conditions, commonly
   encountered in PLC scenarios. We evaluate our solution under diverse
   power line channel and noise conditions to examine the overall data rate
   gains that can be achieved. Last, we extend IBFD to multiple-input
   multiple-output BB-PLC systems that enable faster and/or more robust

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the resource allocation in two-tier wireless
   systems in which small-cell base stations harvest energy from renewable
   sources in addition to the conventional power grid. Moreover, we assume
   that each cell has access to an energy storage system with a limited
   battery capacity. We introduce new mechanisms that enable an efficient
   allocation of the available energy over time across the network. In
   doing so, we take into account the time-varying fading channel, the
   inter-cell interference and the fluctuations of harvested energy. In
   particular, we propose convergent offline algorithms to maximize the
   network energy efficiency while satisfying an average sum-rate
   constraint at each cell. Furthermore, we extend the resource allocation
   scheme by enabling an energy cooperation between the cells. By
   cooperating, they can exchange their harvested energy through a
   smart-grid power infrastructure. Using numerical simulations, we verify
   the convergence of the proposed algorithms and analyze the efficacy of
   the resource allocation and energy cooperation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the long-term histological
   and behavioral outcomes after spinal cord injury (SCI) induced by one of
   three distinct biomechanical mechanisms: dislocation, contusion, and
   distraction. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to incur a
   traumatic cervical SCI by one of these three clinically relevant
   mechanisms. The injured cervical spines were surgically stabilized, and
   motor function was assessed for the following 8 weeks. The spinal cords
   were then harvested for histologic analysis. Quantification of white
   matter sparing using Luxol fast blue staining revealed that dislocation
   injury caused the greatest overall loss of white matter, both laterally
   and along the rostrocaudal axis of the injured cord. Distraction caused
   enlarged extracellular spaces and structural alteration in the white
   matter but spared the most myelinated axons overall. Contusion caused
   the most severe loss of myelinated axons in the dorsal white matter.
   Immunohistochemistry for the neuronal marker NeuN combined with Fluoro
   Nissl revealed that the dislocation mechanism resulted in the greatest
   neuronal cell losses in both the ventral and dorsal horns. After the
   distraction injury mechanism, animals displayed no recovery of grip
   strength over time, in contrast to the animals subjected to contusion or
   dislocation injuries. After the dislocation injury mechanism, animals
   displayed no improvement in the grooming test, in contrast to the
   animals subjected to contusion or distraction injuries. These data
   indicate that different SCI mechanisms result in distinct patterns of
   histopathology and behavioral recovery. Understanding this heterogeneity
   may be important for the future development of therapeutic interventions
   that target specific neuropathology after SCI.}},

Abstract = {{During traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), the spinal cord is subject to
   external displacements that result in damage of neural tissues. These
   displacements produce complex internal deformations, or strains, of the
   spinal cord parenchyma. The aim of this study is to determine a
   relationship between these internal strains during SCI and primary
   damage to spinal cord gray matter (GM) in an in vivo rat contusion
   model. Using magnetic resonance imaging and novel image registration
   methods, we measured three-dimensional (3D) mechanical strain in in vivo
   rat cervical spinal cord (n = 12) during an imposed contusion injury. We
   then assessed expression of the neuronal transcription factor, neuronal
   nuclei (NeuN), in ventral horns of GM (at the epicenter of injury as
   well as at intervals cranially and caudally), immediately post-injury.
   We found that minimum principal strain was most strongly correlated with
   loss of NeuN stain across all animals (R-2 = 0.19), but varied in
   strength between individual animals (R-2 = 0.06-0.52). Craniocaudal
   distribution of anatomical damage was similar to measured strain
   distribution. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess strain field
   error, and minimum principal strain (which ranged from 8\% to 36\% in GM
   ventral horns) exhibited a standard deviation of 2.6\% attributed to the
   simulated error. This study is the first to measure 3D deformation of
   the spinal cord and relate it to patterns of ensuing tissue damage in an
   in vivo model. It provides a platform on which to build future studies
   addressing the tolerance of spinal cord tissue to mechanical
   deformation.}},

   modified microfabrication process without any help of cleanroom

   conductivity sensor was able to measure a wide range of liquids.
   Considering the ease of fabrication and its low cost, the cleanroom-free

Abstract = {{Molecular approaches to solar-energy conversion require a kinetic
   optimization of light-induced electron-transfer reactions. At
   molecular-semiconductor interfaces, this optimization has previously
   been accomplished through control of the distance between the
   semiconductor donor and the molecular acceptor and/or the free energy
   that accompanies electron transfer. Here we show that a kinetic pathway
   for electron transfer from a semiconductor to a molecular acceptor also
   exists and provides an alternative method for the control of interfacial
   kinetics. The pathway was identified by the rational design of molecules
   in which the distance and the driving force were held near parity and
   only the geometric torsion about a xylyl-or phenylthiophene bridge was
   varied. Electronic coupling through the phenyl bridge was a factor of
   ten greater than that through the xylyl bridge. Comparative studies
   revealed a significant bridge dependence for electron transfer that
   could not be rationalized by a change in distance or driving force.
   Instead, the data indicate an interfacial electron-transfer pathway that
   utilizes the aromatic bridge orbitals.}},

Abstract = {{The alternative energy sector is expanding quickly in the USA since
   passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and
   Security Act of 2007. Increased interest in wood-based bioenergy has led
   to the need for robust modeling methods to analyze woody biomass
   operations at landscape scales. However, analyzing woody biomass
   operations in regions like the US Inland Northwest is difficult due to
   highly variable terrain and wood characteristics. We developed the
   Forest Residue Economic Assessment Model (FREAM) to better integrate
   with Geographical Information Systems and overcome analytical modeling
   limitations. FREAM analyzes wood-based bioenergy logistics systems and
   provides a modeling platform that can be readily modified to analyze
   additional study locations. We evaluated three scenarios to test the
   FREAM's utility: a local-scale scenario in which a catalytic pyrolysis
   process produces gasoline from 181 437 Mg yr(-1) of forest residues, a
   regional-scale scenario that assumes a biochemical process to create
   aviation fuel from 725 748 Mg yr(-1) of forest residues, and an
   international scenario that assumes a pellet mill producing pellets for
   international markets from 272 155 Mg yr(-1) of forest residues. The
   local scenario produced gasoline for a modeled cost of \$22.33
   GJ(-1{*}), the regional scenario produced aviation fuel for a modeled
   cost of \$35.83 GJ(-1) and the international scenario produced pellets
   for a modeled cost of \$10.51 GJ(-1). Results show that incorporating
   input from knowledgeable stakeholders in the designing of a model yields
   positive results. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley

Abstract = {{In this study, corrosion performances of the Pb-MnO2 composite in a
   sulfuric acid electrolyte solution at a wide range of anodic potentials
   were investigated. The protective effects of manganese ions as an
   additive to the electrolyte were also studied. An industrially supplied
   PbAg alloy was examined in some cases and the obtained results were used
   as benchmarks for comparison. Oxidation of these materials and
   properties of the formed anodic layers were examined using
   electrochemical techniques including electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic polarization, and
   linear sweep voltammetry. Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray
   diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the anodic
   layers. The presence of MnO2 particles in the Pb-MnO2 caused the
   open-circuit potential of lead to increase from the PbSO4 potential
   region to the PbO potential region, contributing to different
   composition of the anodic layer and higher charge transfer resistances
   of the corrosion layer in comparison with those of the PbAg alloy. The
   charge transfer resistance of the composite increased with potential
   within the PbO/PbSO4 potential region. At the PbO2 potential region, the
   Pb-MnO2 composite anode showed a larger amount of PbO2 in the corrosion
   layer than the PbAg alloy in the Mn-free electrolyte. The presence of
   manganese ions inhibited the formation of PbO2 on the anodes, an effect
   that was more significant on the composite anode. Regardless of the
   electrolyte composition, the amount of PbO2 corrosion product on the
   composite anode increased with the polarization time and the applied
   potential.}},

Title = {{Role of muscle damage on loading at the level adjacent to a lumbar spine

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that posterior spinal surgery results in damage
   to the paraspinal musculature. The effects of such iatrogenic changes on
   spinal loading have not been previously investigated, particularly at
   levels adjacent to a spinal fusion. Therefore, the objective of this
   study was to investigate the effect of simulated muscle damage on
   post-operative spinal loading at the adjacent levels to a spinal fusion
   during upright postures using a mathematical model.
   A musculoskeletal model of the spine using ArtiSynth with 210 muscle
   fascicles was used to predict spinal loading in an upright posture. The
   loading at L1-L2 and L5-S1 were estimated before and after simulated
   paraspinal muscle damage (i.e., removal of muscle attachments at L2-L5)
   along the lumbar spine, both with a spinal fusion at L2-L5 and without a
   spinal fusion.
   The axial compressive forces at the adjacent levels increased after
   simulated muscle damage, with the largest changes being at the rostral
   level (78 \% increase in presence of spinal fusion; 73 \% increase
   without spinal fusion) compared to the caudal level (41 \% in presence
   of fusion and 32 \% without fusion). Shear forces increased in a similar
   manner at both the rostral and caudal levels. These changes in loading
   were due to a redistribution of muscle activity from the local lumbar to
   the global spinal musculature.
   The results suggest that the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine play
   an important role in adjacent segment loading of a spinal fusion,
   independent of the presence of rigid spinal instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Taking advantage of the data gathering capability of wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs) as well as the data storage and processing ability of
   mobile cloud computing (MCC), WSN-MCC integration is attracting
   significant attention from both academia and industry. This paper
   focuses on processing of the sensory data in WSN-MCC integration, by
   identifying the critical issues concerning WSN-MCC integration and
   proposing a novel sensory data processing framework, which aims at
   transmitting desirable sensory data to the mobile users in a fast,
   reliable, and secure manner. The proposed framework could prolong the
   WSN lifetime, decrease the storage requirements of the sensors and the
   WSN gateway, and reduce the traffic load and bandwidth requirement of
   sensory data transmissions. In addition, the framework is capable of
   monitoring and predicting the future trend of the sensory data traffic,
   as well as improving its security. The framework further decreases the
   storage and processing overhead of the cloud, while enabling mobile
   users to securely obtain their desired sensory data faster. Analytical
   and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{We examine inter-channel and intra-channel crosstalk power penalties
   between non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK)
   wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) channels for microring-based
   silicon photonic interconnects. We first propose a new model that
   relates the crosstalk power penalty to the interfering signals power,
   the extinction ratio of the non-return-to-zero, OOK modulated
   ``victim{''} channel, and finally the bit-error-ratio that the power
   penalty is referenced to. As for interchannel crosstalk, the proposed
   model agrees well with our recent experimental measurements. We leverage
   this model to quantify crosstalk induced power penalties in a microring
   based WDM receiver. We also propose an optimization procedure to
   equilibrate the power penalty across channels. We then compare our model
   with intra-channel crosstalk measurements, where two NRZ channels are at
   the same wavelength and are simultaneously routed to different paths by
   two cascaded ring resonators. We remark that intra-channel crosstalk is
   very sensitive to the data rate of NRZ channels. As data rate increases,
   the observed disturbances exceed what models predict. Based on these
   observations, we propose an empirical modification of the original model
   for estimating intrachannel crosstalk power penalties in high (> 20
   Gb/s) data rate situations.}},

Abstract = {{Single-point measurements from towers in cities cannot properly quantify
   the impact of all terms in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget and
   are often not representative of horizontally-averaged quantities over
   the entire urban domain. A series of large-eddy simulations (LES) is
   here performed to quantify the relevance of non-measurable terms, and to
   explore the spatial variability of the flow field over and within an
   urban geometry in the city of Basel, Switzerland. The domain has been
   chosen to be centered around a tower where single-point turbulence
   measurements at six heights are available. Buildings are represented
   through a discrete-forcing immersed boundary method and are based on
   detailed real geometries from a surveying dataset. The local model
   results at the tower location compare well against measurements under
   near-neutral stability conditions and for the two prevailing wind
   directions chosen for the analysis. This confirms that LES in
   conjunction with the immersed boundary condition is a valuable model to
   study turbulence and dispersion within a real urban roughness sublayer
   (RSL). The simulations confirm that mean velocity profiles in the RSL
   are characterized by an inflection point located above the average
   building height . TKE in the RSL is primarily produced above , and
   turbulence is transported down into the urban canopy layer. Pressure
   transport is found to be significant in the very-near-wall regions.
   Further, spatial variations of time-averaged variables and
   non-measurable dispersive terms are important in the RSL above a real
   urban surface and should therefore be considered in future urban canopy
   parametrization developments.}},

Abstract = {{Line-commutated converters (LCCs) are widely used in various high-power
   applications such as generator-rectifier systems, exciters, front-end
   rectifier loads, and classic high voltage dc systems. Among various
   techniques used for modeling LCC systems, the dynamic average value
   modeling (AVM) wherein the effect of switching is neglected or averaged
   over a prototypical switching interval has become indispensible since it
   results in continuous, linearizable, and computationally efficient
   models. The conventional AVMs can only predict the fundamental component
   of the ac voltages and currents, and neglect the harmonics injected at
   the ac side by the switching converter. In this paper, a recently
   proposed parametric average-value modeling (PAVM) approach is extended
   using multiple reference frame theory to include the significant
   harmonics of interest (e.g., fifth and seventh) for diode rectifiers.
   The new PAVM is verified against the detailed simulation in steady-state
   and transient studies, and is effective in predicting the transient
   waveforms, while achieving significant computational advantage (speed
   up) in time-domain simulation over conventional models.}},

Abstract = {{Recent focus on component-network interfacing has greatly increased the
   maximum step size at which machine models can be simulated accurately
   and stably in nodal-analysis-based electromagnetic transients programs
   (EMTP-type). However, considerably smaller step sizes are often used in
   practice due to the presence of fast modes in external power networks.
   To further improve simulation speed, this paper proposes a multirate
   framework for EMTP-type machine models connected to dynamically faster
   power systems. In particular, two multirate induction machine models
   based on the voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) formulation are presented.
   These new models can be interfaced directly with commercial EMTP-type
   programs with no modifications to their computational engines. The
   presented computer studies demonstrate the superior combination of
   numerical accuracy and efficiency of the proposed multirate models
   compared with the existing models.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Small-sized to medium-sized water utilities (SMWU) face severe
   challenges to maximize the customer satisfaction (CS) because of
   operational failures, limited trained staff, and financial issues.
   Conventional methods are based on performance benchmarking and
   interviews, which might not be feasible at all times for SMWU. A novel
   risk-based framework is developed for improving CS by improving the
   reliability of water supply systems operating in a utility. The
   framework is primarily based on comprehensive analysis of customer
   complaints and staff's observations on related complaints. Customer
   dissatisfaction is evaluated in terms of risk of not meeting CS, which
   starts when a customer reports a complaint; however, a complete
   evaluation of CS depends on the duration between the time of the report
   and the response until the complaints' full resolution. Different
   categories of complaints are identified from an exhaustive record of a
   medium-sized utility in Okanagan Basin (British Columbia, Canada). For
   risk management, root cause analysis and failure mode effect analysis
   are performed. To address inherent uncertainties associated with data
   limitations and vagueness in decision makers' perception, fuzzy set
   theory is employed. The results show that almost half of the cumulative
   risk can be reduced with inspection and maintenance interventions which
   are not very expensive; however, the remaining risk reduction requires
   large-scale infrastructure improvements.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze turbulent flows of shear-thinning yield stress fluids in both
   pipe and channel geometries. We lay down a consistent procedure for
   hydraulic calculation of Herschel-Bulkley fluids; i.e. finding the
   relationship between the mean velocity and the wall shear stress. We
   show that for weakly turbulent flows it is necessary to include an
   analysis of wall layers in studying dispersion. In pipe flows, we
   observe an O(10) increase in Taylor dispersion coefficients, compared to
   highly turbulent values. This arises from a combination of large
   velocity and small turbulent dispersivity, acting over a wall layer that
   can represent greater than or similar to 20\% of the pipe area. In
   channel flows the wall layer effect is more modest, but still represents
   an 0(1) increase in Taylor dispersion coefficient. The preceding effects
   are negated for small power law index, due to rapid reduction of the
   wall layer, and are observed to reduce modestly as the yield stress
   increases. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper explores a set of new equations to predict the bond strength

   the database that contains 250 pullout tests were divided into four

   Afterward, nonlinear regression analysis was performed for each study

Abstract = {{We have expanded a former compartmental model of blood glucose
   regulation for healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects. The former model
   was a detailed physiological model which considered the interactions of
   three substances, glucose, insulin and glucagon on regulating the blood
   sugar. The main drawback of the former model was its restriction on the
   route of glucose entrance to the body which was limited to the
   intravenous glucose injection. To handle the oral glucose intake, we
   have added a model of glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract
   to the former model to address the resultant variations of blood glucose
   concentrations following an oral glucose intake. Another model
   representing the incretins production in the gastrointestinal tract
   along with their hormonal effects on boosting pancreatic insulin
   production is also added to the former model. We have used two sets of
   clinical data obtained during oral glucose tolerance test and
   isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion test from both type 2 diabetic
   and healthy subjects to estimate the model parameters and to validate
   the model results. The estimation of model parameters is accomplished
   through solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The results show
   acceptable precision of the estimated model parameters and demonstrate
   the capability of the model in accurate prediction of the body response

Abstract = {{Sand consisting of round quartz grains is widely used as a proppant
   during hydraulic fracturing to produce natural gas from tight shale
   formations. This paper presents results from sand characterization and
   crushing tests on Jordan Formation frac sand. It includes an assessment
   of grain-size reduction, changes in particle shape, and reduction in
   void ratio. It also examines the implications for permeability reduction
   through a sand pack caused by the closure stress on a hydraulic
   fracture. The sand from two size ranges (0.6 to 0.71 mm and 0.5 to 0.6
   mm) was tested dry under applied compressive stresses of up to 40 MPa in
   a crushing cup. The overall sand pack stress-strain response becomes
   softer as grains are crushed. The particle shape shifts from nearly
   spherical grains to diametrically split grains and then to small
   elongated and angular fragments for the smaller particle sizes. The
   permeability of the sand pack reduces by more than 40\% at a 20 MPa
   stress, which is mainly caused by a decrease in void ratio due to
   compaction. The permeability reduces by over 70\% at a 40 MPa stress,
   which is primarily caused by void ratio decrease, reduction in particle
   size, and a shift away from spherical particle shapes. Compared to the
   ISO 13503-2 standard where only the sand crushing percentage after
   crushing tests is measured, this paper demonstrates that more
   information can be extracted from sand crushing tests and that sand pack
   permeability can be assessed to optimize frac sand selection. A sand
   with a larger size range has a higher crushing percentage, but is more
   permeable compared to a sand with a smaller size range. This further
   indicates that frac sand selection based only on sand crushing
   percentage is not sufficient to achieve better sand pack permeability.}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1460-1473}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The cyclic shear response of soils is commonly examined using undrained
   (or constant-volume) laboratory element tests conducted using triaxial
   and direct simple shear (DSS) devices. The cyclic resistance ratio (CRR)
   from these tests is expressed in terms of the number of cycles of
   loading to reach unacceptable performance that is defined in terms of
   the attainment of a certain excess pore-water pressure and (or) strain
   level. While strain accumulation is generally commensurate with excess
   pore-water pressure, the definition of unacceptable performance in
   laboratory tests based purely on cyclic strain criteria is not robust.
   The shear stiffness is a more fundamental parameter in describing
   engineering performance than the excess pore-water pressure alone or
   shear strain alone; so far, no criterion has considered shear stiffness
   to determine CRR. Data from cyclic DSS tests indicate consistent
   differences inherent in the patterns between the stress-strain loops at
   initial and later stages of cyclic loading; instead of relatively
   ``smooth{''} stress-strain loops in the initial parts of loading,
   nonsmooth changes in incremental stiffness showing ``kinks{''} are
   notable in the stress-strain loops at large strains. The point of
   pattern change in a stress-strain loop provides a meaningful basis to
   determine the CRR (based on unacceptable performance) in cyclic shear
   tests.}},

Abstract = {{Buckling restrained knee braced truss moment frame (BRKBTMF) is a novel
   and innovative steel structural system that utilizes the advantages of
   long-span trusses and dedicated structural fuses for seismic
   applications. Steel trusses are very economical and effective in
   spanning large distance. However, conventional steel trusses are
   typically not suitable for seismic application, due to its lack of
   ductility and poor energy dissipation capacity. BRKBTMF utilizes
   buckling restrained braces (BRBs) as the designated structural fuses to
   dissipate the sudden surge of earthquake energy. This allows the BRKBTMF
   to economically and efficiently create large span structural systems for
   seismic applications. In this paper, a prototype BRKBTMF office building
   located in Berkeley, California, USA, was designed using
   performance-based plastic design procedure. The seismic performance of
   the prototype building was assessed using the state-of-the-art finite
   element software, OpenSees. Detailed BRB hysteresis and advanced element
   removal technique was implemented. The modeling approach allows the
   simulation for the force-deformation response of the BRB and the force
   redistribution within the system after the BRBs fracture. The developed
   finite element model was analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis
   approach to quantify the seismic performance of BRKBTMF. The results
   show BRKBTMF has excellent seismic performance with well controlled
   structural responses and resistance against collapse. In addition, life
   cycle repair cost of BRKBTMF was assessed using the next-generation
   performance-based earthquake engineering framework. The results confirm
   that BRKBTMF can effectively control the structural and non-structural
   component damages and minimize the repair costs of the structure under
   different ranges of earthquake shaking intensities. This studies
   conclude that BRKBTMF is a viable and effective seismic force resisting
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent studies on the compressed sensing problem with Multiple
   Measurement Vectors (MMVs) under the condition that the vectors in the
   different channels are jointly sparse have been recently carried. In
   this paper, this condition is relaxed. Instead, these sparse vectors are
   assumed to depend on each other but this dependency is assumed unknown.
   We capture this dependency by computing the conditional probability of
   each entry in each vector being non-zero, given the ``residuals{''} of
   all previous vectors. To estimate these probabilities, we propose the
   use of the long short-term memory (LSTM), a data-driven model for
   sequence modeling that is deep in time. To learn the model parameters,
   we minimize a cross-entropy cost function. To reconstruct the sparse
   vectors at the decoder, we propose a greedy solver that uses the above
   model to estimate the conditional probabilities. By performing extensive
   experiments on two real world datasets, we show that the proposed method
   significantly outperforms the general MMV solver (the Simultaneous
   Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP)) and a number of the model-based
   Bayesian methods. The proposed method does not add any complexity to the
   general compressive sensing encoder. The trained model is used at the
   decoder only. As the proposed method is a data-driven method, it is only
   applicable when training data is available. In many applications
   however, training data is indeed available, e.g., in recorded images for
   which our method is successfully applied as to be reported in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Convective heat transfer inside fibrous gas diffusion layers (GDLs)
   noticeably impacts the heat and water management of air-cooled polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Cutting-edge experiments have
   recently proved that convective heat transfer inside fibrous GDLs
   increases their thermal resistances considerably. However, heat transfer
   coefficients are difficult to measure experimentally or compute
   numerically for the millions of the tiny pores inside microstructural
   GDLs.
   The present study provides robust analytic models for predicting the
   heat transfer coefficient for both through-plane and in-plane flows
   inside fibrous media such as GDLs. The model is based on the unit cell
   approach and the integral method. Closed-form formulas are developed for
   local and average heat transfer coefficients. The model considers the
   temperature variations of the fiber layers along the medium thickness
   while assuming the same temperature for all the fibers in each layer.
   The model is well verified by COMSOL numerical data for a few pores
   inside a GDL. The simple, closed-form easy-to-use formulas developed in
   this study can be readily employed for predicting Nusselt number inside
   multi layer fibrous porous materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study assessed the issue of membrane fouling in a Hybrid Membrane
   Process (HMP) due to the export of powdered activated carbon (PAC) fines
   from a pretreatment contactor. Two parallel pilot-scale ceramic and
   polymeric membranes were studied. Reversible and irreversible foulings
   were measured following three cleaning procedures: Physical backwashing
   (BW), chemically enhanced backwashing (CEB) and Clean-in-Place (CIP).
   The impacts on fouling of membrane type, operation flux increase and the
   presence/absence of the PAC pretreatment were investigated. Membranes
   without pretreatment were operated in parallel as a control. In
   addition, CIP washwaters samples were analyzed to measure organic and
   inorganic foulants removed from the membranes. It was observed that for
   the polymeric membranes, fouling generally increased with the presence
   of the PAC pretreatment because of the export of fines. On the contrary,
   the ceramic membranes were not significantly impacted by their presence.
   The analysis of CIP washwaters showed a greater total organic carbon
   (TOC) content on membranes with a PAC pretreatment while no similar
   conclusion could be made for inorganic foulants.}},

Abstract = {{H-2-fed polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most
   advanced fuel cell technology to date and continue to be of great
   interest as prospective energy sources in numerous applications,
   including for low/zero-emission electric vehicles, distributed power
   generators in homes, and small portable electronic devices. However, the
   commercialization of PEMFC technology has been greatly hindered by
   certain challenges, mainly the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction
   reaction at the cathode and the high cost of Pt-based cathode catalysts,
   the latter presently accounting for over 55\% of the total PEMFC cost.
   To overcome the limited stability of state-of-the-art Pt/C, Pt and
   Pt-alloy catalysts supported on modified carbon materials have garnered
   significant interest in recent years. It is therefore timely to compile
   a review that focuses on Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts supported on modified
   carbon materials, examining their current R\&D status, applications,
   challenges, and future prospects. This review provides a systematic and
   comprehensive survey of current Pt and Pt-alloy PEMFC cathode catalysts
   in terms of materials selection and design, synthesis methods, and
   structural features, emphasizing how these various aspects relate to the
   catalysts' physicochemical characterization and performance, and with
   the aim of shedding light on the future direction of PEMFC research. (C)

Abstract = {{The expression developed in our previous work to predict the redox
   potential of the quaternary H2SO4-Fe-2(SO4)(3)-FeSO4-H2O system can
   still be used to predict the redox potential of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple in
   more complex acidic iron sulfate solutions generated during the acidic
   leaching and bioleaching of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). This
   expression can also be employed to determine the ferrous and ferric
   concentrations based on measured redox potential, temperature and total
   iron by AAS, especially in ferric or ferrous -dominant solutions. This
   equation therefore provides an alternative to the traditional
   colorimetric or volumetric methods for ferric and ferrous determination.
   The applicability of this equation in acidic iron sulfate solutions
   containing cupric ions was also supported by the experimental results in
   the literature. It is also shown that the measured redox potential is
   highly useful to estimate and understand the iron chemistry of
   industrial leaching processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examines mechanical activation as the pre-treatment method
   for ultramafic mine waste containing olivine and serpentine. Specific
   surface area, microstructure and carbonation conversion in a direct
   aqueous carbonation process were measured to test the effects of
   mechanical activation. It was found that, as a result of the grinding
   energy input on materials, surface area was increased, crystallite size
   was reduced and microstrain was accumulated, carbonation conversion was
   enhanced. With the presence of serpentine content, the formation of new
   surface area was promoted and the disordering of forsterite structure
   was prevented. Forsterite makes up the majority of the content and
   contributes to CO2 sequestration under selected carbonation conditions.
   For the purposes of mineral carbonation, the mechanical activation of
   mine waste is preferable to simply grinding pure olivine. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Recently, important advances in road safety statistics have been brought
   about by methods able to address issues other than the choice of the
   best error structure for modeling crash data. In particular, accounting
   for spatial and temporal interdependence, i.e., the notion that the
   collision occurrence of a site or unit times depend on those of others,
   has become an important issue that needs further research.
   Overall, autoregressive models can be used for this purpose as they can
   specify that the output variable depends on its own previous values and
   on a stochastic term. Spatial effects have been investigated and applied
   mostly in the context of developing safety performance functions (SPFs)
   to relate crash occurrence to highway characteristics. Hence, there is a
   need for studies that attempt to estimate the effectiveness of safety
   countermeasures by including the spatial interdependence of road sites
   within the context of an observational before-after (BA) study.
   Moreover, the combination of temporal dynamics and spatial effects on
   crash frequency has not been explored in depth for SPF development.
   Therefore, the main goal of this research was to carry out a BA study
   accounting for spatial effects and temporal dynamics in evaluating the
   effectiveness of a road safety treatment. The countermeasure analyzed
   was the installation of traffic signals at unsignalized urban/suburban
   intersections in British Columbia (Canada). The full Bayes approach was
   selected as the statistical framework to develop the models.
   The results demonstrated that zone variation was a major component of
   total crash variability and that spatial effects were alleviated by
   clustering intersections together. Finally, the methodology used also
   allowed estimation of the treatment's effectiveness in the form of crash
   modification factors and functions with time trends. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper considers a statistical signal processing problem involving
   agent-based models of financial markets, which at amicrolevel are driven
   by socially aware and risk-averse agents. These agents trade (buy or
   sell) stocks at each trading instant by using the decisions of all
   previous agents (social learning) in addition to a private (noisy)
   signal they receive on the value of the stock. We are interested in the
   following: 1) modelling the dynamics of these risk averse agents and 2)
   sequential detection of a market shock based on the behaviour of these
   agents. Structural results that characterize social learning under a
   risk measure, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), are presented and
   formulation of the Bayesian change point detection problem is provided.
   The structural results exhibit two interesting properties: 1) risk
   averse agents herd more often than risk neutral agents and 2) the
   stopping set in the sequential detection problem is nonconvex. The
   framework is validated on data from the Yahoo! Tech Buzz game dataset
   and it is revealed that 1) the model identifies the value changes based
   on agent's trading decisions. 2) Reasonable quickest detection
   performance is achieved when the agents are risk-averse.}},

Abstract = {{Rough surface topographies on implants attract macrophages but the
   influence of topography on macrophage fusion to produce multinucleated
   giant cells (MGC) and foreign body giant cells (FBGC) is unclear. Two
   rough novel grooved substrata, G1 and G2, fabricated by anisotropic
   etching of Silicon < 110 > crystals without the use of photolithographic
   patterning, and a control smooth surface (Pol) were produced and
   replicated in epoxy. The surfaces were compared for their effects on
   RAW264.7 macrophage morphology, gene expression, cyto/chemokine
   secretion, and fusion for one and five days. Macrophages on grooved
   surfaces exhibited an elongated morphology similar to M2 macrophages and
   increased cell alignment with surface directionality, roughness and cell
   culture time. Up-regulated expression of macrophage chemoattractants at
   gene and protein level was observed on both grooved surfaces relative to
   Pol. Grooved surfaces showed time-dependent increase in soluble
   mediators involved in cell fusion, CCL2 and MMP-9, and an increased
   proportion of multinucleated cells at Day 5. Collectively, this study
   demonstrated that a rough surface with surface directionality produced
   changes in macrophage shape and macrophage attractant chemokines and
   soluble mediators involved in cell fusion. These in vitro results
   suggest a possible explanation for the observed accumulation of
   macrophages and MGCs on rough surfaced implants in vivo. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Respiratory motion is one major complicating factor in many image
   acquisition applications and image guided interventions. Existing
   respiratory motion estimation and compensation methods typically rely on
   breathing motion models learned from certain training data, and
   therefore may not be able to effectively handle intra-subject and/or
   inter-subject variations of respiratory motion. In this paper, we
   propose a respiratory motion compensation framework that directly
   recovers motion fields from sparsely spaced and efficiently acquired
   dynamic 2-D MRIs without using a learned respiratory motion model. We
   present a scatter-to-volume deformable registration algorithm to
   register dynamic 2-D MRIs with a static 3-D MRI to recover dense
   deformation fields. Practical considerations and approximations are
   provided to solve the scatter-to-volume registration problem
   efficiently. The performance of the proposed method was investigated on
   both synthetic and real MRI datasets, and the results showed significant
   improvements over the state-of-art respiratory motion modeling methods.
   We also demonstrated a potential application of the proposed method on
   MRI-based motion corrected PET imaging using hybrid PET/MRI. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Dependence of shear rigidity of woven fabrics on yarn pre-tension has
   been reported in the recent literature, however some conflict regarding
   the trend of this effect is observed. Sources of this conflict are
   discussed and resolved in the present article using a new
   characterization framework and a custom-design combined loading fixture.
   It is shown that in order to correctly characterize the tension-shear
   coupling behavior in woven fabrics, instead of using global measured
   data, local normalized forces and displacements should be driven via a
   non-orthogonal transformation procedure, while considering kinematic
   force coupling in the setup. In addition, the effect of fabric shear on
   the tensile behavior of yarns has been investigated, suggesting that the
   coupling under question is in fact two-way. In particular, results
   revealed that applying yarn pre-tension increases the shear resistance
   of the fabric reinforcement, while the tensile behavior of the material
   becomes more compliant when undergoing shear deformation. (C) 2016

Title = {{Numerical simulation of microstructure of brittle rock using a

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{203-217}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A distinct element grain-based method (GBM) was developed to simulate
   the microstructure of rock-like materials. Using this method, a UDEC-GBM
   model can be readily constructed with a given mineral composition,
   allowing independent assignment of specific properties to both the
   grains and grain boundaries. Both intra-granular cracks cutting through
   the grains and inter-granular cracks developed along grain boundaries
   can be captured. These features allow a full incorporation of both
   geometric and mechanical heterogeneity at grain scale for simulating
   brittle rocks. The validity of the proposed UDEC-GBM approach was
   verified by simulating a low-porosity sandstone under compression and
   direct-shear tests. The UDEC-GBM was proved to be capable of reproducing
   many of the characteristics associated with brittle fracture in
   low-porosity sandstone. It was found that the model with unbreakable
   grains trends to under-estimate the crick initiation threshold,
   highlighting the importance of the incorporation of breakable grains
   when modeling micro-structure of brittle rocks. The numerical
   experiments suggested that examining the extent of the tensile stress
   zones alone may lead to a biased evaluation of tensile cracking at crack
   initiation. The tensile stress magnitude must also be taken into
   consideration. It was also found that a synthetic sandstone sample with
   relatively low ground boundary strength produces a more ductile
   post-peak behavior. Microscopic tensile strength of the grains has
   limited influence on the failure mechanism of the synthetic specimen
   under unconfined compression loading. The proposed GBM approach provides
   a very useful tool for studying grain-scale micro-mechanics of brittle
   rocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to provide a clear derivation of the
   Multi-Area Thevenin Equivalent Concept (MATE) including current- and
   voltage-dependent sources. The links concept in MATE is advantageous in
   representing branches connecting subsystems. MATE deviates from
   Diakoptics and from the Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) methods in the way
   it is solved, by manipulating the submatrices in a form that preserves
   the individuality of the internal subsystems while solving, their
   interdependenceg at the level of Thevenin Equivalents. The
   generalization presented in this paper expands the link branch equations
   to dependent, coupled, linear or nonlinear relations, thus resulting in
   unsymmetrical matrices. Its significance occurs when complex control
   systems and power system equations are simultaneously solved in an
   Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). In this case, exact results
   can be achieved with less computational effort for power system dynamics
   studies. A test case with simulation results illustrates the main

Title = {{Voltage-behind-reactance model of six-phase synchronous machines

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{Six-phase synchronous machines have been used in special-purpose
   applications such naval and aircraft power systems, and are now being
   considered in renewable energy systems due to their advantages such as
   lower power per phase, less mechanical' stress, and higher reliability
   compared to three-phase machines. This paper is focused on techniques
   for modeling six-phase synchronous machines in transient simulation
   programs. Firstly, the qd0 model is presented, and a method for
   incorporating the main flux saturation is proposed. However, since in
   simulation programs, the qd0 model is interfaced as a current source, it
   creates interfacing challenges with power electronics devices and
   inductive networks. To alleviate the interfacing challenge, the already
   available coupled-circuit phase domain (CCPD) model is also considered.
   This paper presents a new voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) formulation
   that includes the stator mutual inductances and main flux saturation,
   while achieving direct interface with external circuit. The presented
   VBR model is verified in a single-phase to ground fault scenario while
   connected to an arbitrary six-phase network. The computer studies
   demonstrate the numerical advantages of the new model including
   simulation time and accuracy over the CCPD and the conventional qd0

Abstract = {{The stabilisation of soils with additives is a chemical process that can
   be used to improve soils that contain weak engineering properties. The
   effects of non-traditional additives on the geotechnical properties of
   soils have been the focus of much investigation in recent years. It has
   been well established that the plasticity index and also the size,
   shape, and arrangement of soil particles will affect the treatment
   process of natural soils with additives. In this study, a commercial
   liquid polymer (SS299) was used to improve the strength of Malaysian
   residual soil. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS), field emission
   scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), N-2-BET surface area, and particle
   size analysis tests were used to investigate the influence of SS299 and
   the plasticity index on the time-dependent compressive strength and
   textural characteristics of tropical residual soil. The UCS results
   showed that the addition of 6\% (as the optimum amount) of the selected
   additive increased the compressive strength of laterite soil noticeably,
   after 7 days of curing period. In addition, the increased compressive
   strength of the treated samples with the curing time was evident. Based
   on the FESEM results, it was found that the stabilisation process
   modified the porous network of the laterite soil. Furthermore, new white
   layers of reaction products were formed on the surface of clay
   particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Off-site construction has gained more attention from both academia and
   industry during the last few years. Modular construction is one of the
   most efficient off-site construction methods. In this method, different
   parts (components) of a building are designed and fabricated off the
   construction site in factories as one or more modules, and then they are
   assembled on site to form the final product Studies have shown that the
   modular building technique is applicable to different types of
   buildings, including residential, commercial, educational, and medical.
   Environmental performance is one of the most significant dimensions
   leading to sustainability. Since buildings account for a substantial
   portion of environmental burdens, the main focus of this study is on the
   environmental performance of modular facilities over their life cycle.
   This article also presents a comprehensive critical literature review on
   the benefits and challenges of the modular construction method, compared
   to its conventional counterpart. It is concluded that, on average,
   modular buildings have been shown to provide a better life cycle
   performance, for example a building's energy performance, among others.
   Further life cycle research, considering all the dimensions of
   sustainable construction, is recommended in order to develop a robust
   picture of the sustainability of modular construction. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the widespread growth of slim portable electronics, research into
   planar spiral windings for wireless power transfer (WPT) battery
   charging systems has gained a lot of attention due to their low profile,
   reproducibility, and manufacturability. The major design goal for
   windings in WPT systems is high-quality factor (Q) for a given
   inductance. This study presents a new method to improve Q by using a
   nonunity track-width-ratio (TWR) geometrical arrangement in conjunction
   with increasing the inner radius of winding to make an improved hollow
   planar spiral winding. The inductance regulation of this technique
   combined with its exceptional improvements in Q make it a superior
   choice for resonant WPT systems. Inductance and resistance models are
   provided in order to assess the Q improvement. A 5-W, 110-200-kHzWPT
   system was built and tested based on the wireless power consortium Qi
   standard to confirm the advantages of the improved windings on the
   transmission efficiency of the system. An increase from 70\% to 90\% are
   observed from employing the proposed winding technique designed using
   the provided models.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Unprecedented expansion of native dc powered equipment (LEDs, computers,
   and consumer electronics) has increased commercial and residential dc
   electricity usage over the past decade. Thus, it is foreseeable that
   hybrid ac/dc buildings featuring both ac and dc infrastructures will
   coexist. A hybrid ac/dc building will involve an efficient centralized
   rectifier that supplies all the dc loads, while legacy ac loads will
   remain connected to the existing ac infrastructure. This paper explores
   the opportunity of harmonic mitigation at distribution level in small
   hybrid ac/dc building by using a centralized power factor corrector
   (PFC) with large bandwidth. The current reference generator for the
   harmonic mitigation function (HMF) is explained along with power
   considerations. The PFC uses a proportional resonant controller, instead
   of a PI controller, without requiring additional sensors in the
   rectifier. A computationally inexpensive implementation of the
   phase-locked loop is also proposed along with considerations on
   parameter selection. The proposals provide all the steps for the
   straightforward control design of the PFC+HMF with fast calculations.
   The HMF requires only software modifications in the PFC and one sensor
   to measure the nonlinear load. Simulation and experiments validate the
   proposed procedures.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Linear controllers and small-signal modeling techniques have been used
   for over 40 years to control power electronic converters around the
   equilibrium operating point. Outside the quiescent area, the
   shortcomings of linear controllers are well known and include uncertain
   large-signal transient behavior and sluggish dynamic/recovery response.
   In particular, resonant converters have inherent large-signal behavior,
   making the transient performance of small-signal linear controllers
   poor. This paper develops a geometric controller based on large-signal
   modeling to achieve enhanced dynamic response of the series resonant
   converter (SRC). The proposed modeling strategy provides detailed
   insight into the behavior of the SRC and creates an analytical framework
   to successfully perform geometric control. A new geometric control law
   is mathematically derived using average circular trajectories producing
   accurate and fast dynamics during startup, sudden load or reference
   changes. In order to validate the theoretical analysis, experimental and
   simulation results of an SRC are presented and compared to those of a
   linear and a nonlinear controller. The dynamic response is, on average,
   over 100 times faster than that of the designed linear controller, while
   overshoot is virtually eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{Collecting human skin samples for medical research, including developing
   microneedle-based medical devices, is challenging and time-consuming.
   Researchers rely on human skin substitutes and skin preservation
   techniques, such as freezing, to overcome the lack of skin availability.
   Porcine skin is considered the best substitute to human skin, but their
   mechanical resemblance has not been fully validated. We provide a direct
   mechanical comparison between human and porcine skin samples using a
   conventional mechano-analytical technique (microindentation) and a
   medical application (microneedle insertion), at 35\% and 100\% relative
   humidity. Human and porcine skin samples were tested immediately after
   surgical excision from subjects, and after one freeze-thaw cycle at -80
   degrees C to assess the impact of freezing on their mechanical
   properties. The mechanical properties of fresh human and porcine skin
   (especially of the stratum corneum) were found to be different for bulk
   measurements using microindentation; and both types of skin were
   mechanically affected by freezing. Localized in-plane mechanical
   properties of skin during microneedle insertion appeared to be more
   comparable between human and porcine skin samples than their bulk
   out-of-plane mechanical properties. The results from this study serve as
   a reference for future mechanical tests conducted with frozen human skin
   and/or porcine skin as a human skin substitute.}},

Abstract = {{Recent earthquakes worldwide show that a significant portion of the
   earthquake shaking happens in the vertical direction. This phenomenon
   has raised significant interests to consider the vertical ground motion
   during the seismic design and assessment of the structures. Strong
   vertical ground motions can alter the axial forces in the columns, which
   might affect the shear capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) members.
   This is particularly important for non-ductile RC frames, which are very
   vulnerable to earthquake-induced collapse. This paper presents the
   detailed nonlinear dynamic analysis to quantify the collapse risk of
   non-ductile RC frame structures with varying heights. An array of
   non-ductile RC frame architype buildings located in Los Angeles,
   California were designed according to the 1967 uniform building code.
   The seismic responses of the architype buildings subjected to concurrent
   horizontal and vertical ground motions were analyzed. A comprehensive
   array of ground motions was selected from the PEER NGA-WEST2 and Iran
   Strong Motions Network database. Detailed nonlinear dynamic analyses
   were performed to quantify the collapse fragility curves and collapse
   margin ratios (CMRs) of the architype buildings. The results show that
   the vertical ground motions have significant impact on both the local
   and global responses of non-ductile RC moment frames. Hence, it is
   crucial to include the combined vertical and horizontal shaking during
   the seismic design and assessment of non-ductile RC moment frames.}},

   immobilized on a TiO2 surface. The triarylamine-based dyes under
   investigation showed larger rate constants for dye regeneration (k(reg))
   by the nucleophilic electrolyte species when heavier halogen
   substituents were positioned on the dye. The open-circuit voltages
   (V-OC) tracked these k(reg) values. This analysis of a homologous series
   of dyes that differ only in the identity of two halogen substituents
   provides compelling evidence that the DSSC photovoltage is sensitive to
   k(reg). This study also provides the first direct evidence that
   halogen-bonding interactions between the dye and the electrolyte can
   bolster DSSC performance.}},

   amorphous phases of nickel hydroxide films (NiOx) that renders congruent
   and reproducible redox behavior that enables more standardized
   mechanistic studies. Dynamic oxidative behavior was measured for the
   conditioned films, where the initial peak associated with the oxidation
   of NiOx contains 1.3-2.0 times the charge for that measured in
   subsequent oxidative scans and the corresponding reductive peak. It is
   shown that charge trapping does not fully account for this excess
   charge. The magnitude of excess anodic charge is affected by pH, OH-
   diffusion through the film, and voltammetric scan rates.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to accurately determine the
   concentrations of amplifiable targets makes it a promising platform for
   measuring copy number alterations (CNAs) in genomic biomarkers. However,
   its application to clinical samples, particularly formalin-fixed
   paraffin-embedded specimens, will require strategies to reliably
   determine CNAs in DNA of limited quantity and quality. When applied to
   cancerous tissue, those methods must also account for global genetic
   instability and the associated probability that the abundance(s) of one
   or more chosen reference loci do not represent the average ploidy of
   cells comprising the specimen. Here we present an experimental design
   strategy and associated data analysis tool that enables accurate
   determination of CNAs in a panel of biomarkers using multiplexed ddPCR.
   The method includes strategies to optimize primer and probes design to
   cleanly segregate droplets in the data output from reaction wells
   amplifying multiple independent templates, and to correct for bias from
   artifacts such as DNA fragmentation. We demonstrate how a panel of
   reference loci can be used to determine a stable CNA-neutral benchmark.
   These innovations, when taken together, provide a comprehensive strategy
   that can be used to reliably detect biomarker CNAs in DNA extracted from
   either frozen or FFPE tissue biopsies.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{17-29}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Optimization of forming process of fabric reinforced composites requires
   a multifaceted characterization of the reinforcement material and its
   implementation in customized simulations. This manuscript investigates
   the effect of inclusion of `shear-tension coupling' (interaction) in
   woven fabric models on the ensuing predictions of forming simulations.
   To this end, a constitutive model estimating the shear stiffness as a
   function of axial tension along warp and weft in a typical glass plain
   weave has been selected. The model was implemented into the Abaqus
   numerical package using a customized fabric element, capable of
   simulating the non-orthogonal behaviour of the fabric as well as its
   tension-shear interaction. Subsequently, the model was employed for
   studying forming processes with three different punch geometries
   including hemisphere, double-dome, and tetrahedral shapes. In each case,
   comparisons were made between the model with the effect of shear-tension
   interaction and the conventional model assuming the shear stiffness is
   merely a function of shear angle (i.e., with no interaction). Results
   revealed that although the conventional models could be acceptable in
   predicting the general shear deformation pattern of the fabric (in
   particular in the presence of sufficient blank holder forces), the
   forming models that included the shear-tension interaction had lower
   formation of local wrinkles as well as notably higher residual stresses
   in all simulation cases, especially in critical sharp corners of the
   part and the fabric free regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The flexural behavior of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced
   concrete (UHPFRC) beams reinforced with internal glass fiber-reinforced
   polymer (GFRP) bars was experimentally investigated. For this, large
   sized beams with four different reinforcement ratios (rho = 0.53-1.71\%)
   were fabricated and tested. All test beams exhibited very stiff
   load-deflection response beyond the first cracking point and satisfied
   the crack width criteria of ACI 440.1R and CAN/CSA 5806 at
   serviceability limit state and deformability requirement by CAN/CSA-S6.
   Higher reinforcement ratio resulted in better flexural performances such
   as higher post-cracking stiffness, maximum moment capacity, ductility,
   and deformability. The effective moment of inertia equation from the
   current ACI 440.1R code, which is based on Bischoff's model,
   significantly overestimated the service deflections of UHPFRC beams with
   GFRP bars because of its inappropriate first cracking prediction and
   moment of inertia equation at cracked section. Therefore, alternative
   equation for predicting first cracking moment and moment of inertia of
   cracked section in strain-hardening zone for UHPFRC was suggested, and
   it was verified through comparison with the measured service
   deflections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{531-536}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Artisanal mining (AM) activities are generally seen as a source of
   concern owing to their illegality and the environmental pollution that
   they cause, but in recent years it has been demonstrated that gold
   mining can be performed on a small-scale mining (SSM) in a responsible
   way outside of the artisanal dimension. A previous study by the same
   authors demonstrated how mineral resources and reserves can be managed
   to achieve a sustainable form of SSM, based on the concepts of proving a
   ``minimum reserve{''} and working with ``replication{''} of the
   operation on subsequent small reserves. It was shown that SSM can be
   viable with 1/100 of the reserves necessary to prove the feasibility of
   a large-scale mining business. However, that work made some
   simplifications in terms of value of money over time and taxation.
   The present work continues by undertaking a realistic analysis of
   economic feasibility through a cash flow analysis (CFA) on various
   scenarios of investment strategy for the SSM business, considering the
   ``minimum reserve{''} approach along with the traditional mining
   business strategy. The results show that the ``minimum reserve{''}
   approach is always more attractive from an economic point of view, in
   terms of value of the project, rate of return of investment and payback
   time. Finally, the most suitable profile for investors in the SSM
   business is discussed, and it is shown how small-scale investors and
   large corporations can fit into this approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The paper presents experimental investigations on different methods to
   increase the stiffness of Rounded Dovetail Joints (RDJs). Departing from
   a reference geometry, the specific methods were (i) oversizing the
   dovetail tenon part for a tighter fit; (ii) reinforcement with
   self-tapping screws; (iii) reinforcement with an adhesive layer; and
   (iv) a combination of adhesive layer and self-tapping screws. The
   specimens from the reinforced test series were compared to regular RDJ
   specimens and to beam to joist connections by means of self-tapping
   screws only. It was demonstrated that all methods significantly
   increased the joint stiffness of RDJs. Furthermore, the research showed
   that there is no difference in structural performance between
   hand-routed joints and CNC-routed joints, and that a previously
   suggested design equation for RDJs yields conservative predictions when
   compared to the experimentally obtained 5th percentile values. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Photonic networks form the backbone for data communications. In
   particular, in current and future wireless communication systems,
   photonic networks are becoming increasingly popular for data
   distribution between the central office and the remote antenna units at
   base stations. As wireless-photonic systems become in increasing demand,
   low-cost implementation of such systems will be desirable. This paper
   describes how integrated photonics and electronics, on silicon, can be
   used to design such systems. Various building blocks of such
   silicon-photonics systems are reviewed. The emphasis is on a 60 GHz
   wireless system which could be suitable for the emerging 5th-generation
   (5G) cellular networks. The implementation discussed here uses digital
   baseband optical transmission as opposed to the radio-over-fibre
   approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{378}},
Pages = {{426-434}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Hot embossing was utilized to imprint topographical metallic patterns on
   the surfaces of thermoplastic polymers in order to create
   superhydrophobic and superoleophobic polymeric surfaces. The stainless
   steel (SS) micro/nano structured templates were fabricated using
   femtosecond laser ablation. The SS laser ablated templates were employed
   to imprint micron/submicron periodic structures onto the surface of high
   density polyethylene (HDPE), polylactic acid (PLA), and medical PVC at
   temperatures slightly above their melting points and pressures in the
   range of 3-12 MPa. Results have shown that the water contact angle (CA)
   of imprinted polymers increased to above 160 degrees in the case of PLA
   and HDPE, while their water contact angle hysteresis (CAH) were
   significantly below 10 degrees. In the case of medical-PVC, imprinting
   produced morphologies with high CA and high CAH (petal effect) due to
   the adhesion forces developed at the interface between the hydrophilic
   plasticizer of medical-PVC (TOTM) and water droplets. It is also noted
   that the re-entrant superoleophobic patterns created on HDPE through
   imprinting closely resemble the patterns found on the surface of
   filefish skin that is densely angled microfiber arrays. This bioinspired
   surface is highly capable of repelling both polar (water) and non-polar
   liquids of low surface tension and meets the superoleophobicity
   criteria. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between electromagnetic phase and power flow in
   metamaterials composed of periodic magnetodielectric inclusions is
   investigated. The distribution of Poynting vectors in k space across
   multiple Brillouin zones suggests that backward phase is a result of
   field compression within the inclusions, and that left-handedness can be
   achieved without negative electric or magnetic susceptibility (i.e.,
   without out-of-phase dipole moments). This hypothesis is verified by
   showing that a one-dimensional periodic array of magnetodielectric slabs
   can be designed tomimic the properties of an ideal (homogeneous)
   left-handed medium. Furthermore, using exact fields and without any
   field averaging, it is shown that the structure can be designed such
   that practically all power is carried in the fundamental left-handed
   spectral component. In the limit where the fundamental contains all the
   power, this periodic structure has the same spectral power signature as
   that of a homogeneous left-handed medium. It is shown that this
   congruence does not manifest when the inclusions are purely dielectric,
   nor does it manifest for magnetodielectric inclusions in two or three
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Electromechanical coupling in electroactive polymers (EAPs) has been
   widely applied for actuation and is also being increasingly investigated
   for sensing chemical and mechanical stimuli. EAPs are a unique class of
   materials, with low-moduli high-strain capabilities and the ability to
   conform to surfaces of different shapes. These features make them
   attractive for applications such as wearable sensors and interfacing
   with soft tissues. Here, we review the major types of EAPs and their
   sensing mechanisms. These are divided into two classes depending on the
   main type of charge carrier: ionic EAPs (such as conducting polymers and
   ionic polymer-metal composites) and electronic EAPs (such as dielectric
   elastomers, liquid-crystal polymers and piezoelectric polymers). This
   review is intended to serve as an introduction to the mechanisms of
   these materials and as a first step in material selection for both
   researchers and designers of flexible/bendable devices, biocompatible
   sensors or even robotic tactile sensing units.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the experimental and computational study of droplet
   generation for hydrogel prepolymer solution in oil using a flow-focusing
   device. Effects of different parameters on hydrogel droplet generation
   and droplet sizes in a flow-focusing device were investigated
   experimentally and computationally. First, three dimensional (3D)
   computational simulations were conducted to describe the physics of
   droplet formation in each regime and mechanism of three different
   regimes: squeezing, dripping, and jetting regime of hydrogel were
   investigated. Subsequently, the effects of viscosity, inertia force, and
   surface tension force on droplet generation, and droplet size were
   studied through these experiments. The experiments were carried out
   using different concentration of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel
   (5 wt \% and 8 wt \%) as the dispersed phase and two different
   continuous phase liquids (light mineral oil and hexadecane) with various
   concentrations of surfactant (0 wt \%, 3 wt \%, and 20 wt \%). All
   experimental data was summarized by capillary number of dispersed phases
   and the continuous phases to characterize the different regimes of
   droplet generation and to predict the transition of dripping to a
   jetting regime for GelMA solution in flow-focusing devices. It is shown
   that the transition of dripping to a jetting regime for GelMA happens at
   lower capillary numbers compared to aqueous solutions. Moreover, by
   increasing the viscous force of continuous phase or decreasing the
   interfacial force, the size of GelMA droplets was decreased. By
   controlling these parameters, the droplet sizes can be controlled
   between 30 m and 200 m, which are very suitable for cell encapsulation.

Abstract = {{Addition of CeO2 to a PdO/Al2O3 catalyst, assessed for the oxidation of
   CH4 in the presence of 5\% H2O at various temperatures, reduces the
   inhibition effects of H2O. A simplified kinetic analysis that assumes
   Langmuir adsorption of H2O on the catalyst active sites is used to model
   both the dynamic response and the steady-state CH4 conversion following
   H2O addition to the feed gas and to quantify the effect of CeO2
   addition. The analysis shows that less H2O is adsorbed on the
   2.9Ce/6.5Pd/Al2O3 than the 6.5Pd/A1203 catalyst and that the rate of H2O
   desorption is higher on the Cepromoted catalyst. Both factors result in
   reduced inhibition of CH4 conversion by H2O on the 2.9Ce/6.5Pd/Al2O3
   catalyst compared to the 6.5Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The apparent activation
   energy for CH4 oxidation over the 2.9Ce/6.513d/Al2O3 catalyst (61 11 kJ
   mol(-1)) is shown to be statistically the same over the 6.5Pd/Al2O3 (56
   9 kJ mol(-1)). Catalyst characterization data show minimal changes in
   catalyst properties after reaction, and removal of H2O from the reactant
   feed gas results in partial recovery of the catalyst activity. The data
   are consistent with H2O adsorption on the catalyst/support that may also
   inhibit O exchange with Pd-{*}/PdO site pair (Pd-{*} is an O-vacancy),
   the effect of which is reversible.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of communication technology and the Internet,
   more and more people pay attention to personal privacy. Therefore, the
   research on anonymous communication system is gradually increasing, at
   the same time, the study of anonymous communication systems attack
   techniques are constantly deepened. In a certain sense, the research on
   anonymous communication system, mainly aims at the attack the anonymous
   communication may face and the study of how to defense attack and
   improve the existence of the system. This requires us to classify the
   attack technology, so as to improve the safety of anonymous
   communication system. This paper mainly studies the passive attack
   technology in anonymous communication system. First of all, the paper
   has carried on the simple classifications of the attack technique on the
   anonymous system, which mainly divided into active and passive attacks.
   Secondly, we mainly introduce the passive attack mode. Passive attackers
   only monitor traffic and analyze related information of the sender and
   the receiver in the communication. We mainly introduce statistical
   disclosure attack, timing attack and Predecessor attack in detail.
   Finally, we study the passive attack other simply.}},

   average delay times. The second calibration step used a genetic
   algorithm procedure to calibrate PARAMICS parameters to enhance the
   correlation between simulated and field-measured conflicts. Finally, the
   results obtained from PARAMICS were compared with results obtained from
   VISSIM. The comparison included three aspects: (i) the car-following
   model and safety-related parameters; (ii) the correlation between
   simulated and field-measured conflicts; and (iii) the conflict spatial
   distributions. The results show that the default simulation model
   parameters give poor correlation with the field-measured data, and
   therefore, using simulation models without a proper calibration should
   be avoided. Overall, good correlation between field-measured and
   simulated conflicts was obtained after calibration for both models,
   especially at higher time-to-collision (TTC) values. At TTC threshold of
   1.5 s, PARAMICS overestimates the number of conflicts and VISSIM
   underestimates it. Both models overestimated the number of conflicts at
   TTC threshold of 3.00 s. There were major differences between
   field-measured and simulated conflicts spatial distributions for both
   simulation models. This indicates that despite the good correlation
   obtained from the calibration process, both PARAMICS and VISSIM do not
   capture the actual conflict occurrence mechanism. Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Environmental and operational benefits of green roofs are manifolds;
   however, their main disadvantages are cost and weight. New technology
   enabled the use of plastics to reduce the weight of green roof systems
   to promote their installation. To maximize their potential benefits,
   green roofs can be installed on existing structures. This study
   evaluates the influence of green roofs on the seismic response of 3, 6,
   and 8 storey reinforced concrete ductile moment resisting frames, which
   were designed according to current seismic standards, however, not
   designed for green roofs. For each frame, three different types of roofs
   are considered: gravel flat roof, extensive green roof, and intensive
   green roof. Nonlinear dynamic time history analysis using an ensemble of
   twenty real earthquake records was performed to determine the
   inter-storey drift demand and roof drift demand for each frame.
   Eigenvalue analysis was also performed to determine the impact of green
   roofs weight on the elastic and cracked periods of the structure.
   Results from the analysis demonstrated that intensive and extensive
   green roofs do not affect the seismic performance of reinforced concrete
   frame structures.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its outstanding performance in extending coverage and
   reducing transmit power, wireless relay cooperation is deemed as one of
   the promising techniques to realize green-broadband communication in the
   future. In such relay cooperative systems, optimal power allocation not
   only can prolong the lifetime of users, but also is an effective way to
   reduce radiation in the environment. In this paper, for
   amplify-and-forward-relay cooperative networks, where multiple
   communication pairs share a common relay, we propose a novel power
   allocation scheme, which has considerably lower complexity compared with
   the existing solution schemes. The objective of this paper is to
   minimize sum-source-power consumption under the conditions that the
   transmit power of all nodes in the network is constrained and their
   predetermined target signal-to-noise ratios are satisfied. By providing
   sufficient analytical evidence, we study the optimality, convergence,
   and computational complexity of our proposed scheme. Through numerical
   simulation, we further justify the effectiveness and efficacy of our
   scheme compared with the existing works.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Commercially available cell strain tools, such as pneumatically actuated
   elastomer substrates, require special culture plates, pumps, and
   incubator setups. In this work, we present a magnetically actuated
   cellular strain assessment tool (MACSAT) that can be implemented using
   off-the-shelf components and conventional incubators. We determine the
   strain field on the MACSAT elastomer substrate using numerical models
   and experimental measurements and show that a specific region of the
   elastomer substrate undergoes a quasi-uniaxial 2D stretch, and that
   cells confined to this region of the MACSAT elastomer substrate undergo
   tensile, compressive, or zero axial strain depending on their angle of
   orientation. Using the MACSAT to apply cyclic strain on endothelial
   cells, we demonstrate that actin filaments within the cells reorient
   away from the stretching direction, towards the directions of minimum
   axial strain. We show that the final actin orientation angles in
   strained cells are spread over a region of compressive axial strain,
   confirming previous findings on the existence of a varied pre-tension in
   the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. We also demonstrate that
   strained cells exhibit distinctly different values of actin alignment
   coherency compared to unstrained cells and therefore propose that this
   parameter, i.e., the coherency of actin alignment, can be used as a new
   readout to determine the occurrence/extent of actin alignment in cell
   strain experiments. The tools and methods demonstrated in this study are
   simple and accessible and can be easily replicated by other researchers
   to study the strain response of other adherent cells. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{Osteoporosis greatly impairs bone fracture restoration with bone cement
   because the accelerated resorption decreases the osseointegration
   between bone and implants. In this study, we designed a new drug
   delivery system based on the third generation bisphosphonate risedronate
   (RA) and the osteogenic calcium phosphate silicate cement (CPSC). The
   impact of RA on CPSC's material properties and microstructure was
   evaluated by different characterization methods (mu CT, XRD, FTIR, SEM
   and gas sorption). In addition, in vitro biocompatibility of RA-added
   CPSC was evaluated (MTT assay, flow cytometry, real-time PCR). In an in
   vivo study of osteoporotic rabbits, osteoporosis-and bone
   resorption-related biomarkers were measured over time (ELISA) and local
   osteogenic and anti-osteoporotic effects investigated (x-ray, CT,
   histology, PCR arrays). RA decreased the setting rate and compressive
   strength of CPSC by impeding the hydration of calcium silicate. The
   overall porosity of CPSC was also decreased with RA. The RA-added CPSC
   was biocompatible and improved osteoblast proliferation and
   differentiation. The slow release of RA from CPSC reduced the prevalence
   of osteoporosis in rabbits and improved peri-implant bone formation and
   osseointegration. In conclusion, RA-containing CPSC demonstrates its
   potentials to improve fractural restoration under osteoporotic
   conditions and should be further engineered to increase its
   effectiveness in fractural restoration.}},

Abstract = {{IA is a promising solution for the interference management of future
   wireless networks. On the other hand, physical layer security is a
   critical issue of wireless communications in the presence of
   adversaries. Recently, these two important fields tend to be researched
   closely together. In this article, some of the key results are
   summarized, and two primary attacks at the physical layer of IA-based
   networks, adversarial jamming and eavesdropping, are further studied. We
   first propose an anti-jamming scheme by aligning the jamming signal
   together with interference among users cooperatively when an adversarial
   jammer exists. Then an AN scheme is proposed, in which the external
   eavesdropping is disrupted by AN without introducing any additional
   interference to the legitimate network. To further analyze the potential
   threat, a collusive eavesdropping scheme by some hostile IA users in the
   network is also proposed. Simulation results are presented to show the
   effectiveness of these schemes. Finally, some future challenges are also
   summarized.}},

Abstract = {{We report the facile preparation of gels from the hydrothermal treatment
   of suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The properties of the
   hydrogels have been investigated by rheology, electron microscopy, and
   spectroscopy with respect to variation in the temperature, time, and CNC
   concentration used in preparation. Desulfation of the CNCs at high
   temperature appears to be responsible for the gelation of the CNCs,
   giving highly porous networks. The viscosity and storage modulus of the
   gels was shown to increase when samples were prepared at higher
   treatment temperature. Considering the wide natural abundance and
   biocompatibility of CNCs, this simple, green approach to CNC-based
   hydrogels is attractive for producing materials that can be used in drug
   delivery, insulation, and as tissue scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{In interference alignment (IA)-based networks, interferences are
   constrained into certain subspaces at the unintended receivers, and the
   desired signal can be recovered free of interference. Due to the
   superposition of signals from legitimate users at the eavesdropper, the
   IA-based network seems to be more secure than conventional wireless
   networks. Nevertheless, when adequate antennas are equipped, the
   legitimate information can still be eavesdropped. In this paper, we
   analyze the performance of the external eavesdropper, and propose two
   anti-eavesdropping schemes for IA-based networks. When the channel state
   information (CSI) of eavesdropper is available, zero-forcing scheme can
   be utilized, in which the transmitted signals are zero-forced at the
   eavesdropper through the precoding of transmitters in IA-based networks.
   Furthermore, a more generalized artificial noise (AN) scheme is proposed
   for IA-based networks without the knowledge of eavesdropper's CSI. In
   this scheme, a single-stream AN is generated by each user, which will
   disrupt the eavesdropping without introducing any additional
   interference to the legitimate transmission of IA-based networks. In
   addition, the feasibility conditions, transmission rate, and
   eavesdropping rate are analyzed in detail, and an iterative algorithm to
   achieve the scheme is also designed. Extensive simulation results are
   provided to verify our analysis results and show the effectiveness of
   the proposed anti-eavesdropping schemes for IA-based networks.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the service demand for rich multimedia over mobile
   networks has continually been soaring at a tremendous pace. To solve the
   critical problem of mobile traffic explosion, substantial efforts have
   been made by researchers to try to offload mobile traffic from
   infrastructured cellular links to direct short-range communications
   locally among nearby users. In this article, we discuss the potential of
   combining users' online and offline social impacts to exploit D2D
   opportunistic sharing for offloading mobile traffic. We propose a
   tag-assisted social-aware D2D sharing framework, TASA, with
   corresponding optimization models, architecture design, and
   communication protocols. Through extensive simulations based on real
   data traces, we demonstrate that TASA can offload up to 78.9 percent of
   mobile traffic effectively.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a method for releasing coated and uncoated 100-nm gold films
   from a 5-nm chromium-coated glass substrate. The method is rapid at room
   temperature within a nontoxic solution of sodium phosphate or sodium
   hydroxide. Etching processes using hydroxide successfully etch the
   chromium layer without affecting a ZnO coating layer deposited on the
   gold film. Etching using sodium phosphate at neutral pH causes some
   surface damage to the ZnO surface while leaving the bulk of the film
   intact. Other anions tested include nitrates and chlorides, both
   demonstrating poor etching selectivity, damaging the gold as well as the
   chromium layers. A copper counter electrode is used to collect the
   chromium from the solution, minimizing chromium persistence in the
   etching solution and any contamination of the ZnO surface. This single
   step acid-free process can be applied to a variety of materials and
   structures formed on gold, where insulating materials and many oxides do
   not require any special protection from the etching solution. An
   uncoated or polyimide coated 2 cm x 1.5 cm film can be released in under
   1 h, while ZnO-coated films require up to 7 h to to release films 1 cm x
   1 cm in size. {[}2015-0331]}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we give formulas for the swimming of simplified

   By way of these formulas we calculate the swimming velocity due to small
   amplitude deformations on the simplest of these bodies, a
   two-dimensional sheet, to explore general conditions on the swimming
   gait under which the sheet may move faster, or slower, in a viscoelastic
   fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid. We show that in general, for small
   amplitude deformations, a speed increase can only be realized by
   multiple deformation modes in contrast to slip flows. Additionally, we
   show that a change in swimming speed is directly due to a change in
   thrust generated by the swimmer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigate the mechanisms responsible for nano-void growth in single
   crystal magnesium under dynamic hydrostatic tensile stress. A key
   conclusion derived from our study is that there is no secondary strain
   hardening near the nano-void. This behavior, which is in remarkable
   contrast to face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic materials,
   greatly limits the peak stress and explains the relatively lower spall
   strength of magnesium. The lack of secondary strain hardening is due to
   the fact that pyramidal dislocations do not interact with basal or
   prismatic dislocations. Our analysis also shows that for loads applied
   at moderate strain rates ((epsilon) over dot <= 10(6) s(-1)) the peak
   stress, dislocation velocity and temperature distribution converge
   asymptotically. However at very high strain rates ((epsilon) over dot >=
   10(8) s(-1)), there is a sharp transition in these quantities.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of stormwater via sorption has the potential to remove both
   colloidal and dissolved pollutants. Previous research shows that
   activated carbon produced from sewage sludge is very efficient in
   sorbing hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs), frequently detected in
   stormwater. The aim of this research was to determine whether the
   presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has a negative effect on the
   adsorption of HOCs onto sludge-based activated carbon (SBAC) in batch
   adsorption tests. Batch adsorption tests were used to investigate the
   influence of two types of DOM - soil organic matter and humic acid (HA)
   technical standard - on the sorption of HOCs onto SBAC, and whether
   preloading adsorbent and adsorbates with DOM affects HOC sorption. The
   results indicate that soil DOM and HAs do not have a significant
   negative effect on the adsorption of HOCs under tested experimental
   conditions, except for a highly hydrophobic compound. In addition,
   preloading SBAC or HOCs with DOM did not lead to lower adsorption of
   HOCs. Batch adsorption tests appear to be inefficient for investigating
   DOM effects on HOC adsorption, as saturating the carbon is difficult
   because of high SBAC adsorption capacity and low HOC solubility, so that
   limited competition occurs on the sorbent.}},

Abstract = {{It is critical to design energy-efficient communication technologies for
   wireless nanosensor networks (WNSNs) as nanosensors are highly
   energy-constrained. This paper focuses on WNSNs adopting the ON-OFF
   keying (OOK) modulator. So far, some existing low-weight (LW) codes with
   low average codeword weight (ACW) map source symbols into different
   codewords with fewer high bits so as to greatly reduce the transmission
   energy at the transmitter. However, the transmission energy reduction is
   achieved at the price of large reception energy at the receiver as the
   codeword lengths of LW codes are large, incurring their ineffectiveness
   in most scenarios. To remedy the problem, we design the fixed-length

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the overstrength, ductility, and response
   modification factors for low to mid-rise buckling restrained braced
   frames (BRBFs) designed as per the 2010 National Building Code of

   history analyses are performed to assess the seismic performance of
   four-, six-, and eight-story BRBFs. Different bracing configurations,
   including chevron (inverted-V) and split-X braces, are considered for
   the building frames with varied frame span lengths of 6m and 8m. The
   results confirm that the prescribed design values for overstrength and
   ductility factors provide reasonable estimations of the lower bound for
   these factors. The response modification factor obtained in this study
   ranged from 4.8 to 6 for different frames. The results also indicate
   that the response modification factor decreases with the increase of
   story height and span length. Moreover, bracing configurations may
   slightly affect the response modification factor for BRBFs.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based design (PBD) was first introduced in Canadian Highway
   Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) in 2014. Performance-based design is the
   design that meets multiple performance criteria under different
   earthquake hazards. To investigate the impact of changes in CHBDC 2014,
   a four-span concrete highway bridge is designed and evaluated using
   force-based design (FBD) and PBD methods as per CHBDC 2014, and FBD
   method as per CHBDC 2006. By incorporating soil-structure interaction
   (using p-y curves) nonlinear pushover and dynamic time history analyses
   are conducted to assess the seismic performance of these bridges.
   Maximum strains of concrete and reinforcing steel are compared among the
   three designs to determine their performance levels. It is concluded
   that PBD (CHBDC 2014) is highly conservative compared to FBD (for both
   CHBDC 2014 and 2006). For the three-level PBD approach, the design is
   governed by the criterion of reinforcing steel not yielding under the
   design earthquake (with 475 years return period).}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of the wrist bones in CT images has been frequently used in
   different clinical applications including arthritis evaluation, bone age
   assessment and image-guided interventions. The major challenges include
   non-uniformity and spongy textures of the bone tissue as well as narrow
   inter-bone spaces. In this work, we propose an automatic wrist bone
   segmentation technique for CT images based on a statistical model that
   captures the shape and pose variations of the wrist joint across 60
   example wrists at nine different wrist positions. To establish the
   correspondences across the training shapes at neutral positions, the
   wrist bone surfaces are jointly aligned using a group-wise registration
   framework based on a Gaussian Mixture Model. Principal component
   analysis is then used to determine the major modes of shape variations.
   The variations in poses not only across the population but also across
   different wrist positions are incorporated in two pose models. An
   intra-subject pose model is developed by utilizing the similarity
   transforms at all wrist positions across the population. Further, an
   inter-subject pose model is used to model the pose variations across
   different wrist positions. For segmentation of the wrist bones in CT
   images, the developed model is registered to the edge point cloud
   extracted from the CT volume through an expectation maximization based
   probabilistic approach. Residual registration errors are corrected by
   application of a non-rigid registration technique. We validate the
   proposed segmentation method by registering the wrist model to a total
   of 66 unseen CT volumes of average voxel size of 0.38 mm. We report a
   mean surface distance error of 0.33 mm and a mean Jaccard index of 0.86.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of using a centrifugal-gravity concentrator to reject
   Mg-bearing minerals and minimize metal losses in the flotation of base
   metals was evaluated. Sample characterization, batch scoping tests,

   flotation tailings stream. Batch tests revealed that the Mg grade
   decreased dramatically in the concentrate products. Pilot-scale testing
   of a continuous centrifugal concentrator (Knelson CVD6) on the flotation
   tailings revealed that a concentrate with a low mass yield, low Mg
   content, and high Ni upgrade ratio could be achieved. Under optimum
   conditions, a concentrate at 6.7\% mass yield was obtained with 0.85\%
   Ni grade at 12.9\% Ni recovery and with a low Mg distribution (1.7\%).
   Size partition curves demonstrated that the CVD also operated as a size
   classifier, enhancing the rejection of talc fines. Overall, the CVD was
   capable of rejecting Mg-bearing minerals. Moreover, an opportunity
   exists for the novel use of centrifugal-gravity concentration for

Abstract = {{Forward- and back-projection operations are the main computational
   burden in iterative image reconstruction in computed tomography. In
   addition, their implementation has to be accurate to ensure stable
   convergence to a high-quality image. This paper reviews and compares
   some of the variations in the implementation of these operations in
   cone-beam computed tomography. We compare four algorithms for computing
   the system matrix, including a distance-driven algorithm, an algorithm
   based on cubic basis functions, another based on spherically symmetric
   basis functions, and a voxel-driven algorithm. The focus of our study is
   on understanding how the choice of the implementation of the system
   matrix will influence the performance of iterative image reconstruction
   algorithms, including such factors as the noise strength and spatial
   resolution in the reconstructed image. Our experiments with simulated
   and real cone-beam data reveal the significance of the speed-accuracy
   trade-off in the implementation of the system matrix. Our results
   suggest that fast convergence of iterative image reconstruction methods
   requires accurate implementation of forward- and back-projection
   operations, involving a direct estimation of the convolution of the
   footprint of the voxel basis function with the surface of the detectors.
   The required accuracy decreases by increasing the resolution of the
   projection measurements beyond the resolution of the reconstructed
   image. Moreover, reconstruction of low-contrast objects needs more
   accurate implementation of these operations. Our results also show that,
   compared with regularized reconstruction methods, the behavior of
   iterative reconstruction algorithms that do not use a proper
   regularization is influenced more significantly by the implementation of
   the forward- and back-projection operations.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies on polylactide (PLA)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)
   biodegradable blends revealed enhanced nucleation of PLA. The mechanism
   by which this enhancement of nuclei density occurs attracted significant
   interest. In this study, precursors' transportation from PCL into PLA
   phase is invoked in order to interpret the experimental findings related
   to phase separation and crystallization. This mechanism is supported by
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy
   (POM). The DSC data revealed that PCL crystallinity within the blends is
   decreased with PLA content. In addition, POM data showed more nuclei
   within PLA as the PCL weight fraction is increased. The linear
   viscoelastic properties of these blends in the vicinity of the phase
   separation and cold crystallization boundary are examined. It is shown
   that the combination of POM and rheometry allows determining the phase
   diagram of the blend and identifying changes occurring due to phase
   separation and crystallization. Thus, the complete phase diagram of such
   systems can be fully determined, essential in process design and
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission (AE) signal generated from artificial defects in
   rolling element bearings are investigated using experimental
   measurements in this paper. Rolling element bearings are crucial parts
   of many machines and there has been an increasing demand to find
   effective and reliable health monitoring technique and advanced signal
   processing to detect and diagnose the size and location of incipient
   defects. Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, comprises
   four main stages which are, statistical analysis, faults diagnostics,
   defect size calculation, and prognostics. In this paper, the effect of
   defect size, operating speed, and loading conditions on statistical
   parameters of AE signals, using design of experiment method, have been
   investigated to select the most sensitive parameters for diagnosing
   incipient faults and defect growth on rolling element bearings.}},

Abstract = {{In seismically active regions, the use of timber-reinforced concrete
   (RC) hybrid construction can overcome the structural limitations that
   occur with timber construction. A series of shake table tests were
   carried out on RC-timber hybrid systems that used two diaphragms: glulam
   + plywood system (CN75 @ 50 mm nail spacing) and laminated wood + RC
   slab system. To develop robust analytical models, however, understanding
   the different components is crucial. In this paper, a series of in-plane
   monotonic and reverse-cyclic tests were undertaken on two diaphragm
   systems and their connections. Salient features of each diaphragm(i.e.
   stiffness, ductility, and energy dissipation) were computed from the
   monotonic loading test results. With the test results reported,
   analytical and numerical models can be developed. (C) 2016 The

Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{153-164}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) on
   the bond strength of concrete and deformed steel bars. Here, 144
   push-out tests were performed. Four RCA replacement percentages (i.e.
   0\%, 30\%, 40\%, and 50\%) and three sizes of deformed steel bars (i.e.
   10M, 15M, and 20M) were used. Moreover, the effect of embedment length
   and concrete cover to bar diameter ratio on the bond strength was
   considered. It was found that under constant mix proportions, an
   increase in the bar size and the embedment length to bar diameter ratio
   lead to a reduction in the bond strength. Like regular concrete, larger
   concrete cover helps improve the bond behaviour. On an average,
   specimens made of partial RCA had bond strengths similar to regular
   concrete. In some cases, 30\% replacement of natural aggregate by RCA
   illustrated the best results among all the mixes. A new formula for
   calculating the bond strength is proposed based on the test results.

Title = {{Exploiting the malleability of gold for placer concentrate extraction

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{38-40}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A novel, chemical-free method for extracting gold from gravity middlings
   is described. This method exploits the differences in relative
   malleability, rather than density, of gold and waste products by
   submitting concentrates to grinding in a rod mill. The grind products
   are separated through a sieve, where flattened gold particles are
   captured on the oversize while brittle waste reports to the fines. This
   paper presents the results of a field tour of this method throughout the
   Yukon placer gold fields, where gold was extracted from difficult to
   process stockpiled middlings. Recoveries were often well over 90\%, with
   nearly pure raw gold effectively separated after only minutes of
   grinding in a batch mill. Gold remaining in the fine and evenly
   classified loss material is now more amenable to gravity processing than
   similarly sized unground concentrate. Further lab testing indicated that
   gold recoveries were most sensitive to the mill charge amount and total
   grind time. While these results are based on placer properties, the
   method has potential in any mill involving a gravity recovery circuit.

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{124-134}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recently, reliability analysis has been advocated as an effective
   approach to account for uncertainty in the geometric design process and
   to evaluate the risk associated with a particular design. In this
   approach, a risk measure (e.g. probability of noncompliance) is
   calculated to represent the probability that a specific design would not
   meet standard requirements. The majority of previous applications of
   reliability analysis in geometric design focused on evaluating the
   probability of noncompliance for only one mode of noncompliance such as
   insufficient sight distance. However, in many design situations, more
   than one mode of noncompliance may be present (e.g. insufficient sight
   distance and vehicle skidding at horizontal curves). In these
   situations, utilizing a multi-mode reliability approach that considers
   more than one failure (noncompliance) mode is required. The main
   objective of this paper is to demonstrate the application of multi-mode
   (system) reliability analysis to the design of horizontal curves. The
   process is demonstrated by a case study of Sea-to-Sky Highway located
   between Vancouver and Whistler, in southern British Columbia, Canada.
   Two noncompliance modes were considered: insufficient sight distance and
   vehicle skidding. The results show the importance of accounting for
   several noncompliance modes in the reliability model. The system
   reliability concept could be used in future studies to calibrate the
   design of various design elements in order to achieve consistent safety
   levels based on all possible modes of noncompliance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-speed machine tools have parts with both stationary and rotating
   dynamics. While spindle housing, column, and table have stationary
   dynamics, rotating parts may have both symmetric (i.e., spindle shaft
   and tool holder) and asymmetric dynamics (i.e., two-fluted end mill) due
   to uneven geometry in two principal directions. This paper presents a
   stability model of dynamic milling operations with combined stationary
   and rotating dynamics. The stationary modes are superposed to two
   orthogonal directions in rotating frame by considering the time-and
   speed-dependent, periodic dynamic milling system. The stability of the
   system is solved in both frequency and semidiscrete time domain. It is
   shown that the stability pockets differ significantly when the rotating
   dynamics of the asymmetric tools are considered. The proposed stability
   model has been experimentally validated in high-speed milling of an
   aluminum alloy with a two-fluted, asymmetric helical end mill.}},

Abstract = {{The governing linear equations of transverse motion of a spinning disk
   with a splined inner radius and constrained from lateral motion by guide
   pads are derived. The disk is driven by a matching spline arbor that
   offers no restraint to the disk in the lateral direction. Rigid body
   translational and tilting degrees-of-freedom are included in the
   analysis of total motion of the spinning disk. The disk is subjected to
   lateral constraints and loads. Also considered are applied conservative
   in-plane edge loads at the outer and inner boundaries. The numerical
   solution of these equations is used to investigate the effect of the
   loads and constraints on the natural frequencies, critical speeds, and
   stability of a spinning disk. The sensitivity of eigenvalues of spline
   spinning disk to the in-plane edge loads is analyzed by taking the
   derivative of the spinning disk's eigenvalues with respect to the loads.
   An expression for the energy induced in the spinning disk by the
   in-plane loads, and their interaction at the inner radius, is derived by
   computation of the rate of work done by the lateral component of the
   edge loads. Experimental idling and cutting tests for a guided spline
   saw are conducted at the critical speed, super critical speeds, and at
   the flutter instability speed. The cutting results at different speeds
   are compared to show that the idling results of a guided spline disk can
   be used to predict stable operation speeds of the system during cutting.}},

Abstract = {{Three different approaches for considering the effect of Mn on the
   austenite-ferrite interface migration in an Fe-0.1C-0.5Mn alloy have
   been coupled with a phase field model (PFM). In the first approach
   (PFM-I), only long-range C diffusion is considered while Mn is assumed
   to be immobile during the phase transformations. Both long-range C and
   Mn diffusions are considered in the second approach (PFM-II). In the
   third approach (PFM-III), long-range C diffusion is considered in
   combination with the Gibbs energy dissipation due to Mn diffusion inside
   the interface instead of solving for long-range diffusion of Mn. The
   three PFM approaches are first benchmarked with isothermal
   austenite-to-ferrite transformation at 1058.15 K (785 A degrees C)
   before considering cyclic phase transformations. It is found that PFM-II
   can predict the stagnant stage and growth retardation experimentally
   observed during cycling transformations, whereas PFM-III can only
   replicate the stagnant stage but not the growth retardation and PFM-I
   predicts neither the stagnant stage nor the growth retardation. The
   results of this study suggest a significant role of Mn redistribution
   near the interface on reducing transformation rates, which should,
   therefore, be considered in future simulations of austenite-ferrite
   transformations in steels, particularly at temperatures in the
   intercritical range and above.}},

Abstract = {{Hot tearing susceptibility is commonly assessed using a pressure drop
   equation in the mushy zone that includes the effects of both tensile
   deformation perpendicular to the thermal gradient as well as shrinkage
   feeding. In this study, a Pore Fraction hot tearing model, recently
   developed by Monroe and Beckermann (JOM 66:1439-1445, 2014), is extended
   to additionally include the effect of strain rate parallel to the
   thermal gradient. The deformation and shrinkage pore fractions are
   obtained on the basis of the dimensionless Niyama criterion and a
   scaling variable method. First, the model is applied to the binary Al-Cu
   system under conditions of directional solidification. It is shown that
   for the same Niyama criterion, a decrease in the cooling rate increases
   both the deformation and shrinkage pore fractions because of an increase
   in the time spent in the brittle temperature region. Second, the model
   is applied to the industrial aluminum alloy AA5182 as part of a finite
   element simulation of the Direct Chill (DC) casting process. It is shown
   that an increase in the casting speed during DC casting increases the
   deformation and shrinkage pore fractions, causing the maximum point of
   pore fraction to move towards the base of the casting. These results
   demonstrate that including the strain rate parallel to the thermal
   gradient significantly improves the predictive quality of hot tearing
   criteria based on the pressure drop equation.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks, beacons are always treated as
   infrastructures for localization. After beacons are deployed, non-beacon
   nodes can be located by simple schemes such as multilateration and
   multidimensional scaling (MDS). Deploying as many beacons as needed is
   an efficient way to improve localization accuracy where a global
   positioning system does not work well or a higher location accuracy is
   required. With more beacons to be deployed, the configuration of
   beacons' positions will have to be done manually. Therefore position
   auto-configuration using measured distances between these beacons can
   save a lot of efforts for the deployment. One challenge of this
   auto-configuration is that the positions should be uniquely determined
   based on the measured distances. In graph theory, it is a problem of
   unique realization in which the positions of vertices are determined by
   edges between them. Addressing this problem is one major aspect of this
   paper. To determine whether the topology of a network is a unique
   realization, this paper proposes a novel category of topology named
   Uniquely Determined Topology, with which edges in a d-dimensional space
   can be reduced from d \_ 1 to d in each extension, which is less strict
   and more suitable for beacon deployment. The other aspect of this paper
   is to improve localization accuracy of the deployed beacons. In MDS and
   curvilinear component analysis, a shortest-path algorithm is adopted to
   approximately reconstruct the distance matrix between each two nodes,
   and our proposed Uniquely Determined Topology has a feature that a
   distance calculation model can be adopted to replace the shortest-path
   algorithm, therefore that the local distance matrix can be reconstructed
   more accurately. Theoretical analysis shows that it has a low
   computational complexity to determine whether a deployment is a Uniquely
   Determined Topology. Simulations show the advantages of the improved
   localization scheme, in that they do not depend on the connectivity
   level of the networks, and they can provide accurate localization when
   the estimation accuracy of distances is high.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effect of silicate content on the mechanical and
   durability-related properties of metakaolin (MK) and

   reference mortar based on the alkaline activated MK was compared to
   60/40 MK/BFS mortars containing different SiO2 Na2O molar ratios in the
   activator. The properties assessed were compressive strength, porosity
   (water saturation), porosity and pore size distribution by Mercury
   Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) and water capillary sorption. The
   microstructure was assessed using SEM and x-ray computerized
   micro-tomography (mu-CT). Results show that the addition of BFS
   significantly alters the microstructure of alkali-activated mortars,
   promoting a reduction of porosity and capillary sorption. In addition,
   an optimum SiO2/Na2O molar ratio in the activator is required to produce
   better durability mortars, which however do not necessarily present the
   highest mechanical strength. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The controller design for bilateral teleoperation systems involves a
   delicate trade-off between performance and stability. To achieve high
   performance, high order robust controllers may not be feasible for
   real-time implementation because of hardware and computational
   limitations. The main purpose of this paper is to achieve stability and
   transparency in the presence of time delay in communication channel as
   well as model uncertainty. To address these problems, a novel robust
   fixed-structure controller is proposed for uncertain bilateral
   teleoperation systems. Here, the traditional conventional
   Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is employed to achieve
   the requirements. The simplicity and straightforward design are the
   significant advantageous of the proposed method. Robust stability
   analysis of the proposed technique is also provided. Results demonstrate
   that the structure is effective in providing stability and transparency
   in teleoperation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated corrosion of candidate alloys was induced by metal
   chlorides/sulfates at 500 A degrees C. Results suggest that the
   corrosivity of the studied metal chlorides increases in the order CaCl2
   < NaCl < KCl < ZnCl2 < PbCl2 < FeCl2. Mechanisms to explain the
   different impacts of chlorides were proposed. It is believed that
   materials exposed to chloride salts corrode through vicious cycles, in
   which a shorter path of the cycle leads to a higher corrosion rate.
   Experimental results confirmed that FeCl2 with the shortest path of the
   corresponding vicious cycle has the highest corrosion rate. It is also
   confirmed that the sulfates of Zn and Pb are less corrosive than their
   chlorides for the alloys tested. A kinetic study on the hot corrosion of
   T22, Esshete 1250 and Sanicro 28 was carried out under simulated
   waste-to-energy (WTE) ashes at 500 A degrees C for 1000 h. Results from
   the kinetic study show that T22, Esshete 1250, and Sanicro 28 exhibited
   comparable performance for short-term exposure; however, the degradation
   thickness presented a clear trend after the 1000-h exposures in terms of
   decreasing resistance to corrosion: T22 > Esshete 1250 > Sanicro 28. EDX
   maps confirmed the role of Ni/Cr for slowing the corrosion kinetics of
   these three alloys.}},

Title = {{The thermal decomposition of uranous sulfate hydrates}},
Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{130-136}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Uranous sulfate x-hydrate will thermally decompose into uranium oxide at
   high temperature, releasing SO2 gas that can be recovered as sulfuric
   acid. The recovered acid can be recycled back to the prior
   hydrometallurgical crystallization step, thus offsetting the net acid
   consumption of the process while at the same time producing a more
   readily marketable oxide product. A thorough understanding of the
   thermal decomposition pathways of the various uranous sulfate x-hydrates
   is critical to the proper design of such a calcining process. The
   thermal decomposition pathways of uranous sulfate tetra-, hexa-, and
   octahydrate, including decomposition temperatures and intermediary
   products, were determined theoretically using thermodynamic data, and
   then verified experimentally using thermogravimetric analysis. All three
   hydrates were found to proceed through similar stages of decomposition:
   multi-Step water loss, oxidation to uranyl sulfate, and finally
   decomposition to U2O8. These thermal events were observed to occur at
   markedly different temperatures for each of the hydrates, suggesting
   that differences in structural arrangement play a role in thermal
   stability. A decomposition mechanism is proposed based on theoretical
   and experimental data, and an explanation for the different behaviours
   of the three hydrates based on structural differences is postulated. (C)

Abstract = {{The novel ``travelling fluidized bed{''} (TFB), operated under identical
   conditions, was deployed to compare alternate experimental measurement
   techniques for the investigation of solid motion in gas-fluidized beds
   operating in the square-nosed slugging regime. Measurements of particle
   velocity obtained by radioactive particle tracking (RPT - non-invasive
   at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal), positron emission particle
   tracking (PEPT non-invasive at University of Birmingham), optical fibre
   probes (invasive at UBC) and borescopic high speed particle image
   velocimetry (invasive at PSRI) are compared for sand particles of mean
   diameter of 292 mu M. Significant differences between the time-average
   radial profiles of particle velocity are observed in many cases. The
   results provide valuable insights into the merits and challenges of
   advanced particle velocity measurement techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present work describes an abiotic energy harvesting strategy from
   electrocatalytic glucose oxidation based on bimetallic FePt
   nanoparticles (NPs) with a unique onset oxidation potential of -0.63 V
   vs. Ag/AgCl and a maximum current density of 3.7 mA cm(-2) at the

   proportion and particle size on the electrocatalytic activity is
   investigated and it is found that the small size of Fe15Pt85 have the
   highest activity toward glucose oxidation. For the proposed abiotic
   system the cathode material is constructed from nitrogen doped graphene
   decorated with Pt NPs. The anode material is prepared via a simple
   one-step co-precipitation method and the cathode material was
   synthesized through a one-pot electrochemical synthesis route. The
   morphology, crystal structure and chemical composition of prepared
   nanostructure materials are characterized by various techniques. Based
   on the polarization profile and power density plot the designed glucose
   biofuel cell has an open-circuit potential of 0.64 V and provides a
   maximum power density of 95 mu W cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.44 V.

Abstract = {{High-performance buck converters are often required in modern power
   electronic applications. An augmented buck converter (a main buck
   converter with augmentation circuits) can achieve fast transient
   recovery and small output voltage deviation. Compared with other
   augmentation circuits, a resonant augmentation circuit offers potential
   electromagnetic interference reduction due to the relatively low di/dt
   value and compacts the circuit through a reduced inductance for
   resonance. In this paper, the performance analysis of an augmented buck
   converter constructed with the resonant circuit are described in detail
   in terms of voltage-deviation band and power loss. A circuit design and
   control principle is also proposed for achieving the required voltage
   deviation for a given transient-detection delay. A 12-to-5-V converter
   prototype is built to verify the analysis and effectiveness of the
   proposed methodology. It is demonstrated that the voltage deviation is
   reduced from 360 to 200 mV using the proposed resonant augmentation
   circuits and control scheme. The efficiency study shows that the power
   loss varies from 0.02 to 0.72W, when the repetition frequency of
   5-to-10-A transients changes from 100 to 5 kHz.}},

Title = {{A new diagnostic when determining the activation energy by the advanced
   isoconversional method}},
Journal = {{THERMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{636}},
Pages = {{85-93}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{The Advanced Isoconversional (AIC) method involves minimization of a
   function which uses conversion data at a minimum of three heating rates
   to determine an activation energy (E-a) at different values of
   conversion (alpha). Reactions that can be described by a single model
   give an E-a which is independent of alpha, while reactions which are
   described by more than one model give an E-a which varies with alpha.
   Shifts in the conversion curves due to error can lead to E-a vs. alpha
   trends which falsely indicate, or mask, true multi-model kinetics. It
   was found that the minimum value obtained during optimization of what we
   call the `Optimization Indicator' (Omega) can indicate whether trends in
   E-a vs. alpha are likely to be error-derived in the case of single-model
   reactions or artifacts in the case of multi-model reactions. E-a and
   Omega for the calcination of CaCO3 are used to demonstrate the
   experimental application of this new diagnostic. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Instrumented spherical indentation has been used to extract information
   on the deformation behaviour of (0001) oriented grains in commercial
   purity magnesium. Reproducible discontinuities were found in the loading
   and the unloading curves and these have been interpreted as the
   nucleation and growth of \{10 (1) over bar2) extension twins during
   loading and their subsequent retreat during unloading. Detailed
   three-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction-based orientation
   microscopy (3D-EBSD) revealed that the presence of residual deformation
   twins depended on the depth of the indent. Analysis of residual
   geometrically necessary dislocation density using the EBSD data showed
   that residual basal < a > dislocations were dominant in the deformation
   zone. The crystallographic misorientation observed below the indent can
   be rationalized by the presence of these basal < a > dislocations and
   this is shown to be consistent with crystal plasticity finite element
   method calculations. Finally, a schematic view of the different stages
   of deformation during loading and unloading is proposed to rationalize
   the experimental observations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a thin porous layer sandwiched between
   a bipolar plate (BPP) and a catalyst coated membrane in a fuel cell.
   Besides providing passage for water and gas transport from and to the
   catalyst layer, it is responsible for electron and heat transfer from
   and to the BPP. In this paper, a method has been developed to measure
   the GDL bulk thermal conductivity and the contact resistance at the
   GDL/BPP interface under inhomogeneous compression occurring in an actual
   fuel cell assembly. Toray carbon paper GDL TGP-H-060 was tested under a
   range of compression pressure of 0.34 to 1.71 MPa. The results showed
   that the thermal contact resistance decreases non -linearly (from 3.8 x
   10(-4) to 1.17 x 10(-4) Km(2) W-1) with increasing pressure due to
   increase in microscopic contact area between the GDL and BPP; while the
   effective bulk thermal conductivity increases (from 0.56 to 1.42 Wm(-1)
   K-1) with increasing the compression pressure. The thermal contact
   resistance was found to be greater (by a factor of 1.6-2.8) than the
   effective bulk thermal resistance for all compression pressure ranges
   applied here. This measurement technique can be used to identify optimum
   GDL based on minimum bulk and contact resistances measured under
   inhomogeneous compression. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a measurement technique developed for the
   determination of the effective electrical bulk resistance of the gas
   diffusion layer (GDL) and the contact resistance distribution at the
   interface of the GDL and the bipolar plate (BPP). The novelty of this
   study is the measurement and separation of the bulk and contact
   resistance under inhomogeneous compression, occurring in an actual fuel
   cell assembly due to the presence of the channels and ribs on the
   bipolar plates. The measurement of the electrical contact resistance,
   contributing to nearly two-third of the ohmic losses in the fuel cell
   assembly, shows a non-linear distribution along the GDL/BPP interface.
   The effective bulk resistance of the GDL under inhomogeneous compression
   showed a decrease of nearly 40\% compared to that estimated for
   homogeneous compression at different compression pressures. Such a
   decrease in the effective bulk resistance under inhomogeneous
   compression could be due to the non-uniform distribution of pressure
   under the ribs and the channels. This measurement technique can be used
   to identify optimum GDL, BPP and channel-rib structures based on minimum
   bulk and contact resistances measured under inhomogeneous compression.

Abstract = {{Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) present promising options for
   environmentally sustainable power generation especially in conjunction
   with waste water treatment. However, major challenges remain including
   low power density, difficult scale-up, and durability of the cell
   components. This study reports enhanced biocurrent production in a
   membrane-free MFC, using graphene microsheets (GNs) as anode and MnOx
   catalyzed air cathode. The GNs are produced by ionic liquid assisted
   simultaneous anodic and cathodic electrochemical exfoliation of
   iso-molded graphite electrodes. The GNs produced by anodic exfoliation
   increase the MFC peak power density by over 300\% compared to plain
   carbon cloth (i.e., 2.85 W m(-2) vs 0.66 W m(-2), respectively), and by
   90\% compared to conventional carbon black (i.e., Vulcan XC-72) anode.
   These results exceed previously reported power densities for
   graphene-containing MFC anodes. The fuel cell polarization results are
   corroborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicating three
   times lower charge transfer resistance for the GN anode. Material
   characterizations suggest that the best performing GN samples were of
   relatively smaller size (similar to 500 nm), with higher levels of ionic
   liquid induced surface functionalization during the electrochemical
   exfoliation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to design antithrombotic implants, the effect of extreme
   wettability (superhydrophilicity to super hydrophobicity) on the
   biocompatibility of the metallic substrates (stainless steel and
   titanium) was investigated. The wettability of the surface was altered
   by chemical treatments and laser ablation methods. The chemical
   treatments generated different functionality groups and chemical
   composition as evident from XPS analysis. The micro/ nanopatterning by
   laser ablation resulted in three different pattern geometry and
   different surface roughness and consequently wettability. The patterned
   surface were further modified with chemical treatments to generate a
   wide range of surface wettability. The influence of chemical functional
   groups, pattern geometry, and surface wettability on protein adsorption
   and platelet adhesion was studied. On chemically treated flat surfaces,
   the type of hydrophilic treatment was shown to be a contributing factor
   that determines the platelet adhesion, since the hydrophilic oxidized
   substrates exhibit less platelet adhesion in comparison to the control
   untreated or acid treated surfaces. Also, the surface morphology,
   surface roughness, and superhydrophobic character of the surfaces are
   contributing factors to platelet adhesion on the surface. Our results
   show that superhydrophobic cauliflower -like patterns are highly
   resistant to platelet adhesion possibly due to the stability of Cassie
   Baxter state for this pattern compared to others. Our results also show
   that simple surface treatments on metals offer a novel way to improve
   the hemocompatibility of metallic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Given the importance of residual stresses and dimensional changes in
   composites manufacturing, process simulation has been the focus of many
   studies in recent years. Consequently, various constitutive models and
   simulation approaches have been developed and implemented for composites
   process simulation. In this paper, various constitutive models, ranging
   from elastic to nonlinear viscoelastic; and simulation approaches
   ranging from separated flow/solid phases to multiscale integrated phases
   are presented and their applicability for process simulation is
   discussed. Attention has been paid to practical aspects of the problem
   where the complexity of the model coupled with the complexity and size
   scaling of the structure increases the characterization and simulation
   costs. Two specific approaches and their application are presented in
   detail: the pseudo-viscoelastic cure hardening instantaneously linear
   elastic (CHILE) and linear viscoelastic (VE). It is shown that CHILE can
   predict the residual stress formation in simple cure cycles such as the
   one-hold cycle for HEXCEL AS4/8552 where the material does not devitrify
   during processing. It is also shown that using this simple approach, the
   cure cycle can be modified to lower the residual stress level and
   therefore increase the mechanical performance of the composite laminate.
   For a more complex cure cycle where the material is devitrified during a
   post-cure, it is shown that a more complex model such as VE is required.
   This article is part of the themed issue `Multiscale modelling of the
   structural integrity of composite materials'.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainties are ubiquitous and unavoidable in process design and
   modeling. Because they can significantly affect the safety, reliability
   and economic decisions, it is important to quantify these uncertainties
   and reflect their propagation effect to process design. This paper
   proposes the application of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)-based
   approach for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of
   complex chemical processes. The gPC approach approximates the dependence
   of a process state or output on the process inputs and parameters
   through expansion on an orthogonal polynomial basis. All statistical
   information of the interested quantity (output) can be obtained from the
   surrogate gPC model. The proposed methodology was compared with the
   traditional Monte-Carlo and Quasi Monte-Carlo sampling -based approaches
   to illustrate its advantages in terms of the computational efficiency.
   The result showed that the gPC method reduces computational effort for
   uncertainty quantification of complex chemical processes with an
   acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, Sobol's sensitivity indices to
   identify influential random inputs can be obtained directly from the
   surrogated gPC model, which in turn further reduces the required
   simulations remarkably. The framework developed in this study can be
   usefully applied to the robust design of complex processes under
   uncertainties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sparse parameter matrix estimation method is proposed for identifying
   a stochastic monomolecular biochemical reaction network system.
   Identification of a reaction network can be achieved by estimating a
   sparse parameter matrix containing the reaction network structure and
   kinetics information. Stochastic dynamics of a biochemical reaction
   network system is usually modeled by a chemical master equation (CME)
   describing the time evolution of probability distributions for all
   possible states. This paper considers closed monomolecular reaction
   systems for which an exact analytical solution of the corresponding
   chemical master equation can be derived. The estimation method presented
   in this paper incorporates the closed-form solution into a regularized
   maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for which model complexity is
   penalized. A simulation result is provided to verify performance
   improvement of regularized MLE over least-square estimation (LSE), which
   is based on a deterministic mass-average model, in the case of a small
   population size. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) networks, consisting of multiple
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) acting as optical access points (APs), can
   provide low-cost high-rate data transmission to multiple users
   simultaneously in indoor environments. However, the performance of VLC
   networks is severely limited by the interference between different
   users. In this paper, we establish a distributed user-centric scheduling
   framework based on stable marriage theory, and propose a novel
   decentralized scheduling method to manage interference by forming
   flexible amorphous cells for all users. The proposed scheduling method
   has provable low computational complexity and requires only the exchange
   of a few 1-bit messages between the APs and the users but not the
   feedback of the channel state information of the entire network. We
   further show that the proposed method can achieve both user-wise and
   system-wise optimality as well as a certain level of fairness.
   Simulation results indicate that our decentralized user-centric
   scheduling method outperforms existing centralized approaches in terms
   of throughput, fairness, and computational complexity. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{The microporous layer (MPL) is a key cathodic component in proton
   exchange membrane fuel cells owing to its beneficial influence on
   two-phase mass transfer. However, its performance is highly dependent on
   material properties such as morphology, porous structure, and electrical
   resistance. To improve water management and performance,
   electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EGN) microsheets are considered
   as an alternative to the conventional carbon black (CB) MPLs. The
   EGN-based MPLs decrease the kinetic overpotential and the Ohmic
   potential loss, whereas the addition of CB to form a composite EGN+CB
   MPL improves the mass-transport limiting current density drastically.
   This is reflected by increases of approximately 30 and 70\% in peak
   power densities at 100\% relative humidity (RH) compared with those for
   CB- and EGN-only MPLs, respectively. The composite EGN+CB MPL also
   retains the superior performance at a cathode RH of 20\%, whereas the CB
   MPL shows significant performance loss.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) typically requires painful blood drawn
   from patients. We propose a painless and minimally-invasive alternative
   for TDM using hollow microneedles suitable to extract extremely small
   volumes (<1 nL) of interstitial fluid to measure drug concentrations.
   The inner lumen of a microneedle is functionalized to be used as a
   micro-reactor during sample collection to trap and bind target drug
   candidates during extraction, without requirements of sample transfer.
   An optofluidic device is integrated with this microneedle to rapidly
   quantify drug analytes with high sensitivity using a straightforward
   absorbance scheme. Vancomycin is currently detected by using volumes
   ranging between 50-100 mu L with a limit of detection (LoD) of 1.35 mu
   M. The proposed microneedle-optofluidic biosensor can detect vancomycin
   with a sample volume of 0.6 nL and a LoD of <100 nM, validating this
   painless point of care system with significant potential to reduce
   healthcare costs and patients suffering.}},

   oxynitride solid solution photocatalyst for visible-light overall water

Abstract = {{Gallium-zinc oxynitride (GaZnON) solid solution is a photocatalyst
   capable of effective overall water splitting under visible light. In
   order to address the inefficiencies of the synthesis of GaZnON solid
   solution (e:g., 10+ hat 850 degrees C under 250 ml min(-1) NH3 flow), a
   facile technique is proposed. The technique utilizes crystalline Ga3+
   and Zn2+ layered double hydroxides (LDHs) material as ``an atomic-level
   uniform precursor, and urea as the nanotemplated source of nitrogen.
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   analysis confirm the formation of wurtzite GaZnON in a 12 min process
   through distribution of the uniform Ga3+ and Zn2+ LDHs precursor within
   the nanotemplate formed through urea pyrolysis. The structural, optical,
   and electrochemical properties of the prepared samples were
   characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   energy-dispersive X-ray spettroscopy (EDX), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis)
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) analysis.
   The newly synthesized photocatalyst consists of nanopores distributed
   uniformly through the surface and bulk of the solid solution particles;
   the presence of these nanopores improves the active surface area of the
   photocatalyst up to seven times, as compared to the one for
   traditionally prepared solid solution photocatalyst. The proposed
   technique is capable of controlling the composition of the final
   photocatalyst in a wide range of ZnO content ({[}Zn]/{[}Zn + Ga] up to
   0.66). Apparent quantum yield (AQY) up to 2.5\% at 420-440 was achieved
   by the photocatalyst with bulk {[}Zn]/{[}Zn Ga] = 0.32, loaded with 1
   wt\% Rh nanoparticles. The effect of crystal defects and Zn content of
   the solid solution on the PL emission of the samples revealed that the
   GaZnON samples prepared with the LDHs precursor contain fewer crystal
   imperfections, which aids their water-splitting performance. The
   performance of the newly synthesized photocatalyst is among the highest
   reported in the open literature for photocatalysts loaded with a single
   co-catalyst. This photocatalyst has potential for future improvement
   through enhancement of the crystalline structure and improvement of the
   charge separation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Energy-efficient power allocation for multi-user single-AF-relay
   underlay cognitive radio networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{115-128}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{In underlay relay-based cognitive radio networks, when the interference
   imposed on primary users is below some pre-determined threshold,
   secondary users can use the licensed spectrum although it is occupied by
   primary users. Hence, energy-efficient power allocation among secondary
   users and cognitive relay is one of the key techniques to utilize this
   new network paradigm effectively as power is the key component of the
   interference imposed on primary users. In this paper, for cognitive
   radio cooperative communication (CRCC) networks where multiple secondary
   users share a common cognitive relay with amplify-and-forward (AF) mode,
   we propose an optimal power allocation strategy with the objective to
   minimize the sum-power consumption of the system. In addition to the
   constraints that restrict the interference on the primary users within
   pre-determined threshold, the formulated problem has constraints to
   ensure the minimum SNR achieved by secondary users and the cognitive
   relay has a total power constraint. From the inner understanding of the
   problem, we simplify the formulation. In order to transform the problem
   to a search problem of finding equilibrium points of power allocation, a
   theorem is proposed which provides the condition for sum-system-power
   minimization state. Consequently, an algorithm with linear time
   complexity is developed based on that theorem. Extensive simulation has
   been conducted under different system setups to justify the
   effectiveness and efficacy of our power allocation strategy comparing
   with other methods usually adopted to solve this type of problem. (C)

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Surface energy released upon drop coalescence is known to power the
   self-propelled jumping of liquid droplets on superhydrophobic solid
   surfaces, and the jumping droplets can additionally carry colloidal
   payloads toward self-cleaning. Here, we show that drop coalescence on a
   spherical particle leads to self-propelled launching of the particle
   from virtually any solid surface. The main prerequisite is an
   intermediate wettability of the particle, such that the momentum from
   the capillary-inertial drop coalescence process can be transferred to
   the particle. By momentum conservation, the launching velocity of the
   particle-drop complex is proportional to the capillary-inertial velocity
   based on the drop radius and to the fraction of the liquid mass in the
   total mass. The capillary-inertial catapult is not only an alternative
   mechanism for removing colloidal contaminants, but also a useful model
   system for studying ballistospore launching. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{Carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) of ammonium heptamolybdate
   impregnated activated charcoal (AC) yields a mixed Mo2C/MoOxCy catalyst.
   As the CHR temperature increases (from 600 to 800 degrees C) the Mo2C
   content increases. At 675 degrees C graphite networks are generated that
   attach to the beta-Mo2C particles, and at >= 700 degrees C agglomeration
   and sintering occur, all of which decrease catalyst activity. An optimal
   CHR temperature of similar to 650 degrees C is identified based on the
   catalyst activity for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 4-methylphenol
   (4-MP) at 350 degrees C and 4.3 MPa H-2 and the high selectivity for
   direct deoxygenation (DDO: to yield toluene) versus hydrogenation (HYD:
   to yield cyclohexane). The Mo2C/MoOxCy catalysts have higher DDO
   selectivity than MoP, MoO2, or MoS2 when operated at similar conditions.
   The apparent activation energies for DDO (125 kJ/mol) and HYD (89
   kJ/mol) are invariant among the catalysts with varying Mo2C content, but
   the rate per g Mo correlates with the CO uptake. The fact that the
   kinetics are not strong functions of the CHR reduction temperature and
   hence relative content of Mo2C versus MoOxCy suggests that the active
   site of the catalyst is a result of O adsorption and/or exchange with
   the catalyst during reaction, and these active sites occur on both Mo2C
   and MoOxCy during the HDO reaction.}},

Abstract = {{We review the ecological and socio-economic impacts of the catastrophic
   dam failure in Mariana, Brazil. Tailing management practices by Samarco
   mining company ultimately caused a dam breach that abruptly discharged
   between 55 and 62 million m(3) of tailings into the Doce River
   watershed. On November 5th, 2015, a tsunami of slurry engulfed the small
   district of Bento Rodrigues, loading the Doce River and its estuary with
   toxic tailings along a 663.2km trajectory, extending impacts to the
   Atlantic coast. Acute ecological impacts will adversely affect
   livelihoods of more than 1 million people in 41 riparian municipalities
   by reducing local access to fisheries resources, clean water, crop
   production sites, hydroelectric power generation and raw materials. The
   threats to riverine human communities are particularly critical for the
   disadvantaged populations from remote areas that rely on subsistence
   agriculture and fisheries, and are uniquely vulnerable to long-term
   heavy metal exposure. At the landscape scale, we predict multiple
   negative impacts, ranging from alterations of the genetic diversity of
   fish populations to long-term vegetation loss and poor regeneration in
   contaminated areas. Consequently, compromised soil stability and runoff
   control will increase the risk of further geomorphologic disturbance,
   including landslides, bank failure and mass movements. We propose
   spatially explicit long-term monitoring frameworks and priority
   mitigation measures to cope with acute and chronic risks. We posit that,
   from a national perspective, disastrous impacts like that of Doce River
   may become more frequent, given the recent regulatory changes that
   undermine both institutional governance structures and enforcement of
   environmental regulation. (C) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia

Abstract = {{PVDF was electrospun to fabricate ribbon-and spider web-like nanofibrous
   membranes containing both TiO2 nanoparticles and Ag nanoparticles. These
   composite fibrous membranes were characterised by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), confocal laser microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). The results revealed that Ag nanoparticles were
   mainly produced via reduction by DMF and played a key role in the
   formation of ribbon and spider web structures in cooperation with TiO2
   nanoparticles. The presence of Ag nanoparticles was also found to
   improve the mechanical strength of the PVDF membranes. The
   photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) experimentals further
   shows that the Ag-TiO2/PVDF composite membranes have excellent
   photocatalytic activity which probably results from the synergistic
   effect of Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles. This typical composite membrane
   used as filters has potential applications in remove of organic
   pollutions in the industrial waster water areas.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of content delivery in caching networks is investigated for
   the scenarios where multiple users request identical files. An adaptive
   method is proposed for the delivery of redundant demands in caching
   networks. Based on the redundancy pattern in the current demand vector,
   the proposed method decides between the transmission of uncoded messages
   or the coded messages of Maddah-Ali and Niesen for delivery. Moreover, a
   lower bound on the delivery rate of redundant requests is derived. The
   performance of the adaptive method is investigated through numerical
   examples and Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the adaptive
   method considerably reduces the performance gap to the lower bound for
   the specific ranges of network parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) and total mercury
   (THg) analyses were conducted on algae, submersed and emergent
   macrophytes, shrubs and trees, Macrobrachium sp. and Paracheirodon
   axelrodi collected in three streams that drain a large interfluvial
   region in the middle Rio Negro, Amazonas State, Brazil. Samples were
   collected during different hydrological periods over 12 months in lower
   stream reaches and their headwaters; the latter being characterized by
   shallow, open-canopy swamps. Additionally, delta(15)Nvalues andmercury
   concentrations of Paracheirodon simulans and Cichla spp. from the middle
   Rio Negro were analysed to demonstrate THg biomagnification in the food
   web. The highest mercury levels of P. axelrodi were found in small
   individuals, which were collected principally in the low water period.
   The log10 THg-delta N-15 relationship of vascular plants and algae,
   Macrobrachium sp., Paracheirodon spp. and Cichla spp. showed significant
   mercury biomagnification among trophic levels, with regression slopes of
   0.15 and 0.25 for the entire food web and heterotrophs-only food web,
   respectively. The mean +/- s.d. THg concentrations for Macrobrachium
   sp., P. axelrodi, P. simulans and Cichla spp. were 63.6 +/- 23.7, 104.5
   +/- 40.0, 112.3 +/- 31.4 and 418.5 +/- 188.1 ng g(-1) wet mass,
   respectively. Elevated levels of mercury found in Paracheirodon spp. and
   top predators such as Cichla spp. in a remote area far from
   anthropogenic inputs provide evidence that high mercury concentrations
   occur naturally in Rio Negro aquatic food webs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) cell cultures are beneficial models for
   mimicking the complexities of in vivo tissues, especially in tumour
   studies where transport limitations can complicate response to cancer
   drugs. 3-D optical microscopy techniques are less involved than
   traditional embedding and sectioning, but are impeded by optical
   scattering properties of the tissues. Confocal and even two-photon
   microscopy limit sample imaging to approximately 100-200 mu m depth,
   which is insufficient to image hypoxic spheroid cores. Optical clearing
   methods have permitted high-depth imaging of tissues without physical
   sectioning, but they are difficult to implement for smaller 3-D cultures
   due to sample loss in solution exchange. In this work, we demonstrate a
   microfluidic platform for high-throughput on-chip optical clearing of
   breast cancer spheroids using the SeeDB, Clear(T2), and ScaleSQ clearing
   methods. Although all three methods are able to effectively clear the
   spheroids, we find that SeeDB and ScaleSQ more effectively clear the
   sample than Clear(T2); however, SeeDB induces green auto-fluorescence
   while ScaleS causes sample expansion. Our unique on-chip implementation
   permits clearing arrays of 3-D cultures using perfusion while monitoring
   the 3-D cultures throughout the process, enabling visualization of the
   clearing endpoint as well as monitoring of transient changes that could
   induce image artefacts. Our microfluidic device is compatible with
   on-chip 3-D cell culture, permitting the use of on-chip clearing at the
   endpoint after monitoring the same spheroids during their culture. This
   on-chip method has the potential to improve readout from 3-D cultures,
   facilitating their use in cell-based assays for high-content drug
   screening and other applications. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Millimeter wave ( mm-wave) communication is a promising technology for
   short-range communications and highspeed services. It provides potential
   solutions for multimedia content delivery in home networks. However,
   approaches for resource allocation in traditional wireless networks may
   not be efficient for multimedia data transmissions in mm-wave networks.
   This is due to the very wide bandwidth and highly directional
   transmissions, which bring challenges as well as opportunities to the
   resource allocation of mm-wave transmissions. In this paper, we first
   characterize different usage scenarios of multimedia content delivery by
   introducing a set of utility functions. We then formulate a joint power
   and channel allocation problem based on a network utility maximization
   framework, which captures the spatial and frequency reuse of mm-wave
   communications. The formulated problem is a non-convex mixed integer
   programming ( MIP) problem. We reformulate the problem into a convex MIP
   problem and propose a resource allocation algorithm based on outer
   approximation ( OA) method. We further develop an efficient heuristic
   algorithm, which has a lower complexity than the OA based algorithm.
   Simulation results present the tradeoffs between the OA based and
   heuristic algorithms for different scenarios and show that our proposed
   algorithms substantially outperform recently proposed schemes in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed beamforming for cooperative cognitive radio
   (CR) networks, that reduces the required feedback overhead in terms of
   sharing the channel state information (CSI) between the cooperating CR
   relays. Assuming the reciprocity of the channels of each cooperating CR
   node toward the CR receiver, as well as toward the primary receiver, the
   proposed beamforming technique only requires sharing the location
   information of the CR relays among the cooperating CR relays, rather
   than the global CSI. Reducing the required feedback overhead provides
   enhanced scalability of the cooperative CR network with lower deployment
   cost. In this paper, we also propose two autonomous decision making
   strategies that can help each CR user to independently decide whether to
   participate in the cooperative transmission or not. This participation
   decision is tackled from a game theoretic approach, by quantifying the
   reward and cost functions of each CR relay. The first proposed strategy,
   named regret testing-based strategy, is proved to asymptotically achieve
   an approximate Nash equilibrium state of the system. However, it has
   higher complexity and slower convergence time. So we also propose a
   suboptimal decision making strategy, named learning-based strategy, that
   has lower complexity and faster convergence time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose quality-of-service (QoS) based resource
   allocation (RA) schemes for energy harvesting (EH) systems. We consider
   a system model with a single source and multiple destination nodes or
   users, in which the source node harvests energy from the environment.
   Our goal is to develop efficient RA policies for EH systems when the
   harvested energy at the source node is uncertain and insufficient to
   satisfy the QoS of the users completely. We develop two different
   schemes and RA policies to address this problem. In the first scheme, we
   minimize the total dissatisfaction of the users over a finite period of
   time through goal programming approach. In the second scheme, we
   maximize the number of admitted users and provide guaranteed QoS to
   them. For both schemes, we first develop offline algorithms assuming the
   availability of perfect and complete information about the harvested
   energy and channel state information (CSI). Next, we devise online
   algorithms based on dynamic programming (DP) considering the
   availability of causal information about the harvested energy and CSI.
   Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
   algorithms and the importance of QoS provisioning based RA schemes in EH
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum mechanics tells us that the bound states of a potential well are
   quantized-a phenomenon that is easily understandable based on wave
   properties and resonance. Here, the authors demonstrate a classical
   mechanism for the formation of a momentum gap in the phase space of
   electrons traveling as particles in a potential well in vacuum. This
   effect is caused by the reflection of electrons from at least two
   potential maxima, which may, for instance, exist due to space-charge
   distribution in a triode configuration. This gap plays a critical role
   in space-charge-mitigated electron transport in vacuum, such as in a
   thermionic energy converter with a positively biased grid, where it is
   shown that the current density can be increased by 1-3 orders of
   magnitude depending on the severity of space charge in the absence of
   the grid. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy wire-based rubber bearings (SMA-RBs) possess enhanced
   energy dissipation capacity and self-centering property compared to
   conventional RBs. The performance of different types of SMA-RBs with
   different wire configurations has been studied in detail. However, their
   reliability in isolating structures has not been thoroughly
   investigated. The objective of this study is to analytically explore the
   effect of SMA-RBs on the seismic fragility of a highway bridge.
   Steel-reinforced elastomeric isolators are equipped with SMA wires and
   used to isolate the bridge. Results revealed that SMA wires with a
   superelastic behavior and re-centering capability can increase the
   reliability of the bearing and the bridge structure. It was observed
   that at the collapse level of damage, the bridge isolated by SMA-HDRB
   has the lowest fragility. Findings also showed that equipping NRB with
   SMA wires decreases the possibility of damage in the bridge while,
   replacing HDRB with SMA-HDRB; or LRB with SMA-LRB increases the failure
   probability of the system at slight, moderate, and extensive limit

Abstract = {{For the fabrication of highly efficient all-solid-state dye-sensitized
   solar cells, a full coverage of electrolyte on dye/TiO2 surface and a
   continuous electrolyte route from dye/TiO2 surface to counter electrode
   are the most important issues, which depend heavily on the infiltration
   and precipitation behavior of solid electrolyte into porous photoanode.
   In this paper, an important experimental strategy, fast evaporation of
   the solvent at 80 degrees C under a low pressure, was explored for the
   first time to create in situ continuous charge transfer pathways after
   the infiltration of polymer electrolyte solution into a dual-porous TiO2
   film created by vacuum cold spraying. It was found that with the novel
   strategy very good electrolyte coverage could be realized on the
   dye/TiO2 surface, and continuous electrolyte fibers could be developed
   in the sub-micro-pores of the dual-porous TiO2 film, which could serve
   as a highway for fast electron transport between counter electrode and
   photoanode. As a result, a very high photo-to-electric energy conversion
   efficiency was demonstrated by the solvent-free polymer electrolyte
   solar cell.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality management in distribution networks is directly related to
   spatial distribution of chlorine boosters and its dosages. Water
   chlorination is essential to reduce the effects of bacterial and other
   microbiological contaminants. A higher dosage of chlorine generates
   harmful by-products in addition to changes in drinking water's taste and
   odor. The optimization of chlorine dosage is necessary to decrease the
   microbial contaminants that affect water quality. Once the chlorine
   threshold is determined for microbial contaminant, it will help decision
   makers suggest optimal values. These decisions can rely on the estimated
   water quality index (WQI). WQI is an index to evaluate water quality and
   can be linked to adequate residual chlorine with optimal booster dosage,
   numbers, and locations in water distribution network (WDN). The city of
   Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia's WDN was selected to validate the application
   of this study. Based on geographic location, the city Al-Khobar water
   network was divided into five zones. The initial temporal and spatial
   analysis pointed out poor water quality zones. EPANET, a modeling and
   simulating software, was applied to evaluate the WQI. Those EPANET
   results were then integrated with an optimization model. The
   optimization model suggested new chlorine booster locations to improve
   water quality in the city of Al-Khobar water distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest in distributed antenna systems (DASs), how
   to guarantee resource-based fairness in multiuser DASs remains largely
   unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel cumulative distribution
   function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) with flexible beam transmissions
   (CSFB) to guarantee resource-based fairness in DASs. With CSFB, to
   increase the probability that each remote antenna unit (RAU) can
   contribute to the throughput of users located near it, the probabilities
   of each user being selected for different RAUs and the number of beams
   for transmission are jointly adapted to the geographical distribution of
   RAUs. Thus, CSFB can efficiently exploit multiuser diversity realized by
   independent fading channels, as well as spatial multiplexing by
   effectively utilizing the distributed RAUs. To realize CSFB in practice,
   a one-bit-feedback scheme, i.e., CSFB-OB, is further proposed to reduce
   feedback overhead for user selection. We prove that both CSFB and
   CSFB-OB can satisfy resource-based fairness and derive the upper bound
   for the feedback overhead with CSFB-OB. Simulation results show that
   CSFB and CSFB-OB with a suitable feedback threshold achieve a better
   throughput performance than CS with all-beam and single-beam
   transmissions and the existing fair scheduling schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless network virtualization has attracted great attention from both
   academia and industry. Another emerging technology for next-generation
   wireless networks is in-band full-duplex (FD) communications. Due to its
   promising performance, FD communication has been considered to be an
   effective way of achieving self-backhauls for small cells. In this
   paper, we introduce wireless virtualization into small-cell networks and
   propose a virtualized small-cell network architecture with FD
   self-backhauls. We formulate the virtual-resource-allocation problem in
   virtualized small-cell networks with FD self-backhauls as an
   optimization problem. Since the formulated problem is a mixed
   combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem, its computational
   complexity is high. Moreover, the centralized scheme may suffer from
   signaling overhead, outdated dynamics information, and scalability
   issues. To solve it efficiently, we divide the original problem into two
   subproblems. For the first subproblem, we transfer it to a convex
   optimization problemand then solve it by an efficient alternating
   direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed algorithm. The
   second subproblem is a convex problem, which can be solved by each
   infrastructure provider. Extensive simulations are conducted with
   different system configurations to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety impacts of
   unconventional outside left-turn lane at signalized intersections. New
   designed unconventional outside left-turn lanes are increasingly used at
   signalized intersections in urban areas in China. The unconventional
   outside left-turn lane design allows an exclusive left-turn lane to be
   located to the right of through lanes to improve the efficiency and
   increase the capacity of left-turn movements. However, the design also
   raises some concerns regarding potential negative safety impacts. The
   evaluation is conducted using an automated video-based traffic conflict
   technique. The traffic conflicts approach provides better understanding
   of collision contributing factors and the failure mechanism that leads
   to road collisions. Traffic conflicts are automatically detected and
   time to collision is calculated based on the analysis of the vehicles'
   positions in space and time. Video data are collected from a signalized
   intersection in Nanjing, China, where both traditional inside and
   unconventional outside left-turn lanes are installed on two intersection
   approaches. The other two approaches have only inside left-turn lanes.
   The study compared frequency and severity of conflict for left-turning
   vehicles as well as the percentage of vehicles involved in conflicts
   from the inside and outside left-turn lanes. The results show that the
   intersection approaches with outside left-turn lanes had considerably
   more conflicts compared to approaches without outside left-turn lanes.
   As well, the approaches with outside left-turn lanes had significantly
   higher conflict severity than the approaches without outside left-turn
   lanes. As such, it is recommended that the trade-off between the
   improved mobility and negative safety impact of outside left-turn lanes
   be carefully considered before recommending their installation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on the problems of load scheduling and power
   trading in systems with high penetration of renewable energy resources
   (RERs). We adopt approximate dynamic programming to schedule the
   operation of different types of appliances including must-run and
   controllable appliances. We assume that users can sell their excess
   power generation to other users or to the utility company. Since it is
   more profitable for users to trade energy with other users locally,
   users with excess generation compete with each other to sell their
   respective extra power to their neighbors. A game theoretic approach is
   adopted to model the interaction between users with excess generation.
   In our system model, each user aims to obtain a larger share of the
   market and to maximize its revenue by appropriately selecting its
   offered price and generation. In addition to yielding a higher revenue,
   consuming the excess generation locally reduces the reverse power flow,
   which impacts the stability of the system. Simulation results show that
   our proposed algorithm reduces the energy expenses of the users. The
   proposed algorithm also facilitates the utilization of RERs by
   encouraging users to consume excess generation locally rather than
   injecting it back into the power grid.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a suite of algorithms to determine the active- and
   reactive-power setpoints for photovoltaic (PV) inverters in distribution
   networks. The objective is to optimize the operation of the distribution
   feeder according to a variety of performance objectives and ensure
   voltage regulation. In general, these algorithms take a form of the
   widely studied ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem. For the envisioned
   application domain, nonlinear power-flow constraints render pertinent
   OPF problems nonconvex and computationally intensive for large systems.
   To address these concerns, we formulate a quadratic constrained
   quadratic program (QCQP) by leveraging a linear approximation of the
   algebraic power-flow equations. Furthermore, simplification from QCQP to
   a linearly constrained quadratic program is provided under certain
   conditions. The merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated with
   simulation results that utilize realistic PV-generation and load-profile
   data for illustrative distribution-system test feeders.}},

   method. It was found that the solubility of MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O in
   the H2SO4-H2O system gradually decreased and then slightly increased
   with the concentration of 112504. Each solubility curve has its own

Abstract = {{Natural gas can support the electricity grid through integration of the
   existing natural gas and electric networks into energy hubs. This paper
   elaborates on the design of an efficient algorithm for the EMS (energy
   management system) inside a residential energy hub. We study the
   strategic operation of the energy hubs in a competitive electricity
   market. Each energy hub aims to jointly minimize the operating cost and
   the discomfort cost caused by modifying the electrical and thermal load
   profiles. We show that there exists a competitive equilibrium for the
   energy hubs. A linear time EMS scheduling algorithm is proposed to
   determine that equilibrium. The optimal strategy of the energy hubs are
   compared for two widely used electricity pricing mechanisms, namely the
   TOU (time-of-use) and the dynamic pricing schemes. Furthermore, we study
   the effects of the electrical storage system and renewable resources on
   the hubs' optimal strategies. Simulations are performed for a group of
   ten residential energy hubs in a competitive electricity market. It is
   shown that the energy hubs' daily cost will be reduced by using the
   proposed scheduling algorithm. It is also shown that the dynamic pricing
   scheme can better motivate the energy hubs toward modifying their daily
   operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{503-506}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fluids play a critical role in natural and human-induced rock failure.
   It is unclear, however, if propagation of a tensile fracture is
   inherently an episodic or continuous process. For example, typical
   average propagation speeds of hydraulic fracture tips on the order of
   1-10 m/min suggest continuous crack growth, possibly at subcritical
   stress intensities. In contrast, using field observations and numerical
   and mathematical analyses, we show that fracture growth due to
   anthropogenic hydraulic fracturing is most likely to occur in an
   episodic fashion, characterized by stick-split behavior that is
   analogous to stick-slip motion of earthquakes. The stick-split mechanism
   is regulated by cyclic variations in fluid pressure near the crack tip,
   in which each successive failure produces a local pressure drop that
   temporarily halts or slows fracture propagation. A pressure drop results
   in partial fracture closure, producing noncontinuous fracture
   propagation through a process that is reminiscent of hand clapping.
   Rupture speeds for individual failure events are on the order of the
   shear-wave velocity of the medium; thus, continuous crack growth is not
   a likely mechanism for anthropogenic hydraulic fracturing treatments
   despite slow average tip propagation speeds.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a compact, broadband, 2 x 2 adiabatic 3 dB coupler using
   sub-wavelength gratings (SWGs) for silicon-on-insulator waveguides. In
   our device, two SWG waveguides that support two transverse electric
   modes and have tapered waveguide widths were used to achieve an
   adiabatic mode evolution of the two-waveguide system for broadband 3 dB
   power splitting. We present results for a SWG adiabatic 3 dB coupler
   that has an overall coupler length of 50 mu m and achieves broadband
   power splitting over a 130 nm wavelength range with an imbalance of no
   greater than +/- 0.3 dB and with low excess losses of less than 0.5 dB.

Abstract = {{The microwave-enhanced advanced oxidation (MW/H2O2-AOP) treatment of
   sewage sludge in a continuous-flow 915MHz microwave system was studied.
   A higher H2O2 dosage at the same flow rate resulted in better solids
   disintegration in terms of higher soluble chemical oxygen demand. The
   highest soluble chemical oxygen demand concentration of 5174mg/L was
   obtained at a dosage of 0.005 L/L (0.5 \% v/v). A higher soluble
   chemical oxygen demand was obtained at a higher flow rate with the same
   H2O2 dosage. A substantial amount of soluble phosphorus (over 60\% of
   total phosphorus content) was produced for all treatments, regardless of
   H2O2 dosage. A first-order reaction kinetics of soluble chemical oxygen
   demand was proposed in this study. Real-time energy consumption
   corresponding to performance efficacy, which provides a realistic
   assessment of the process efficiency, was calculated. Energy consumption
   was found to vary between 0.22-0.29kWh/L of sludge treated. The results
   demonstrated that a continuous-flow 915MHz microwave system resulted in
   high treatment efficiency in terms of nutrient release, solids
   disintegration, and low energy consumption, which is suitable for
   real-time industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, carbon black Vulcan XC-72R (VC)-supported Pt hollow
   nanospheres (HNSs) were prepared through a simple synthesis strategy
   using VC-supported Co nanoparticles (NPs) as the template combined with

   Pt(20 wt\%)HNS/VC catalyst has a homogenous Pt HNS particle size of ca.
   18 nm and a uniform particle distribution on the VC support.
   Furthermore, the Pt HNSs are found to be composed of discrete Pt NPs
   with a crystallite size of ca. 2-3 nm. Due to the unique nanostructure

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is an epistemological concept in the sense that any
   meaningful understanding of uncertainty requires a theory of knowledge.
   Therefore, uncertainty resulting from scientific endeavors can only be
   properly understood in the context of a well-defined philosophy of
   science. Our main message here is that much of the discussion about
   uncertainty in hydrology has lacked grounding in these foundational
   concepts, and has resulted in a controversy that is largely the product
   of logical errors rather than true (axiomatic) disagreement. As an
   example, we explore the current debate about the appropriate role of
   probability theory for hydrological uncertainty quantification. Our main
   messages are: (1) apparent (and/or claimed) limitations of probability
   theory are not actually consequences of that theory, but rather of
   deeper underlying epistemological (and ontological) issues; (2)
   questions about the appropriateness of probability theory are only
   meaningful if posed as questions about our preferred philosophy of
   science; and (3) questions about uncertainty may often be better posed
   as questions about available information and information use efficiency.
   Our purpose here is to discuss how hydrologists might ask more
   meaningful questions about uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of the textile reinforcement type on the
   flexural response of textile-reinforced concrete beams under static and
   impact loads was investigated. In addition, to compare the flexural
   capacities with those of conventional steel-fiber-reinforced concrete,
   steel-fiber-reinforced concrete beams having similar compressive
   strength with that of textile-reinforced concrete were fabricated and
   tested according to the fiber content. Enhancements in the flexural
   capacities were obtained using polymer-coated textile reinforcement, and
   three-dimensional textile reinforcement resulted in slightly better
   flexural performance than two-dimensional textile reinforcement under
   both static and impact loads. Upon comparison with the results obtained
   from the steel-fiber-reinforced concrete beams, the textile-reinforced
   concrete specimen with polymer-coated textile reinforcement exhibited
   the best flexural performance in terms of the strength, toughness, and
   residual load carrying capacity (higher than or at least similar to
   those of the steel-fiber-reinforced concrete with a fiber volume content
   of 2\%), whereas the textile-reinforced concrete specimens with uncoated
   textile reinforcement exhibited lower strength and toughness than those
   of the steel-fiber-reinforced concrete with a fiber volume content of
   0.5\%. Finally, the strain-rate sensitivity of the flexural strength for
   textile-reinforced concrete was found to be similar to that for
   steel-fiber-reinforced concrete.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluates whether there is any advantage of selecting one
   of the thermal methods of sludge pretreatment, conventional heating (CH)
   and microwave hydrolysis (MW), over another to enhance municipal sludge
   disintegration and performance of thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD).
   For this purpose, a custom-built CH system simulating MW hydrolysis
   under identical heating and cooling profiles was used. The effects of
   three main pretreatment parameters including pretreatment method (CH and
   MW), heating ramp rate (3, 6 and 11 degrees C/min) and final temperature
   (80, 120 and 160 degrees C) on sludge solubilization and performance of
   thermophilic batch AD were evaluated. The effects of CH and MW
   hydrolysis were observed to be similar for sludge disintegration and
   digester performance (p-value > 0.05), while the effects of final
   temperature and heating ramp rate were proven to be different (p-value <
   0.05). According to the results, it is essential to apply MW and CH
   pretreatments under identical experimental condition for an unbiased
   comparison which supports the findings of the author's earlier study
   under mesophilic condition. Failing to address this issue explains the
   significant inconsistency observed among the findings of the previous CH
   vs. MW comparison studies that were unable to implement identical
   thermal profiles (between CH and MW) during sludge pretreatment. In
   comparison with mesophilic AD, thermophilic AD revealed lower
   biodegradation rate constant at the highest pretreatment temperature
   tested (160 degrees C), suggesting its higher sensitivity to the
   inhibitory effects of thermal pretreatment at the elevated temperatures.

Abstract = {{Bioprinting is a 3D fabrication technology used to precisely dispense
   cell-laden biomaterials for the construction of complex 3D functional
   living tissues or artificial organs. While still in its early stages,
   bioprinting strategies have demonstrated their potential use in
   regenerative medicine to generate a variety of transplantable tissues,
   including skin, cartilage, and bone. However, current bioprinting
   approaches still have technical challenges in terms of high-resolution
   cell deposition, controlled cell distributions, vascularization, and
   innervation within complex 3D tissues. While no one-size-fits-all
   approach to bioprinting has emerged, it remains an on-demand, versatile
   fabrication technique that may address the growing organ shortage as
   well as provide a high throughput method for cell patterning at the
   micrometer scale for broad biomedical engineering applications. In this
   review, we introduce the basic principles, materials, integration
   strategies and applications of bioprinting. We also discuss the recent
   developments, current challenges and future prospects of 3D bioprinting
   for engineering complex tissues. Combined with recent advances in human
   pluripotent stem cell technologies, 3D-bioprinted tissue models could
   serve as an enabling platform for high-throughput predictive drug
   screening and more effective regenerative therapies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Contributing to slow advance of finite element (FE) simulations for hip
   fracture risk prediction, into clinical practice, could be a lack of
   consensus in the biomechanics community on how to map properties to the
   models. Thus, the aim of the present study was first, to systematically
   quantify the influence of the modulus-density relationship (E-rho) and
   the material mapping method (MMM) on the predicted mechanical response
   of the proximal femur in a side-ways fall (SWF) loading configuration
   and second, to perform a model-to-model comparison of the predicted
   mechanical response within the femoral neck for all the specimens tested
   in the present study, using three different modelling techniques that
   have yielded good validation outcome in terms of surface strain
   prediction and whole bone response according to the literature. We found
   the outcome to be highly dependent on both the E-rho relationship and
   the MMM. In addition, we found that the three modelling techniques that
   have resulted in good validation outcome in the literature yielded
   different principal strain prediction both on the surface as well as
   internally in the femoral neck region of the specimens modelled in the
   present study. We conclude that there exists a need to carry out a more
   comprehensive validation study for the SWF loading mode to identify
   which combination of MMMs and E-rho relationship leads to the best match
   for whole bone and local mechanical response. The MMMs tested in the
   present study have been made publicly available at

Abstract = {{A process model was developed to determine the net energy ratio (NER)
   for the production of pellets from steam pretreated agricultural residue
   (wheat straw) and energy crops (i.e., switchgrass in this case). The NER
   is a ratio of the net energy output to the total net energy input from
   non-renewable energy sources into a system. Scenarios were developed to
   measure the effects of temperature and level of steam pretreatment on
   the NER of steam pretreated wheat straw and switchgrass pellets. The
   NERs for the base case at 6 kg h(-1) are 1.76 and 1.37 for
   steam-pretreated wheat straw and switchgrass-based pellets,
   respectively. The reason behind the difference is that more energy is
   required to dry switch grass pellets than wheat straw pellets. The
   sensitivity analysis for the model shows that the optimum temperature
   for steam pretreatment is 160 degrees C with 50\% pretreatment (i.e. 50
   \% steam treated material is blended with the raw biomass and then
   pelletised). The uncertainty results for NER for steam pretreated wheat
   straw and switch grass pellets are 1.62 +/- 0.10 and 1.42 +/- 0.11,
   respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using a novel in-situ laser ultrasonic technique, the evolution of
   longitudinal velocity was used to measure the alpha-beta transformation
   during cyclic heating and cooling in commercially pure titanium. In
   order to quantify the transformation kinetics, it is shown that changes
   in texture can not be ignored. This is particularly important in the
   case of titanium where significant grain growth occurs in the beta-phase
   leading to the ultrasonic wave sampling a decreasing number of grains on
   each thermal treatment cycle. Electron backscatter diffraction
   measurements made postmortem in the region where the ultrasonic pulse
   traveled were used to obtain an estimate of such local texture and grain
   size changes. An analysis technique for including the anisotropy of wave
   velocity depending on local texture is presented and shown to give self
   consistent results for the transformation kinetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the developing heart, a specific subset of endocardium undergoes an
   endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) thus forming nascent
   valve leaflets. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and growth factors
   (GFs) play important roles in regulating EndMT but the combinatorial
   effect of GFs with ECM proteins is less well understood. Here we use
   microscale engineering techniques to create single, binary, and tertiary
   component microenvironments to investigate the combinatorial effects of
   ECM proteins and GFs on the attachment and transformation of adult ovine
   mitral valve endothelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype. With the
   combinatorial microenvironment microarrays, we utilized 60 different
   combinations of ECM proteins (Fibronectin, Collagen I, II, IV, Laminin)
   and GFs (TGF-1, bFGF, VEGF) and were able to identify new
   microenvironmental conditions capable of modulating EndMT in MVECs.
   Experimental results indicated that TGF-1 significantly upregulated the
   EndMT while either bFGF or VEGF downregulated EndMT process markedly.
   Also, ECM proteins could influence both the attachment of MVECs and the
   response of MVECs to GFs. In terms of attachment, fibronectin is
   significantly better for the adhesion of MVECs among the five tested
   proteins. Overall collagen IV and fibronectin appeared to play important
   roles in promoting EndMT process. Great consistency between macroscale
   and microarrayed experiments and present studies demonstrates that
   high-throughput cellular microarrays are a promising approach to study
   the regulation of EndMT in valvular endothelium. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

   captured environmental assessments and well-being outcomes from a survey
   of 850 student occupants. Objective measures indicated that sound levels
   generated by occupants and other sound sources tended to exceed maximum
   values recommended by standards. Some components of perceived
   suitability and well-being were greater in spaces with lower background
   sound levels (e.g., from ventilation systems), but with more
   occupant-generated sound, and more reverberation. Furthermore, some
   design features such as more vegetation, the presence of soft
   furnishings, and lower seating density predicted some components of
   perceived suitability and well-being. This evaluation of ILSs offers
   lessons for designers and suggests additional directions for further

   machined with ball end mills on 5-axis CNC machining centers. This paper
   presents automatic adjustment of tool axis orientations to avoid chatter
   along the tool path. The process mechanics and dynamics of ball end
   milling are modeled in cutter-workpiece engagement coordinate system.
   The structural dynamics of tool and workpiece are transformed to
   cutter-workpiece engagement coordinates by considering the tool path and
   the kinematics of the machine tool. The stability of the 5-axis ball end
   milling is modeled at each tool path location, and the chatter free tool
   axis orientations are searched iteratively using Nyquist criterion while
   avoiding gouging limits. The tool path, i.e. cutter location (CL) file,
   is updated to generate chatter free, 5-axis ball end milling of the
   parts. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally proven in 5-axis
   ball end milling tests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial morphology between the catalyst layer (CL) and micro
   porous layer (MPL) influences the performance of proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Here we report a direct method to
   investigate the CL-MPL interfacial morphology of stacked and compressed
   gas diffusion layer (GDL with MPL)-catalyst coated membrane (CCM)
   assemblies. The area, origin and dimensions of interfacial gaps are
   studied with high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (X-ACT).
   The projected gap area (fraction of the CL-MPL interface separated by
   gaps) is higher for GDL-CCM assemblies with large differences in the
   surface roughness between CL and MPL but reduces with increasing
   compression and similarity in roughness. Relatively large continuous
   gaps are found in proximity to cracks in the MPL. These are hypothesized
   to form due to the presence of large pores on the surface of the GDL.
   Smaller gaps are induced by the surface roughness features throughout
   the CL-MPL interface. By modification of the pore sizes on the GDL
   surface serving as substrate for the MPL, the number and dimension of
   MPL crack induced gaps can be manipulated. Moreover, adjusting the CL
   and MPL surface roughness parameters to achieve similar orders of
   roughness can improve the surface mating characteristics of these two
   components. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{218-224}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle aggregates formed in colloidal or aerosol processes have
   complex morphologies. Soot, for example, is formed as aggregates of
   primary particles. Soot properties are influenced by the diameter (4)
   and the arrangement of its constitutive primary particles. Transmission
   Electron Microscopy (TEM) is commonly used for the characterization of
   agglomerates' morphology, but manual analysis of the micrographs is
   extremely labor-intensive. Here, a new method is developed for automatic
   determination of the average primary particles diameter based on the
   variation of the 2-D pair correlation function P(r) at different
   distances r measured from the main skeleton of the aggregates. It is
   assumed that P{*} = P(d(p)/2) is nearly constant. The method has been
   applied to numerical agglomerates and real soot aggregates collected
   from several operating conditions of a gasoline direct injection engine
   and a heavy-duty compression-ignition engine. Using a constant value of
   P{*} determined from the analysis of TEM images results in primary
   particle sizing errors (relative to manual sizing) of similar to 13\%
   for single aggregates. The ensemble-mean values of d(p) for manual and
   automatic sizing differed by similar to 4\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   contaminants}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{344-353}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), the aqueous hydroxyl radical
   (HO.) acts as a strong oxidant to react with organic contaminants. The
   hydroxyl radical rate constant (km.) is important for evaluating and
   modelling of the AOPs. In this study, quantitative structure-property
   relationship (QSPR) method is applied to model the hydroxyl radical rate
   constant for a diverse dataset of 457 water contaminants from 27 various
   chemical classes. The constricted binary particle swarm optimization and
   multiple-linear regression (BPSO-MLR) are used to obtain the best model
   with eight theoretical descriptors. An optimized feed forward neural
   network (FFNN) is developed to investigate the complex performance of
   the selected molecular parameters with km.. Although the FFNN prediction
   results are more accurate than those obtained using BPSO-MLR, the
   application of the latter is much more convenient. Various internal and
   external validation techniques indicate that the obtained models could
   predict the logarithmic hydroxyl radical rate constants of a large
   number of water contaminants with less than 4\% absolute relative error.
   Finally, the above-mentioned proposed models are compared to those
   reported earlier and the structural factors contributing to the AOP
   degradation efficiency are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the effect of accurately mapping spatially
   heterogeneous drainage densities in high-altitude alpine basins on
   Rescaled Width Functions (RWFs), used in some applications as a
   minimalist model of the hydrologic response. The channel network and 373
   of its channel heads were mapped in the field in a high mountain
   catchment in the Swiss Alps. The mapped channel network is characterized
   by highly uneven drainage density, here described by the distribution of
   the length to the first channelized site computed along steepest descent
   from any unchannelled site. Various channel networks were extracted from
   a 1m lidar-derived digital terrain model and compared with the
   field-mapped channel network using geomorphologic parameters,
   hillslope-to-channel distance and RWFs. Our results show that the
   channel network derived by statistical analysis of surface morphology is
   consistent with the field-mapped network. Larger discrepancies were
   observed when the channel network was obtained with classical
   threshold-based approaches relying on cumulative drainage area and local
   slope. The actual arrangement of the drainage densities has a
   significant impact on the RWFs. The discrepancy was largest between RWFs
   derived from classical extraction methods and RWFs derived with the
   field-mapped network, indicating an inappropriate extraction of the
   channelled portion of the high-altitude catchment that is a reflection
   of the variety of channel initiation processes. Our results suggest that
   spatial heterogeneity of the drainage density might play an important
   role in modelling streamflow generation. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic
   cells, and while the cells may migrate by metastasis, they remain within
   that single individual. Natural transmission of cancer cells from one
   individual to another has been observed in two distinct cases in mammals
   (Tasmanian devils(1) and dogs(2,3)), but these are generally considered
   to be rare exceptions in nature. The discovery of transmissible cancer
   in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria)(4) suggested that this phenomenon
   might be more widespread. Here we analyse disseminated neoplasia in
   mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden
   carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus) and find that neoplasias in all
   three species are attributable to independent transmissible cancer
   lineages. In mussels and cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from
   their respective host species; however, unexpectedly, cancer cells in P.
   aureus are all derived from Venerupis corrugata, a different species
   living in the same geographical area. No cases of disseminated neoplasia
   have thus far been found in V. corrugata from the same region. These
   findings show that transmission of cancer cells in the marine
   environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many
   times, and that while most transmissible cancers are found spreading
   within the species of origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells
   can occur.}},

Title = {{Highly Efficient Thermoresponsive Nanocomposite for Controlled Release

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Highly efficient magnetic release from nanocomposite microparticles is
   shown, which are made of Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel with
   embedded iron nanowires. A simple microfluidic technique was adopted to
   fabricate the microparticles with a high control of the nanowire
   concentration and in a relatively short time compared to chemical
   synthesis methods. The thermoresponsive microparticles were used for the
   remotely triggered release of Rhodamine (B). With a magnetic field of
   only 1 mT and 20 kHz a drug release of 6.5\% and 70\% was achieved in
   the continuous and pulsatile modes, respectively. Those release values
   are similar to the ones commonly obtained using superparamagnetic beads
   but accomplished with a magnetic field of five orders of magnitude lower
   power. The high efficiency is a result of the high remanent
   magnetization of the nanowires, which produce a large torque when
   exposed to a magnetic field. This causes the nanowires to vibrate,
   resulting in friction losses and heating. For comparison, microparticles
   with superparamagnetic beads were also fabricated and tested; while
   those worked at 73 mT and 600 kHz, no release was observed at the low
   field conditions. Cytotoxicity assays showed similar and high cell
   viability for microparticles with nanowires and beads.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen evolution kinetics and hydrogen absorption in an API X100 line
   pipe steel exposed to near-neutral pH solutions is studied in this work.
   At the corrosion potential, dissolved CO2 in the solution accelerates
   the hydrogen evolution kinetics through the carbonic acid discharge
   reaction. At potentials more negative than the corrosion potential,
   hydrogen evolution due to bicarbonate discharge dominates the other
   cathodic reactions occurring at the ocp. The hydrogen diffusivity in the
   API X100 steel is found to be approximately 4.4 x 10 x (7) cm(2)/s. A
   measurable amount of diffusible hydrogen of approximately 1 appm is
   detected in the steel at the freely corroding condition using an
   electrochemical hydrogen permeation technique. Higher concentration of
   diffusible hydrogen is observed at more negative applied potentials as
   well as at higher CO2 partial pressures. The results in this paper
   support the attribution of stress corrosion cracking of pipelines in
   near-neutral pH trapped water environments to hydrogen embrittlement.

Abstract = {{We experimentally investigate the interchannel and intrachannel
   crosstalk of first- and second-order microring resonator (MRR) filters
   fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform. We find that there is an
   MRR radius that maximizes the wavelength division multiplexing channel
   count given a waveguide geometry, a maximum tolerable insertion loss,
   and a minimum permissible adjacent channel isolation. The measured power
   penalties due to interchannel crosstalk of two-channel demultiplexers
   based on first-order and series-coupled MRR filters are presented as
   functions of channel spacing and adjacent channel isolation. Next, we
   compare the intrachannel crosstalk of first-order, cascaded, and
   series-coupled MRR add-drop filters. Our results show that first-order
   MRR devices are unsuitable for simultaneous add-drop operation at high
   data rates and small channel spacings. Intrachannel crosstalk of
   cascaded and series-coupled designs are measured as functions of the
   data rate and the level of detuning between the MRRs. Low intrachannel
   crosstalk power penalties are demonstrated for cascaded and
   series-coupled MRR filters for data rates up to 20 Gb/s. Based on the
   measured results, we present requirements for the input-to-through
   response of add-drop filters that will ensure low intrachannel
   crosstalk.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{10-25}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{A series of in-plane shear tests were carried out on twenty-one steel
   roof deck diaphragms. This test program was initiated and designed to
   evaluate the seismic inelastic response of steel roof decks with
   different thicknesses and different types of deck-to-frame connections:
   nails and arc spot welds. Self drilled screws were used for sheet side
   lap fasteners in all specimens. The tests included monotonic,
   quasi-static reversed cyclic inelastic deformation, and seismic motions.
   Shear performance and failure mode of the steel decks for both types of
   deck-to-frame connections were investigated. Lateral resistance and
   elastic stiffness of steel decks with different panel thicknesses and
   connector types were determined and compared with those available in the
   Diaphragm Design Manual. Testing of all specimens confirmed that the
   inelastic deformation of a deck is mainly concentrated on the edge of
   the diaphragms parallel to the lateral loading. The cyclic tests showed
   a pinched hysteretic behavior for all the specimens. Nail specimens
   sustained large inelastic deformation cycles with progressive strength
   degradation. In contrast, weld specimens showed very significant
   deterioration and very rapid strength reduction after the peak load was
   reached. These tests confirm that the response modification factor for
   structural systems built with steel decks with nail-screw connectors
   should be greater than the current value in the building codes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{It is often assumed that the maximum seismic damage in a bridge pier
   will concentrate in the regions subjected to maximum inelastic curvature
   known as its plastic hinge length. Predicting the plastic hinge length
   accurately is an important part of seismic design of bridge piers. This
   study focuses on deriving an analytical expression for the plastic hinge
   length of shape memory alloy (SMA) reinforced concrete (RC) bridge pier
   based on the results from well calibrated nonlinear finite element
   models. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of
   different parameters on the plastic hinge length, including axial load
   ratio, aspect ratio, concrete strength, SMA properties, longitudinal and
   transverse reinforcement ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was
   performed to develop an expression to estimate the plastic hinge length
   in SMA-RC bridge pier. The results are compared with the existing
   plastic hinge length equations. The proposed equation was validated
   against test results which showed reasonable accuracy. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{The nickel-base superalloy, Inconel 718, is widely used in aircraft

   knowledge on recrystallization, grain growth and second phase evolution
   during thermomechanical processing. The present study focuses on the
   in-situ evaluation of heterogeneous grain growth in the
   super-delta-solvus domain (above 1050 degrees C) using laser
   ultrasonics. This technology is dedicated to the ultrasonic
   characterization of microstructure evolution during thermomechanical
   processing of metals and alloys. The real time measurement of the
   ultrasonic attenuation provides the evolution of a representative grain
   size in the material. A criterion is developed to determine the onset
   and completion of heterogeneous grain growth stages associated with the
   dissolution of precipitates. The laser ultrasonic methodology is
   validated with ex-situ metallographic observations and quantitative
   characterization of the grain size heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Broadening the detection view of 2D photoacoustic tomography using two

Abstract = {{Although commercial linear array transducers are widely used in clinical
   ultrasound, their application in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is still
   limited due to the limited-view problem that restricts the image
   quality. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to address the
   limited-view problem in 2D by using two linear array transducers to
   receive PAT signal from different orientations. The positions of the two
   transducers can be adjusted to fit the specific geometry of an imaging
   site. This approach is made possible by using a new calibration method,
   where the relative position between the two transducers can be
   calibrated using ultrasound by transmitting ultrasound wave with one
   transducer while receiving with the other. The calibration results are
   then applied in the subsequent PAT imaging to incorporate the detected
   acoustic signals from both transducers and thereby increase the
   detection view. In this calibration method, no calibration phantom is
   required which largely simplifies and shortens the process. The efficacy
   of the calibration and improvement on the PAT image quality are
   demonstrated through phantom studies and in vivo imaging. (C) 2016

Title = {{Improved Active Harmonic Current Elimination Based on Voltage Detection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing penetration of power electronic equipment in modern
   residential distribution systems, harmonics mitigation through the
   distributed generation (DG) interfacing converters has received
   significant attention. Among recently proposed methods, the so-called
   active resonance damper (ARD) and harmonic voltage compensator (HVC)
   based on voltage detection can effectively reduce the harmonic
   distortions in selected areas of distribution systems. However, it is
   found out that when traditional ARD algorithm is used to eliminate
   harmonic current injected by non-linear loads, its performance is
   constrained by stability problems and can at most eliminate half of the
   load harmonic currents. Thus, inspired by the duality between ARD and
   HVC, this paper presents a novel improved resistive active power filter
   (R-APF) algorithm based on integral-decoupling control. The design
   guideline for its parameters is then investigated through carefully
   analyzing the closed-loop poles' trajectory. Computer studies
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate the
   load harmonic currents and its performance is much better than
   traditional ARD based on proportional control.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for the design of stepless beam modulators for proton

   depth dose distributions showed improved uniformity over the classic
   stepped designs. Simulated results imply a possible improvement in
   distal penumbra width; however, more accurate measurements are needed to
   fully verify this effect. Lastly, simulations were done to model
   bio-equivalence to Co-60 cell kill. A wheel was successfully designed to
   flatten this metric.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},

Abstract = {{Flexibility of a manufacturing system is quite important and
   advantageous in modern industry, which function in a competitive
   environment where market diversity and the need for customized product
   are growing. Key machinery in a manufacturing system should be reliable,
   flexible, intelligent, less complex, and cost effective. To achieve
   these goals, the design methodologies for engineering systems should be
   revisited and improved. In particular, continuous or on-demand design
   improvements have to be incorporated rapidly and effectively in order to
   address new design requirements or resolve potential weaknesses of the
   original design. Design of an engineering system, which is typically a
   multi domain system, can become complicated due to its complex structure
   and possible dynamic coupling between domains. An integrated and
   concurrent approach should be considered in the design process, in
   particular in the conceptual and detailed design phases. In the context
   of multi-domain design, attention has been given recently to such
   subjects as multi-criteria decision making, multi-domain modeling,
   evolutionary computing, and genetic programing. More recently, machine
   condition monitoring has been considered for integration into a scheme
   of design evolution even though many challenges exist for this to become
   a reality such as lack of systematic approaches and the existence of
   technical barriers in massive condition data acquisition, transmission,
   storage and mining. Recently, the Internet of things (loT) and cloud
   computing (CC) are being developed quicldy and they offer new
   opportunities for evolutionary design for such tasks as data
   acquisition, storage and processing. In this paper, a framework for the
   closed-loop design evolution of engineering systems is proposed in order
   to achieve continuous design improvement for an engineering system
   through the use of a machine condition monitoring system assisted by IoT
   and CC. New design requirements or the detection of design weaknesses of
   an existing engineering system can be addressed through the proposed
   framework. A design knowledge base that is constructed by integrating
   design expertise from domain experts, on-line process information from
   condition monitoring and other design information from various sources
   is proposed to realize and supervise the design process so as to achieve
   increased efficiency, design speed, and effectiveness. The framework
   developed in this paper is illustrated by using a case study of design
   evolution of an industrial manufacturing system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{An opportunistic scheduling scheme is proposed for the downlink of a

   multiplexing and multiuser diversity gains while maintaining fair

   two steps in each time slot: selecting a base station (BS) at each user,

   selects users in a distributed manner, the channels among the selected
   users are proved to be orthogonal when the number of users approaches

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology to alleviate spectrum
   shortage and satisfy the huge demand of bandwidth for multimedia
   streaming in future mobile computing systems. The inherent features of
   CR pose tough challenges in provisioning quality of service (QoS) for
   acceptable user experience and minimizing energy consumption for
   multimedia transmissions. In this paper, scalable video coding and
   transmission rate adaptation are jointly considered in an
   energy-efficient scheme for transmissions of streaming media over CR
   with QoS guarantee. An event-driven discrete-time-Markov control process
   model is introduced to formulate the QoS-guaranteed energy-efficient
   transmission problemas a constrained stochastic optimization problem.
   Based on estimations of potentials and the difference between
   performance measurement and QoS requirement, an online policy iteration
   algorithm is proposed to optimize energy consumption under QoS
   constraints directly. By exploiting the system dynamics, this algorithm
   does not depend on any prior knowledge of channel availability or fading
   statistics, and it can converge to a near optimum with a low
   computational burden. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method.}},

   Review}},
Journal = {{FIBERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Large residual strain in reinforced concrete structures after a seismic
   event is a major concern for structural safety and serviceability.
   Alternative reinforcement materials like fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   have been widely used to mitigate corrosion problems associated with
   steel. Low modulus of elasticity and brittle behavior compared to steel
   has made the use of FRP unsuitable in seismic resistant strictures. A
   combination of steel-FRP reinforcement configuration can address the
   problem of corrosion. Therefore, introducing a material that shows
   strong post elastic behavior without any decay due to corrosion is in
   demand. Shape memory alloy (SMA), a novel material, is highly corrosion
   resistive and shows super elastic property. Coupling SMA with FRP or
   steel in the plastic hinge region allows the structure to undergo large
   deformations, but regains its original shape upon unloading. In this
   study, the performance characteristics of four previously tested
   beam-column joints reinforced with different configurations (steel,
   SMA/steel, glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) and SMA/FRP) are
   compared to assess their capacity to endure extreme loading.
   Experimental results are scrutinized to compare the behavior of these
   specimens in terms of load-story drift and energy dissipation capacity.
   SMA/FRP and SMA/Steel couples have been found to be an acceptable
   approach to reduce residual deformation in beam-column joints with
   adequate energy dissipation capacity. However, SMA/FRP is superior to
   SMA/Steel concerning to the corrosion issue in steel.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates a robust energy-efficient solution for
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions in cognitive
   vehicular networks. Our goal is to design an optimal MIMO beamforming
   for secondary users (SUs), considering imperfect interference
   channel-state information (CSI). Specifically, we optimize the energy
   efficiency (EE) of SUs, given that the transmission power constraint,
   the robust interference power constraint, and the minimum transmission
   rate are satisfied. To solve the optimization problem, we first
   characterize the uncertainty of CSI by bounding it in a
   Frobenius-norm-based region and then equivalently convert the robust
   interference constraint to a linear matrix inequality (LMI).
   Furthermore, a feasible ascent direction approach is proposed to reduce
   the optimization problem into a sequential linearly constrained
   semidefinite program, which leads to a distributed iterative
   optimization algorithm for deriving the robust and optimal beamforming.
   The feasibility and convergence of the proposed algorithm is
   theoretically validated, and the final experimental results are also
   supplemented to show the strength of the proposed algorithm over some
   conventional schemes in terms of the achieved EE performance and
   robustness.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2947-2965}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The use of partial geometries to construct parity-check matrices for
   binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes has resulted in the design
   of successful codes with a probability of error on the AWGN channel
   close to the Shannon capacity at bit error rate down to 10(-15). Such
   considerations have motivated this further investigation. A new and
   simple construction of a type of partial geometries with a quasi-cyclic
   (QC) structure is given and their properties are investigated. Two new
   classes of this type of partial geometries, one based on prime fields
   and the other based on cyclic subgroups of prime orders of finite
   fields, are constructed. QC-LDPC codes with good error performances are
   constructed based on these two new classes of partial geometries. The
   trapping sets of the partial geometry codes were previously considered
   using the geometric aspects of the underlying structure to derive
   information on the size of allowable trapping sets. This topic is
   further considered here. Finally, there is a natural relationship
   between partial geometries and strongly regular graphs. The eigenvalues
   of the adjacency matrices of such graphs are well known, and it is of
   interest to determine if any of the Tanner graphs derived from the
   partial geometries are good expanders for certain parameter sets, since
   it can be argued that codes with good geometric and expansion properties
   might perform well on the AWGN channel under message-passing decoding.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Biochemical reactors (BCRs) using complex organics for bioremediation of
   mine-influenced water must operate successfully year round. In cold
   climates, where many mines in Canada are located, survival of the
   important microorganisms through the winter months is a concern. In this
   work, broad phylogenetic surveys, using metagenomics, of the microbial
   populations in pulp mill biosolids used to remediate metal leachate
   containing As, Zn, Cd and sulfate were performed to see if the types of
   microorganisms present changed over the seasons of one year (August 2008
   to July 2009). Despite temperature variations between 0 and 17 degrees C
   the overall structure of the microbial population was fairly consistent.
   A cyclical pattern in relative abundance was detected in certain taxa.
   These included fermenter-related groups, which were out of phase with
   other taxa such as Desulfobulbus that represented potential consumers of
   fermentation byproducts. Sulfate-reducers in the BCR biosolids were
   closely related to psychrotolerant species. Temperature was not a factor
   that shaped the microbial population structure within the BCR biosolids.
   Kinetics of organic matter degradation by these microbes and the rate of
   supply of organic carbon to sulfate-reducers would likely affect the
   metal removal rates at different temperatures.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A performance monitoring study of an electric rope shovel operating in
   an open pit coal mine was conducted. As the mining industry moves toward
   higher productivity, profitability and predictability, the need for more
   reliable, productive and efficient mining shovels increases.
   Consequently, it is critical to study the productivity of these machines
   and to understand the effect of different operational parameters on
   that. In this paper a clustering analysis is performed to classify
   shovel digging effort and behaviour based on digging energy, dig time
   and payload per pass. Then the influence of the operator on the digging
   efficiency and productivity of the machine is analyzed with a focus on
   operator technique during digging. A statistical analysis is conducted
   on different cycle time components (dig time, swing time, return time)
   for different operators. In addition to time components, swing and
   return angles as well as loading rate and mucking rate are observed and
   analyzed. The results of this study help to understand the effect of
   different operators on the digging productivity of the shovel and then
   to set the best operator practice.}},

Abstract = {{Scanning speed and coupling efficiency of excitation light to optic
   fibres are two major technical challenges that limit the potential of
   fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrometer for on-line
   applications and in vivo studies. In this paper, a novel EEM system,
   utilizing a supercontinuum white light source and acousto-optic tunable
   filters (AOTFs), was introduced and evaluated. The supercontinuum white
   light, generated by pumping a nonlinear photonic crystal fiber with an
   800 nm femtosecond laser, was efficiently coupled into a bifurcated
   optic fiber bundle. High speed EEM spectral scanning was achieved using
   AOTFs both for selecting excitation wavelength and scanning emission
   spectra. Using calibration lamps (neon and mercury argon), wavelength
   deviations were determined to vary from 0.18 nm to -0.70 nm within the
   spectral range of 500-850 nm. Spectral bandwidth for filtered excitation
   light broadened by twofold compared to that measured with monochromatic
   light between 650 nm and 750 nm. The EEM spectra for methanol solutions
   of laser dyes were successfully acquired with this rapid fluorometer
   using an integration time of 5 s. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining highly sensitive ferromagnetic, FM, and nonmagnetic, NM,
   multilayers with a large room-temperature magnetoresistance, MR, and
   strong magnetic anisotropy, MA, under a small externally applied
   magnetic field, H, remains a subject of scientific and technical
   interest. Recent advances in nanofabrication and characterization
   techniques have further opened up several new ways through which MR,
   sensitivity to H, and MA of the FM/NM multilayers could be dramatically
   improved in miniature devices such as smart spin-valves based
   biosensors, non-volatile magnetic random access memory, and spin
   transfer torque nano-oscillators. This review presents in detail the
   fabrication and characterization of a few representative FM/NM
   multilayered films-including the nature and origin of MR, mechanism
   associated with spin-dependent conductivity and artificial generation of
   MA. In particular, a special attention is given to the Pulsed-current
   deposition technique and on the potential industrial applications and
   future prospects. FM multilayers presented in this review are already
   used in real-life applications such as magnetic sensors in automobile
   and computer industries. These material are extremely important as they
   have the capability to efficiently replace presently used magnetic
   sensors in automobile, electronics, biophysics, and medicine, among many
   others.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical and experimental study of dewatering of fibre suspensions
   by uniaxial compression is presented. Solutions of a one-dimensional
   model are discussed and asymptotic limits of fast and slow compression
   are explored. Particular focus is given to relatively rapid compression
   and to the corresponding development of spatial variations in the
   solidity and velocity profiles of the suspension. The results of
   complementary laboratory experiments are presented for nylon or
   cellulose fibres suspended in viscous fluid. The constitutive
   relationships for each suspension were measured independently.
   Measurements of the load for different fixed compression speeds,
   together with some direct measurements of the velocity profiles using
   particle tracking velocimetry, are compared with model predictions. The
   comparison is reasonable for nylon, but poor for cellulose fibres. An
   extension to the model, which allows for a strain-rate-dependent
   component in the network stress, is proposed, and is found to give a
   dramatic improvement in the model predictions for cellulose fibre
   suspensions. The reason for this improvement is attributed to the
   microstructure of cellulose fibres, which, unlike nylon fibres, are
   themselves porous. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Tag anticollision is critical to the performance of many radio frequency
   identification systems in industrial applications. Tree-based schemes
   are popular arbitration algorithms for tag collision, as they are
   scalable and easy to implement. In these schemes, collided tags are
   recursively divided into two groups until each group contains only one
   tag. However, we have determined that previous pure tree-based schemes
   do not fully utilize the information that can be collected; they allow
   only the responding tags to be involved in the splitting process. In
   this paper, we propose a novel pure tree-based method that we named
   parallel splitting with retrieve (PSR), which allows both the
   nonresponding and unidentified tags to also be involved in the splitting
   process. PSR consists of two mechanisms: parallel splitting (PS) and
   retrieve. The PS mechanism can reduce the total number of tag collisions
   and the retrieve mechanism can reduce the extra idle slots caused by PS.
   In comparison with conventional pure tree-based schemes, the proposed
   PSR algorithm achieves higher efficiency without the need to estimate
   the number of tags; simulation results indicate an efficiency level of
   0.41. The PSR algorithm also has similar performance to state-of-the-art
   algorithms that do not need to estimate the number of tags, but it is
   simpler to implement and is thus preferred for resource constrained
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we adopt a multiobjective optimization for the bit and
   power allocation problem in order to meet the requirements of emerging
   wireless systems, i.e., achieving higher throughput without considerably
   increasing the transmit power. More specifically, we propose to
   simultaneously maximize the throughput and minimize the transmit power
   of an OFDM system subject to average bit error rate (BER), power budget,
   and maximum allocated number of bits per subcarrier constraints. The
   formulated optimization problem is not convex and we use an evolutionary
   algorithm, i.e., genetic algorithm, in order to obtain the solution. We
   study the structure of the problem and the obtained solution and notice
   that the constraint on the average BER can be replaced by a BER per
   subcarrier constraint. As such, we propose an approximate non-convex
   optimization problem. We further exploit the structure of the
   approximate optimization problem and notice that the BER constraint per
   subcarrier (i.e., the source of the non-convexity) must be satisfied
   with an equality sign and can be substituted; this leads to an
   equivalent convex optimization problem where the global optimality of
   the Pareto solutions is guaranteed. Closed-form expressions are obtained
   for the bit and power allocations with reduced complexity. Simulation
   results show that the proposed multiobjective optimization approach
   provides significant performance improvements over single objective
   optimization techniques presented in the literature, without incurring
   additional complexity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a low-complexity uniform power loading scheme
   for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with two
   reduced feedback mechanisms and analyze its performance over Rayleigh
   fading channels. In the first feedback mechanism, the receiver feeds
   back to the transmitter the channel gains and the indices of the best M
   subchannels; while for the second feedback mechanism, the receiver feeds
   back only the indices of the best M subchannels. The available power
   budget is equally distributed over the best M subchannels for both
   feedback mechanisms. We derive closed-form expressions for the
   achievable capacity and an upper bound on the outage capacity of the
   first and second mechanisms, respectively. A simple elimination
   algorithm is provided to find the optimal number of best subchannels M
   that maximizes the achievable capacity. Numerical results show the
   dependence of the optimal number of the best subchannels M on the system
   parameters. Additionally, the presented results interestingly show that
   the low-complexity uniform power loading scheme can achieve up to
   98.72\% of the channel capacity, obtained using the well-known
   waterfilling solution, when the optimal value of M is used. Moreover,
   the uniform power loading scheme can achieve up to 88.86\% of the energy
   efficiency at reduced complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of video analysis for a

   address the shortcomings of conventional data collection methods by
   conducting an automated study to obtain real-world bicycle data and

   observations. Basic traffic quantities such as average speed, volume
   count, flow rate, and density are automatically estimated and validated.
   Furthermore, traffic analysis applications are conducted on the
   collected data as a demonstration of the capabilities of the automated
   computer vision system. The analysis is applied to a data set collected
   through video cameras at a cycling event at the University of British
   Columbia. The analysis indicates the feasibility to automate the cyclist
   traffic data collection process in challenging, dense conditions. The
   reported results can provide a motivation for traffic engineers to rely
   on automated data collection as guidance during the decision-making

Abstract = {{Nanophotonic all-optical switching is anticipated to replace electronic

   subdiffractional focus called a photonic nanojet. The photonic nanojet
   materializes in a coating of semiconductor nano particles at the rear of

   coated by Si, CdTe, InP, and CuO nanoparticles, having radii of 40, 30,
   20, and 20 nm, reveal switching energies of 1 pJ, 500 fJ, 400 fJ, and
   300 fJ and switching times of 2 ps, 2.3 ps, 900 fs, and 350 fs,

Abstract = {{Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) are of global concern due to
   their persistence, bio-accumulation and toxicity. Although the fate of
   PCDDs in the environment is determined by their physical-chemical
   properties, such as aqueous solubility, vapor pressure, octanol/water-,
   air/water-, and octanol/water-partition coefficients, experimental
   property data on the entire set of 75 PCDD congeners are limited. The
   quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach is applied
   to predict the properties of all PCDD congeners. Experimental property
   data available from the literature are correlated against 16 molecular
   descriptors of five types. Reported and newly developed QSPR models for
   PCDDs are presented and reviewed. The values calculated by the best
   QSPRs are further adjusted to satisfy fundamental thermodynamic
   relationships. Although the single-descriptor models with chlorine
   number, molar volume, solvent accessible surface area and polarizability
   are based on good statistical results, these models cannot distinguish
   among PCDDs having the same chlorine number. The QSPR model based on the
   hyper-Wiener index of quantum-chemical descriptor gives useful
   statistical results and is able to distinguish among congeners with the
   same chlorine number, as well as satisfying thermodynamic relationships.
   The resulting consistent properties of the 75 PCDD congeners can be used
   for environmental modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification of cellulosic paper is demonstrated by employing
   plasma assisted atomic layer deposition. Al2O3 thin films are deposited
   on paper substrates, prepared with different fiber sizes, to improve
   their barrier properties. Thus, a hydrophobic paper is created with low
   gas permeability by combining the control of fiber size (and structure)
   with atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 films. Papers are prepared using
   Kraft softwood pulp and thermomechanical pulp. The cellulosic wood
   fibers are refined to obtain fibers with smaller length and diameter.
   Films of Al2O3, 10, 25, and 45 nm in thickness, are deposited on the
   paper surface. The work demonstrates that coating of papers prepared
   with long fibers efficiently reduces wettability with slight enhancement
   in gas permeability, whereas on shorter fibers, it results in
   significantly lower gas permeability. Wettability studies on Al2O3
   deposited paper substrates have shown water wicking and absorption over
   time only in papers prepared with highly refined fibers. It is also
   shown that there is a certain fiber size at which the gas permeability
   assumes its minimum value, and further decrease in fiber size will
   reverse the effect on gas permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Physical models of Ge energy band structure and material loss were
   implemented in LASTIP((TM)), a 2D simulation tool for edge emitting
   laser diodes. This model is able to match available experimental data.
   Important design parameters of a Fabry-Perot Ge laser, such as the
   cavity length, thickness, width, polycrystalline Si cladding layer
   thickness were studied and optimized. The laser structure optimizations
   alone were shown to reduce I-th by 22-fold and increase eta(d) and
   eta(i) by 11 and 6 times. The simulations also showed that improving the
   defect limited carrier lifetime is critical for achieving an efficient
   and low-threshold Ge laser. With the optimized structure design (300 mu
   m for the cavity length, 0.4 mu m for the cavity width, 0.3 mu m for the
   cavity thickness, and 0.6 mu m for the polycrystalline Si cladding layer
   thickness) and a defect limited carrier lifetime of 100 ns, a wall-plug
   efficiency of 14.6\% at 1 mW output is predicted, where J(th) of 2.8 kA
   cm(-2), I-th of 3.3 mA, I-1mW of 9 mA, and eta(d) of 23.6\% can be
   achieved. These are tremendous improvements from the available
   experimental values at 280 kA cm (2), 756 mA, 837 mA and 1.9\%,

Abstract = {{Deep level defects in p-type GaAs1-xBix (x < 1\%) and GaAs grown by
   molecular beam epitaxy at substrate temperatures of 330 degrees C and
   370 degrees C have been characterized by deep level transient
   spectroscopy. We find that incorporating Bi into GaAs at 330 degrees C
   does not affect the total concentration of hole traps, which is similar
   to 4 x 10(16) cm(-3), comparable to the concentration of electron traps
   observed in Si-doped GaAsBi having a similar alloy composition.
   Increasing the growth temperature of the p-type GaAsBi (x = 0.8\%) layer
   from 330 degrees C to 370 degrees C reduces the hole trap concentration
   by an order of magnitude. Moreover, the defects having near mid-gap
   energy levels that are the most efficient non-radiative recombination
   centers are present only in GaAsBi layers grown at the lower
   temperature. These new results are discussed in the context of previous
   measurements of n-type GaAs and GaAsBi layers grown under similar

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ashes are characterized by
   high calcium oxide (CaO) content. Carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption by
   MSWI fly ash was discussed based on thermogravimetry (TG)/differential
   thermal analysis (DTA), minerology analysis, and adapting the Stenoir
   equation. TG/DTA analysis showed that the weight gain of the fly ash
   below 440 degrees C was as high as 5.70 \%. An adapted Stenoir equation
   for MSWI fly ash was discussed. The chloride in MSWI fly ash has a major
   impact on CO2 adsorption by MSWI fly ash or air pollution control (APC)
   residues. Geochemical modeling of the critical trace elements copper
   (Cu), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and antimony (Sb) before and
   after carbonation was performed using a thermodynamic equilibrium model
   for solubility and a surface complexation model for metal sorption.
   Leaching of critical trace elements was generally found to be strongly
   dependent on the degree of carbonation attained, and their solubility
   appeared to be controlled by several minerals. Adsorption on ferrum (Fe)
   and aluminum (Al) colloids was also responsible for removal of the trace
   elements Cd, Pb, and Sb. We used Hakanson's potential ecological risk
   index (HPERI) to evaluate the risk of trace element leaching in general.
   The results demonstrate that the ecological risk showed a V-shaped
   dependency on pH; the optimum pH of the carbonated fly ash was found to
   be 10.3-11, resulting from the optimum carbonation (liquid-to-solid
   (L/S) ratio = 0.25, carbonation duration = similar to 30-48 h). The
   dataset and modeling results presented here provide a contribution to
   assessing the leaching behavior of MSWI fly ash under a wide range of
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has recognized
   machine-type communications (MTCs) as a vital medium to drive the
   Internet of Things (IoT). One of the key challenges in MTC is to reduce
   the energy consumption of the MTC user equipment (UE). Currently, the
   3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced (LTE-A) standards
   incorporate discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism for this purpose. In
   this paper, we propose a modified DRX mechanism incorporating the quick
   sleeping indication (QSI) as a novel, simple, and energy-efficient
   solution for low-complexity, low-mobility MTC UEs. We demonstrate our
   QSI transmission mechanisms using the broadcast and synchronization
   channels of LTE/LTE-A for MTC UEs in normal coverage and using the data
   channel for MTC UEs operating in ``coverage enhancement{''} (CE) mode.
   For MTC UEs in normal coverage, our simulation results and analysis show
   that our DRX with QSI mechanisms result in 45\% improvement in the
   energy efficiency and 66\% reduction in the computational complexity at
   the UE receiver, when compared to the current DRX mechanism. For MTC UEs
   with CE, the energy and computational efficiency increase to 63\% and
   68\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Facet joint injections and epidural needle insertions are widely used
   for spine anesthesia. Accurate needle placement is important for
   effective therapy delivery and avoiding complications arising from
   damage of soft tissue and nerves. Needle guidance is usually performed
   by fluoroscopy or palpation, resulting in radiation exposure and
   multiple needle re-insertions. Several ultrasound (US)-based approaches
   have been proposed but have not found wide acceptance in clinical
   routine. This is mainly due to difficulties in interpretation of the
   complex spinal anatomy in US, which leads to clinicians' lack of
   confidence in relying only on information derived from US for needle
   guidance.
   We introduce a multimodal joint registration technique that takes
   advantage of easy-to-interpret preprocedure computed topography (CT)
   scans of the lumbar spine to concurrently register a shape+pose model to
   the intraprocedure 3D US. Common shape coefficients are assumed between
   two modalities, while pose coefficients are specific to each modality.
   The joint method was evaluated on patient data consisting of ten pairs
   of US and CT scans of the lumbar spine. It was successfully applied in
   all cases and yielded an RMS shape error of 2.1 mm compared to the CT
   ground truth. The joint registration technique was compared to a
   previously proposed method of statistical model to US registration
   Rasoulian et al. (Information processing in computer-assisted
   interventions. Springer, Berlin, pp 51-60, 2013). The joint framework
   improved registration accuracy to US in 7 out of 17 visible vertebrae,
   belonging to four patients. In the remaining cases, the two methods were
   equally accurate.
   The joint registration allows visualization and augmentation of
   important anatomy in both the US and CT domain and improves the
   registration accuracy in both modalities. Observing the patient-specific
   model in the CT domain allows the clinicians to assess the local
   registration accuracy qualitatively, which is likely to increase their
   confidence in using the US model for deriving needle guidance decisions.}},

   ultrasound has been suggested as an alternative imaging tool for this
   procedure; however, it has not yet been integrated into clinical routine
   since ultrasound only provides a limited view of the scaphoid and its
   surrounding anatomy.
   We propose a registration of a statistical wrist shape + scale + pose
   model to a preoperative CT and intraoperative ultrasound to derive a
   patient-specific 3D model for guiding scaphoid fracture fixation. The
   registered model is then used to determine clinically important
   intervention parameters, including the screw length and the trajectory
   of screw insertion in the scaphoid bone.
   Feasibility experiments are performed using 13 cadaver wrists. In 10 out
   of 13 cases, the trajectory of screw suggested by the registered model
   meets all clinically important intervention parameters. Overall, an
   average 94 \% of maximum allowable screw length is obtained based on the
   measurements from gold standard CT. Also, we obtained an average 92 \%
   successful volar accessibility, which indicates that the trajectory is
   not obstructed by the surrounding trapezium bone.
   These promising results indicate that determining clinically important
   screw insertion parameters for scaphoid fracture fixation is feasible
   using 3D ultrasound imaging. This suggests the potential of this
   technology in replacing fluoroscopic guidance for this procedure in
   future applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to detect a standard handheld needle
   in ultrasound-guided interventions.
   Our proposal is to use natural hand tremor, which causes minute
   displacement of the needle, to detect the needle in ultrasound B-mode
   images. Subtle displacements arising from tremor motion have a periodic
   pattern which is usually imperceptible to the naked eye in the B-mode
   image. We use these displacement measurements in a spatiotemporal
   framework to detect linear structures with periodic pattern among a
   sequence of frames. The needle trajectory is estimated as a linear path
   in the image having maximum spectral correlation with the time trace of
   displacement due to tremor. A coarse estimation process is followed by a
   fine estimation step, where the motion pattern is analyzed along
   spatiotemporal linear paths with various angles originating from the
   estimated puncture site, within the trajectory channel. Spectral
   coherency is derived for each sample path versus the reference path, and
   the needle trajectory is identified as the mean of the sample paths with
   the maximum coherence within the tremor frequency range.
   To evaluate the detection accuracy, we tested the method in vivo on
   porcine tissue, where the needle was inserted into the biceps femoris
   muscle. To understand whether tremor itself affects needle position, the
   maximum angular change due to tremor was calculated: mean, standard
   deviation (SD) and root-mean-square (RMS) measurement of and . The
   accuracy of the needle trajectory was calculated by comparing to an
   expert manual segmentation, averaged over the captured data and
   presented in mean, SD and RMS error of and , respectively.
   Results demonstrate that natural tremor motion creates minute coherent
   motion along the needle, which could be used to localize the needle
   trajectory within the acceptable accuracy. This method is suitable for
   standard needles used clinically.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) pose recovery and tracking from
   X-ray images is a key enabling technology for many interventional
   imaging applications. However, real-time 2D/3D registration is a very
   challenging problem because of the heavy computation in iterative
   digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation. In this paper, we
   propose a real-time 2D/3D registration framework using library-based
   DRRs to achieve high computational efficiency.
   The proposed method pre-computes a library of canonical DRRs and
   reconstructs library-based DRRs (libDRRs) during registration without
   online rendering. The transformation parameters are decoupled to 2
   geometry-relevant and 4 geometry-irrelevant ones so that canonical DRRs
   only need to cover the variation of 2 geometry-relevant parameters,
   making it practical to be pre-computed and stored. The 2D/3D
   registration using libDRRs is then solved as a hybrid optimization
   problem, i.e., continuous in geometry-irrelevant parameters while
   discrete in geometry-relevant parameters.
   On 5 fluoroscopic sequences with 246 frames acquired during animal
   studies with a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe in the field
   of view, 6DoF tracking of the TEE probe using the proposed method
   achieved a mean target registration error in the projection direction
   (mTREproj) of 0.81 mm, a success rate of 100 \% (defined as mTREproj 2.5
   mm), and a registration frame rate of 23.1 fps on a pure CPU-based
   implementation executed in a single thread.
   Using libDRRs with a hybrid optimization can significantly improve the
   computational efficiency (up to tenfold) for 6DoF pose recovery and
   tracking with little degradation in robustness and accuracy, compared to
   conventional intensity-based 2D/3D registration using ray casting DRRs
   with a continuous optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The episodic movement of deep-seated landslides is often governed by the
   presence of high pore pressures and reduced effective stresses along
   active shear surfaces. Pore pressures are subject to cyclic fluctuation
   under seasonal variations of groundwater recharge, resulting in an
   intermittent movement characterized by acceleration-deceleration phases.
   However, it is not always clear why certain acceleration phases reach
   alarming levels without a clear trigger (i.e., in the absence of an
   exceptional pore pressure event). This paper presents a conceptual
   framework linking hydromechanical cycling, progressive failure and
   fatigue to investigate and explain the episodic behavior of deep-seated
   landslides using the Campo Vallemaggia landslide in Switzerland as a
   case study. A combination of monitoring data and advanced numerical
   modeling is used. The principal processes forcing the slope into a
   critical disequilibrium state are analyzed as a function of rock mass
   damage and fatigue. Modeling results suggest that during periods of
   slope acceleration, the rock slope experiences localized fatigue and
   gradual weakening through slip along pre-existing natural fractures and
   yield of critically stressed intact rock bridges. At certain intervals,
   pockets of critically weakened rock may produce a period of enhanced
   slope movement in response to a small pore pressure increase similar to
   those routinely experienced each year. Accordingly, the distribution and
   connectivity of pre-existing permeable planes of weakness play a central
   role. These structures are often related to the rock mass's tectonic
   history or initiate (and dilate) in response to stress changes that
   disturb the entire slope, such as glacial unloading or seismic loading
   via large earthquakes. The latter is discussed in detail in a companion
   paper to this (Gischig et al., Rock Mech Rock Eng, 2015). The results
   and framework presented further demonstrate that episodic movement and
   progressive failure of deep-seated landslides cannot be analyzed by
   means of classical limit equilibrium tools but require advanced
   numerical models. When calibrated against slope monitoring data, the
   improved understanding of episodic slope movements can lead to more
   reliable early warning forecasting and improved landslide hazard
   management.}},

   damaging rock slopes. Given the typically long recurrence time and
   unpredictability of earthquakes, field-based investigations of
   co-seismic rock slope deformations are difficult. We present here a
   conceptual numerical study that demonstrates how repeated earthquake
   activity over time can destabilize a relatively strong rock slope by
   creating and propagating new fractures until the rock mass is
   sufficiently weakened to initiate catastrophic failure. Our results
   further show that the damage and displacement induced by a certain
   earthquake strongly depends on pre-existing damage. In fact, the damage
   history of the slope influences the earthquake-induced displacement as
   much as earthquake ground motion characteristics such as the peak ground
   acceleration. Because seismically induced fatigue is: (1) characterized
   by low repeat frequency, (2) represents a large amplitude damage event,
   and (3) weakens the entire rock mass, it differs from other fatigue
   processes. Hydro-mechanical cycles, for instance, occur at higher repeat
   frequencies (i.e., annual cycles), lower amplitude, and only affect
   limited parts of the rock mass. Thus, we also compare seismically
   induced fatigue to seasonal hydro-mechanical fatigue. While earthquakes
   can progressively weaken even a strong, competent rock mass,
   hydro-mechanical fatigue requires a higher degree of pre-existing damage
   to be effective. We conclude that displacement rates induced by
   hydro-mechanical cycling are indicative of the degree of pre-existing
   damage in the rock mass. Another indicator of pre-existing damage is the
   seismic amplification pattern of a slope; frequency-dependent
   amplification factors are highly sensitive to changes in the fracture
   network within the slope. Our study demonstrates the importance of
   including fatigue-related damage history-in particular, seismically
   induced fatigue-into landslide stability and hazard assessments.}},

Abstract = {{A review of available literature and current governance approaches
   related to the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water
   quality (including drinking water) was developed. The paper identifies
   gaps in literature and (or) current governance approaches that should be
   addressed to guide decision-makers in the development of appropriate
   regulatory regimes that will enable assessment of the impacts of
   hydraulic fracturing on water quality. The lack of credible and
   comprehensive data are shown to have been a major setback to properly
   investigate and monitor hydraulic fracturing activities and their
   potential risks on the environment and water quality. A review of
   current governance approaches demonstrates that some jurisdictions have
   implemented baseline and post-operation water quality monitoring
   requirements; however, there are large variations in site-specific
   monitoring requirements across Canada and the United States. In light of
   recent information, a targeted approach is suggested based on risk
   priorities, which can prioritize sample collection and frequency, target
   contaminants, and the needed duration of the sampling. The steps
   outlined in this review help to interface with the public concerns
   associated with water quality, and appropriately ensure that public
   health is protected through appropriate water safety planning.}},

Abstract = {{Brushless permanent magnet motor drives based on Hall sensors have
   received significant attention in recent years. In this area, the faults
   of Hall sensors become a new concern and several fault-tolerant control
   (FTC) methods have been proposed. However, most of the state-of-the-art
   FTC methods require some time to reconstruct the correct Hall sensor
   signals, which results in significant transient currents and speed dip
   during fault diagnostic process (FDP). In this paper, a new and improved
   FTC scheme based on FDP and vector-tracking observer is proposed. A
   method to identify the duration of FDP is proposed based on the analysis
   of acceleration estimation and the fault diagnosis results. During FDP,
   the method defaults to an open-loop observer control, which removes the
   undesirable current/torque transient. After that, the close-loop
   observer is re-enabled and the motor operation is restored. The proposed
   FTC is demonstrated in detailed simulations and experimentally on 120
   degrees brushless dc motor drives and sinusoidal PM motor drives. For
   both types of drives, a significant improvement is achieved in steady
   state and transient operation with faults of up to two Hall sensors,
   which has not been possible with available alternative FTC approaches
   (unless a sensorless control is used).}},

Abstract = {{In IEEE 802.11 infrastructure wireless local area network (WLAN), the
   communication between any two nodes is relayed by an access point (AP),
   which becomes the bottleneck of WLAN and severely restricts the overall
   throughput. It is well known that network coding technique is able to
   greatly improve the throughput of wireless networks. But, the available
   coding schemes do not make full advantage of channel capacity due to the
   fact that they pick at most one packet from each data flow for coding
   and the picked packets may have a great difference in packet size,
   wasting some channel capacity. To remedy the problem, in this paper, we
   propose the coding scheme that combines multiple buffered packets in one
   flow into a larger packet for coding so that the packets participating
   in coding have close sizes. We formulate an integer programming problem
   to find the optimal packet coding, which is solved by an optimal
   algorithm with relative high time complexity together with a heuristic
   algorithm with relative low time complexity. Simulation results show
   that the proposed coding scheme is able to greatly improve the
   throughput of WLAN and the throughput gain increases with the growth of
   the number of coding flows.}},

Abstract = {{In recent studies of atmospheric turbulent surface exchange in complex
   terrain, questions arise concerning velocity-sensor tilt corrections and
   the governing flow equations for coordinate systems aligned with steep
   slopes. The standard planar-fit method, a popular tilt-correction
   technique, must be modified when applied to complex mountainous terrain.
   The ramifications of these adaptations have not previously been fully
   explored. Here, we carefully evaluate the impacts of the selection of
   sector size (the range of flow angles admitted for analysis) and
   planar-fit averaging time. We offer a methodology for determining an
   optimized sector-wise planar fit (SPF), and evaluate the sensitivity of
   momentum fluxes to varying these SPF input parameters. Additionally, we
   clarify discrepancies in the governing flow equations for slope-aligned
   coordinate systems that arise in the buoyancy terms due to the
   gravitational vector no longer acting along a coordinate axis. New
   adaptions to the momentum equations and turbulence kinetic energy budget
   equation allow for the proper treatment of the buoyancy terms for purely
   upslope or downslope flows, and for slope flows having a cross-slope
   component. Field data show that new terms in the slope-aligned forms of
   the governing flow equations can be significant and should not be
   omitted. Since the optimized SPF and the proper alignment of buoyancy
   terms in the governing flow equations both affect turbulent fluxes,
   these results hold implications for similarity theory or budget analyses
   for which accurate flux estimates are important.}},

Title = {{Connections between the Ozmidov scale and mean velocity profile in
   stably stratified atmospheric surface layers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{797}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The mean velocity profile (MVP) in thermally stratified atmospheric
   surface layers (ASLs) deviates from the classic logarithmic form. A
   theoretical framework was recently proposed (Katul et al. Phys. Rev.
   Lett., vol. 107, 2011, 268502) to link the MVP to the spectrum of
   turbulence and was found to successfully predict the MVP for unstable
   stratification. However, the theory failed to reproduce the MVP in
   stable conditions (Salesky et al. Phys. Fluids, vol. 25, 2013, 105101),
   especially when zeta > 0.2 (where zeta is the atmospheric stability
   parameter). In the present study, it is demonstrated that this
   shortcoming is due to the failure to identify the appropriate length
   scale that characterizes the size of momentum transporting eddies in the
   stable ASL. Beyond zeta approximate to 0.2 (near where the original
   theory fails), the Ozmidov length scale becomes smaller than the
   distance from the wall z and hence is a more stringent constraint for
   characterizing the size of turbulent eddies. An expression is derived to
   connect the Ozmidov length scale to the normalized MVP (phi(m)),
   allowing phi(m) to he solved numerically. It is found that the revised
   theory produces a prediction of phi(m) in good agreement with the widely
   used empirical Businger-Dyer relation and two experimental damsels in
   the stable ASL. The results here demonstrate that the behaviour of
   phi(m) the stable ASL is closely linked to the size of momentum
   transporting eddies, which can he characterized by the Ozmidov scale
   under mildly to moderately stable conditions (0.2 < zeta < 1 - 2).}},

   using global positioning systems (GPS), accelerometers, LVDTs, and so
   forth. Each of these methods has limitations in terms of accuracy, cost,
   installation, and so on. In this study, a novel, laser-based in situ
   interstory drift measurement setup is proposed and tested on a shake
   table on which the laser sensors were mounted in the frame to measure
   interstory drift without any reference frame. The in situ measurements
   are compared with measurements from reference lasers, which are mounted
   on a frame separate from the structure. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic (PV) power converters and maximum power point tracking
   (MPPT) algorithms are required to ensure maximum energy transfer between
   the PV panel and the load. The requirements for the MPPT algorithms have
   increased over the years-the algorithms are required to be increasingly
   accurate, fast, and versatile, while reducing the intrusiveness on the
   overall performance of the PV panel and converter. The family of
   hill-climbing algorithms such as incremental conductance (InCond) and
   perturb and observe (P\&O) has gained popularity given their simplicity
   and accuracy, but it requires the injection of a perturbation that
   changes the operating point even in steady state and are prone to errors
   during changing environmental conditions. In recent literature, the use
   of the switching ripple has been proposed to replace the perturbation in
   the hill-climbing algorithms given its inherent presence in the system
   and speed. The constant work toward smaller and faster ripples presents
   challenges to the signal detection involved in this kind of algorithm.
   This paper develops and implements a new InCond MPPT technique based on
   switching ripple detection using a digital lock-in amplifier (LIA) to
   extract the amplitude of the oscillation ripple even in the presence of
   noise. The use of this advanced technique allows to push forward the
   reduction of the ripple in order to virtually eliminate the oscillation
   in steady state maximizing the efficiency. The accurate detection allows
   for adaptive-step features for fast tracking of changing environmental
   conditions while keeping the efficiency at maximum during the steady
   state. Detailed mathematical analysis of the proposed technique is
   provided. Overall, the use of the proposed LIA allows to push the
   reduction of the ripple even more while keeping accuracy and delivering
   superior performance. Simulations and experimental results are provided
   for the proposed technique and the InCond technique in order to validate
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to assess specific side-stream
   treatment processes for biodegradation and precipitation of dissolved
   nutrients in dewatering centrate. In this study, characterization was
   made of a conventional suspended growth deammonification treatment
   process for transforming dissolved polyphosphate (poly-P), dissolved
   organic phosphorus (DOP) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in two
   types of dewatering centrate. The deammonification process was
   configured as a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), combining partial
   nitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) in a single
   tank. The first centrate feed studied was from the full-scale Annacis
   Island wastewater treatment plant (AIWWTP) located in Metro Vancouver,
   Canada. The second centrate feed was from a lab-scale anaerobic digester
   (AD) fed waste sludge from the existing City of Kelowna Wastewater
   Treatment Facility (KWTF), located in the Okanagan Valley, Canada. In
   addition, poly aluminum chloride (PACL) dosing was assessed for final
   polishing of dissolved nutrients. The deammonification SBR (DeSBR)
   process showed similar treatment characteristics for both the KWTF and
   AIWWTP centrates with excellent DON removal and poor non-reactive
   dissolved phosphorus (NRDP) removal. A statistical comparison of the DOP
   and poly-P through the DeSBR process suggests that DOP has a higher
   biodegradation potential. Future research focused on understanding the
   variables associated with degradation of DOP could lead to better NRDP
   removal through deammonification processes. Utilization of a
   post-anammox PACL chemical dosing stage can achieve the objective of
   precipitating any residual DON and NRDP and producing an effluent that
   has lower dissolved nutrients than the pre-digestion KWTF dewatering
   centrate scenario. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In smart cities, cellular network plays a crucial role to support
   wireless access for numerous devices anywhere and anytime. The future 5G
   network aims to build the infrastructure from mobile internet to
   connected world. Small Cell is one of the most promising technologies of
   5G to provide more connections and high data rate. In order to make the
   best use of small cell technology, smart cell planning should be
   implemented to guarantee connectivity and performance for all end nodes.
   It is particularly a challenging task to deploy dense small cells in the
   presence of dynamic traffic demands and severe co-channel interference.
   In this paper, we model various traffic patterns using stochastic
   geometry approach and propose an energy-efficient scheme to deploy and
   plan small cells according to the prevailing traffic pattern. The
   simulation results indicate that our scheme can meet dynamic traffic
   demands with optimized deployment of small cells and enhance the energy
   efficiency of the system without compromising on quality-of-service
   (QoS) requirements. In addition, our scheme can achieve very close
   performance compared with the leading optimization solver CPLEX and find
   solutions in much less computational times than CPLEX. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{76-91}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In previous publications by the authors (Zobeiry et al., 2006; Zobeiry
   et al., 2010), a differential form of viscoelasticity was presented as
   an efficient approach for modelling the response of polymer matrix
   composites. In this paper, the one-dimensional formulation previously
   presented in (Zobeiry et al., 2006), is extended to include the
   three-dimensional behaviour of both isotropic and transversely isotropic
   viscoelastic materials. For this purpose, the time-dependent variation
   of all material properties and effect of temperature changes are taken
   into account. The finite element formulation of the constitutive
   equation is developed such that it can be applied solely at the
   integration point level of an element, thus facilitating its
   implementation in most commercial finite element codes. In this study,
   the constitutive formulation is implemented in the finite element
   software, Abaqus, as a user material model and is verified through
   simulation of a few benchmark numerical examples. The capabilities of
   the current differential viscoelasticity approach compared to other
   available viscoelastic models, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency,
   are demonstrated and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Drinking water quality is mainly influenced by the variable quality of
   source water, which is affected by both meteorological and climate
   factors. Contrary to medium and large municipalities, small systems do
   not have appropriate equipment to face important variations of raw water
   quality, and they do not have enough information either on the impact of
   these alterations. The objective of this study is to develop a
   decision-making tool to small system operators allowing the
   determination of risk periods, based on easily accessible measures. The
   impact of several raw water quality parameters and climate factors on
   drinking water quality was under study. A stepwise regression analysis
   was applied to determine the most important factors. Two of them were
   retained: the level of UV254 of raw water and average maximal air
   temperature of 15 days before measurement. These factors are
   representative of raw water quality or meteorological conditions and are
   easily accessible to systems with restricted financial capacities. A
   logistic regression analysis contributed to the estimation of the
   probability to provide drinking water of bad quality (defined by a
   drinking water quality index). Finally, results of the analysis were
   synthetized in a visual tool, allowing the identification of risk
   periods using the known values of UV254 and average maximal air
   temperature of 15 days. This tool may strongly contribute to the
   improvement of drinking water management in small systems, as it
   provides easily accessible information on the risks of deterioration of
   drinking water quality using two simple parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative decision support system (DSS) for
   prognostic and diagnostic analyses of water distribution system (WDS)
   failures. The framework of the DSS is based on four novel models
   developed and published by the authors of this paper. The four models
   include reliability assessment model, leakage potential model, leakage
   detection model, and water quality failure potential model. Information
   obtained from these models together with external information such as
   customer complaints, lab test results (if any), and historical
   information are integrated using Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory to
   evaluate prognostic and diagnostic capabilities of the DSS. The
   prognostic capabilities of the DSS provide hydraulic and water quality
   states of a WDS whereas the diagnostic capabilities of the DSS help to
   identify the failure location with minimal time after the occurrence and
   will help to reduce false positive and false negative predictions. The
   framework has `unique' capacity to bring the modeling information
   (hydraulic and Quality), consumer complaints, historical failure data,
   and laboratory test information under a single platform to perform a
   prognostic and diagnostic investigation of WDS failures (hydraulic and
   Quality). The proof of concept of the DSS has been demonstrated using
   data used in published four articles. The outcomes of this research
   widely addressed the uncertainties associated with WDS which improves
   the efficiency and effectiveness of diagnosis and prognosis analyses of
   WDS. It is expected that the developed integrated framework will help
   municipalities to make informed decisions to increase the safety,
   reliability and the security of public health.}},

   metals which permits the QM treatment of a small region chosen from a
   large, arbitrary MM domain to calculate total system energy and relaxed
   geometry. In order to test our improved method, we compute
   solute-vacancy binding in bulk Al as well as the binding of Mg and Pb to
   a symmetric Sigma 5 grain boundary. Results are calculated with and
   without our improvement to the QM/MM scheme and compared to periodic QM
   results for the same systems. We find that our scheme accurately and
   efficiently reproduces periodic QM target values in these test systems

Abstract = {{Using hot aggregates, in concrete production, results in a drop in
   compressive strength of the produced concrete. Various methods have been
   proposed for cooling concrete aggregates. This paper proposes new two
   designs for aggregates cooling systems for various production rate

   rotating drum for high production rates. Simulation of the heat flow
   during the cooling process over the conveyor and through the drum are
   analyzed with the objective of understanding the effect of the various
   design parameters and achieving minimum cooling time with the least
   possible power. Finite element models for the new designs are proposed
   and discussed. The results of the finite element analysis of the new
   designs are presented for various initial conditions and cooling rates.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-sensitive sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy
   and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were used to study the
   interactions between water molecules and the surfactant polyoxyethylene
   glycol alkyl ether (C12E4) at its critical micelle concentration. The
   surfactant enhanced the positive peak of water's SFG spectrum suggesting
   that C12E4 was more anionic-like, even though the surfactant was overall
   neutral. MD simulations showed that the surfactant increased the depth
   of the surface anisotropic layer from 0.31 to 1.82 nm and the average
   number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule from 2.7 to 3.1. For water
   molecules near the surfactant, their H and O atoms are confined in well
   -separated shells. Both the O and C atoms in the head group of the
   surfactant are surrounded by the H atoms, instead of the O atoms, of
   water indicating that the negatively charged O atoms of the surfactant
   play a more important role than the C atoms in determining the
   orientation of water. The simulation also showed that the orientation of
   surface water molecules was flipped in the presence of the surfactant,
   which was consistent with the observed SFG spectra. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Effects of scanning orientation on outlier formation in 3D laser
   scanning of reflective surfaces}},
Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{35-45}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Inspecting objects with reflective surfaces using 3D laser scanning is a
   demanded but challenging part inspection task due to undesirable
   specular reflections, which produce extensive outliers in the scanned
   point cloud. These outliers need to be removed in order to alleviate
   subsequent data processing issues. Many existing automatic outlier
   removal methods do not detect outliers according to the outlier
   formation properties. As a result, these methods only offer limited
   capabilities in removing extensive and complex outliers from scanning
   objects with reflective surfaces. This paper reports an empirical study
   which experimentally investigates the outlier formation characteristics
   in relation to the scanning orientation of the laser probe. The
   objective is to characterize the scanning orientation effects on outlier
   formation in order to facilitate the development of an effective outlier
   detection and removal method. Such an experimental investigation was
   hardly done before. It has been found in this work that scanning
   orientation can directly affect outlier extensity and occurrence in 3D
   laser scanning. A general guidance on proper scan path planning can then
   be provided with an aim to reduce the occurrence of outliers. Further,
   the observed dependency of outlier formation on scanning orientation can
   be exploited to facilitate effective and automatic outlier detection and
   removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Breath biomarkers were used to study uptake of traffic-related volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) from urban bicycling. Breath analysis was
   selected because it is one of the least invasive methods to assess urban
   traveler exposure. Research hurdles that were overcome included
   considering that factors other than on-road exposure can influence
   concentrations in the body, and absorbed doses during a trip can be
   small compared. to baseline body burdens. Pre-trip, on-road, and
   post-trip breath concentrations and ambient air concentrations were
   determined for 26 VOCs for bicyclists traveling on different path types.
   Statistical analyses of the concentration data identified eight
   monoaromatic hydrocarbons potentially useful as breath biomarkers to
   compare differences in body levels brought about by urban travel
   choices,: Breath concentrations of the biomarker compounds were
   significantly higher than background levels after riding on high-traffic
   arterial streets and on a path through a high-exposure industrial area,
   but not after riding On low-traffic local streets or on other off-street
   paths. Modeled effects of high-traffic streets on ambient concentrations
   were 100-200\% larger than those of low-traffic streets; modeled effects
   of-high-traffic streets on breath concentrations were 40-100\% larger
   than those of low-traffic streets. Similar percentage increases in
   breath concentrations are expected for bicyclists in other cities.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{140-154}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, layout optimization of structures under seismic loads is
   investigated. The difficulties faced in using actual earthquake records
   in the optimization process are addressed and some methods are proposed
   to deal with them. The objective is to minimize a suitable norm of
   displacements of the structure. Since the procedure is extremely
   time-consuming, along with using the actual record, an artificial
   record, created by employing basic concepts in earthquake engineering,
   is used for the optimization process. A series of Gaussian wave packet
   functions are used to fit the frequency content of the new artificial
   record to that of the actual one. The parameters obtained are reported
   for further studies. The well-known Solid Isotropic Material with
   Penalization (SIMP) method is employed and it is demonstrated that clear
   layouts may be found through an approach recently proposed by the
   authors based on the use of a nodal based interpolation of the design
   variables followed by a sequence of design mesh refining. The results of
   some numerical experiments are presented for a number of sample problems

Abstract = {{In this work, a new method for inserting a surface as an internal
   boundary into an existing unstructured tetrahedral mesh is developed.
   The surface is discretized by initially placing vertices on its bounding
   curves, defining a length scale at every location on each boundary curve
   based on the local underlying mesh, and equidistributing length scale
   along these curves between vertices. The surface is then sampled based
   on this boundary discretization, resulting in a surface mesh spaced in a
   way that is consistent with the initial mesh. The new points are then
   inserted into the mesh, and local refinement is performed, resulting in
   a final mesh containing a representation of the surface while preserving
   mesh quality. The advantage of this algorithm over generating a new mesh
   from scratch is in allowing for the majority of existing simulation data
   to be preserved and not have to be interpolated onto the new mesh. This
   algorithm is demonstrated in two and three dimensions on problems with
   and without intersections with existing internal boundaries. Copyright

Abstract = {{A homologous series of donor--acceptor dyes was synthesized, differing
   only in the identity of the halogen substituents about the
   triphenylamine (TPA; donor) portion of each molecule. Each Dye-X (X=F,
   Cl, Br, and I) was immobilized on a TiO2 surface to investigate how the
   halogen substituents affect the reaction between the light-induced
   charge-separated state, TiO2(e(-))/Dye-X+, with iodide in solution.
   Transient absorption spectroscopy showed progressively faster reactivity
   towards nucleophilic iodide with more polarizable halogen substituents:
   Dye-F < Dye-Cl < Dye-Br < Dye-I. Given that all other structural and
   electronic properties for the series are held at parity, with the
   exception of an increasingly larger electropositive sigma-hole on the
   heavier halogens, the differences in dye regeneration kinetics for
   Dye-Cl, Dye-Br, and Dye-I are ascribed to the extent of halogen bonding
   with the nucleophilic solution species.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the radiation dose in computed tomography (CT) is highly
   desirable but it leads to excessive noise in the projection
   measurements. This can significantly reduce the diagnostic value of the
   reconstructed images. Removing the noise in the projection measurements
   is, therefore, essential for reconstructing high-quality images,
   especially in low-dose CT. In recent years, two new classes of
   patch-based denoising algorithms proved superior to other methods in
   various denoising applications. The first class is based on sparse
   representation of image patches in a learned dictionary. The second
   class is based on the non-local means method. Here, the image is
   searched for similar patches and the patches are processed together to
   find their denoised estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel
   denoising algorithm for cone-beam CT projections. The proposed method
   has similarities to both these algorithmic classes but is more effective
   and much faster. In order to exploit both the correlation between
   neighboring pixels within a projection and the correlation between
   pixels in neighboring projections, the proposed algorithm stacks noisy
   cone-beam projections together to form a 3D image and extracts small
   overlapping 3D blocks from this 3D image for processing. We propose a
   fast algorithm for clustering all extracted blocks. The central
   assumption in the proposed algorithm is that all blocks in a cluster
   have a joint-sparse representation in a well-designed dictionary. We
   describe algorithms for learning such a dictionary and for denoising a
   set of projections using this dictionary. We apply the proposed
   algorithm on simulated and real data and compare it with three other
   algorithms. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
   some of the best denoising algorithms, while also being much faster.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{287-299}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion of oil and gas transmission pipelines is a serious industrial
   problem with potentially catastrophic environmental and financial
   consequences. A finite element model of the external corrosion of buried
   steel pipelines at coating failures is developed here to better predict
   degradation in different soil and cathodic protection (CP) environments.
   Synergistic interactions between steady-state temperature, potential,
   and oxygen concentration profiles in the soil surrounding the pipeline
   structure are quantified and discussed. Conductivity and oxygen
   diffusivity of soil conditions are represented as functions of soil
   matter, air porosity, and volumetric wetness. Theoretical formulations
   are uniquely merged with corrosion experiments conducted on actual
   pipeline steel samples, greatly improving simulation results. Overall,
   drier sand and clay soil structures cause the most corrosion, whereas
   wetter conditions impede oxygen diffusion and significantly augment
   hydrogen evolution. Geometric location of the coating breakdown site
   relative to the ground surface and the CP anode has a particular
   influence on oxygen concentration profiles and pipeline corrosion. Model
   convergence is tested with a mesh sensitivity study, and the model's
   ability in evaluating practical design changes in the CP system is
   demonstrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study reveals that the conventional notion that thermal
   contact resistance increases with porosity does not necessary hold. It
   is proved through a mechanistic robust model that, under specific
   circumstances, the porosities of two contacting bodies attain a critical
   value beyond which the contact resistance counter-intuitively drops. The
   model focuses on micro porous layers (MPLs) coated on gas diffusion
   layers (GDLs) of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and is
   validated with the MPL-GDL thermal contact resistance measured over a
   range of pressure.
   The counter-intuitive reduction of the contact resistance with porosity
   can find important applications in energy conversion systems such as
   PEMFCs and batteries where contact resistance plays a major role in
   ohmic loss and heat management. This game changing finding can lead to
   improving mass and heat transfer, diffusivity and permeability of porous
   materials by increasing the porosity without any compromise on contact
   resistance or ohmic loss. The present cutting-edge research can also
   open new avenues for fuel cell and any other manufacturers to develop
   state-of-the-art materials with higher porosities but lower contact
   resistances, which are currently not available in the market. Copyright

   It is applied here to detection of rearrangements in the anaplastic

   lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC patients may carry a nonreciprocal
   translocation on human chromosome 2, in which synchronized double
   stranded breaks (DSB) within the echinoderm microtubule-associated
   protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and ALK lead to an inversion of genetic
   material that forms the non-natural gene fusion EML4-ALK encoding a
   constitutively active tyrosine kinase that is associated with 3 to 7\%
   of all NSCLCs. Detection of ALK rearrangements is currently achieved in
   clinics through direct visualization via a fluorescent in situ
   hybridization (FISH) assay, which can detect those rearrangements to a
   limit of detection (LOD) of ca. 15\%. We show that the ddPCR assay

Abstract = {{A survey of pit wall monitoring practices was conducted at all large
   open pit copper-molybdenum mines in British Columbia. The survey found
   that these mines tend to rely on visual inspection and prism surveys as
   the primary techniques for pit wall management. Open standpipe
   piezometers and wire-line extensometers are also used. Newer monitoring
   technologies are slow to be adopted by the mines. One exception is slope
   stability radar, which is used at two mines. All mines have established
   movement thresholds that trigger different operational responses. These
   thresholds do not appear to be based on the pit depth or rock mass
   conditions.}},

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The question is sometimes asked: ``How does the durability of shotcrete
   compare to that of cast-in-place concrete?{''} The durability of
   shotcrete and concrete structures is strongly influenced by their
   transport properties. While considerable data are available regarding
   the transport properties of cast-in-place concrete, little has been
   published concerning shotcrete transport properties. This study is
   directed at addressing this deficiency so that factual data are made
   available regarding the comparative transport properties of both wet,
   and dry-mix shotcretes and comparable cast-in-place concretes. In this
   study, a comparative evaluation was conducted on cast-in-place concrete;
   cast wet-mix shotcrete; sprayed wet-mix shotcrete; and sprayed dry-mix
   shotcrete in mixtures with and without fly ash, silica fume, and
   accelerators. Plastic concrete and wet-mix shotcrete tests conducted
   included slump, air content, and setting time. Hardened concrete and
   shotcrete tests conducted included compressive strength at 7 and 28
   days; ASTM C642 boiled absorption and volume of permeable voids; ASTM
   C1202 rapid chloride permeability (RCP); ASTM C1792 rate of water
   absorption; and U.S. Navy specification UFGS 03 31 29-3 (chloride
   permeability test). Calculated transport property values compared
   included boiled absorption (BA) and volume of permeable voids (VPV),
   Coulomb values in RCP test, coefficient of diffusion (Diff{[}OH-]),
   effective coefficient of diffusion (Diff{[}OH-] x VPV), permeability (k)
   and tortuosity, in U.S. Navy specification UFGS 03 31 29-3 tests. This
   study demonstrates that properly applied wet-mix and dry-mix shotcretes
   can provide equivalent or superior transport properties (for example,
   ionic diffusion and permeability), and hence durability, to
   cast-in-place concrete.}},

   distinctly different from other CMOS RF rectifier designs which use
   voltage multiplier techniques. Power losses in the rectifier are
   analyzed including saturation resistance in the switch, inductor losses,
   and current/voltage overlap losses. The rectifier circuit includes a
   50-Omega single-ended RF input port with on-chip matching. The circuit
   is self-biased and completely powered from the RF input signal.
   Experimental results for the rectifier show a peak RF-to-dc conversion

Abstract = {{The problem of joint downlink cell association (CA) and wireless
   backhaul bandwidth allocation (WBBA) in two-tier cellular heterogeneous
   networks (HetNets) is investigated. Large-scale antenna array is
   implemented at the macro base station (BS), while the small cells within
   the macro cell range are single-antenna BSs and they rely on
   over-the-air links to the macro BS for back-hauling. A sum logarithmic
   user rate maximization problem is studied under the wireless backhaul
   constraints. Duplex and spectrum sharing with co-channel reverse
   time-division duplex (TDD) and dynamic soft frequency reuse is
   considered for interference management in the two-tier HetNet employing
   large-scale antenna arrays at the macro BS and wireless backhauling for
   small cells. Two in-band WBBA scenarios, namely, unified bandwidth
   allocation and per-small-cell bandwidth allocation, are investigated for
   joint CA-WBBA in the HetNet. A two-level hierarchical decomposition
   method for relaxed optimization is employed to solve the mixed-integer
   nonlinear program (MINLP). Solutions based on the General Algorithm
   Modeling System (GAMS) optimization solver and fast heuristics are also
   proposed for cell association in the per-small-cell WBBA scenario. It is
   shown that when all small cells have to use in-band wireless backhaul,
   the system load has more impact on both the sum logarithmic rate and
   per-user rate performance than the number of small cells deployed within
   the macro cell range. The proposed joint CA-WBBA algorithms have an
   optimal load approximately equal to the size of the large-scale antenna
   array at the macro BS. The cell range expansion (CRE) strategy, which is
   an efficient cell association scheme for HetNets with ideal backhauling,
   is shown to be inefficient when in-band wireless backhauling for small
   cells comes into play.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the performance of cooperative
   communication in decentralized wireless networks under unsaturated
   traffic conditions with randomly positioned single-hop
   source-destination pairs and relays, where interference is the main
   performance-limiting factor. The traffic unsaturation and concurrent
   cooperative transmissions introduce a correlation between the interferer
   density and the packet retransmission probability, and a correlation of
   interference power in both space and time domains, which complicate the
   interference characterization. Based on queueing theory and stochastic
   geometry, the stationary interferer density is derived by solving a
   fixed-point equation, which is proved to have a unique solution.
   According to the relay selection scheme, we characterize the correlation
   of interference power in two consecutive time-slots by identifying the
   densities of source and relay retransmissions. Based on the interferer
   density and interference correlation, we derive the outage probability
   and average packet delay of the cooperative scheme, while taking into
   account the dynamic traffic arrivals, interference correlation, relay
   selection scheme, and spatial node distribution. The performance
   analysis is validated by extensive simulations. The analytical results
   provide useful insights on cooperative communication in large-scale

Abstract = {{Strain gages are commonly used to measure bone strain, but only provide
   strain at a single location. Digital image correlation (DIC) is an
   optical technique that provides the displacement, and therefore strain,
   over an entire region of interest on the bone surface. This study
   compares vertebral body strains measured using strain gages and DIC. The
   anterior surfaces of 15 cadaveric porcine vertebrae were prepared with a
   strain rosette and a speckled paint pattern for DIC. The vertebrae were
   loaded in compression with a materials testing machine, and two
   high-resolution cameras were used to image the anterior surface of the
   bones. The mean noise levels for the strain rosette and DIC were 1 le
   and 24 le, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare
   strain from the DIC and rosette (excluding 44\% of trials with some
   evidence of strain rosette failure or debonding); the mean difference
   +/- 2 standard deviations (SDs) was - 108 mu epsilon +/- 702 mu epsilon
   for the minimum (compressive) principal strain and - 53 mu epsilon +/-
   332 mu epsilon for the maximum (tensile) principal strain. Although the
   DIC has higher noise, it avoids the relatively high risk we observed of
   strain gage debonding. These results can be used to develop guidelines
   for selecting a method to measure strain on bone.}},

Title = {{Pedestrian detection from thermal images: A sparse representation based
   approach}},
Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrian detection, a key technology in computer vision, plays a
   paramount role in the applications of advanced driver assistant systems
   (ADASs) and autonomous vehicles. The objective of pedestrian detection
   is to identify and locate people in a dynamic environment so that
   accidents can be avoided. With significant variations introduced by
   illumination, occlusion, articulated pose, and complex background,
   pedestrian detection is a challenging task for visual perception.
   Different from visible images, thermal images are captured and presented
   with intensity maps based objects' emissivity, and thus have an enhanced
   spectral range to make human beings perceptible from the cool
   background. In this study, a sparse representation based approach is
   proposed for pedestrian detection from thermal images. We first adopted
   the histogram of sparse code to represent image features and then detect
   pedestrian with the extracted features in an unimodal and a multimodal
   framework respectively. In the unimodal framework, two types of
   dictionaries, i.e. joint dictionary and individual dictionary, are built
   by learning from prepared training samples. In the multimodal framework,
   a weighted fusion scheme is proposed to further highlight the
   contributions from features with higher separability. To validate the
   proposed approach, experiments were conducted to compare with three
   widely used features: Haar wavelets (HWs), histogram of oriented
   gradients (HOG), and histogram of phase congruency (HPC) as well as two
   classification methods, i.e. AdaBoost and support vector machine (SVM).
   Experimental results on a publicly available data set demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The effect of Prandtl number on mixing in low Reynolds number
   Kelvin-Helmholtz billows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effect of Prandtl number on mixing in temporally evolving
   Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities at low to moderate Reynolds numbers
   is studied through direct numerical simulation. We distinguish between
   the mixing induced by the primary billow and the mixing generated by
   three-dimensional motions by performing each simulation in two and three
   dimensions. The results indicate that the time evolution of the rate of
   two-and three-dimensional mixing through different stages of the life
   cycle of KH flow is significantly influenced by the Prandtl number. As
   the Prandtl number increases, the final amount of mixing increases for
   Reynolds that are too low to support active three-dimensional motions.
   This trend is the opposite in sufficiently high Reynolds number KH flows
   that can overcome viscous effects and develop significant
   three-dimensional instabilities. While the mixing generated in the
   two-dimensional flows, uniform in the span-wise direction, is not
   significantly dependent on the Prandtl number, the turbulent mixing
   induced by three-dimensional motions is a function of the Prandtl
   number. We observe a steady increase in the total amount of mixing for
   buoyancy Reynolds numbers above 7, consistent with the results of Shih
   et al. {[}{''}Parameterization of turbulent fluxes and scales using
   homogeneous sheared stably stratified turbulence simulations,{''} J.
   Fluid Mech. 525, 193-214 (2005)]. Both maximum instantaneous and
   cumulative mixing efficiencies exhibit a decreasing trend with
   increasing Prandtl number. We compare the dependence of the mixing
   efficiency on Prandtl number to previous studies. Published by AIP

Title = {{Understanding JavaScript Event-Based Interactions with Clematis}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Web applications have become one of the fastest-growing types of
   software systems today. Despite their popularity, understanding the
   behavior of modern web applications is still a challenging endeavor for
   developers during development and maintenance tasks. The challenges
   mainly stem from the dynamic, event-driven, and asynchronous nature of
   the JavaScript language. We propose a generic technique for capturing
   low-level event-based interactions in a web application and mapping
   those to a higher-level behavioral model. This model is then transformed
   into an interactive visualization, representing episodes of triggered
   causal and temporal events, related JavaScript code executions, and
   their impact on the dynamic DOM state. Our approach, implemented in a
   tool called CLEMATIS, allows developers to easily understand the complex
   dynamic behavior of their application at three different semantic levels
   of granularity. Furthermore, CLEMATIS helps developers bridge the gap
   between test cases and program code by localizing the fault related to a
   test assertion. The results of our industrial controlled experiment show
   that CLEMATIS is capable of improving the comprehension task accuracy by
   157\% while reducing the task completion time by 47\%. A follow-up
   experiment reveals that CLEMATIS improves the fault localization
   accuracy of developers by a factor of two.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the potential use of elemental S (S-0) to
   convert Cr-VI to Cr-III which should decrease the bio-availability
   hence, toxicity of Cr-VI in soils. The bio-available fraction of Cr in
   soil was measured by phosphate buffer extraction (PBE) and the results
   showed that the fraction is about 10\% of the total Cr-VI and varied
   from 12.8 to 42.5 mg kg(-1). The addition of 4.0 mg g(-1) S-0 decreased
   PBE Cr-VI to <0.4 mg kg(-1) limit established for Cr-VI toxicity in
   soils. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES),
   X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and micro-XRD revealed that Cr-III was the
   dominant species (99\% of total Cr) and Cr was retained by hematite and
   goethite in soil. Fe-containing minerals may have provided sufficient
   protection to render the dominant Cr-III species biochemically inert to
   redox processes in soils. It is concluded that S-0 amendment is a
   promising approach to remediate Cr-VI contaminated soils. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Frequency synthesis at mm-wave range suffers from a severe tradeoff
   between phase noise (PN) and frequency tuning range (FTR). This work
   presents the analysis and compares the performance of fundamental-mode
   voltage-controlled oscillators (F-VCOs) to harmonic-mode VCOs (H-VCOs).
   It is shown that unlike a mm-wave F-VCO, an H-VCO can simultaneously
   achieve higher FTR and lower PN. An H-VCO architecture, denoted as
   self-mixing VCO (SMV), is presented where the VCO core generates both
   the first (f(0)) and second harmonic (2f(0)) and then mixes them
   together to obtain the desired mm-wave thirdharmonic (3f(0)). Use of a
   Class-C push-push topology as the VCO core enhances the second-harmonic
   content to improve mixing efficiency, decreases parasitic capacitance,
   and improves PN. Compared to an F-VCO operating in a mm-wave band at a
   fundamental frequency that equals 3f(0), the proposed SMV architecture
   achieves about 2x higher FTR and a better PN performance. A 52.8-62.5
   GHz SMV prototype is designed and implemented in a 0.13 mu mCMOS
   process. Measurement results show that the VCO achieves an FTR of 16.8\%
   with a PN of -100.6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset-resulting in an FTR-inclusive
   figure-of-merit (FoMT) of -190.85 dBc/Hz while consuming 7.6 mW from a
   1.2 V supply.}},

   to solve the problem where in each iteration closed-form solutions are

   offering an achievable lower bound on secrecy rate for both uplink and

Abstract = {{Cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) with
   resource-based fairness is well-known as an efficient algorithm that
   satisfies fair resource sharing among users while accommodating
   exploitation of multiuser diversity. In this letter, we extend CS to
   satisfy proportional throughput fairness. In particular, the proposed CS
   with proportional throughput fairness (CSPT) exploits the properties of
   CS to intelligently calculate the channel access ratio (CAR) for each
   user that satisfies proportional throughput fairness. Then, user
   selection is performed under CS with the obtained CARs. Moreover, the
   throughput upper-bound of schedulers satisfying proportional throughput
   fairness is analyzed and, through asymptotic analysis and simulations
   for various scenarios, we show that the performance of our proposed CSPT
   is close to this upper-bound.}},

Abstract = {{Extrudate swell of industrial-grade high-molecular mass high-density
   polyethylenes (HDPEs) in flat/slit dies is studied using both
   experiments and simulations. The experimental set-up consists of an
   optical micrometer to measure the extrudate dimensions and a pair of
   radiation heaters to control the extrudate temperature outside the die
   attached to the capillary rheometer. The simulation of extrudate swell
   phenomenon is carried out by using a well-known integral K-BKZ model.
   The effects of several rheological characteristics, die characteristics,
   and processing conditions on swell measurements are studied
   systematically, and the corresponding two-dimensional, steady-state
   numerical predictions are presented in this paper. This study includes
   the effects of polymer molecular characteristics, apparent shear rate,
   die geometrical characteristics (length to die gap (L/H) and width to
   die gap (W/H)), and distance from the die exit. It is found that the
   integral K-BKZ model predicts well both the width and thickness
   extrudate swells. Extrudate swell measurements demonstrate that the

Abstract = {{To identify stable cutting conditions with a high depth of cut,
   stability lobe diagrams are used. In order to predict these diagrams,
   frequency response functions (FRF) at the tool tip are required for
   every tool, holder and machine combination. To reduce the number of
   experimental tests, receptance coupling substructure analysis (RSCA) is
   proposed in the literature. In order to take full advantage of this
   method, contact parameters between holder and tool must be known. To
   identify these parameters this paper presents a new method based on
   free-free measurements. The obtained contact parameters led to good
   results for various tool lengths. Based on this, an extensive
   investigation is performed for the ER32 holder interface. Afterwards,
   the RCSA method is tested. Therefore, different spindle-holder-tool
   assemblies are modeled for two machine tools. Prediction and measurement
   of obtained tool-tip FRF shows a good match, especially for the

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Inactivating pathogens is essential to eradicate waterborne diseases.
   However, disinfection forms undesirable disinfection by-products (DBPs)
   in the presence of natural organic matter. Many regulations and
   guidelines exist to limit DBP exposure for eliminating possible health
   impacts such as bladder cancer, reproductive effects, and child
   development effects. In this paper, an index named non-compliance
   potential (NCP) index is proposed to evaluate regulatory violations by
   DBPs. The index can serve to evaluate water quality in distribution
   networks using the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). BBN is a graphical
   model to represent contributing variables and their probabilistic
   relationships. Total trihalomethanes (TTHM), haloacetic acids (HAA5),
   and free residual chlorine (FRC) are selected as the variables to
   predict the NCP index. A methodology has been proposed to implement the
   index using either monitored data, empirical model results (e.g.,
   multiple linear regression), and disinfectant kinetics through EPANET
   simulations. The index's usefulness is demonstrated through two case
   studies on municipal distribution systems using both full-scale
   monitoring and modeled data. The proposed approach can be implemented
   for data-sparse conditions, making it especially useful for smaller
   municipal drinking water systems.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of MIMO technology is highly dependent on the surrounding
   propagation environment and antenna configuration. In order to benefit
   from MIMO technology inside underground mines with low angular spread,
   careful antenna design and deployment strategies are required. In this
   regard, we studied the effect of uniform-linear-array (ULA)
   configuration on the MIMO channel capacity inside a short underground
   service tunnel. With its extensive infrastructure, this tunnel
   represents a typical midsize underground-mine tunnel. We simulated and
   measured channel frequency response at 2.49 GHz for grids of
   transmitters and receivers in different parts of the tunnel while taking
   into account practical considerations for access point (AP) deployments.
   All the ULA configurations were deployed either close to the sidewalls
   or under the ceiling. Among them, two configurations, which show the
   best performance for AP communications, were identified. For these
   configurations, we found that interelement separation requires to be
   four times longer than in conventional indoor environment with rich
   multipath (i.e., 2 lambda) to provide decorrelation among MIMO
   subchannels. We also found that infrastructure which has been neglected
   in previous studies, significantly degrades MIMO performance. Insightful
   results and guidelines for employing MIMO technology in underground
   mines can significantly benefit mining industry.}},

Abstract = {{Prior results on exact error rates and outage probabilities of diversity
   receptions over arbitrarily correlated fading channels involve
   intractable nested integrals, which makes the performance analyses
   challenging to carry out. In this paper, we derive asymptotic
   expressions and asymptotically tight bounds for error rates and outage
   probabilities of diversity receptions (including maximal-ratio
   combining, selection combining, and equal-gain combining) over
   arbitrarily correlated Beckmann fading channels. These new asymptotic
   performance expressions reveal insights into the diversity systems over
   arbitrarily correlated Beckmann fading channels, and the accuracy of the
   asymptotic performance expressions is explicitly quantified by the
   performance bounds. Using these analytical tools, one can assess the
   performance of the diversity reception systems over arbitrarily
   correlated Beckmann fading channels without resorting to time-consuming
   Monte Carlo simulation or numerical multifold integration.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid-selection maximal-ratio combining (HS/MRC) is a useful diversity
   reception technique to reduce the number of radio frequency chains, and
   this diversity scheme has been well studied. However, past studies on
   HS/MRC have often ignored the significant insertion loss associated with
   hardware implementation of HS/MRC. Therefore, we consider a special
   class of two-stage diversity receptions known as hierarchical diversity
   with low insertion loss. The asymptotic error rate performances of
   hierarchical selection-combining MRC (SC-MRC) and hierarchical
   selection-combining equal-gain combining are studied for Rician fading
   channels with arbitrary correlation. Based on our asymptotic analysis,
   it is shown that, for a practical number of antenna branches, SC-MRC
   will suffer, at most, 0.6-dB performance losses with respect to HS/MRC;
   however, SC-MRC will incur significantly less insertion loss. Based on
   closed-form asymptotic error expressions, we also study unique
   transmission properties of two-stage diversity receptions over Rician
   channels with arbitrary branch correlation.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the demand of increasing mobile data traffic and provide better
   user experience, heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) have become a
   promising solution to improve both the system capacity and coverage.
   However, due to dense self-deployment of small cells in a limited area,
   serious interference from nearby base stations may occur, which results
   in severe performance degradation. To mitigate downlink interference and
   utilize spectrum resources more efficiently, we present a novel
   graph-based resource allocation and interference management approach in
   this paper. First, we divide small cells into cell clusters, considering
   their neighborhood relationships in the scenario. Then, we develop
   another graph clustering scheme to group user equipment (UE) in each
   cell cluster into UE clusters with minimum intracluster interference.
   Finally, we utilize a proportional fairness scheduling scheme to assign
   subchannels to each UE cluster and allocate power using water-filling
   method. To show the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed approach,
   we propose a dual-based approach to search for optimal solutions as the
   baseline for comparisons. Furthermore, we compare the graph-based
   approach with the state of the art and a distributed approach without
   interference coordination. The simulation results show that our
   graph-based approach reaches more than 90\% of the optimal performance
   and achieves a significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared
   with the state of the art and the distributed approach both under
   cochannel and orthogonal deployments. Moreover, the proposed graph-based
   approach has low computation complexity, making it feasible for
   real-time implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Study design: This was a cross-over efficacy study design.
   Objective: To determine spasticity differences between static and
   dynamic standing training in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Setting: Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Ten individuals with SCI who could stand with or without
   bracing or supports participated in both dynamic and static standing
   training (one session each, 2 days apart) using a Segway. The primary
   outcome was spasticity as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS),
   Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and electromyography (EMG) of the
   quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors and gastrocnemius.
   Results: There was no statistically detectable difference in spasticity
   between dynamic and static standing training in individuals with SCI as
   measured by VAS, MAS or EMG, although there was a trend towards
   decreased spasticity after the dynamic training.
   Conclusion: There is no significant difference in spasticity outcomes
   between static and dynamic standing training on a Segway for individuals
   with SCI.}},
