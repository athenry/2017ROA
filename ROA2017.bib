Physics, engineering and sociology were examined using the literature of the disciplines for the year 1983. Results indicated that physics differs from both engineering and sociology in terms of having a greater frequency of methodological references. There was no significant difference found between engineering and sociology.},

	abstract={This paper focuses on the citation analysis of all research articles from one issue of 16 engineering journals from different engineering disciplines and captures data on the formats cited and the age (median and mean) of those citations. In addition to contextualizing the data by comparing to other engineering citation analyses, the study also replicates (both data source and variables) a 1996 study so that longitudinal comparisons may also be made. Implications of the results on engineering collection development are discussed. Adapted from the source document.},

	abstract={This study takes a multidimensional approach to citation analysis, examining citations in multiple subfields of engineering, from both scholarly journals and doctoral dissertations. The three major goals of the study are to determine whether there are differences between citations drawn from dissertations and those drawn from journal articles; to test a methodology incorporating both internal and external citation sources; and to explore the citation habits of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subfields. The results reveal variations in how STEM subfields conduct research in career and academic settings and are more nuanced than internal or external citation data alone can provide. The results have practical collection development implications.},

	abstract={In recent years, Google Scholar has been considered as a multi-discipline source of citation that covers a wide range of different periodical and non-periodical information sources. The present study aimed at identification of the amount of overlap between Google Scholar and the ISI Web of Science in four disciplines of chemistry, physics, biology and computer science, to investigate the application of this new source as a complement tool for the traditional citation sources. Type of publication and level of access for cited sources was analysed in Google Scholar, and the relative increase in both sources was also identified as for a 4 months period. For this purpose, 4184 citations in the Web of Science were compared with 5589 citations to 882 articles in 39 indexed journals, retrieved by Google Scholar. The results of the study revealed that the relative overlap percentage for ISI in four disciplines equals to 57% (2378 common citations). It was also revealed that differences between the four disciplines are important factors in both sources. The relative overlap in biology (66%), physics (62%), computer science (57%) was remarkably more than chemistry (33%). Also, in chemistry and biology, journal articles, in physics E-print articles, and in computer science, conference articles were the most citation sources that were unique to Google Scholar, and could not be traced in Web of Science. Results of the study also revealed that 70% of the citation sources that were unique to Google Scholar, were accessible as full text. The increase rate for citations in four disciplines in 4 months was 12% for ISI Web of Science, and 22% for Google Scholar. According to the results, it can be concluded that the citations in Google Scholar could be considered as supplementary to ISI Web of Science. However, in measuring the impact of researches cited in this source, one should consider the difference that exists between the disciplines in regard with the number and the type of Web citations.

	abstract={Discusses how to evaluate the research quality of universities and colleges in Taiwan. Refers to the Research Assessment Exercises (RAE) in the UK, which provides ratings of the quality of research conducted in universities and colleges in the UK, to inform the selective allocation of funds in accordance with the quality of the work undertaken. The expert peer review system which is the evaluation mechanism of RAE is explored with evaluation procedures in the study. Citation Analysis with its application is also studied in the article. Concludes that citation analysis is a form of bibliometrics and is not suitable for application as a main tool in research assessment of universities and colleges. Concludes that it is necessary to develop the research assessment of universities and college in Taiwan with expert peer review, in addition to the use of Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and citation counting data as a metric information for reference.

	abstract={Purpose - The research aim for this study was to compare three citation resources with one another to identify the citation resource with the most representative South African scholarly environmental sciences citation coverage. This paper focuses on the results of the content verification process which measured amongst others the citation counts, multiple copies and inconsistencies encountered across the three citation resources ISI Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach - The research, the first phase of a longitudinal study, used a comparative research design method with a purposive, non-probability sample. Data from the South African scholarly environmental sciences journals for the year range 2004-2008 (first phase) were extracted from the three citation resources and compared. Findings - It became evident during the verification process that the citation resources retrieved varied results. The total citation counts indicated that ISI Web of Science (WOS) retrieved the most citation results, followed by Google Scholar (GS) and then Scopus. WOS performed the best with total coverage of the journal sample population and also retrieved the most unique items. The investigation into multiple copies indicated that WOS and Scopus retrieved no duplicates, while GS retrieved multiple copies. Scopus delivered the least inconsistencies regarding content verification and content quality compared to the other two citation resources. Additionally, GS also retrieved the most inconsistencies, with WOS retrieving more inconsistencies than Scopus. Examples of these inconsistencies include author spelling and sequence, volume and issue number. Originality/value - The findings of the study contribute to the understanding of the completeness of citation results retrieved from different citation resources. In addition it will raise awareness amongst academics to check citations of their work.},

	abstract={Librarians are better able to respond to the needs of their end users while supporting the goals of their institution. This is illustrated through five recent initiatives undertaken by the Library of École Polytechnique in direct support of institutional research activities: * Master's and PhD students develop information skills through the preparation of a portfolio on their research topic. This assignment forms part of an information literacy laboratory within a research methodology course. The course is mandatory for PhD students and assignment grading is done by librarians. * Canada Research Chairs benefit from dedicated information services in return for a financial contribution by each Chair to the Library. * A bibliographic database with citations to the scientific and engineering publications of the institution's faculty and researchers is available via the Internet. A knowledge management tool, the database is also useful for marketing and promoting the institution. * A three-pronged approach to analyzing user needs allows the Library to identify those journals containing 80% of the articles published or cited by the institution's faculty and researchers. * A comparative analysis of publication data for fifteen Canadian engineering schools aids the institution in developing its strategic positioning.},
