Abstract = {{Optomechanical transduction has demonstrated its supremacy in probing
   nanomechanical displacements. In order to apply nano-optomechanical
   systems (NOMS) as force and mass sensors, knowledge about the
   transduction responsivity (i.e. the change in measured optical
   transmission with nanomechanical displacement) and its tradeoffs with
   system design is paramount. We compare the measured responsivities of
   NOMS devices with varying length, optomechanical coupling strength
   g(om), and optical cavity properties. Cantilever beams 1.5 to 5 mu m
   long are fabricated 70 to 160 nm from a racetrack resonator optical
   cavity and their thermomechanical (TM) noise signals are measured. We
   derive a generic expression for the transduction responsivity of the
   NOMS in terms of optical and mechanical system parameters such as
   finesse, optomechanical coupling constant, and interaction length. The
   form of the expression holds direct insight as to how these parameters
   affect the responsivity. With this expression, we obtain the
   optomechanical coupling constants using only measurements of the TM
   noise power spectra and optical cavity transmission slopes. All optical
   pump/probe operation is also demonstrated in our side-coupled
   cantilever-racetrack NOMS. Finally, to assess potential operation in a
   gas sensing environment, the TM noise signal of a device is measured at
   atmospheric pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT), Moller-Plesset second-order
   perturbation theory (MP2), and semiempirical methods are employed for
   the geometry optimization and thermochemistry analysis of pi-pi stacked
   di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentamer aggregates of the fused polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene,
   tetracene, pyrene, and coronene as well as benzene. These aggregates
   (stabilized by dispersion interactions) are highly relevant to the
   intermolecular aggregation of asphaltenes, major components of heavy
   petroleum. The strength of pi-pi stacking interaction is evaluated with
   respect to the pi-stacking distance and thermochemistry results, such as
   aggregation enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies (Delta
   G(298)). For both pi-stacking interplanar distances and thermochemistry,
   the omega B97X-D functional with an augmented damped R-6 dispersion
   correction term and MP2 are in the closest agreement with the highly
   accurate spin-component scaled MP2 (SCS-MP2) method that we selected as
   a reference. The Delta G(298) values indicate that the aggregation of
   coronene is spontaneous at 298 K and the formation of pyrene dimers
   occurs spontaneously at temperature lower than 250 K. Aggregates of
   smaller PAHs would be stable at even lower temperature. These findings
   are supported by X-ray crystallographic determination results showing
   that among the PAHs studied only coronene forms continuous stacked
   aggregates in single crystals, pyrene forms dimers, and smaller PAHs do
   not form pi-pi stacked aggregates. Thermochemistry analysis results show
   that PAHs containing more than four fused benzene rings would
   spontaneously form aggregates at 298 K. Also, round-shaped PAHs, such as
   phenanthrene and pyrene, form more stable aggregates than linear PAHs,
   such as anthracene and tetracene, due to decreased entropic penalty.
   These results are intended to help guide the synthesis of model
   asphaltene compounds for spectroscopic studies so as to help understand
   the aggregation behavior of heavy petroleum.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time, label-free detection of Gram-positive bacteria with high
   selectivity and sensitivity is demonstrated using an interdigitated
   impedimetric array functionalized with naturally produced antimicrobial
   peptide from class ha bacteriocins. The antimicrobial peptide, leucocin
   A, was chemically synthesized and covalently immobilized on
   interdigitated gold microelectrodes via the interaction between the
   C-terminal carboxylic acid of the peptide and free amines of a
   preattached thiolated linker. Exposing the peptide sensor to various
   concentrations of Gram-positive bacteria generated reproducible
   impedance spectra that detected peptide-bacteria interactions at a
   concentration of 1 cell/mu L. The peptide sensor also selectively
   detected Listeria monocytogenes from other Gram-positive strains at a
   concentration of 10(3) cfu mL(-1). The study highlights that short
   peptide ligands from bacteriocin class offer high selectivity in
   bacterial detection and can be used in developing a robust, portable
   biosensor device to efficiently detect pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria

Abstract = {{Impulse atomisation in helium and nitrogen and water atomisation have
   been utilised to produce powders of D2 tool steel. It was determined
   that higher cooling rates result in a lower percentage of eutectic.
   Scanning electron microscopy image analysis, along with coarsening
   model, was used to predict eutectic and primary phase undercooling of
   particles. Small particles exhibited a higher amount of undercooling.
   The particles exposed to a He atmosphere during atomisation had a larger
   amount of eutectic undercooling. The fraction of primary phase that
   solidified during the recalescence was then calculated based on the
   amount of primary phase undercooling under adiabatic conditions. In
   smaller particles, there was a larger amount of primary phase solidified
   during recalescence due to a higher amount of primary undercooling.
   Based on primary phase undercooling values, critical nuclei radius of
   austenite and assuming homogenous nucleation, the number of austenite
   unit cells in the stable nucleus was calculated.}},

Abstract = {{Non-linear state filters of different approximations and capabilities
   allow for real-time estimation of unmeasured states in non-linear
   stochastic processes. It is well known that the performance of
   non-linear filters depends on the underlying numerical and statistical
   approximations used in their design. Despite the theoretical and
   practical interest in evaluating the performance of non-linear filtering
   methods, it remains one of the most complex problems in the area of
   state estimation. We propose the use of posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound
   (PCRLB) or mean square error (MSE) inequality as a filtering performance
   benchmark. Using the PCRLB inequality, we develop assessment and
   diagnosis tools for monitoring and evaluating the performance of
   non-linear filters. Using the PCRLB inequality-based performance
   assessment tool, an optimal non-linear filter switching strategy is
   proposed for state estimation in general non-linear systems. The
   non-linear filter switching strategy is an optimal performance strategy,
   which maintains high filtering performance under all operating
   conditions. The complex, high dimensional integrals involved in the
   computation of the PCRLB inequality-based non-linear filter assessment
   and diagnosis tools are approximated using sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC)
   methods. The utility and efficacy of the developed tools are illustrated
   through a numerical example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Kalman filter algorithm gives an analytical expression for the point
   estimates of the state estimates, which is the mean of their posterior
   distribution. Conventional Bayesian state estimators have been developed
   under the assumption that the mean of the posterior of the states is the
   `best estimate'. While this may hold true in cases where the posterior
   can be adequately approximated as a Gaussian distribution, in general it
   may not hold true when the posterior is non-Gaussian. The posterior
   distribution, however, contains far more information about the states,
   regardless of its Gaussian or non-Gaussian nature. In this study, the
   information contained in the posterior distribution is explored and
   extracted to come up with meaningful estimates of the states. The need
   for combining Bayesian state estimation with extracting information from
   the distribution is demonstrated in this work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Leg Dominance May Not Be a Predictor of Asymmetry in Peak Joint Moments

Abstract = {{Sit-to-stand transfer is a common prerequisite for many daily tasks.
   Literature often assumes symmetric behavior across the left and right
   side. Although this assumption of bilateral symmetry is prominent, few
   studies have validated this supposition. This pilot study uniquely
   quantifies peak joint moments and ground reaction forces (GRFs), using a
   Euclidian norm approach, to evaluate bilateral symmetry and its relation
   to lower limb motor-dominance during sit to stand in ten healthy males.
   Peak joint moments and GRFs were determined using a motion capture
   system and inverse dynamics. This analysis included joint moment
   contributions from all three body planes (sagittal, coronal, and axial)
   as well as vertical and shearing GRFs. A paired, one-tailed t test was
   used, suggesting asymmetrical joint moment development in all three
   lower extremity joints as well as GRFs (P < .05). Furthermore, using an
   unpaired two-tailed t test, asymmetry developed during these movements
   does not appear to be predictable by participants' lower limb
   motor-dominance (P < .025). Consequently, when evaluating sit-to-stand
   it is suggested the effects of asymmetry be considered in the
   interpretation of data. The absence of a relationship between dominance
   and asymmetry prevents the suggestion that one side can be tested to
   infer behavior of the contralateral.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state moving crack under mode-I loading is studied with a
   modified cohesive zone model which addresses speed-dependent role of the
   normal stress parallel to the crack axis and the non-uniformity of
   traction force in cohesive zone. Unlike the classical Dugdale model
   which predicts independence of the cohesive zone size on crack speed,
   the present model predicts that the cohesive zone size strongly depends
   on crack speed. Comparison with some known experimental data suggests
   that the present model has the potential to capture the speed effects on
   moving cracks in ductile materials especially at high crack speed. (C)

Abstract = {{Aptamers are, in general, easier to produce, easier to store and are
   able to bind to a wider variety of targets than antibodies. For these

   applications. This review article examines the research and design of
   RNA and DNA aptamer based biosensor systems and applications as well as
   their potential for integration in effective biosensor devices. As
   single stranded DNA or RNA molecules that can bind to specific targets,
   aptamers are well suited for biomolecular recognition and sensing
   applications. Beyond being able to be designed for a near endless number
   of specific targets, aptamers can also be made which change their
   conformation in a predictable and consistent way upon binding. This can
   lead to many unique and effective detection methods using a variety of
   optical and electrochemical means.}},

Abstract = {{Among various approaches to modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs),
   Boolean networks (BNs) and its probabilistic extension, probabilistic
   Boolean networks (PBNs), have been studied to gain insights into the
   dynamics of GRNs. To further exploit the simplicity of logical models, a
   multiple-valued network employs gene states that are not limited to
   binary values, thus providing a finer granularity in the modeling of
   GRNs. In this paper, stochastic multiple-valued networks (SMNs) are
   proposed for modeling the effects of noise and gene perturbation in a
   GRN. An SMN enables an accurate and efficient simulation of a
   probabilistic multiple-valued network (as an extension of a PBN). In a
   k-level SMN of n genes, it requires a complexity of to compute the state
   transition matrix, where L is a factor related to the minimum sequence
   length in the SMN for achieving a desired accuracy. The use of randomly
   permuted stochastic sequences further increases computational efficiency
   and allows for a tunable tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. The
   analysis of a p53-Mdm2 network and a WNT5A network shows that the
   proposed SMN approach is efficient in evaluating the network dynamics
   and steady state distribution of gene networks under random gene
   perturbation.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed mean flow characteristics generated by a staggered arrangement

   The results showed that this type of fish pass can produce adequate

   different characteristic velocity regions were identified, namely,
   downstream of boulders (wake region), intermediate region, and upstream
   of boulders. Some general correlations were developed for predicting the
   flow depth and velocity in a rock-ramp fish pass as a function of
   normalized discharge. Moreover, a flow-resistance analysis based on
   basic concepts for wake-interference flow regime in this fish pass has
   resulted in a general equation for the average velocity. This study
   improves the understanding of the complex flow characteristics in a

Abstract = {{The behavior of a conventional steel single-plate (shear tab) connection
   is highly dependent on the type of loading to which it is subjected.
   Although these connections have been studied primarily under shear
   loading, reflecting their common usage in gravity framing, their
   behavior under combined loading scenarios is more complex. The objective
   of this study is to develop and validate a component-based mechanical
   shear tab connection model that accounts for the interactions of shear,
   axial load, and moment. The component-based methodology allows for the
   division of the connection into its constituent parts and for modeling
   of the force-deformation relationship of each part separately. Thus, the
   connection response to a broad array of load combinations can be
   obtained on the basis of the geometric and material properties of the
   connection. The model is validated against experimental results from a
   variety of loading regimes, and the sensitivity of the model performance
   to the connection and model parameters is presented.}},

   forces of fluids in confined geometries or porous media is of both
   fundamental and practical importance, providing significant insights

   the fundamentals of nanoreheolgy, advances in experimental techniques
   and theoretical simulation methods, as well as important progress in the
   nanorheology of confined thin films. The advent of advanced experimental
   techniques such as surface forces apparatus (SFA), X-ray surface forces

   methods such as molecular dynamics simulations provides powerful tools
   to study a wide range of rheological phenomena at molecular level and
   nano scale. One of the most challenging issues unresolved is to
   elucidate the relationship between the rheological properties and
   structural evolution of the confined fluid films and particles
   suspensions. Some of the emerging research areas in the nanorheology

   cardiology. Current conformal electronic systems are essentially 2D
   sheets, which cannot cover the full epicardial surface or maintain
   reliable contact for chronic use without sutures or adhesives. Here we
   create 3D elastic membranes shaped precisely to match the epicardium of
   the heart via the use of 3D printing, as a platform for deformable
   arrays of multifunctional sensors, electronic and optoelectronic
   components. Such integumentary devices completely envelop the heart, in
   a form-fitting manner, and possess inherent elasticity, providing a
   mechanically stable biotic/abiotic interface during normal cardiac
   cycles. Component examples range from actuators for electrical, thermal
   and optical stimulation, to sensors for pH, temperature and mechanical
   strain. The semiconductor materials include silicon, gallium arsenide
   and gallium nitride, co-integrated with metals, metal oxides and
   polymers, to provide these and other operational capabilities. Ex vivo
   physiological experiments demonstrate various functions and
   methodological possibilities for cardiac research and therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Vitrification of articular cartilage (AC) could enhance tissue
   availability but requires high concentrations of cyroprotective agents
   (CPAs). This study investigated relative injuries caused by commonly
   used CPAs. We hypothesized that the in situ chondrocyte dose-injury
   relationships of five commonly used CPAs are nonlinear and that relative
   injuries could be determined by comparing cell death after exposure at
   increasing concentrations. Human AC samples were used from four patients
   undergoing total knee arthroplasty surgery. Seventy mu m slices were
   exposed in a stepwise protocol to increasing concentrations of 5 CPAs
   (max = 8 M); dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), glycerol (Gly), propylene
   glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), and formamide (FM). Chondrocyte
   viability was determined by membrane integrity stains. Statistical
   analysis included t-tests and nonlinear least squares estimation
   methods. The dose-injury to chondrocytes relationships for all CPAs were
   found to be nonlinear (sigmoidal best fit). For the particular loading
   protocol in this study, the data identified the following CPA
   concentrations at which chondrocyte recoveries statistically deviated
   significantly from the control recovery; 1 M for Gly, 4 M for FM and PG,
   6 M for Me2SO, and 7 M for EG. Comparison of individual means
   demonstrated that Gly exposure resulted in the lowest recovery, followed
   by PG, and then Me2SO, FM and EG in no specific order. The information
   from this study provides an order of damage to human chondrocytes in
   situ of commonly used CPAs for vitrification of AC and identifies
   threshold CPA concentrations for a stepwise loading protocol at which
   chondrocyte recovery is significantly decreased. In general, Gly and PG
   were the most damaging while DMSO and EG were among the least damaging.

Abstract = {{Time-varying mesh stiffness is a periodic function caused by the change
   in the number of contact tooth pairs and the contact positions of the
   gear teeth. It is one of the main sources of vibration of a gear
   transmission system. An efficient and effective way to evaluate the
   time-varying mesh stiffness is essential to comprehensively understand
   the dynamic properties of a planetary gear set. According to the
   literature, there are two ways to evaluate the gear mesh stiffness, the
   finite element method and the analytical method. The finite element
   method is time-consuming because one needs to model every meshing gear
   pair in order to know the mesh stiffness of a range of gear pairs. On
   the other hand, analytical method can offer a general approach to
   evaluate the mesh stiffness. In this study, the potential energy method
   is applied to evaluate the time-varying mesh stiffness of a planetary
   gear set. Analytical equations are derived without any modification of
   the gear tooth involute curve. The developed equations are applicable to
   any transmission structure of a planetary gear set. Detailed discussions
   are given to three commonly used transmission structures: fixed carrier,
   fixed ring gear and fixed sun gear.}},

Abstract = {{Light-responsive ligands are useful tools in biochemistry and cell
   biology because the function of these ligands can be spatially and
   temporally controlled. Conventional design of such ligands relies on
   previously available data about the structure of both the ligand and the
   receptor. In this paper, we describe de novo discovery of
   light-responsive ligands through screening of a genetically encoded
   light-responsive library. We ligated a photoresponsive azobenzene core
   to a random CX7C peptide library displayed on the coat protein of M13
   phage. A one-pot alkylation/reduction of the cysteines yielded a
   photoresponsive library of random heptapeptide macrocycles with over 2 X
   10(8) members. We characterized the reaction on-phage and optimized the
   yield of the modifications in phage libraries. Screening of the library
   against streptavidin yielded three macrocycles that bind to streptavidin
   in the dark and cease binding upon irradiation with 370 nm light. All
   ligands restored their binding properties upon thermal relaxation and
   could be turned ON and OFF for several cycles. We measured dissociation
   constants, K-d, by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
   binding assay. For ligand ACGFERERTCG, the K-d of cis and trans isomers
   differed by 22-fold; an incomplete isomerization (85\%), however,
   resulted in the apparent difference of 4.5-fold between the dark and the
   irradiated state. We anticipate that the selection strategy described in
   this report can be used to find light-responsive ligands for many
   targets that do not have known natural ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Pipeline hydro-transport could be more economic approach than truck
   delivery for agricultural waste biomass to a bio-refinery for bio-fuel
   production. The transportation of slurries of wheat straw and corn
   stover agricultural waste biomass was investigated through a
   laboratory-scale closed-circuit pipeline facility. While the slurry was
   pumped, longitudinal friction loss was measured and analysed as a
   function of particle type and properties, slurry solid concentration,
   slurry flow rate, and measured carrier fluid viscosity. Irregularly
   shaped fibrous particles of agricultural waste biomass 2.0-9.0 mm in
   length and with aspect ratios of 2-7 exhibited drag-reducing features,
   e.g. a drag reduction of 33\% for a slurry containing 40\% {[}mass] of
   <3.2 mm corn stover particles. The role of particle dimensions and
   morphological features on slurry friction loss and drag-reducing
   behaviour was investigated, The influence of particle size distribution
   was recognised with broad size distributions producing lower frictional
   losses at higher flow rates. Above certain flow rated, larger-sized
   particles at lower solid concentrations produced the same drag ratio as
   smaller size particles at higher solid concentrations thus requiring
   lower pumping power. Slurries of wheat straw and corn stover particles
   affected pressure drop behaviour differently from conventional solid
   liquid systems and showed decreasing pressure gradients with increasing
   solid concentration. The results obtained should assist the design and
   operation of agricultural waste biomass pipeline hydro-transport
   processes. (C) 2013 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Clays cause problems in all crucial stages of bitumen extraction, and
   they affect bitumen recovery and waste management. It is thus of great
   importance to understand the mineralogy, chemistry, and surface
   properties of clays to improve both bitumen recovery and tailings
   treatment. Four petrologically different types of Alberta oil sands
   ores-called ``end-members{''}-were examined in this study by cation
   exchange capacity (CEC), specific surface area (SSA), total specific
   surface area (TSSA), and negative layer charge density (LCD)
   measurements in order to better understand the effects of clay surface
   properties on bitumen nonaqueous extraction and solvent recovery from
   the extraction tailings. The surface properties are primarily controlled
   by the mineralogy of the petrologic end-members, mainly by the type and
   quantity of clay minerals. CEC, SSA, TSSA, and LCD increased as the
   amount of 2:1 clays (illite and illite-smectite), in particular
   expandable interstratified illite-smectite, increased. CEC values
   increased with increasing SSA and TSSA. The number of H-aggregates
   increased and the number of monomers decreased in the second derivative
   spectra of Rhodamine 6G and Methylene Blue as the 2:1 clays content in
   the petrologic end-members increased. This indicated a greater negative
   layer charge density with an increasing amount of 2:1 clays. The
   molecular aggregation of the organic dyes (Rhodamine 6G and Methylene
   Blue) was observed in the second derivative spectra for petrologic
   end-members bearing >25 wt \% of 2:1 clays. Overall, the results
   indicate that interstratified illite-smectite may be largely responsible
   for high CEC, SSA, TSSA, and LCD in the fine size fractions of
   petrologic end-members from Alberta oil sands.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy oil and bitumen exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behaviors at
   lower,temperatures. Thixotropy is one such behavior. Thixotropy affects
   the efficiency and length scale of mixing during blending operations and
   flow behaviors in pipes and pipelines following flow disruption, where
   it affects the pressure required to reinitiate flow. In the present
   work, thixotropic behaviors of Maya crude oil are explored
   systematically using a stress-controlled rheometer. Maya crude oil is
   shown to be a shear-thinning fluid below 313 K The thixotropic behaviors
   are identified and explored Using transient stress techniques
   (hysteresis loops, stepwise change in the shear rate, and startup
   experiments). The magnitude Of the thixotropy effect is larger at lower
   temperatures. Relationships are identified between rest times and other

Abstract = {{The sorption of solvents in asphaltenes, residual bitumen, and organic
   matter is of interest in oil sands production and extraction. In this
   study, we investigate the sorption and desorption rates of cyclohexane
   in a thin film of asphaltene using a gravimetric method. These data were
   used to model the kinetics and obtain estimates of the apparent
   diffusion coefficients. The rate curves for cyclohexane showed
   biexponential behavior, suggesting the presence of two different
   transport kinetics. Use of concentration-dependent diffusion
   coefficients was required to fit the data using Fick's law. The apparent
   diffusion coefficients were in the range from 10(-14) to 10(-18) m(2)/s,
   but the values for sorption were distinctly different from desorption.
   The results suggest a restructuring of the asphaltene film with
   negligible swelling because of the addition and removal of the solvent.}},

Abstract = {{The front-end design of a direct coal liquefaction process for the
   conversion of lignite into coal liquids by solvent extraction was
   investigated. The experimental work focused on physical coal dissolution
   in the temperature range 25-150 degrees C. It was found that the
   kinetics of physical coal dissolution was rapid and essentially complete
   within 2 min at 25 degrees C. There was a limiting extract yield, which
   increased with increasing temperature. Within the pore diameter range
   0.1-10.7 mu m, the volume of only pores with diameters <5 mu m increased
   measurably on solvent extraction, while the shape of the pore size
   distribution remained the same. Additional pore volume created during
   extraction exceeded that of the liquid extract. Extraction took place
   from the bulk of the coal. Packed bed extraction was more efficient than
   batch extraction at otherwise similar conditions; an explanation was
   proposed. Even at the least severe conditions, 25 degrees C for 2 min,
   mass transport was not limiting and the solvent-to-coal ratio did not
   meaningfully affect the extract yield. These observations were employed
   to propose potential improvements to the front-end design for direct
   coal liquefaction.}},

Abstract = {{Disposal of tissues and organs associated with prion accumulation and
   infectivity in infected animals (designated as Specified Risk Materials
   {[}SRM]) is strictly regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
   (CFIA); however, the contamination of wastewater from slaughterhouses
   that handle SRM still poses public concern. In this study, we examined
   for the first time the partitioning of infectious prions in rendering
   plant wastewater and found that a large proportion of infectious prions
   were partitioned into the scum layer formed at the top after gravity
   separation, while quite a few infectious prions still remained in the
   wastewater. Subsequently, we assessed the ozone inactivation of
   infectious prions in the raw, natural gravity-separated and dissolved
   air flotation (DAF)-treated (i.e., primary-treated) rendering plant
   wastewater, and in a municipal final effluent (i.e., secondary-treated
   municipal wastewater). At applied ozone doses of 43.4-44.6 mg/L, ozone
   was instantaneously depleted in the raw rendering plant wastewater,
   while a greater than 4-log(10) inactivation was achieved at a 5 mm
   exposure in the DAF-treated rendering plant wastewater. Prion
   inactivation in the municipal final effluent was conducted with two
   levels of applied ozone doses of 13.4 and 22.5 mg/L, and a greater than
   4-log(10) inactivation was achieved at a 5 min exposure with the higher
   ozone dose. Efficiency factor Hom (EFH) models were used to model (i.e.,
   fit) the experimental data. The CT (disinfectant concentration
   multiplied by contact time) values were determined for 2- and 3-log(10),
   inactivation in the municipal final effluent treated with an ozone dose
   of 13.4 mg/L Our results indicate that ozone could serve as a final
   barrier for prion inactivation in primary- and/or secondary-treated
   wastewaters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Depth profiling measurement using multiple pulse Laser Induced Breakdown
   Spectroscopy (LIBS) can be used to determine the characteristics of
   buried layers. However for femtosecond pulses the emission spectra does
   not necessarily reflect the average depth composition for the single
   shot case and instead has much higher sensitivity for the surface layer
   of the ablation region. We introduce a concept of ``depth
   sensitivity{''} to characterize this behavior for single shot LIBS depth
   profiling. Experiments were carried out using 800 nm femtosecond laser
   pulses irradiating layered targets while monitoring the plasma emission
   with a spectrometer system. Laser induced plasma formed at the surface
   layer exhibits a strong LIBS signature while deeper ablated region
   contributes very little to the emission spectrum. The sensitive depth
   region, the source of the major part of the emission, is much less than
   the ablation crater depth and is shown to be of the order of 3 nm in the
   case of actual crater depths of 100's of nm. A two temperature model has
   been used to determine the lattice temperature profile versus depth
   which qualitatively predicts the observed behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional ultrasound arrays hold great promise for 3-D imaging;
   however, wiring of each channel becomes impractical for large arrays or
   for small-footprint catheter probes for which the number of wires must
   be limited. Capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers offer a
   promising solution for such 2-D array applications, but channel routing
   is still non-trivial. A top-orthogonal-to-bottom-electrode (TOBE) 2-D
   CMUT array architecture is presented along with row-column addressing
   schemes for low-channel-count 3-D ultrasound imaging. An N x N TOBE
   array is capable of obtaining 3-D images using only 2N channels. An
   interfacing scheme is presented in which transmit-receive signals are
   routed along rows while bias voltages are applied along columns,
   effectively allowing for single-element transmit/receive control.
   Simulations demonstrated potentially finer resolution and improved side
   lobe suppression over a previously published row-column-based imaging
   method. Laser vibrometer testing was done to measure membrane
   displacement in air and confirmed that single-element air-coupled
   actuation in transmit mode could be achieved using our proposed
   interfacing scheme. Acoustic testing was also performed in both transmit
   and receive modes to characterize the ability of the proposed
   interfacing scheme to achieve dominant-element transmission and
   reception in immersion operation. It was seen that membrane displacement
   in both modes was indeed largely confined to the active area.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal behavior of potassium C-1-C-12 n-alkanoates (K-carboxylates)
   were studied over the temperature range T/K = (243 to 873). A number of
   problems in industrial Fischer-Tropsch facilities were attributed to
   these compounds, but this study also revealed some beneficial effect
   that may directly be related to the thermal behavior of potassium
   methanoate. The unusually low melting point of potassium methanoate, T/K
   = (442.2 +/- 0.3), combined with its thermal stability to T/K
   approximate to (693), may explain the ease of distribution of the
   potassium promoter of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts during
   synthesis even when potassium promoter is added separately. The C-2-C-12
   K-carboxylates were all thermally stable at temperatures T/K <= (713),
   and significant mass loss was not observed at T/K <= (748). The thermal
   stability and high melting point of potassium propanoate, T/K = (636.9
   +/- 0.3) and potassium butanoate, T/K = (623.1 +/- 0.3), in particular
   caused these compounds to be prone to cause pressure drop problems in
   refining units. The C-4-C-12 K-carboxylates melted to a liquid crystal
   phase first, before clearing at higher temperature. One or more solid
   solid transitions were observed in all of the K-carboxylates, with the

Abstract = {{Amorphous TaRhx was integrated in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)
   capacitors with Cu gate metallization (Al/Si/25 nm SiO2/10 nm TaRhx/Cu).
   The stability of TaRhx diffusion barriers was investigated under bias
   temperature stress testing using capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements.
   The stability of these capacitors was compared with similar capacitors
   with TaNx as the diffusion barrier layer or with capacitors with no
   diffusion barrier. The electrical measurements were compared with
   compositional information obtained by backside secondary ion mass
   spectroscopy (SIMS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Comparison of C-V measurements on capacitors with TaRhx/Cu and TaRhx/Al
   gate metallizations revealed that both mobile alkali ions and Cu+
   contribute to the flatband voltage shift of the MOS capacitors. C-V
   measurements of capacitors with various barriers showed that the mobile
   ion concentration (Cu+) in the capacitors with TaRhx diffusion barriers
   is reduced to 32 \% of the value for capacitors with no diffusion
   barrier. In contrast, capacitors with TaNx barriers showed the lowest
   mobile ion concentration among all the barrier types. Based on flatband
   voltage shift values, TaNx barriers outperform TaRhx barriers. However,
   if the percentage of deformed C-V curves is used as the reliability
   criterion, both barriers perform quite similarly. Compositional analysis
   data suggests that the concentrations of the diffused species are below
   the detection limits of SIMS and TEM. This work demonstrated the
   importance of employing electrical reliability tests for evaluation of
   potential diffusion barrier materials.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the cyclical actuation of electric field sensitive
   microscale hydrogels employing dielectric coated coplanar electrodes.
   Microscale hydrogels are photopolymerized in-situ, and AC
   frequency-based actuation combined with pulse width modulation enabled
   controlled manipulation of hydrogel deformation. Stable actuation cycles
   are achieved with applied electric potentials from 20 Vpk-pk to 40
   Vpk-pk, with a maximum true strain of 29 \% and a minimum rise time of
   4.7 s. The peak and trough osmotic pressure for each system's cycle is
   also analytically determined, with a peak pressure at 40 Vpk-pk of 201.1
   +/- 38.3 kPa. A plateau in the peak-to-trough true strain is observed
   above 30 Vpk-pk. For comparative purposes a system without dielectric
   coated electrodes and employing external syringe pumps is also examined,
   and stable cyclical actuation was achieved for applied electric
   potentials of 5 Vpk-pk and 10 Vpk-pk. For this system the maximum stable
   rise time, true strain, and osmotic pressure are 8.1 s, 57 \%, and 429.2
   +/- 81.9 kPa, respectively. The difference between the two systems
   highlights how optimization of the dielectric layer's thickness and
   uniformity can further enhance actuation performance. The electronically
   responsive hydrogel-based cyclical actuator developed within this work
   could be further employed for microfluidic regulation in portable
   low-power systems.}},

Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{66-78}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Kinematic parameters of a robotic manipulator are hard to measure
   precisely and the varying size and shape of tools held by the robot
   end-effector introduce further kinematic uncertainties. Moreover, the
   exact knowledge of the robot nonlinear dynamics may be unavailable due
   to model uncertainties. While adaptive master-slave teleoperation
   control strategies in the literature consider the dynamic uncertainties
   in the master and the slave robots, they stop short of accounting for
   the robots' kinematic uncertainties, which can undermine the
   transparency of the teleoperation system. In this paper, for a
   teleoperation system that is both dynamically and kinematically
   uncertain, we propose novel nonlinear adaptive controllers that require
   neither the exact knowledge of the kinematics of the master and the
   slave nor the dynamics of the master, the slave, the human operator, and
   the environment. Therefore, the proposed controllers can provide the
   master and slave robots with a high degree of flexibility in dealing
   with unforeseen changes and uncertainties in their kinematics and
   dynamics. A Lyapunov function analysis is conducted to mathematically
   prove the stability and master-slave asymptotic position tracking. The
   validity of the theoretical results is verified through simulations as
   well as experiments on a bilateral teleoperation test-bed of
   rehabilitation robots. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique to mitigate zero-sequence harmonics in
   power distribution systems. The method is based on the concept of
   passive zero-sequence harmonic filters. However, its basic configuration
   has been expanded to create a double-tuned filtering feature. This
   feature makes it possible to trap two harmonics with one filter and is
   especially attractive in solving harmonic-caused telephone interference
   problems. Furthermore, this paper has shown that common utility service
   transformers can be used to construct the filter. As a result, a
   practical and low-cost solution to mitigating zero-sequence harmonics
   has been found. A method for sizing and loading assessment of filters
   has also been developed. As an example application, the proposed filter
   package has been applied to mitigate a telephone interference problem.
   Issues, such as filter location, the number of filters required, and the
   effectiveness of filtering harmonics produced by distributed residential
   loads have been investigated. The results show that the proposed filter
   is a very promising technique to reduce zero-sequence harmonics in
   primary power distribution systems.}},

Abstract = {{An in vitro study was conducted with the aim of investigating the effect

   uniformly via electrostatic induction. Experiments were conducted at
   various aerodynamic particle diameters (3.3, 4.6 and 5.9 mu m) and
   volume flow rates (15 and 30 L/min) for a wide range of charges per
   particle (0-25,000 elementary charges). The results show substantial
   increases in deposition due to induced charge electrostatics, especially
   for smaller particle sizes. A dimensionless empirical correlation was
   developed for predicting deposition in the mouth-throat region of human

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a laboratory study on the subaqueous
   deposition of sand particles from sediment-laden circular jets on
   horizontal and inclined beds. Four sets of experiments were carried out
   to investigate the effects of jet characteristics, bed slope, sediment
   size, and sediment concentration on the growth and development of the
   sediment mound. Three distinct flow regimes can be identified as
   developing regime, spreading regime, and backup regime. It was found
   that in the developing regime, deposition height and width formed by the
   continuous release of sediment particles grow faster than the mound
   length. Slurry jet flow in the spreading regime was diverted from the
   axial direction to the sides and caused more deposition on both sides of
   the mound. Backup regime started when the deposition height and width
   reached their maximum values. In this condition, a slurry jet pushed
   sediment back to the nozzle and eventually blocked the flow. The
   initiation of sediment deposition was estimated, and predictions were
   compared with experimental results. Variations of the deposition length
   scales, mound base area, and angle of deposition with time were
   measured. Empirical formulations were introduced to predict deposition
   development with time. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium MRI is typically concerned with measuring tissue sodium
   concentration. This requires the minimization of relaxation weighting.
   However, Na-23 relaxation may itself be interesting to explore, given an
   underlying mechanism (i.e. the
   electric-quadrupole-moment-electric-field-gradient interaction) that
   differs from H-1. A new sodium sequence was developed to enhance Na-23
   relaxation contrast without decreasing signal-to-noise ratio.
   The new sequence, labeled Projection Acquisition in the steady-state
   with Coherent MAgNetization (PACMAN), uses gradient refocusing of
   transverse magnetization following readout, a short repetition time, and
   a long radiofrequency excitation pulse. It was developed using
   simulation, verified in model environments (saline and agar), and
   evaluated in the brain of three healthy adult volunteers.
   Projection Acquisition in the steady-state with Coherent MAgNetization
   generates a large positive contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between saline
   and agar, matching simulation-based design. In addition to enhanced CNR
   between cerebral spinal fluid and brain tissue in vivo, PACMAN develops
   substantial contrast between gray and white matter. Further simulation
   shows that PACMAN has a ln(T (2f)/T (1)) contrast dependence (where T
   (2f) is the fast component of Na-23 T (2)), as well as residual
   quadrupole interaction dependence.
   The relaxation dependence of PACMAN sodium MRI may provide contrast
   related to macromolecular tissue structure.}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this study was to determine the effect of two
   protein denaturants, urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), on the
   apparent activation energy of cross-linking bisphenol A diglycidyl ether
   (DGEBA) with hydrolysate of waste animal proteins. Nonisothermal
   differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the apparent
   activation energy of the reactions. The use of SDS resulted in a marked
   reduction in activation energy, comparable to the reduction in
   activation energy when a catalyst for epoxy rings, triethylamine (TEA),
   was used. The addition of urea slightly incieased the activation energy.
   The heat of reaction increased in the presence of SDS because more
   reactive sites were made available for curing. This work demonstrates
   the use of SDS as a protein denaturant additive was an energetically
   efficient alternative to higher degrees of protein hydrolysis for
   subsequent curing of DGEBA.}},

Title = {{Field and numerical assessment of turning pool hydraulics in a vertical
   slot fishway}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{88-101}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Turning pools are common in fishways, they create a more compact design
   by enabling fishways to fold back on themselves. Despite this, little is
   known about the hydraulic characteristics of turning pools or how they
   are influenced by different design elements. This paper presents the
   results of a study on the hydraulics of turning pools in vertical slot
   fishways focusing on the Vianney-Legendre vertical slot fishway in
   Quebec, Canada, which is one of few fishways worldwide to successfully
   pass sturgeon (i.e., lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens). Field
   velocity measurements taken in two pools and a computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model study were used to assess the turning pool
   hydraulics of seven design geometries. Parallel biological studies of
   sturgeon in the fishway revealed that turning pools were the location
   with the highest rate of failed passage, apparently associated with
   large vortices in the centre of the turning pools which serve to delay
   or inhibit passage. Interestingly, the velocity, and turbulence levels
   are comparable to results from regular pools in vertical slot fishways.
   The volumetric energy dissipation rate in turning pools is suitable for
   fish passage. Based on in silico modelling we revealed that the addition
   of a baffle wall extending from the inside centre wall of the pool
   reduced the size of the vortex and provided a resting area for ascending
   fish. Adding a baffle wall should be considered in turning pools with
   semi-circular or straight back walls. There is a need for research to
   evaluate exactly how fish respond to different turning pool designs but
   in the interim, the approach used here demonstrates the potential for
   using hydraulic studies to design turning pools in fishways that meet
   biological criteria and presumably increase passage efficiency. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) simulation was used to study the dynamics of a
   series of coarse-grained atactic polypropylene (aPP) model chains
   (C192H578) in the melt state at 473 K. Model chains with meso diads
   factions, P (m) , set at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 but with different meso and
   racemo diads sequences were studied. It was observed that aPP chains
   with an alternate meso and racemo diads sequence exhibited the highest
   mobility (or diffusivity) among all stereochemical sequences studied.
   Additionally, chains with long consecutive sequences of diads of the
   same type exhibited lower mobility than those with more random
   stereochemical sequences. The differences in the intramolecular and
   intermolecular interactions resulting from differences in diad sequences
   contributed to the observed differences in dynamics. In particular,
   intramolecular interactions play a more dominant role for aPP chains
   containing low fractions of meso diads or none at all (i.e., all racemo
   diads (P (m) =0.0) or syndiotactic chains). On the other hand, in the
   cases of P (m) values close to 1.0 (i.e., isotactic chains),
   intermolecular interactions play a more dominant role than the
   intramolecular interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental approach incorporating current theoretical models into
   aerosol formulation design potentially reduces experimental work for
   complex formulations. A D-amino acid mixture containing D-Leucine
   (D-Leu), D-Methionine, D-Tryptophan, and D-Tyrosine was selected as a
   model formulation for this approach.
   Formulation design targets were set, with the aim of producing a highly
   dispersible D-amino acid aerosol. Particle formation theory and a spray
   dryer process model were applied with boundary conditions to the design
   targets, resulting in a priori predictions of particle morphology and
   necessary spray dryer process parameters. Two formulations containing
   60\% w/w trehalose, 30\% w/w D-Leu, and 10\% w/w remaining D-amino acids
   were manufactured.
   The design targets were met. The formulations had rugose and hollow
   particles, caused by deformation of a crystalline D-Leu shell while
   trehalose remained amorphous, as predicted by particle formation theory.
   D-Leu acts as a dispersibility enhancer, ensuring that both
   formulations: 1) delivered over 40\% of the loaded dose into the in
   vitro lung region, and 2) achieved desired values of lung airway surface
   liquid concentrations based on lung deposition simulations.
   Theoretical models were applied to successfully achieve complex
   formulations with design challenges a priori. No further iterations to
   the design process were required.}},

Abstract = {{Solid lubricated bearings are important mechanical components in space,
   and accelerated life tests (ALT) of them are widely conducted. ALT model
   is needed to give the lifetime of solid lubricated bearings with ALT
   data, and former accelerated life test models of solid lubricated models
   are mainly statistical models, while physical models can imply an
   understanding of the failure mechanism and are preferred whenever
   possible. This paper proposes a physical model, which is called copula
   dependent proportional hazards model. A solid lubricated bearing is
   considered as a system consisting of several dependent items and Clayton
   copula function is used to describe the dependence. Proportional hazard
   effect is also considered to build the model. An ALT of solid lubricated
   bearing is carried out and the results show that this model is

Abstract = {{People recognize familiar faces in a similar way by using interior
   facial features (facial regions) such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc.
   However, the importance of these regions in the realization of face
   identification and a quantification of the impact of such regions on the
   recognition process could vary from one region to another. An
   intuitively appealing observation is that of monotonicity: the more
   regions are taken into account in the recognition process, the better.
   From a formal point of view, the relevance of the facial regions and an
   aggregation of these pieces of experimental evidence can be described in
   the formal setting of fuzzy measures. Fuzzy measures are of particular

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{206-212}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Vector fitting (VF) is known as the most popular method for
   frequency-dependent modelling. Using VF, frequency-domain data of a
   network can be converted into an equivalent circuit model. Some initial
   poles need to be selected before VF can be started. The starting poles
   affect the accuracy and convergence speed of the vector fitting method.
   In this paper, a new procedure is proposed to select starting poles. The
   proposed procedure selects starting poles by partitioning the frequency
   response, and then ranks the starting poles so that the most dominant
   poles can be used when low order approximation is desired. Case study
   results show that the proposed procedure improves the accuracy and the
   speed of VF significantly. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The City of Edmonton is developing a city-wide cycling network through
   the Complete Streets project (inclusively) and the On-Street Bike Route
   project (exclusively). The Complete Streets project develops new roadway
   design guidelines that consider a specific corridor's function and
   users, and provides appropriate transportation infrastructure, including
   traffic lights, signage, and turning lanes. The On-Street Bike Route
   project designs and installs cycling infrastructure (facilities),
   including multiuse trails, bike lanes, and shared-use lanes. The present
   study aims to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to
   severe bicycle-motor vehicle (BMV) collisions. The study investigates a
   total of 571 BMV collisions (424 intersection-related and 147
   midblock-related BMV collisions) that occurred between 2006 and 2009 to
   provide a baseline understanding of Edmonton's cycling safety concerns,
   prior to the installation of on-street cycling facilities. Spatial mixed
   logit models were fitted to the data. The categories of covariates
   included corridor design, human, temporal, and environmental factors.
   The results did not show any common factors contributing to BMV
   collision severity at intersections or midblock sections. Significant
   factors affecting the BMV intersection collision severity included the
   interaction between roadway and approach-control type, the existence of
   partial crosswalks and bike signs, and the cyclist's gender and age.
   Alternatively, factors affecting the probability of BMV midblock
   collision severity included roadway classification, on-street parking
   allocations, and the driver's age. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Investigating the safety effects of road width on urban collector
   roadways}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{305-311}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Collector roads are designed to provide a balance between traffic
   safety, mobility, and land access; however, the literature on the
   effects of collector lane width on safety is generally inconsistent.
   This study determines the safety implications of oversized collectors by
   analyzing collisions statistics, traffic-survey data, and
   roadway-inventory data from the City of Edmonton. The paper adopts a
   cross-sectional evaluation methodology by developing negative binomial
   (NB) safety performance functions (SPFs) for total collisions. Based on
   the NB SPFs, it was found that segment length, traffic volume,
   access-point density and midblock change was statistically significant
   and positively related to collisions, while the width was negatively
   related to collisions and statistically significant. The interaction
   term of volume and lane width was found to be positively related to
   collisions. This suggests that the collision rate for oversized
   collector roads is higher than that for standard-sized roads. It was
   also found that both standard-sized and oversized roads, with some form
   of midblock roadway width change, were less safe than those with uniform
   width. Converting oversized roads to standard size was found to improve
   safety only for the roads with an average daily traffic (ADT) volume
   higher than 4000. The maximum crash reduction was estimated to be as
   high as 28.9\%. This study is timely given the contradicting evidence
   that exists in current literature regarding the relationship between
   safety and oversized collector roads. For the present data set, this
   paper provides guidelines on when to convert oversized collector roads
   to standard-sized collector roads, to improve safety. Crown Copyright

Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In 2010, the City of Edmonton reduced the posted speed limit (PSL) in
   six residential communities from 50 to 40 km/h. This study investigates
   the impact of the reduced PSL on vehicle speeds using a before-and-after
   experimental design with a control group adjustment. Continuous speed
   and traffic flow data was collected at 65 locations over a period of 7
   months, with the first month representing the before period and the
   following 6 months representing the after period. Speed evaluation was
   performed on several levels, ranging from individual speed survey
   locations to an overall aggregate analysis. Several performance
   indicators, such as mean free-flow speed, speed variance, level of
   compliance, and percentile speed profile, were considered. The results
   revealed a statistically significant reduction in mean free-flow speed
   and speed variances for all combinations of time-of-day and day-of-week
   classifications. Though absolute compliance to the reduced PSL was low,
   compliance to a 15 km/h threshold above the PSL was significantly high.
   Moreover, the analysis showed that the effectiveness of the reduced PSL
   improved with time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a relatively less studied class of structures is
   presented based on the research conducted on Florida's movable bridges
   over the last several years. Movable bridges consist of complex
   structural, mechanical and electrical systems that provide versatility
   to these bridges, but at the same time, create intermittent operational
   and maintenance challenges. Movable bridges have been designed and
   constructed for some time; however, there are fewer studies in the
   literature on movable bridges as compared to other bridge types. In
   addition, none of these studies provide a comprehensive documentation of
   issues related to the condition of movable bridge populations in
   conjunction with possible monitoring applications specific to these
   bridges. This paper characterises and documents these issues related to
   movable bridges considering both the mechanical and structural
   components. Considerations for designing a monitoring system for movable
   bridges are also presented based on inspection reports and expert
   opinions. The design and implementation of a monitoring system for a
   representative bascule bridge are presented along with long-term
   monitoring data. Various movable bridge characteristics such as
   opening/closing torque, bridge balance and friction are shown since
   these are critical for maintenance applications on mechanical
   components. Finally, the impact of environmental effects (such as wind
   and temperature) on bridge mechanical characteristics is demonstrated by
   analysing monitoring data for more than 1000 opening/closing events.}},

   impact of imperfect channel estimation on the performance of OC with
   decode-andforward relaying is analyzed. When the source-destination and
   relay-destination channel estimations are imperfect, the diversity gains
   of OC deteriorate and the performance further degrades with increase of
   the error variance. When the destination node accurately estimates the
   variances of the interferer channel state information (CSI), instead of
   instantaneous CSI, no performance loss is observed. Thus, the overhead
   associated with the interferer channel estimation in OC can be
   significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, data-based soft sensors are constructed upon the labeled
   historical dataset which contains equal numbers of input and output data
   samples. While it is easy to obtain input variables such as temperature,
   pressure, and flow rate in the chemical process, the output variables,
   which correspond to quality/key property variables, are much more
   difficult to obtain. Therefore, we may only have a small number of
   output data samples, and have much more input data samples. In this
   article, a mixture form of the semisupervised probabilistic principal
   component regression model is proposed for soft sensor application,
   which can efficiently incorporate the unlabeled data information from
   different operation modes. Compared to the total supervised method, both
   modeling efficiency and soft sensing performance are improved with the
   inclusion of additional unlabeled data samples. Two case studies are
   provided to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the new method.

Abstract = {{Granular data and granular models offer an interesting tool for
   representing data in problems involving uncertainty, inaccuracy,
   variability and subjectivity have to be taken into account. In this
   paper, we deal with a particular type of information granules, namely
   interval-valued data. We propose a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to model
   interval-valued input-output mappings. The proposed MLP comes with
   interval-valued weights and biases, and is trained using a genetic
   algorithm designed to fit data with different levels of granularity. In
   the evolutionary optimization, two implementations of the objective
   function, based on a numeric-valued and an interval-valued network
   error, respectively, are discussed and compared. The modeling
   capabilities of the proposed MLP are illustrated by means of its
   application to both synthetic and real world datasets. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Planetary gearboxes significantly differ from fixed-axis gearboxes and
   exhibit unique behaviors, which invalidate fault diagnosis methods
   working well for fixed-axis gearboxes. Much work has been done for
   condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of fixed-axis gearboxes, while
   studies on planetary gearboxes are not that many. However, we still
   notice that a number of publications on condition monitoring and fault
   diagnosis of planetary gearboxes have appeared in academic journals,
   conference proceedings and technical reports. This paper aims to review
   and summarize these publications and provide comprehensive references
   for researchers interested in this topic. The structures of a planetary
   gearbox as well as a fixed-axis one are briefly introduced and
   contrasted. The unique behaviors and fault characteristics of planetary
   gearboxes are identified and analyzed. Investigations on condition
   monitoring and fault diagnosis of planetary gearboxes are summarized
   based on the adopted methodologies. Finally, open problems are discussed
   and potential research topics are pointed out. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{525-534}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we develop a central profile-based 3D face pose
   estimation algorithm. The central profile is a unique curve on a 3Dface
   surface that starts from forehead center, goes down through nose ridge,
   nose tip, mouth center, and ends at a chin tip. The points on the
   central profile are co-planar and belong to a symmetry plane that
   separates human face into two identical parts. The central profile is
   protrusive and has a certain length. Most importantly, the normal
   vectors of the central profile points are parallel to the symmetry
   plane. Based on the properties of the central profile, Hough transform
   is employed to determine the symmetry plane by invoking a voting
   procedure. An objective function is introduced in the parameter space to
   quantify the vote importance for face profile points and map the central
   profile to an accumulator cell with the maximal value. Subsequently, a
   nose model matching algorithm is used to detect nose tip on the central
   profile. A pitch angle estimation algorithm is also proposed. The pose
   estimation experiments completed for a synthetic 3D face model and the
   FRGC v2.0 3D database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pose
   estimation algorithm. The obtained central profile detection rate is
   99.9\%, and the nose tip detection rate has reached 98.16\% with error
   not larger than 10 mm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In decision analysis, uncertainty is usually described in the framework
   of probability. However, a large number of experimental and theoretical
   studies showed that a single nature of probability does not accurately
   capture human preferences. To avoid this drawback, they use imprecise
   probabilities. But, as decision maker is usually uncertain about
   first-order imprecise probabilities, imprecise hierarchical probability
   models are used. For most of such models, the second levels are precise.
   There also exist studies on two-level imprecise hierarchical models,
   which use imprecise probabilities or possibilities at the second level.
   Most of these works are based on lower prevision theory leading to a
   large number of optimization problems. In the present paper, we propose
   an imprecise hierarchical decision-making model where the first and the
   second level are described by interval probabilities. The method
   associates with the construction of a nonadditive measure as a lower
   prevision and uses this capacity in Choquet integral for constructing a
   utility function. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We have used photothermal cantilever deflection spectroscopy (PCDS) for

   rise to a readily observable deflection. The nanomechanical deflection
   of the cantilever as a function of illumination wavelength corresponds
   to the IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. Here, we report
   on detection and molecular discrimination of nanogram quantities of

Abstract = {{Dry adhesives containing nonuniform arrays of fibrils were tested for
   the uniformity of their adhesion strength. These arrays comprised
   fibrils with nanometer-scale dimensions and lengths tuned from 150 to
   1500nm. The surfaces of the fibrils were rendered hydrophobic through a
   vapor phase deposition of silane molecules to further tune the adhesion
   strength of the fibrillar structure. Adhesion force measurements over
   micrometer-length scales were obtained using a tipless cantilever
   controlled by a scanning probe microscope. Maps of the adhesion forces
   depicted diverse variations in adhesion strength with the nonuniform
   lateral changes in topography. Through an extensive data analysis,
   differences observed between samples were correlated to changes in
   processing conditions and surface chemistry modifications. The methods
   demonstrated in this paper are useful for identifying variations in the
   adhesion strength of dry adhesives made of nonuniform arrays of fibrils.
   These advancements are crucial for understanding the correlation between
   structure and function within nonuniform fibrillar adhesives.}},

Abstract = {{Although bioinspired dry adhesives are nearly a decade old, there are to
   date no available commercial products based on these materials. Although
   commercialization is a while off, great strides have been made with
   respect to physical modeling of actual gecko adhesion, synthetic
   fabrication methods, and introduction of capabilities like
   self-cleaning, directional behavior, and superhydrophobic behavior into
   synthetic variations. Despite the large number of fabrication methods
   available, there are still specific difficulties in manufacturing these
   materials that limit their use in commercial applications. In this
   paper, we describe how a simple manufacturing technology can be adapted
   to create relatively high-strength adhesives at low costs on large
   areas. Our focus is on determining how larger diameter, easily
   manufactured fiber shapes can be best designed to adhere to smooth
   surfaces. This manufacturing method has been used to successfully
   produce adhesives from a variety of materials, and we demonstrate how it
   can be adapted to form the microscale mushroom-shaped fibers necessary
   for strong adhesion without needing vacuum casting. Additionally, we
   present practical lessons learned in what makes an effective dry
   adhesive for industrial applications, where the expected surfaces to be
   encountered are mostly flat and rigid in comparison to the adhesive
   material. Finally, the importance of tip roughness due to manufacturing

Abstract = {{We present how direction-sensitive biomimetic dry adhesives made from
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) may be tailored directly with standard
   lithographic techniques without requirements for angled fibers or caps.
   Specifically, it is possible to alter both 90 degrees pull-off adhesion
   strength and directionality solely through the control over precise cap
   dimensions and offset, and the improved or reduced adhesion strength is
   determined primarily by the vulnerability of the fiber cap to peeling in
   different directions. Running experimental trials on two different
   variations of anisotropic adhesives and two isotropic adhesives reveal
   that in this method, directionality is due to reducing the adhesion
   strength in specific orientations rather than improving it in the strong
   direction, and this has implications for the maximum adhesion strengths
   that could be reached with direction-sensitive designs. Using a
   combination of microscale normal adhesion tests, load-drag-pull tests
   and macroscale peel strength tests, we reveal that peel strength is the
   primary factor that is necessary to characterize when manufacturing dry
   adhesives, as it will ultimately affect all other properties of
   interest. Our anisotropic adhesive variations have demonstrated peel
   strength ratios of approximately 15:1, making these versions some of the
   most directionally sensitive to date, while isotropic variations can
   demonstrate more than 600kPa of adhesion strength in the normal
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylenimine (PEI) is known to be one of the most promising polymers
   to serve as a delivery carrier in gene therapy. Complexation between PEI
   molecules and nucleic acids results in nanoparticles that can
   subsequently enter cells for therapeutic treatment. Design of the
   carrier molecules for stabler complexation, better cell uptake, and
   lower cytotoxicity remains to be a challenge. Molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations allow atomistic level examination of the complexation
   between PEI and nucleic acids, as well as the interaction of the
   complexes formed with other entities in the delivery path. It is a
   powerful tool in revealing the role of carrier molecules and guiding the
   design of more effective delivery systems. In this work, we first review
   the current status in studying complexation of PEI with nucleic acids
   and interaction between the complex formed and cell membrane. We have
   conducted preliminary MD simulations on several aspects of complexation
   between PEI and DNA. These results are presented to demonstrate how MD

Abstract = {{The increasing application of nonlinear loads may cause distribution
   system power quality issues. In order to utilize distributed generation
   (DG) unit interfacing converters to actively compensate harmonics, this
   paper proposes an enhanced current control approach, which seamlessly
   integrates system harmonic mitigation capabilities with the primary DG
   power generation function. As the proposed current controller has two
   well-decoupled control branches to independently control fundamental and
   harmonic DG currents, local nonlinear load harmonic current detection
   and distribution system harmonic voltage detection are not necessary for
   the proposed harmonic compensation method. Moreover, a closed-loop power
   control scheme is employed to directly derive the fundamental current
   reference without using any phase-locked loops (PLL). The proposed power
   control scheme effectively eliminates the impacts of steady-state
   fundamental current tracking errors in the DG units. Thus, an accurate
   power control is realized even when the harmonic compensation functions
   are activated. In addition, this paper also briefly discusses the
   performance of the proposed method when DG unit is connected to a grid
   with frequency deviation. Simulated and experimental results from a
   single-phase DG unit validate the correctness of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify the effects of aluminum content
   and strain rate on the compressive strain hardening behavior of AZ31,
   AZ61 and AZ91D cast magnesium alloys. The yield strength (YS) and
   ultimate compressive strength (UCS) of the alloys increased but the
   strain to failure decreased with increasing aluminum content, due to the
   presence of an increasing number of beta-Mg17Al12 particles. The YS
   increased slightly with increasing strain rate, while the strain-rate
   dependence of the UCS and the strain to failure was basically absent,
   leading to a decreasing hardening capacity. The strain hardening
   exponent and strength coefficient evaluated via four equations of
   Ludwik, Hollomon, Swift, and Afrin et al. showed a similar increase with
   increasing strain rate in the AZ31 alloy, but were nearly independent of
   strain rate in the AZ61 and AZ91D alloys. The strength coefficient
   increased with increasing aluminum content based on all the four
   equations. The three alloys exhibited stage III hardening followed by
   stage IV hardening. AZ31 alloy had the longest stage IV hardening and
   the highest strain to failure, followed by AZ61 and AZ91D alloys. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports on tests conducted to establish the influence of
   chopped glass fibers on the mechanical and rheological properties of
   ceramic concrete produced using a phosphate cement binder. Two different
   ceramic concrete matrices were studied, containing either sand or
   lightweight expanded clay aggregates. Fiber volume fractions between 0\%
   and 2\% were examined. The addition of glass fibers into ceramic
   concrete had little influence on the compressive strength and modulus of
   elasticity but resulted in significant increases in flexural strength
   and direct shear strength, regardless of the matrix type or fiber
   length. The results also showed that the compression, the flexure and
   the shear toughness all increased with an increase in the fiber content,
   while the workability decreased with an increase in fiber content.
   Overall, the results indicate that glass fiber reinforced ceramic

Abstract = {{The widely adopted alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation for
   rice production in lowland paddy fields with shallow groundwater table
   is increasingly needed to quantify the soil water regime for irrigation
   schedule design. Field experiments were conducted to compare the soil
   water flow between paddy fields under AWD and continuously flooded
   irrigation (CFI), during the rice growing season in 2010-2011. Model
   simulations using HYDRUS-1D were also conducted based on the measured
   pressure head distribution of soil profiles. Modeling results show that
   the pressure head derived from forward simulation using the point
   estimated soil hydraulic parameters did not agree well with the measured
   pressure head. However, from inverse modeling of saturated hydraulic
   conductivities of plow pan (mean of 0.68 cm d(-1) in AWD plots and 0.54
   cm d(-1) in CFI plots), the HYDRUS-1D model can properly simulate the
   water flow in multi-layer paddy soil flow, where the plow pan plays an
   important role in determining the vertical pressure head distribution.
   The measured pressure head and simulated pressure head derived from
   inverse modeling agreed well (NSE of 0.93-0.98) during the whole rice
   growing season. Measurement and simulation results indicated that the
   practice of AWD decreased the percolation 38.2-40.3\% in 2010 and
   23.3-27.2\% in 2011, compared to that of CFI. It is also found that
   groundwater capillary rise amounted to 26.1-27.4\% in AWD plots, and
   10.2-18.1\% in CFI plots of respective water input (irrigation and
   rainfall). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Initial partitioning and aggregation of several uncharged polyaromatic
   (PA) molecules with the same polyaromatic core but different terminal
   moieties at oil-water interfaces from the bulk oil phase were studied by
   molecular dynamics simulation. The partition of the PA molecules between
   the bulk organic phase and oil-water interface was highly dependent on
   the terminal moiety structure of the PA molecules and aromaticity of the
   organic phase. The polarity ratio between the oil and water phases
   showed a significant influence on adsorption of the PA molecules at the
   oil-water interface. The presence of hydrophobic aromatic moieties in PA
   molecules hindered the adsorption process. Larger aromatic rings in PA
   molecules lowered the interfacial activity due to strong intermolecular
   pi-pi interactions and molecular aggregation in the bulk oil phase. The
   presence of a terminal carboxylic functional group on the side chain
   enhanced the adsorption of the PA molecules at the oil-water interface.
   The fused ring plane of the uncharged PA molecules was found to
   preferentially adsorb at the oil water interface in a head-on or side-on
   orientation with the polyaromatic core staying in the nonaqueous phase
   (i.e., the principal plane of the molecule perpendicular to the
   oil-water interface). The results obtained from this study could provide
   a scientific direction for the design of proper chemical demulsifiers
   for PA molecule-mediated emulsions formed under specific process
   conditions of temperature, pressure, and pH.}},

   self-assembled fractal structures to substantially larger mobile
   ``liquid-like{''} domains that show distinct tendencies of substrate
   repulsion and self-coalescence. This new aggregation dynamics of
   asphaltene can be explained by temperature-induced transition of

Abstract = {{Branched indium tin oxide (ITO) nanowire networks are promising
   candidates for transparent conductive oxide applications, such as
   optoelectronic electrodes, due to their high porosity. However, these
   branched networks also present new challenges in assessing conductivity.
   Conventional four-point probe techniques cannot separate the effect of
   porosity on the long-range conductivity from the intrinsic material
   conductivity. Here we compare the average nanoscale conductivity within
   the film measured by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to the
   film conductivity measured by four-point probe in a branched ITO
   nanowire network. Both techniques report conductivity increases with
   deposition flux rate from 0.5 to 3.0 nm s(-1), achieving a maximum of
   similar to 10 (Omega cm)(-1). Modeling the THz-TDS conductivity data
   using the Drude-Smith model allows us to distinguish between
   conductivity increases resulting from morphological changes and those
   resulting from the intrinsic properties of the ITO. In particular, the
   intrinsic material conductivity within the nanowires can be extracted,
   and is found to reach a maximum of similar to 3000 (Omega cm)(-1),
   comparable to bulk ITO. To determine the mechanism responsible for
   increasing conductivity with flux rate, we characterize dopant
   concentration and morphological changes (i.e., to branching behavior,
   nanowire diameter and nucleation layers). We propose that changes in the
   electron density, primarily due to changes in O-vacancy concentration at
   different flux rates, are responsible for the observed conductivity
   increase. This understanding will assist balancing structural and
   conductivity requirements in applications of transparent conductive
   oxide networks.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid method of obtaining photoacoustic spectroscopic signals for
   trace amounts of surface adsorbed molecules using a nanostructured
   coupled resonator array is described. Explosive molecules adsorbed on a
   nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide cantilever, which has hexagonally
   ordered nanowells with diameters and well-to-well distances of 35 nm and
   100 nm, respectively, are excited using pulsed infrared (IR) light with
   a frequency matching the common mode resonance frequency of the coupled
   resonator. The common mode resonance amplitudes of the coupled resonator
   as a function of illuminating IR wavelength present a photoacoustic IR
   absorption spectrum representing the chemical signatures of the adsorbed
   explosive molecules. In addition, the mass of the adsorbed molecules as
   an orthogonal signal for quantitative analysis is determined by
   measuring the variation of the localized, individual mode resonance
   frequency of a cantilever on the array. The limit of detection of the
   ternary mixture of explosive molecules (1:1:1 of trinitrotoluene (TNT),
   cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate
   (PETN)) is estimated to be similar to 100 ng cm(-2). These multi-modal

   Basidiomycete Fungi}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Genome sequencing of basidiomycetes, a group of fungi capable of
   degrading/mineralizing plant material, revealed the presence of numerous
   cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) in their genomes, with some
   exceptions. Considering the large repertoire of P450s found in fungi, it
   is difficult to identify P450s that play an important role in fungal
   metabolism and the adaptation of fungi to diverse ecological niches. In
   this study, we followed Sir Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection
   to identify such P450s in model basidiomycete fungi showing a preference
   for different types of plant components degradation. Any P450 family
   comprising a large number of member P450s compared to other P450
   families indicates its natural selection over other P450 families by its
   important role in fungal physiology. Genome-wide comparative P450
   analysis in the basidiomycete species, Phanerochaete chrysosporium,
   Phanerochaete carnosa, Agaricus bisporus, Postia placenta, Ganoderma sp.
   and Serpula lacrymans, revealed enrichment of 11 P450 families (out of
   68 P450 families), CYP63, CYP512, CYP5035, CYP5037, CYP5136, CYP5141,
   CYP5144, CYP5146, CYP5150, CYP5348 and CYP5359. Phylogenetic analysis of
   the P450 family showed species-specific alignment of P450s across the
   P450 families with the exception of P450s of Phanerochaete chrysosporium
   and Phanerochaete carnosa, suggesting paralogous evolution of P450s in
   model basidiomycetes. P450 gene-structure analysis revealed high
   conservation in the size of exons and the location of introns. P450s
   with the same gene structure were found tandemly arranged in the genomes
   of selected fungi. This clearly suggests that extensive gene
   duplications, particularly tandem gene duplications, led to the
   enrichment of selective P450 families in basidiomycetes. Functional
   analysis and gene expression profiling data suggest that members of the
   P450 families are catalytically versatile and possibly involved in
   fungal colonization of plant material. To our knowledge, this is the
   first report on the identification and comparative-evolutionary analysis
   of P450 families enriched in model basidiomycetes.}},

Abstract = {{Leucocin A, a representative class IIa bacteriocin, is a ribosomally
   synthesized antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that displays potent activity
   against specific gram-positive bacteria. The antibacterial activity of
   such peptides is preceded by the binding event that can be utilized for
   studying specific peptide bacteria interactions. In this study,
   37-residue Leucocin A (LeuA) was synthesized using solid-phase peptide
   synthesis and covalently immobilized on gold substrates from either the
   N- or C-terminal. Both the peptide monolayers on gold substrates were
   incubated separately with five strains of gram-positive bacteria and
   displayed differential binding to different strains with highest binding
   to pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes. The C-terminally immobilized LeuA
   showed higher bacterial binding compared to the N-terminally attached
   LeuA. The full length immobilized LeuA (37-residue) was active as well
   as displayed higher bacterial binding (73 +/- 6 bacteria/100 mu m(2))
   compared to 24-residue inactive LeuA fragment (40 +/- 8 bacteria/100 mu
   m(2)) from the C-terminal region. The high and specific bacterial
   binding ability of LeuA functionalized surfaces support the potential
   use of class IIa bacteriocins in antimicrobial peptide-based diagnostic
   platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The present work deals with the shedding of liquid drops by a liquid
   shear flow, which is still not adequately addressed experimentally in
   the literature. The effect of surface wettability, physical properties
   of the oil drop, flow velocity, and drop size on single drop detachment
   was studied. A force balance analogy was carried out to theoretically
   better understand the phenomena. Through an experimental study the
   shedding of series of silicone oil drops of varying viscosities from
   oleophilic Teflon and oleophobic PMMA subjected to a shearing water
   flow, was investigated. The drop motion was tracked using two cameras.
   The position of upstream and downstream drop contact points, drop height
   and baselength, was measured using image processing. The main results
   show that at high viscosities oil drops detach more easily from Teflon
   than PMMA. Different regimes of drop shedding have been observed
   including: (1) drop deformation in the flow direction followed by drop
   sliding, (2) sliding along the substrate without any significant
   deformation, and (3) drop deformation and sliding followed by lift-off
   from the surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces a general event triggered framework of state
   estimation for discrete-time systems with parameter uncertainties
   residing in a polytope. A robust filter is designed to ensure the (2)
   stability from disturbance to the estimation error and to minimise the
   (2) gain subject to both packet rate and size constraints. The number of
   data transmission and the data size are reduced by the utilisation of an
   event detector and a logarithmic quantiser, respectively. The event
   detector compares the current output measurement with the last
   transmitted measurement: if the difference is beyond a prescribed
   percentage of the current measurement, then the current measurement is
   transmitted to the quantiser. The quantiser encodes the measurement
   before sending to the filter via a digital communication channel.
   Conditions for filter design are found using polynomially
   parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions, which generalise the results
   using quadratic and linearly parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. The
   usefulness of the techniques is demonstrated with an illustrative
   example.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{We provide a theory to analyze the impact of finite ion sizes (or steric
   effect) in electrostatic potential distribution for a charged soft
   surface in contact with an electrolyte solution. The theory is based on
   a free energy model that appropriately accounts for the contribution of
   finite ion sizes as well as the structural characteristics of a soft
   interface, represented by a combination of a rigid surface and a fixed
   charge layer (FCL), with the FCL being in contact with an electrolyte
   solution forming an electric double layer (EDL). This FCL contains a
   particular kind of ion which is impermeable to the electrolyte solution,
   and this impermeability is quantified in terms of the corresponding
   Donnan potential of the ``membrane{''} represented by the
   FCL-electrolyte interface. We find that consideration of the finite ion
   size increases the magnitude of this Donnan potential, with the extent
   of increase being dictated by three length scales, namely, the thickness
   of the FCL, the thickness of the electrolyte EDL, and the thickness of
   an equivalent EDL within the FCL. Such regulation of the Donnan
   potential strongly affects the distribution of the permeable electrolyte
   ions within the FCL, which in turn will have significant implications in
   several processes involving ``soft{''} biological membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Process data are the most important information in all aspects of plant
   monitoring and control applications. These data, stemming from
   instruments, carry the necessary information that assists plant
   operations. One of the common problems of process instrument readings is
   their deviation from true values due to instrument bias or systematic
   error. Detection of change points in process data is the first step for
   a more insightful analysis of hidden factors affecting the process. In
   this paper, both Bayesian and Expectation and Maximization (EM) methods
   are considered for change point detection problem of multivariate data
   with both single and multiple changes. The performance of EM is compared
   with the Bayesian approach. Simulation results show superiority of EM in
   the case of improper selection of priors while the Bayesian approach has
   less computation demand. The proposed algorithms are evaluated through
   several examples, two from simulated random data and one from a CSTR
   problem. It is also verified through an experimental study of a hybrid
   tank system. (C) 42013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable design of solvent injection for oil recovery requires accurate
   representation of multiphase behavior in a wide range of pressure
   temperature composition conditions. Volume shift is often required to
   improve density predictions, separately from compositional behavior
   predictions, in conventional fluid characterization methods (CM).
   Thermodynamically, however, volumetric behavior predictions are
   consequences of compositional behavior predictions. We develop a new
   fluid characterization method (NM) that gives accurate multiphase
   behavior representation for oil/solvent mixtures without volume shift.
   The Peng-Robinson EOS is used with the van der Waals mixing rules. The
   NM is compared with the CM in terms of phase diagrams, minimum
   miscibility pressure calculations, and oil displacement simulations. It
   is shown that the CM with volume shift can give erroneous phase behavior
   and oil recovery predictions. The NM requires no volume shift to achieve
   accurate predictions of compositional and volumetric phase behaviors.
   The two types of phase behaviors are properly coupled in the NM.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of sustainable development is to balance social, economic, and
   environmental needs. In order to justify the decisions they make,
   stakeholders must quantify the different impacts found in the operations
   and developments of companies and/or projects throughout their life
   cycle. However, as some areas are subjective in nature, the
   quantification process of the different impacts and the assessment of
   sustainable development performance become arduous tasks of development,
   validation, and application of scientific and empirical methods with the
   intrinsic objective of finding an agreement among the involved parties
   (i.e., stakeholders). Several environmental and sustainability
   assessment tools, instruments, processes, and methodologies have been
   developed; rating systems stand out and have gained attention and
   credibility, as demonstrated by the vast number of certified projects
   around the world and the widely-known usefulness and advantages of their
   application. The Wa-Pa-Su project sustainability rating system presents
   an integrated approach to sustainability assessment by integrating three
   distinctive areas of knowledge: (1) sustainable development theory and
   fundamentals supports the ultimate goal of the rating system, which is
   to contribute to sustainability, with the aim of finding a path to
   balance social, economic, and environmental needs; (2) continual
   performance improvement becomes essential due to the duration of the
   projects, as it is critical to allow organizations or projects to
   improve performance over time; and (3) multi-criteria decision analysis
   assists with the assessment process through stakeholder engagement and
   participation, and the design and implementation of a criteria weighting

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{In this research, a new type of manufacturing feature that is commonly
   observed in aircraft structural parts, known as ribs, is defined and
   implemented using the object-oriented software engineering approach. The
   rib feature type is defined as a set of constrained and adjacent faces
   of a part which are associated with a set of specific rib machining
   operations. Computerized numerical control (CNC) operation experience
   and the machining knowledge are leveraged by analysing typical geometry
   interactions when generating machining tool paths where such knowledge
   and experience are abstracted as rules of process planning. Then those
   abstracted machining process rules are implemented in a feature
   recognition algorithm on top of an existing and holistic attribute
   adjacency graph solution to extract seed faces, identify individual
   local rib elements and further cluster these newly identified local rib
   elements into groups for the ease of machining operations. Out of the
   potentially different combinations of local rib elements, those
   optimised cluster groups are merged into the top-level rib features. The
   enhanced recognition algorithm is presented in details. A pilot system
   has already been developed and applied for machining many advanced
   aircraft structural parts in a large aircraft manufacturer. Observations
   and conclusions are presented at the end.}},

Abstract = {{Protein fold is defined by a spatial arrangement of three types of
   secondary structures (SSs) including helices, sheets, and coils/loops.
   Current methods that predict SS from sequences rely on complex machine
   learning-derived models andprovide the three-state accuracy (Q(3)) at
   about 82\%. Further improvements in predictive quality could be obtained
   with a consensus-based approach, which so far received limited
   attention. We perform first-of-its-kind comprehensive design of a SS
   consensus predictor (SScon), in which we consider 12 modern standalone
   SS predictors and utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) to combine their
   predictions. Using a large benchmark data-set with 10 random
   training-test splits, we show that a simple, voting-based consensus of
   carefully selected base methods improves Q(3) by 1.9\% when compared to
   the best single predictor. Use of SVM provides additional 1.4\%
   improvement with the overall Q(3) at 85.6\% and segment overlap (SOV3)
   at 83.7\%, when compared to 82.3 and 80.9\%, respectively, obtained by
   the best individual methods. We also show strong improvements when the
   consensus is based on ab-initio methods, with Q(3) = 82.3\% and SOV3 =
   80.7\% that match the results from the best template-based approaches.
   Our consensus reduces the number of significant errors where helix is
   confused with a strand, provides particularly good results for short
   helices and strands, and gives the most accurate estimates of the
   content of individual SSs in the chain. Case studies are used to
   visualize the improvements offered by the consensus at the residue
   level. A web-server and a standalone implementation of SScon are
   available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/SSCon/.}},

Abstract = {{Solution processing (SP) is a cheap, simple and high throughput method
   for the fabrication of ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs). Lack of
   enhancement mode operation, poor crystallinity, traps, and poor control
   of the carrier concentration are some of the disadvantages of this
   method. The high intrinsic electron concentration of SP-ZnO makes
   saturation of TFTs non-trivial. We report on Schottky barrier thin film
   transistors (SB-TFT). By biasing the source Schottky contact in reverse
   bias, a depletion region is formed around the source contact hence
   depleting the region from the free charge carriers which produces the
   saturation of the device. The effect of the Schottky contact is
   illustrated by comparing the operation of SB-TFTs with that of
   conventional TFTs.}},

   about their surroundings in a timely fashion. Frequent data sampling is
   desired to obtain data with high temporal resolution, and frequent
   wireless transmissions are needed in order to get the data to end users
   without unnecessary delays. Energy harvesting systems depend, to a large
   extent, on the energy available in the environment. They need
   sophisticated control approaches in order to consolidate these
   requirements with the need for autonomous operation and longevity of the
   system. This study proposes a novel approach for dynamic control of
   energy harvesting nodes. It uses fuzzy logic controller evolved by
   differential evolution. The evolved control system is evaluated in a

Abstract = {{Current plant disease forecasting models require collection of
   information on inoculum density or pathogen load. This information is
   typically collected using subjective assessments or laborious and slow
   spore trapping or pathogen culturing methods, which in turn limit the
   amount of data that can be collected and may delay results past the time
   that disease control decisions can be made. In this article, we have
   selected Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of stem rot of
   canola and many other economically important plant diseases, as our
   model target organism. We have shown that the conductivity of the
   nanoparticle-ascospore complexes is correlated with the number of
   spores. These signals could be easily processed electronically and
   converted to rapidly distributable results, e.g. to smart phones.}},

Abstract = {{Lab-on-chip technology has tremendous potential for point-of-care and
   in-field medical diagnostics, but the uptake of such technologies is
   hampered by the high cost and large size of the instrumentation
   conventionally required. In the present work we demonstrate an
   instrument that fully automates sample preparation, enzymatic digestion
   and electrophoresis to implement DNA sizing and restriction fragment
   length polymorphism analysis for mutation detection. The instrument is
   largely based on a single CMOS chip, notably for fluorescence detection
   and high voltage generation, and can be operated in an off-the-shelf
   mode using low-cost pre-packaged polymeric microfluidic chips. We
   demonstrate the automated detection of the C282Y single nucleotide
   mutation in the HFE gene that underlies hereditary haemochromatosis. The
   system is currently in a portable form factor and could be implemented
   in a hand-held format. In higher volumes of manufacture, the remainder
   of the instrument could be moved to the CMOS chip, enabling a single
   chip instrument that could be housed within an inexpensive, thumb-sized
   device.}},

   the cell circuit other than the memristor biasing scheme. A detailed

Abstract = {{Multilayer graphene (MLG) or thin graphitic films as grown on nickel
   (Ni) or cobalt (Co) has been recently proposed as a promising platform
   for realizing highly efficient spin filters. However, graphene forms
   chemisorption interface with Ni and Co, which significantly affects the
   electronic properties of the interfacial layers as well as the growth of
   the subsequent graphene layers. Such systems can give rise to various
   types of magnetoresistance (MR) effects that are completely unrelated to
   spin filtering. It is, therefore, important to understand these MR
   effects in order to identify the spin filtering related signal. In this
   work we highlight on the various MR effects that are observed in Ni/MLG
   systems and that are also unrelated to spin filtering. In particular, an
   ``interlayer magnetoresistance{''} (ILMR) effect manifests in these
   systems, which can result in large MR values that are comparable to
   state-of-the-art magnetic tunnel junctions at similar operating
   conditions. Preliminary measurements on Co/MLG samples also indicate
   presence of ILMR effect.}},

Abstract = {{A concept of the Semantic Web provides a framework for development of
   systems with higher levels of usability, operability and independence.
   One of the most intriguing ideas of this new paradigm is related to the
   vision of web systems requiring minimal involvement of humans in
   activities related to a pre-selection and eventually selection of most
   promising alternatives among all obtained options. In order to perform
   such a task, systems have to be able to mimic users' behaviour. To be
   more specific, such systems should know not only users' preferences but
   also users' levels of acceptance of alternatives that satisfy multiple
   criteria to a different degree. All this represents a challenge
   especially in the case when any information provided by any individuals
   is more likely to be vague than crisp. The approach proposed here aims
   at creating capability to mimic human acceptance patterns in order to
   make web systems more independent and human-like at the same time. To
   address these needs, the concepts of fuzziness and fuzzy reasoning are
   introduced as important aspects of systems supporting users in their
   selection processes. Architecture of such systems with ontologies
   representing fuzzy information and abilities to express vague acceptance
   levels of users is proposed and described. Feasibility of the presented
   approach is illustrated by a prototype of Semantic Web application Hotel
   Reservation System.}},

Abstract = {{Microalloying, in combination with thermomechanical controlled
   processing (TMCP), is a cost effective method of producing steels for a
   wide range of applications where improved mechanical properties, namely
   strength, formability and toughness coupled with weldability, are
   required. This paper reviews the efforts undertaken at the University of
   Alberta aimed at improving the above mentioned mechanical properties in
   microalloyed steels used in the transmission of oil and gas (i.e.,
   pipelines). Topics that will be reviewed include the characterization of
   precipitates, the effect of processing conditions on precipitate
   evolution, and the effect of pipe forming and subsequent low temperature
   heat treatment on tensile behaviour and the use of Genetic Algorithm
   optimization of the laminar cooling system to produce a uniform through
   thickness microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensors are sophisticated embedded systems designed for
   collecting data on systems or processes of interest. In many cases, they
   are expected to operate in inaccessible locations, without user
   supervision. As a result, such monitoring systems need to operate
   autonomously and independently of external sources of energy. To achieve
   long-lived sustainability, monitoring systems often rely on energy
   extracted from the environment, e.g. through solar harvesting. Their
   design is a challenging problem with several conflicting goals and a
   number of design and implementation possibilities. For obvious reasons,
   these devices must be designed in an energy efficient way. As a result,
   they usually have low computational performance and cannot implement
   complicated control algorithms. At the same time, due to the
   requirements for autonomy and dependability, they must be endowed with
   certain degree of adaptability and fault tolerance - properties
   typically found in intelligent systems. In this contribution, we
   describe the design flow of an intelligent embedded control system for
   management of energy use in wireless monitoring systems. The paper also
   provides a simulation-based analysis of the control system performance.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental sensing is necessary for air quality monitoring,
   assessment of ecosystem health, or climate change tracking.
   Environmental monitoring systems can take a form of standalone
   monitoring stations or networks of individual sensor nodes with wireless
   connectivity. The latter approach allows high resolution mapping of
   spatiotemporal characteristics of the environment. To allow their
   autonomous operation and to minimize their maintenance costs, such
   systems are often powered using energy harvested from the environment
   itself. Due to the scarcity and intermittency of the environmental
   energy, operation of energy harvesting monitoring systems is not a
   trivial task. Their sensing, transmitting, and housekeeping activities
   must be carefully managed to extend their lifetime while providing
   desired quality of service. As the environmental conditions change with
   the region of deployment, the strategies for energy management must
   change accordingly to match the energy availability. In this work, we
   examine how geographic location affects the operations and quality of
   data collected by a solar-powered monitoring system. In particular, we
   use node/network simulation tools to follow the performance of
   energy-harvesting environmental monitoring sensor nodes at different
   latitudes, from equator to the pole. Static parameters of the simulated
   sensor nodes are determined for each latitude using an intelligent
   optimization method. The results show a clear dependence of the
   monitoring system performance on its deployment location. This
   encourages location-specific optimization of sensor node properties and
   parameters.}},

   adsorbs the vapors. This results in a change in the PDMS thickness and

Abstract = {{Coke drums are vertical pressure vessels used in the delayed coking
   process in petroleum refineries. Significant temperature variation
   during the delayed coking process causes damage in coke drums in the
   form of bulging and cracking. It was also observed that most cracks were
   near or within the weld seams. In order to better understand fatigue
   damage mechanisms of the coke drum materials with their weld sections,
   an experimental investigation of fatigue lives of these materials are
   carried out. It is a common consideration that the yield strength of the
   weld should be within a close percentage to that of base material in
   order to keep strength uniformity throughout the drum shell sections.
   However, this effect of the yield strength matching on the shell
   durability has not yet clarified quantitatively. From this point of
   view, two different types of specimens have been designed and
   manufactured: base material only, base with base weld. In addition,
   three groups of base with weld materials with different ratios of weld
   to base yield strengths are prepared. Low cycle fatigue tests at
   elevated temperature of 250 degrees C are carried out on the above
   specimens. Through study on the recorded stress-strain hysteresis loops
   and observation on the fracture surfaces, damage mechanisms of different
   types of specimens are analyzed. Their strain range fatigue life curves
   are also compared. Furthermore, finite element analyses based on the

Abstract = {{Polymer composite piping that is composed of a fiber reinforcement phase
   embedded in a continuous polymer matrix is associated with high specific
   strength and excellent corrosion properties. The fiber reinforcement is
   often considered to dominate the mechanical performance of composite
   structures. Consequently, principal design parameters for composite
   piping are usually associated with the fiber architecture, which in many
   practical applications has been limited to simple angle-ply
   configurations. Nevertheless, the function of the polymer phase is not
   limited to merely providing rigidity to the otherwise pliable fiber
   architecture. In fact, the often quoted high strength of composites is
   sustained by a load-sharing mechanism that the matrix enables between
   filaments. In this manner, the effect of localized flaws and filament
   damage is mitigated, and only the accumulation of numerous micro damage
   events leads to component failure. An additional function of the polymer
   matrix is to prevent ingress of fluid into the composite and possible
   leakage in pressure-bearing components. The design of composite piping
   therefore needs to consider a matrix-sensitive damage criterion. In view
   of variable loading conditions and multi-angle fiber architectures this
   study investigates design optimization techniques' intended to yield
   better performance in terms of strength and especially fluid permeation
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Coke drums are major pressure vessels used in petroleum refineries. In
   this paper, two simplified analytical models based on
   thermo-elasto-plastic constitutive theory have been developed to
   evaluate global and local stresses in coke drums during their operation
   cycles. The first model considers the temperature and internal pressure
   cycle experienced by a drum shell element consisting of clad and base
   steels. The second model is an axisymmetric circular cladding plate
   model experiencing a non-uniform temperature distribution history. The
   latter model considers the effects of severe local nonuniform
   temperature distributions produced by the hot/cold spots appearing
   randomly in coke drums during the water quenching stage. The predicted
   results by the simplified models are in agreement with the results
   obtained from much complicated and time-consuming finite element
   analysis (FEA) models for the coke drums. Corresponding software
   packages for application of the two simplified analysis models (SAM)
   have also been developed. The developed SAM and software could be a more
   convenient analysis tool for coke drum designers and engineers in
   comparison to the use of FEA software package.}},

Abstract = {{As an independent research and monitoring project, Aquistore intends to
   demonstrate that storing liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) deep underground
   (in a brine and sandstone water formation), is a safe, workable solution
   to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). Managed by the Petroleum Technology
   Research Centre, Aquistore is built upon the learnings of the IEAGHG
   Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project, where over 22MT of
   CO2 have been stored in an oil field during EOR operations. As a global
   leader, PTRC has over a decade of experience in CO2 storage and
   monitoring work.
   Aquistore is Canada's first dedicated CO2 storage project, and is an
   integral component of SaskPower's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture
   and Storage (CCS) Demonstration project - the world's first fully
   integrated CCS demonstration project from a coal-fired power plant. As
   an unique CCS project, Aquistore is providing buffer storage to this
   commercial CO2 capture plant and active oilfield EOR operations. In
   collaboration with SaskPower, Aquistore will be the first integrated
   project globally to demonstrate deep saline CO2 capture, transport, and
   storage on a commercial scale from a coal fired power plant. CO2 will be
   captured at unit 3 of the Boundary Dam powerstation (BD3), transported
   via underground pipeline to the Aquistore site, and injected to a depth
   of 3.4 km.
   The Winnipeg and Deadwood formations, which constitute the deepest units
   within the Williston Basin and were chosen as the target zone for CO2
   injection. These geological formations have much greater capacity for
   storing CO2 than any oil reservoir in western Canada. The suitability of
   the storage complex was investigated through 3D characterization using
   high-resolution 3D seismic images and data from the injection and
   observation wells. These data show that: there are no significant faults
   in the immediate area of the storage site; the regional sealing
   formation is continuous in the area; and lastly, that the reservoir is
   not adversely affected by knolls on the surface of the underlying
   Precambrian basement.
   In the Aquistore project PTRC has brought together internationally
   recognized expertise and diverse interests. Research in monitoring
   methods is central to the Aquistore Project. A permanent areal seismic
   monitoring array has been deployed which comprises 650 geophones
   installed at 20 m depth on a 2.5x2.5 km regular grid. The objective of
   this array is to test ``sparse array{''} seismic imaging and to provide
   continuous passive monitoring. This array is being utilized in
   conjunction and comparison with time-lapse 3D seismic imaging,
   continuous microseismic monitoring, vertical seismic profiling,
   cross-well seismic tomography, and broadband seismographs.
   Injection-related surface deformation monitoring is provided by InSAR
   analysis in conjunction with a network of tiltmeters and GPS stations.
   Electromagnetic surveys and gravimeters are also being used. In an
   effort to minimize surface impact these monitoring technologies - where
   possible - have been collocated and solar-powered.
   Surface electromagnetic methods and time-lapse gravity monitoring will
   be tested in conjunction with deployment of a fibre-optic distributed
   acoustic sensing (DAS) line. A fibre-optic distributed temperature
   sensing (DTS) line is also installed. A unique fluid recovery system
   (FRS) as well as casing conveyed pressure and temperature gauges will
   contribute to the project's down-hole monitoring techniques.
   Aquistore's MMV program will test and develop effective methods for
   monitoring CO2 storage sites and ensure conformance of the storage
   process through continuous monitoring. This program is seeking to
   minimize the risk associated with any potential leakage of CO2 from the
   storage reservoir through early detection. Aquistore's MMV program has
   included an added focus on integrated monitoring methods such as the
   inclusion of non-seismic methods and constraints from reservoir flow
   simulations. Aquistore will provide an efficient, cost effective, and
   field-tested basis for designing effective MMV programs for other
   similar projects worldwide. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{We proposed a hybrid device, which is capable of measuring either
   bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) or electrical impedance
   tomography (EIT) based on the Magnitude Ratio and Phase Difference
   Detection method. Frequency range available for measuring is from 1 kHz
   to 1 MHz. The device is based on The Freescale Tower system module with
   S08MM Freescale microcontroller. The proposed device is divided into two
   modules. One of them includes measurement chain, the second one contains
   four multiplexers, which connect always four electrodes to the circuit
   from total amount of sixteen electrodes. Both modules are connected via
   Tower elevator modules. While measuring impedance the systematic error
   occured, so we used the Quadratic Interpolation Self-calibration
   algorithm for calculation of the measured impedance. Calibration was
   applied on the absolute value of impedance. Calibration on the phase
   shift has not been done yet, since both input signals to GPD are highly
   disturbed with the noise, although they pass through a low-pass filter
   with cut-off frequency of 1 MHz. The superposed noise confuses GPD, so
   it cannot give the correct results. The relative error of impedance
   measurement after calibration ranges from -4.52 \% to 5.98 \% with mean
   value of -0.02 \%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a simulator for energy management in wireless

   The Mathworks Simulink environment was used to construct the simulator
   and allows real meteorological data to be used for long term simulated
   operation under different energy management strategies. Three of these
   strategies are tested and presented here; one is dynamically controlled
   by a fuzzy rule based system which allows it to adapt to the
   environmental energy profile, while the other two are statically
   controlled for comparison. The static control strategies seek to
   minimize energy related failures or to maximize the number of stored
   measurements disregarding failures. Ultimately, the strategy which
   allows the simulated sensor platform to adapt its operational level to
   the energy available in the environment is superior. It produces a data
   set with the highest number of data points and a very low number of
   consecutive device failures. It performs better in both areas than
   either of the other static energy management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative ultrasound is used to identify healthy versus osteoporotic
   bone. However the physics of ultrasound propagation in trabecular media
   is still not sufficiently understood. This lack of understanding is
   reported to be an obstacle in further development of this bone
   assessment technique. Numerical models of wave propagation stand as a
   potentially successful tool to explain the various experimental
   observations. The main issue in the numerical modeling of wave
   propagation in trabecular bone is the complex geometry of the trabecular
   structures surrounded by a fluid (bone marrow). So far, the complex
   geometrical domain of trabecular structures has been approximated by
   finite difference grids for wave propagation analyses. In this work,
   numerical simulation of ultrasound propagation into trabecular bone
   sample is performed using the finite element method (FEM). A new
   procedure for numerical modeling of trabecular bone tailored for the FEM
   is introduced. The entire complex trabecular geometries of two cubic
   bone samples are reconstructed using computed microtomography data. For
   the first time a three dimensional finite element mesh using tetrahedral
   elements is generated for the two-phase medium of a trabecular bone.
   Separate meshes for the bony part and the filling marrow (considered as
   non-viscous water) are generated and acoustic-structure interaction
   condition is imposed on their interface. It is shown that the
   three-dimensional simulation using the FEM can predict ultrasound
   propagation phenomena observed in experiments: linear dependency of
   attenuation on frequency, the effect of bone volume on the attenuation
   and speed of sound, and the propagation of fast and slow waves.
   Moreover, the broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) for two ultrasonic
   signals propagating into a healthy and an osteoporotic sample are
   compared. A distinguishable difference in BUA between the two samples is
   observed expressing lower BUA for osteoporotic bone. Our developed model
   is the first three-dimensional finite element analysis model to compare
   the ultrasound propagation in healthy versus osteoporotic bone. The
   developed model can be further utilized as a tool to explain various
   experimental observations of quantitative ultrasound of bone.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   broadcast relay channel (BRC), in which the communication of a
   multi-antenna base station (BS) with several multi-antenna mobile
   stations (MS) is assisted by a fixed half-duplex multi-antenna relay
   station (RS). Applying dirty paper coding (DPC) at the BS and
   beamforming at the RS, we jointly optimize the transmit covariance
   matrices at the BS and the beamforming matrix at the RS by maximizing
   the system sum rate, which is a nonconvex problem. To solve this
   problem, we resort to the more tractable sum rate maximization in the
   dual multiple access relay channel (MARC), which is still a nonconvex
   difference of convex functions (DC) programming problem. We develop an
   iterative algorithm, termed alternating matrix polynomial time DC
   (POTDC) algorithm, based on an alternating optimization of the
   beamforming matrix and the transmit covariance matrices. The resulting
   covariance matrices for the MARC are then mapped to the desired BRC
   covariance matrices. The sum rate performance of the proposed algorithm
   is demonstrated by simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Representing and processing imprecise knowledge has been a requirement
   for a number of applications. Some real-world domains as well as human
   subjective perceptions are intrinsically fuzzy, therefore conventional
   formalisms may not be sufficient to capture the intended semantics. In
   this sense, fuzzy ontologies and Mamdani fuzzy inference systems have
   been successfully applied for knowledge representation and reasoning.
   Combining their reasoning approaches can lead to inferences involving
   fuzzy rules and numerical properties from ontologies, which can be
   required to perform other fuzzy ontology reasoning tasks such as the
   fuzzy instance check. To address this issue, this paper describes the
   HyFOM reasoner, which follows a hybrid architecture to combine fuzzy
   ontology reasoning with Mamdani fuzzy inference system. A real-world
   case study involving the domain of food safety is presented, including
   comparative results with a state-of-the-art fuzzy description logic
   reasoner.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic sheath-flow is one of the techniques used to manipulate
   sample migration and prevent cross-contamination in multi-channel
   microfluidic devices. To achieve a successful design, it is important to
   predict the sample behaviour in advance. We use finite element method to
   investigate the effect of channel geometry on sample leakage in the
   presence of electrokinetic sheath-flow. A typical multi-channel device
   consisting of a main fractionation channel connected to a few collection
   channels is considered. It has' been observed experimentally that the
   depth of different components of the microfluidic device can change the
   sample leakage. In-detail investigations are made here in order to find
   the fundamental cause of the observed behaviour. Simulation results
   confirmed that by increasing the depth ratio of the collection channels
   to the main channel the sample leakage would decrease. Simulations are
   also performed to find criteria for choosing an optimum depth ratio for
   the channels in terms of both high functionality and ease of fabrication
   for any specific application.}},

   measurement cell is developed employing 3D printing technology. The cell
   is tested using glycerol-water mixtures followed by castor oil in water
   emulsion samples. Frequency response analysis and equivalent circuit
   modeling are performed on each sample to quantify the emulsion
   properties in the form of equivalent capacitance and resistance. The

Abstract = {{DC motor drive systems are extensively used in paper, steel, mining,
   material handling and other industrial applications due to high starting
   torque and easy speed control over a wide range. They could account for
   10\%-20\% load demand in some industrial facilities and thus have
   significant impact on the overall system dynamics. However, adequate
   dynamic model for this type of loads is not available for power system
   dynamic studies. In this paper, a comprehensive modeling method for DC
   motor drive systems is proposed considering two scenarios: 1) the drive
   will trip subjected to severe voltage sags; and 2) the drive can ride
   through when experiencing mild voltage sags. The DC drive trip curve and
   a simple procedure to determine if the drive needs to be included for
   dynamic studies are proposed for Scenario 1. The dynamic model for DC
   motor drive systems, which can be readily inserted in the simulation
   software, is developed and verified through case studies for Scenario 2.}},

Abstract = {{As the penetration of wind power into generation mix increases, the
   issue of its integration into the power grid becomes more and more
   important. The variability of wind power generation is a major concern
   as wind is highly intermittent. This may result in significant
   overproduction at times, followed by complete unavailability of wind
   power at other periods. This intermittency must be compensated for by
   other, conventional generation sources such as coal and gas fired power
   plants. This reduces the overall efficiency of the system due to the
   need of running some generators as spinning reserves, and lowers the
   overall contribution of renewable generation to the mitigation of
   greenhouse gas emissions.
   This paper examines the possibility to optimize the spatial distribution
   of wind power plants over an extended area to decrease the overall
   variability of wind power generation in a system. In particular, it
   considers the integration of spatially distributed wind power generation
   in the wind-rich province of Alberta, Canada. The distribution of power
   plants is optimized using simulated annealing and quadratic programming.
   The results clearly show that the variability of wind power generation
   can be reduced if the wind resources are integrated over a wide
   geographic area.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy has become one of the fastest growing renewable sources
   during last few decades. Sudden changes in wind power output, called
   wind ramps, recently attracted great research interest in wind power
   forecasting community. Conventional ramp prediction methods derive
   future ramp estimates from power forecast series. We suggest to analyze
   real wind power series or other weather parameters, searching for
   specific patterns and dependencies indicating forthcoming wind ramp
   events.
   This paper presents a methodology for parametric analysis of time series
   preceding wind ramp events. The presented methodology is based on
   probabilistic data analysis. Sensitivity of the developed algorithm can
   be adjusted through the size of the time window defined before a ramp
   event. Power production and other weather data are standardized,
   averaged and then searched for specific patterns in the form of trend
   lines. The resulting methodology does not require the use of a numerical
   weather prediction (NWP) model; this is a significant simplification
   compared to most conventional methods.
   The proposed methodology is tested using power production and wind speed
   data collected between August 2011 and July 2012 at a wind farm located
   in a wind-rich region of southern Alberta, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{For more than 20 years, the Saskatchewan Research Council's Pipe Flow
   model has been used by companies across the globe to predict pressure
   losses and minimum operating velocities ('deposition velocities') for
   the pipeline transport of heterogeneous (settling) slurries. The success
   of this semi-mechanistic, phenomenological model comes from the fact
   that the friction loss contributions of the dispersed, coarse particle
   phase are accounted for in a physically meaningful way. The focus of
   this study is on the need to make accurate off-line slurry
   characterization measurements to obtain accurate predictions of slurry
   flow behavior. The results of a number of slurry pipeline tests
   conducted under controlled conditions are presented. These results
   clearly demonstrate that, in addition to accurate measurements of
   particle size distribution and density, proper characterization of the
   following parameters is also critical: carrier fluid viscosity, settled
   bed coarse particle concentration, particle drag coefficient / particle
   terminal settling velocity, and the coefficient of friction between the
   particles and the pipe wall.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial Infarction (MI) occurs when the blood flow to the heart is
   blocked. It is major threat to human kind. Current laboratory and ELISA
   tests are expensive, time consuming, and are not very sensitive.
   Biosensors can play an important role in the diagnosis of MI without
   relying on hospital visits. Therefore, researchers are focusing to
   develop rapid, hand-held, inexpensive biosensors for detecting cardiac
   markers. In the present study, one of the cardiac markers (Troponin T)
   is detected using microfluidic based biosensor. Troponin T (cTnT)
   releases in to the blood serum within 4-6 h after minor heart attack and
   remains elevated for up to 2 weeks, which will help in diagnosing the
   heart condition. In this work, a microfluidic channel with an array of
   gold strips is considered for detecting and quantifying the Troponin Tin
   an aqueous solution. Troponin T primary (capture) antibody is
   immobilized on gold strip using self assembled monolayer (SAM)
   consisting of a homogeneous mixture of oligo (ethylene glycol)
   (OEG)-terminated alkanethiolate and mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA).
   Then, an aqueous solution con: taining Troponin T antigen is injected
   into the microchannel to facilitate antibody-antigen reaction to take
   place in less time. Later, FITC tagged Troponin T secondary (detection)
   antibody is dispensed in to the channel for quantification of Troponin T
   antigen. Using confocal fluorescent reader, the variation of fluorescent
   intensity across the microchannel is measured and quantified the
   concentration of Troponin T antigen with calibrated samples. Contact
   angle measurement system, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and
   Ellipsometer are used to characterize the surface properties at each
   stage of biomolecule immobilization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new technique for drop deposition on low
   energy surfaces, which addresses the limitations of the classical drop
   deposition technique. In this classical technique, a drop is deposited
   on a surface by bringing a needle, holding the drop, in proximity to the
   solid surface. Therefore, irrespective of whether the solid surface is
   in air or under a liquid, it becomes extremely difficult to deposit the
   drop on low energy surfaces owing to the large differences between the
   drop-needle and the drop-substrate adhesion forces (or surface
   energies). In our discussed method, we overcome this difficulty for low
   energy surfaces immersed in a liquid. For surfaces under liquid, there
   is an interface in addition to the solid-liquid interface: this
   interface is the air-liquid interface, where the liquid gets exhausted.
   In our technique, we cater the (un)favorable drop spreading dynamics at
   this interface to ensure that the drop gets deposited on the
   under-liquid surface.}},

Abstract = {{Roadside equipment (RSE) is a key component to collect/disseminate
   information from/to vehicles in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. It
   plays different roles in various safety, mobility and environmental
   applications. In the future, millions of RSE can be deployed on urban
   streets and highways. At the initial stage of CV development, however,
   it may be a costly and unfeasible solution to deploy RSE pervasively to
   provide continuous coverage or connectivity. The use of powerful
   simulation tools, that federate the traffic and communication simulator,
   provides a realistic and affordable evaluation solution. It can assist
   in testing various RSE placement strategies, system parameter
   configurations and particular application designs. In this paper a CV
   simulation platform, which links traffic simulator VISSIM with network
   simulator OMNeT++, is utilized to evaluate the traffic and communication
   performance of different RSE placement strategies and system parameter
   settings in an urban freeway scenario. The simulation results clearly
   reveal that the traffic monitoring performance and communication
   performance are sensitive to the RSE placement and system parameter
   settings. The utility of the developed simulator performed reasonably in
   conducting CV application evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Freeway congestion is highly recognized as a worldwide traffic problem
   since traffic demand has grown steadily over the past decades. Active
   traffic and demand management (ATDM) methods, including Ramp Metering
   (RM), Variable Speed Limit (VSL), and Route Guidance (RG), can help
   delay or even avoid congestion. Currently, those measures have become
   predictive and integrated based on real-time data collection and
   facility coordination, e.g. Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based
   measures. In this generic approach, a second-order macroscopic traffic
   flow model is used for traffic state prediction and the control problem
   is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem; whereas, successful
   field implementation requires a computationally simple and accurate
   optimization technique to make it feasible in practice. In previous
   applications of MPC, common optimization techniques are the decision
   tree and sequential quadratic programming (SQP). They both perform well,
   but limited research has been conducted to assess and compare their
   effectiveness and efficiency. To address this research gap, this study
   tested their performance by applying an MPC-based VSL control. Using
   geometric and traffic data from an authentic freeway corridor, this
   paper discussed the speed limit sequences, measures of effectiveness
   (MOEs), and computation time from micro-simulation tests. The results of
   this comparative study can guide future filed implementation as a
   reference.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate queue estimation of traffic congestion at recurrent freeway
   bottlenecks is an important part of developing effective traffic control
   strategies. Two traffic flow analytical techniques are always employed
   in studying queuing processes: shockwave analysis and input-output
   analysis. These two techniques have been taken as separate tools for
   estimating queue length (size) in a number of studies. Shockwave
   analysis is particularly well-suited to evaluating the space occupied by
   the queuing process in units of length, e.g. metre, kilometre etc.
   Input-output analysis is always employed for vertical queue size in
   terms of the number of queued vehicles; however, some studies argued
   that this method underestimated queue size. This paper highlights the
   reason in the literature for underestimation of queue length with
   input-out analysis. The objective of this study was to compare real-time
   queue estimation accuracy using two proposed models based on the two
   analytical techniques, after investigating the dynamic characteristic of
   traffic flow at the bottleneck in the freeway. The parameters were
   determined using discrete field data collected along an urban freeway
   corridor, Whitemud Drive (WMD), in Edmonton, Canada. This study
   illustrated that although the two proposed models estimate queue length
   in different ways, they are compatible and capable of yielding accurate
   estimates of real-time queue length upstream of the studied bottleneck.}},

Abstract = {{Linear ordering problem is a popular NP-hard combinatorial optimization
   problem attractive for its complexity, rich library of test data, and
   variety of real world applications. It has been solved by a number of
   heuristic as well as metaheuristic methods in the past. The
   implementation of nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization and search
   methods usually depends on streams of integer and floating point numbers
   generated in course of their execution. The pseudo-random numbers are
   utilized for an in-silico emulation of probabilitydriven natural
   processes such as arbitrary modification of genetic information
   (mutation, crossover), partner selection, and survival of the fittest
   (selection, migration) and environmental effects (small random changes
   in particle motion direction and velocity). Deterministic chaos is a
   well known mathematical concept that can be used to generate sequences
   of seemingly random real numbers within selected interval in a
   predictable and well controllable way. In the past, it has been used as
   a basis for various pseudo-random number generators with interesting
   properties. Recently, it has been shown that it can be successfully used
   as a source of stochasticity for nature-inspired algorithms solving a
   continuous optimization problem. In this work we compare effectiveness
   of the differential evolution with different pseudo-random number
   generators and chaotic systems as sources of stochasticity when solving
   the linear ordering problem.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical selectivity challenge of microcantilever sensors can be
   overcome by photothermal cantilever deflection spectroscopy (PCDS). A
   bi-material cantilever responds to heat generated by non-radiative decay
   process when the adsorbed molecules are resonantly excited with infrared
   (IR) light. The variation in cantilever deflection amplitude as a
   function of illuminating IR wavelength corresponds to the conventional
   IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. In addition, the mass
   of the adsorbed molecules can be determined by measuring the resonance
   frequency shift of the cantilever for the quantitative analysis. This
   technique offers unprecedented opportunities for highly selective as
   well as sensitive chemical sensing without relying on chemoselective
   interfaces. However, conventional optical signal readout schemes
   employed for microcantilever sensors pose challenges on miniaturization
   and system level integration. Here, we demonstrate PCDS using a
   piezoresistive cantilever which can be easily miniaturized and
   integrated into a portable sensor platform.}},

Abstract = {{A novel experimental setup, based on a diffusion bridge, is proposed to
   accurately and simultaneously measure the in-plane permeability and
   effective molecular diffusivity of gas diffusion layers used in PEMFC
   under compression. The permeability is measured by introducing nitrogen
   in one channel, forcing the gas through the porous media, and measuring
   pressure drop at various flow rates. To measure effective diffusivity,
   nitrogen and oxygen are introduced in two channels separated by a porous
   media. The flow rate of the gases are controlled by two mass flow
   controllers. The absolute pressure of nitrogen in the channel is
   controlled by a back pressure controller. The ratio of convection and
   diffusion flux is modified by controlling the pressure difference
   between the gases using a differential pressure controller, connected to
   the oxygen channel. The oxygen mole fraction in the nitrogen channel is
   meaured at various differential pressures. A steady state one
   dimensional Fick - Darcy model is used to estimate the permeability and
   effective molecular diffusivity based on the experimental data. Toray
   090 samples with 0 and 40\% PTFE at four compression levels are studied.
   The permeability and diffusibility (ratio of effective to bulk
   diffusivity) are found to be between 0.98x10(-11) and 0.13x10(-11) m(2),
   and, 0.52 and 0.09 respectively and are shown to decrease with

Abstract = {{A comprehensive single-phase non-isothermal MEA model, accounting for
   all applicable heat sources, viz., entropic and irreversible heating
   associated with electrochemical reactions, ohmic heating, phase change,
   and heat release/absorption due to sorption/desorption of water in
   electrolyte is presented. The model accounts for water management in two
   phases, viz., vapour and sorbed phase, and temperature driven vapour
   diffusion, and thermal osmosis. It is integrated into openFCST, an
   open-source fuel cell simulation framework, available for download
   online at http://www.openfcst.org/. Maximum temperatures inside the cell
   rise by up to 12 degrees C. A detailed breakdown of various heat sources
   inside the cell is studied. The heat of sorption, ignored in the
   literature, is more significant than protonic ohmic heating at medium
   currents and causes a shift in temperature distribution in the in-plane
   direction. Reversible heat distribution based on Ref. (1) resulted in
   temperature shifts with anode catalyst layer being the hottest.}},

Abstract = {{OpenFCST (open-source fuel cell simulation toolbox) is an open-source,
   finite element method based, multi-dimensional mathematical modeling
   software for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The aim of the software is
   to develop a platform for collaborative development of fuel cell
   mathematical models. The philosophy, structure and main components of
   openFCST are presented. OpenFCST currently includes physical models for
   gas, electron, ion, ionomer-bound water and heat transport. It also
   contains effective transport media relations to estimate transport
   properties for gas diffusion layers, micro-porous layers and catalyst
   layers as well as several kinetic models for the fuel cell
   electrochemical reactions. OpenFCST has been structured as a toolbox
   such that it is easier for new users to integrate new physical models
   with existing framework. OpenFCST is used to analyze the impact of
   different kinetic models on a multidimensional cathode model and to
   study the main differences between a macro-homogeneous and several
   agglomerate models. Finally, openFCST is used to develop a
   three-dimensional model of a patterned catalyst layer. Results show that
   multi-step kinetic models improve fuel cell performance predictions,
   macro-homogeneous and ionomer-filled agglomerate models show similar
   performance for 100 nm radii agglomerates up to current densities of 2
   A/cm(2), and water-filled agglomerate models require negative surface
   charges to exist at the pore walls in order to provide results in-line
   with experimental data. Finally, a patterned catalyst layer with
   micro-pores is shown to improve electrode performance.}},

Abstract = {{Underlay cognitive networks are being promoted as an implementable
   solution for the congestion in the wireless spectrum. With some nodes
   employed as relays, the throughput of such networks is enhanced through
   cooperative gains. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing
   the throughput of an underlay cognitive network through optimal power
   allocation of non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward relays. In order to
   maintain stable communication at the primary network, the interference
   due to the activities of all the cognitive nodes is kept below a limit.
   The optimal power allocation problem is formulated and then transformed
   to a quadratically constrained quadratic problem (QCQP). The maximum
   throughput of the cognitive network is derived as an eigen-solution of a
   channel-dependent matrix and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) is shown to be the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix. The
   proposed power allocation achieves significant throughput improvement
   over equal power allocation scheme and opportunistic relay selection
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid non-volatile (NV) SRAM cell with a new
   scheme for SEU tolerance. The proposed NVSRAM cell consists of a 6T SRAM
   core and a Resistive RAM (RRAM), made of a 1T and a Programmable
   Metallization Cell (PMC). The proposed cell has concurrent error
   detection (CED) and correction capabilities; CED is accomplished using a
   dual-rail checker, while correction is accomplished by utilizing the
   restore operation; data from the non-volatile memory element is copied
   back to the SRAM core. The dual-rail checker utilizes two XOR gates each
   made of 2 inverters and 2 ambipolar transistors, hence, it has a hybrid
   nature. Extensive simulation results are provided. The simulation
   results show that the proposed scheme is very efficient in terms of
   numerous figures of merit such as delay and circuit complexity and thus
   applicable to integrated circuits such as FPGAs requiring secure on-chip
   non-volatile storage (i.e. LUTs) for multi-context configurability.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate circuits have been considered for error-tolerant
   applications that can tolerate some loss of accuracy with improved
   performance and energy efficiency. Multipliers are key arithmetic
   circuits in many such applications such as digital signal processing
   (DSP). In this paper, a novel approximate multiplier with a lower power
   consumption and a shorter critical path than traditional multipliers is
   proposed for high-performance DSP applications. This multiplier
   leverages a newly-designed approximate adder that limits its carry
   propagation to the nearest neighbors for fast partial product
   accumulation. Different levels of accuracy can be achieved through a
   configurable error recovery by using different numbers of most
   significant bits (MSBs) for error reduction. The approximate multiplier
   has a low mean error distance, i.e., most of the errors are not
   significant in magnitude. Compared to the Wallace multiplier, a 16-bit
   approximate multiplier implemented in a 28nm CMOS process shows a
   reduction in delay and power of 20\% and up to 69\%, respectively. It is
   shown that by utilizing an appropriate error recovery, the proposed
   approximate multiplier achieves similar processing accuracy as
   traditional exact multipliers but with significant improvements in power
   and performance.}},

Abstract = {{Challenges due to erosion-corrosion in oil and gas production are
   briefly reviewed. In accordance with theories of non-equilibrium
   thermodynamics, mechanical metallurgy and electrochemistry, the
   theoretical models were built to assess the synergistic effect in slurry
   erosion process. The new models have been validated by experiments to
   evaluate the hardness degradation induced by corrosion and the
   consequently accelerated erosion. The experimental investigations
   demonstrated that the corrosion-induced surface hardness degradation is
   governed by a mechanism of the corrosion-enhanced erosion of steels. The
   corrosion-induced erosion is also observable in flowing electrolyte free
   of solid particles. Based on the understanding of erosion-corrosion
   mechanisms, the methods to evaluate the erosion-corrosion resistance of
   materials and the approaches to mitigate the damage caused by
   erosion-corrosion are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel base stations (BSs) - mobile stations (MSs)
   association policy for cellular networks. In this policy, the BS which
   provides the highest signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) among those
   located within a predetermined maximum association distance of the MS is
   selected as the serving BS. This policy encompasses the conventional
   highest-SIR association as a special case. Application of the new policy
   in 2- and 3-dimensional single-tier (homogeneous) and 2-dimensional
   two-tier (heterogeneous) networks is discussed. Coverage probability
   expressions are derived assuming BSs in each tier are distributed
   according to an independent homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP).
   Rayleigh fading and exponential path-loss radio channels are assumed.
   Analysis is validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. For single-tier
   networks, two methods are proposed for the selection of the maximum
   association distance. With such selection, the proposed association
   policy performs similarly to the highest-SIR association. It is shown
   that this policy can also be used to manage user offloading to small
   cells in two-tier heterogeneous networks.}},

Abstract = {{Erroneous beacon detection by interweave secondary nodes generates
   interference on the primary system. This paper analyzes how the
   aggregate interference behaves when secondary nodes use transmit power
   control and receiver association schemes. For this purpose, secondary
   transmitter nodes and receiver nodes are assumed to be distributed over
   a circular region and over the entire 2-D plane respectively. Two
   independent Poisson point processes model these distributions. We
   propose a receiver association scheme where each secondary transmitter
   attempts to connect to the closest available receiver. If it is not
   available, the transmitter attempts to connect with the next closest.
   This process continues until the M-th closest receivers are scanned. If
   no receiver is available, the transmitter remains silent. Moreover, a
   per-user transmit power control scheme is considered in which the
   transmit power is based on the distance between the transmitter and the
   associated receiver subject to a cut-off power level. All links are
   assumed to undergo path-loss and Rayleigh fading. The exact moment
   generating function (MGF) of the aggregate interference, the outage
   probability of the primary system, and the average probability of
   concurrent transmission are derived. Validated by simulations, our
   results show how the aggregate interference is affected by secondary
   power thresholds, receiver densities, and availability of the secondary
   receiver.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the aggregate interference from interweave
   cognitive secondary nodes spatially distributed in a finite Poisson
   field. These secondary nodes sense an out-of-band beacon to initiate
   their transmissions, which can be concurrent with those of the primary
   system if a sensing error is made. The resulting aggregate interference
   is analyzed in this paper. For this purpose, general Nakagami-m fading
   and path-loss are assumed for all relevant channels. Moreover, we
   incorporate random secondary node transmit powers with any probability
   distribution. The analysis includes the exact moment generating function
   (MGF) of the aggregate interference along with the exact outage
   probability of the primary system. Furthermore, we develop a simple MGF
   approximation which is valid for severely fading channels and for lower
   beacon reception threshold to beacon transmit power ratios. Finally, we
   show that a lower fading severity significantly improves the diversity
   order of the PR due to more accurate spectrum sensing by the secondary
   nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic teleoperation and haptic interaction systems can be modeled as
   multi-port networks. In this context, bilateral or trilateral haptic
   systems stability has been analyzed in the literature by using their
   two-port or three-port network models. Traditionally, such stability
   criteria assume that operators and environments (collectively,
   terminations) of the multilateral haptic systemare passive but otherwise
   arbitrary. However, recent research has shown that such an assumption
   can be inaccurate or too conservative as far as the human operator in a
   robotic system is concerned. In order not to jeopardize the haptic
   system stability when a termination is active or sacrifice system
   performance when a termination is strictly passive, we need a stability
   analysis approach that can take into account the degree of passivity (or
   lack thereof) of each termination. In response to this need, we have
   developed an approach based on series-shunt decomposition of the
   termination impedance model. Experimental validation of the theoretical
   stability criteria are performed involving active operators and
   environment for both bilateral and trilateral teleoperation.}},

   discretization are two major factors that jeopardize the system
   stability. We provide a framework for the system stability analysis in
   which both these two destabilizing factors can be addressed. In this
   paper, first the well-known Colgates stability condition for a 1-user
   haptic system with a passive operator is reproduced in a different
   manner and then extended to the case where delay can exist in the
   communication channel. Then, it is shown that using the same method, the
   stability of sampled-data position-error-based (PEB) bilateral
   teleoperation systems can be dealt in a similar manner. Simulation
   results confirm the validity of the proposed conditions for stability of
   both sampled-data, HVE and PEB bilateral teleoperation systems.}},

   microbubbles to induce intracellular pathways on cell membranes. As a
   result, biomaterials can then easily enter cells. Experimental results
   show that this delivery method can achieve high delivery efficiency.
   Simulation results showed that cells with more deformed structure
   experienced higher strain on cell membranes than cells with less
   deformed structure. The models can help explain how centrifugation
   affects cell membrane permeability. By controlling cell morphology and

Abstract = {{The introduction of Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) in 2004 has initiated an
   important trend in Computational Intelligence research: the application
   of new web technologies to create more flexible and hardware independent
   environment for deploying ``fuzzy ideas{''}. FML allows researchers and
   engineers to focus on problem solving activities bypassing additional
   difficulties related to programming or physical equipment constraints.
   From that moment on, many researches have been using FML and other
   XML-based languages for modeling and developing fuzzy systems. However,
   in spite of their hardware interoperability, XML languages are able to
   model a fuzzy system in static way and, consequently, they do not
   provide any support for modelling ``evolving{''} and temporal-based
   fuzzy systems, as such Timed Automata based Fuzzy Controllers. To
   address this deficiency, this paper introduces an extension of FML
   called FMLScript. It is based on a scripting language concept and allows
   for modeling XML-based systems that can dynamically modify their
   configurations. As the consequence, a better expressive power can be
   achieved when compared with static modelling approaches. This is shown
   in a case study involving a smart grid control.}},

   visualized with directed graphs. Nodes represent information, edges

   Cognitive Map is weights matrix, which contains evaluations of

   constructed by experts. Fuzzy Cognitive Map can be also reconstructed in
   an unmanned mode. In this article authors present their own, new
   approach to time series modeling with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Developed
   methodology joins Fuzzy Cognitive Map reconstruction procedure with
   moving window approach to time series prediction. Authors train Fuzzy
   Cognitive Maps to model and forecast time series. The size of the map
   corresponds to the moving window size and it informs about the length of
   historical data, which produces time series model. Developed procedure
   is illustrated with a series of experiments on three real- life time
   series. Obtained results are compared with other approaches to time
   series modeling. The most important contribution of this paper is
   description of the methodology for time series modeling with Fuzzy

Abstract = {{Cognitive Maps are abstract knowledge representation framework, suitable

   Conceptually, GCMs originated as an extension of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps.
   The contribution presented in this paper is a methodology for Granular
   Cognitive Map reconstruction. The goal of the procedure is to construct
   a weights matrix - and thereby the GCM, which outputs best describe the
   phenomena of interest. The article addresses the conflict between
   generality and specificity of various Granular Cognitive Maps. Balance
   between generality and specificity is the most important architectural
   aspect of a model built with knowledge granules. A series of experiments
   illustrates, how various optimization techniques allow improvement in

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the interconnection of two ac and dc subgrids via a
   voltage source converter (VSC) to facilitate a bidirectional power
   exchange and increase the system reliability. The control of the
   interfacing VSC is achieved by two schemes; autonomous and
   communication-based. The autonomous control might fail to operate in a
   large scale islanded hybrid system due to the variations in the
   generation characteristics of the individual distributed generation (DG)
   units (such as droop coefficients or set points variations,
   loss/connection of units, etc.). A centralized power management
   controller is therefore proposed to achieve an accurate, efficient and
   minimized power exchange. The proposed method can be generalized to
   large scale hybrid systems. Small signal stability analysis has been
   conducted to investigate the influence of the communication delays on
   the system stability. Time domain simulations are presented to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed technique.}},

Title = {{Capacity Estimation for Weaving Segments Using a Lane-Changing Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{94-102}},
Abstract = {{During peak periods, freeway bottlenecks can be activated by intensive
   lane changing at weaving segments, where merging and diverging areas are
   in close proximity. This weaving phenomenon has a major impact on
   capacity. Much research has been devoted to investigating capacity
   estimation models for weaving segments. However, because of the model
   parameters, estimation models are difficult to adopt directly in active
   traffic management strategies to estimate real-time maximum discharge
   flow. To this end, this study defined a linear optimization problem to
   solve weaving capacity and then established a lane-changing model to
   constrain the weaving flows. The proposed method was evaluated and
   analyzed for sensitivity with field data from two weaving segments on
   Whitemud Drive, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The capacity estimates from
   the proposed model were consistent with that from the Highway Capacity
   Manual 2010 model and with field observations. Moreover, it was also
   observed that the weaving capacity was sensitive to weaving maneuvers.
   Finally, the proposed method was applied to estimate the real-time
   maximum discharge flow rate; the estimates matched field measurements.
   These findings could lead to implementations in designing optimal
   traffic control strategies.}},

   dissimilar torque and stiffness capabilities when dissipating or
   restoring energy. This paper aims at identifying the asymmetry
   thresholds that lead to an alteration in the perception of elasticity
   simulated by such devices. 17 subjects took part in an experiment
   consisting in interacting with virtual springs with either controllable
   stiffness or torque asymmetry levels, and identifying if the springs
   were symmetric or not. Experimental results indicate that when the
   decompression stiffness or torque were less than 80\% and 60\% of the
   compression stiffness or torque respectively, users did not perceive the
   asymmetry in 80\% of trials. This suggests that hybrid devices can
   present dissimilar active/passive torque or stiffness capabilities

Abstract = {{An important issue to bear in mind in Group Decision Making situations
   is that of consistency. However, the expression of consistent
   preferences is often a very difficult task for the decision makers,
   specially in decision problems with a high number of alternatives and
   when decision makers use fuzzy preference relations to provide their
   opinions. It leads to situations where a decision maker may not be able
   to express all his/her preferences properly and without contradiction.
   To overcome this problem, we propose the concept of the information
   granularity being regarded as an important and useful asset supporting
   the goal to reach consistent fuzzy preference relations. To do so, we
   develop a concept of granular fuzzy preference relation where each
   pairwise comparison is formed as a certain information granule instead
   of a single numeric value. As being more abstract, the granular format
   of the preference model offers the required flexibility to increase the
   level of consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines have the
   advantage of low Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and soot emissions. In HCCI
   engines, a lean premixed air-fuel mixture is compressed until the
   temperature is high enough for combustion to occur. HCCI engines have a
   limited operating range and are limited by knock at high loads and
   misfire at low loads. They are without a direct source to initiate
   ignition so HCCI requires combustion timing control. Some of the factors
   that affect HCCI combustion timing are mixture composition, pressure and
   temperature at the time of inlet valve closing. One effective way to
   control HCCI combustion timing is Variable Valve Timing (VVT). VVT
   changes the amount of trapped residual gas and the effective compression
   ratio. These factors have a strong effect on HCCI combustion timing. One
   main advantage of VVT is that it is fast enough to handle rapid
   transients. Based on a simplified control oriented model that models the
   effect of trapped residual gas on combustion timing, a
   Feedforward/Feedback controller is designed for HCCI combustion timing
   control. The controller requires feedforward information of the valve
   timing and feedback information of the combustion timing. This
   controller tracks the desired combustion timing trajectory both in
   simulation and experiment by modulating the trapped residual gas using
   VVT actuation.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of oscillation compensation in control loops depends on the
   source of the oscillation. While retuning the controller is required to
   compensate the oscillations caused by aggressive controller tuning, it
   is not an effective approach to compensate oscillations due to valve
   problems or sinusoidal disturbances. Thus, it is of great value to
   distinguish between oscillations which are truly caused by the
   controller tuning from oscillations due to other kind of sources. The
   paper discusses the special properties of oscillations caused by
   controller tuning and proposes a method to distinguish it from
   sinusoidal disturbances. The method is based on analyzing the auto
   correlation function of the signals for both detection and diagnosis of
   oscillations in the presence of multiple oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents distributed state estimation methods through
   wireless sensor networks with event triggered communication protocols
   among the sensors. Optimal consensus filters are derived which apply to
   generic non-uniform and asynchronous information exchange scenarios
   among neighboring sensors. To obtain a scalable covariance propagation
   algorithm, the optimal filter is approximated by a suboptimal filter.
   Homogeneous detection criteria are designed on each sensor node to
   determine the broadcasting instants. Thus, a consensus on state
   estimates is reached with all estimator sensors for the suboptimal
   consensus filter. The purpose of event detection is to achieve energy
   efficient operation by reducing unnecessary interactions among the
   neighboring sensors. In addition, the performance of the proposed state
   estimation algorithm is validated using a simulation example.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden cardiac death resulting from ventricular arrhythmia is one of the
   leading causes of mortality in the United States. The beat-to-beat
   oscillations in the action potential duration (APD) of paced cardiac
   cells, defined as cardiac alternans, has been identified as a potential
   precursor to ventricular arrhythmia. Therefore, the annihilation of
   these alternans is a promising antiarrhythmic strategy. In this work,
   the small amplitude of alternans partial differential equation (PDE) for
   a one dimensional cable of cardiac cells is stabilized through model
   predictive control (MPC). In our proposed control strategy, both
   boundary and spatially distributed actuators are utilized in suppressing
   the alternans along the cable. The low-order MPC formulation is
   developed for the finite-dimensional, discrete state space
   representation of the PDE. Furthermore, input and state constraints are
   addressed explicitly in the MPC formulation. The input constraints may
   arise due to actuator limitations, while state constraints are naturally
   present in cardiac systems. By satisfying these constraints, we can
   ensure that the controller action will not induce conduction block in
   the cardiac cells. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   successful annihilation of alternans using the proposed control
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider communication cost reduction of distributed
   moving horizon estimation (DMHE) for a class of nonlinear systems. In
   particular, we focus on nonlinear systems that are composed of
   interacting subsystems which can communicate and exchange information
   with each other through a shared communication network. Specifically, an
   algorithm based on an event-triggered method is proposed to reduce the
   number of communications between the subsystems in a DMHE scheme. In the
   algorithm, a subsystem sends out its current information when a
   triggering condition based on the difference between the current state
   estimate and a previously transmitted one is satisfied. In order to
   ensure the convergence and ultimate boundedness of the estimation error,
   we also propose to redesign the local moving horizon estimator of a
   subsystem to account for the possible lack of state updates from other
   subsystems explicitly. A reactor-separator chemical process is utilized
   to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed
   approaches.}},

   Disorder: Relationship between diffusion tensor imaging of the corpus
   callosum and eye movement control}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Response inhibition is the ability to suppress irrelevant impulses to
   enable goal-directed behavior. The underlying neural mechanisms of
   inhibition deficits are not clearly understood, but may be related to
   white matter connectivity, which can be assessed using diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI). The goal of this study was to investigate the
   relationship between response inhibition during the performance of
   saccadic eye movement tasks and DTI measures of the corpus callosum in
   children with or without Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).
   Participants included 43 children with an FASD diagnosis (12.3 +/- 3.1
   years old) and 35 typically developing children (12.5 +/- 3.0 years old)
   both aged 7-18, assessed at three sites across Canada. Response
   inhibition was measured by direction errors in an antisaccade task and
   timing errors in a delayed memory-guided saccade task. Manual
   deterministic tractography was used to delineate six regions of the
   corpus callosum and calculate fractional anisotropy (FA), mean
   diffusivity (MD), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity.
   Group differences in saccade measures were assessed using t-tests,
   followed by partial correlations between eye movement inhibition scores
   and corpus callosum FA and MD, controlling for age. Children with FASD
   made more saccade direction errors and more timing errors, which
   indicates a deficit in response inhibition. The only group difference in
   DTI metrics was significantly higher MD of the splenium in FASD compared
   to controls. Notably, direction errors in the antisaccade task were
   correlated negatively to FA and positively to MD of the splenium in the
   control, but not the FASD group, which suggests that alterations in
   connectivity between the two hemispheres of the brain may contribute to
   inhibition deficits in children with FASD. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In recent years, embedding ancillary functions of distributed generation
   (DG) have drawn great attention due to the increasing penetration of
   renewable energy based DG such as photovoltaic, wind turbines and fuel
   cells. Among these ancillary functions, harmonics compensation is
   becoming more interesting and important with the growth of nonlinear
   loads in today's power distribution system. When controlled properly,
   the DG-grid interfacing converters can provide effective harmonic
   compensation for the distribution power system. However, the
   conventional harmonic control methods used for active power filters
   (APFs) may not be suitable for DG units, where the flow of real and
   reactive power limits the switching frequency to be lower than APFs,
   especially when the capacity of DG is large. At this low switching
   frequency, harmonic compensation performance or even the system
   stability may be affected. In this paper, a harmonic compensation
   approach suitable for DG-grid interfacing converters at low switching
   frequency is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for current controller design in a single
   phase grid-connected inverter (GCI). The proposed controller addresses
   the following items: transient performance; steady state tracking;
   output current distortions and dc; active damping; and start-up
   transient. The proposed controller is based on various extensions of the
   linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method and it inherits the optimality
   and robustness features of the LQR. A design algorithm is proposed that
   offers a very systematic method of designing controller gains to achieve
   all the above control objectives. Simulation and experimental results
   are presented to illustrate performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new ZVS technique for fullbridge single-phase
   inverters that has several applications such as PV ac modules. The
   technique uses smaller passive filter between inverter and grid which
   results in a simple control, simpler design and a more compact and more
   efficient topology. The proposed topology uses a passive LC small
   auxiliary circuit which operates under fixed frequency and leads to a
   simpler EMI filter design. Using the proposed topology, the switching
   frequency can be increased to achieve smaller size and higher efficiency
   inverters. A controller to minimize conduction loss in the auxiliary
   circuit is designed and analysis, simulation and experimental results
   are also provided to verify the theory.}},

Title = {{Mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of traumatic articular cartilage
   defects: a comprehensive review}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Articular cartilage has a limited capacity to repair following injury.
   Early intervention is required to prevent progression of focal traumatic
   chondral and osteochondral defects to advanced cartilage degeneration
   and osteoarthritis. Novel cell-based tissue engineering techniques have
   been proposed with the goal of resurfacing defects with bioengineered
   tissue that recapitulates the properties of hyaline cartilage and
   integrates into native tissue. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity of
   MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells
   - chondrocytes. MSCs are historically harvested through bone marrow
   aspiration, which does not require invasive surgical intervention or
   cartilage extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based
   strategies. Biomaterial matrices are commonly used in conjunction with
   MSCs to aid cell delivery and support chondrogenic differentiation,
   functional extracellular matrix formation and three-dimensional tissue
   development. A number of specific transplantation protocols have
   successfully resurfaced articular cartilage in animals and humans to
   date. In the clinical literature, MSC-seeded scaffolds have filled a
   majority of defects with integrated hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue
   based on arthroscopic, histologic and imaging assessment. Positive
   functional outcomes have been reported at 12 to 48 months
   post-implantation, but future work is required to assess long-term
   outcomes with respect to other treatment modalities. Despite relatively
   positive outcomes, further investigation is required to establish a
   consensus on techniques for treatment of chondral and osteochondral
   defects with respect to cell source, isolation and expansion,
   implantation density, in vitro precultivation, and scaffold composition.
   This will allow for further optimization of MSC proliferation,
   chondrogenic differentiation, bioengineered cartilage integration, and
   clinical outcome.}},

Title = {{Development and Evaluation of Adaptive Transit Signal Priority Control
   with Updated Transit Delay Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2438}},
Pages = {{45-54}},
Abstract = {{Transit signal priority (TSP) strategies are widely used to reduce bus
   travel delay and to increase bus service reliability. State-of-the-art
   strategies enable dynamic (and optimal), rather than predetermined, TSP
   plans to reflect real-time traffic conditions. These dynamic plans are
   called adaptive TSP. Existing adaptive TSP strategies normally use a
   performance index (PI), which is a weighted summation of all types of
   delays, to evaluate each candidate TSP plan and the weights to reflect
   the corresponding priority. The performance of an adaptive TSP depends
   on three factors: delay estimation, weights determination, and
   optimization formulation. In this context, there are three key academic
   contributions: (a) an enhanced bus delay estimation model based on
   advance detection, (b) a mechanism to adjust the PI weights dynamically
   to reflect the changing necessity of TSP under different conditions, and
   (c) TSP optimization formulated into a quadratic programming problem
   with an enhanced delay-based PI to obtain global optimization with the
   use of MATLAB solvers. In addition, an adaptive TSP simulation platform
   using a full-scale signal simulator, ASC/3, in VISSIM was developed. The
   optimal TSP plans were granted or were rejected on the basis of TSP
   events, such as check-in, check-out, and multiple TSP requests. Through
   a case study in VISSIM, this research found that, compared with
   conventional active TSP strategies, the new adaptive TSP strategy could
   further reduce bus travel time while maintaining a better balance of
   service on non-TSP approaches along a 7.4-km bus corridor in Edmonton,
   Alberta, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{An asymmetric frequency selective surface (FSS) based on Jerusalem
   cross-slot (JC-SL) unit cell is used as a polarization converting
   surface (PCS) to change the sense of the circularly polarized (CP) wave
   as it passes through it. This is achieved by introducing 0 degrees and
   180 degrees phase shifts for the two perpendicular linear polarized
   components of the CP wave. Without adding any extra phase shift, the
   transmitted CP wave will encounter a change in its sense of
   polarization. The PCS is then combined with a bidirectional CP slot
   antenna to achieve right-hand CP (RHCP) signal on both sides of the
   antenna. The overall size of the structure is about 0.75 lambda x 0.75
   lambda x 0.15 lambda, where lambda is the free-space wavelength. The
   structure is designed to operate at the GPS L1 band (f = 1.575 GHz).}},

   conservation studies that can be realized in the reheating furnace were
   considered including operation of the reheating furnace with the
   pertinent excess air coefficient, compensation of the air leakage losses
   in the recuperator and establishment of the economizer in the furnace.
   As a result of these investigations some saving opportunities were
   determined and a new recuperator, economizer and gas analyzer were
   installed in the reheating furnace leading in total of 2,913,924 kcal/h

   method for assessing breast asymmetry using ST in patients with AIS, and
   proposes a reliable breast asymmetry classification for such patients.
   To achieve this, ST torso scans of 25 females (age: 15.4 +/- 1.3 years;
   range: 13.5 - 17.5 years) with AIS were obtained. Scans were analyzed
   using a method that finds a rotoinversion matrix to minimize the
   distance between the torso scan and its reflected image about the
   sagittal plane. The mirrored torso was then fitted to the original torso
   using an iterative least-squares method, such that the average deviation
   between the observed and reflected torsos was minimized The relative
   deviation between the two torsos was measured and displayed as a
   deviation colour map (DCM). Each patient's DCM was visually appraised by
   two of the authors and a breast asymmetry classification system was
   created based on this appraisal. Good intra- and inter-rater reliability
   was found for the classification decisions by five observers. All of the
   patients presented breast asymmetry that could be reliably categorized
   into the proposed five-group classification with all patients exhibiting
   deviations exceeding the threshold of 3 mm between sides routinely
   observed in healthy teenagers without scoliosis.}},

Abstract = {{We use random linear network coding with simple connection topology
   control to approach the theoretical limit on finish time of
   disseminating k blocks in a server cluster of n nodes. Unlike existing
   gossip schemes which rely on completely random contact, we prove that
   with random linear network coding, any receiver selection following a
   simple permutation rule can achieve a broadcast finish time of k + n and
   that a time-varying random permutation topology achieves a finish time
   of k + o(k) + O(log n), both with high probability. Since the
   theoretical limit on finish time is k + inverted right
   perpendicularlog(2) ninverted left perpendicular, our simple permutation
   algorithms achieve absolutely optimal (not only order-optimal) block
   pipelining for k blocks. Our results hold for both one-to-all
   (broadcast) and all-to-all transfers. We demonstrate the usefulness of
   the proposed organized network coded gossip with an application to
   content distribution in cluster computing systems like MapReduce.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on identifying the zero-stress time (TZ) in jointed
   plain concrete pavements (JPCPs). TZ is the time when the concrete slab
   is sufficiently strong to deform (thermally expand or contract and thus
   curl) despite the existing external restraints, including the friction
   at the base-slab interface. It is critical to be able to identify TZ so
   that the temperature gradient present in the slab at TZ, known as the
   built-in temperature gradient, can be characterized. In this study, TZ
   was established through the instrumentation of 36 concrete slabs in four
   JPCP construction projects. Strain-temperature behavior in each slab was
   used to identify TZ. The slabs in each project were paved at different
   times of the day (morning, noon, early afternoon, and late afternoon) to
   investigate the effects of the ambient curing conditions on TZ. The
   degree of hydration at TZ (alpha(TZ)) was established for each slab. The
   field data were used in the development of a model for predicting
   alpha(TZ) as a function of the concrete water-to-cement ratio, unit
   weight, early-age elastic modulus, and slab thickness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive control scheme for the autonomous

   controller cannot appropriately share the oscillatory components of
   loads among distributed generation (DG) units. The main merit of this
   paper is to present an effective control strategy to share the
   high-frequency current among the power sources of dc microgrid. The DG
   units are considered as reliable hybrid power conversion system which
   can meet load demands and support transients. The proposed control
   system consists of a two control blocks. A multi-loop voltage control
   unit is employed to regulate the microgrid voltage. Furthermore, a
   virtual impedance loop is implemented to share dc current and
   oscillatory components among power sources. The effectiveness of the
   proposed control scheme is verified by using digital time-domain
   simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new HSPICE macromodel of a Programmable
   Metallization Cell (PMC). The electrical characteristics of a PMC are
   simulated by using a geometric model that considers the vertical and
   lateral growth/dissolution of the metallic filament. The selection of
   the parameters is based on operational features, so the electrical
   characterization of the PMC is simple, easy to simulate and intuitive.
   The I-V and R-V plots of a PMC are generated at a very small error
   compared with experimental data; the proposed model also shows a small
   error for the relationship between the switching time and the pulse
   amplitude. The use of a PMC as resistive element in a crossbar memory is
   also presented; it is shown that a PMC-based crossbar offers substantial
   improvements over other resistive technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Robust beamforming for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar in
   the background of powerful jamming signals is investigated in this
   paper. We design two minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)
   type beamformers with adaptiveness/robustness against the powerful
   jammers for colocated MIMO radar. Specifically, the MVDR beamformer is
   firstly designed for known jammers in the sector-of-interest, which
   maintains distortionless response towards the direction of the target
   while imposing nulls towards the directions of jammers. Then the
   adaptive/robust MVDR beamformer is designed for the general case of
   unknown in-sector jammers and/or out-of-sector interfering sources.
   Convex optimization techniques are used in both of the designs.
   Moreover, we derive a closed-form solution to the simplified second
   design. Based on this solution, we derive efficient power estimates of
   the desired and/or interfering sources in the context of powerful
   jammers and non-ideal factors such as array calibration errors and
   target steering vector mismatches. We demonstrate that the capability of
   efficient jammers suppression using these designs is unique in MIMO
   radar.}},

Abstract = {{In the article we present a technique for time series modeling that
   joins concepts based Fuzzy Cognitive Map design with moving window
   approach. Proposed method first extracts concepts that generalize the
   underlying time series. Next, we form a map that consists of several
   layers representing consecutive time points. In each layer we place
   concepts obtained in the previous step. Fuzzified time series is passed
   to the map according to the moving window scheme. We investigate two
   most important aspects of this procedure: division into concepts and
   window size and their influence on model's accuracy. Firstly, we show
   that extraction of concepts plays a big role. Fitted models have low
   errors. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to extract appropriate
   number of concepts. The choice of the number of concepts is a compromise
   between model size and accuracy. Secondly, we show that increasing
   window size improves modeling accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The article is focused on the issue of complexity of Fuzzy Cognitive
   Maps designed to model time series. Large Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are
   impractical to use. Since Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are graph-based models,
   when we increase the number of nodes, the number of connections grows
   quadratically. Therefore, we posed a question how to simplify trained
   FCM without substantial loss in map's quality. We proposed evaluation of
   nodes' and weights' relevance based on their influence in the map. The
   article presents the method first on synthetic time series of different
   complexity, next on several real-world time series. We illustrate how
   simplification procedure influences MSE. It turned out that with just a
   small increase of MSE we can remove up to 1/3 of nodes and up to 1/6 of
   weights for real-world time series. For regular data sets, like the
   synthetic time series, FCM-based models can be simplified even more.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{496-509}},
Abstract = {{Pyrabactin receptors (PYR) play a central role in abscisic acid (ABA)
   signal transduction; they are ABA receptors that inhibit type 2C protein
   phosphatases (PP2C). Molecular aspects contributing to increased basal
   activity of PYR against PP2C are studied by molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. An extensive series of MD simulations of the apo-form of
   mutagenized PYR1 as a homodimer and in complex with homology to
   ABA-insensitive 1 (HAB1) phosphatase are reported. In order to
   investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms mediating PYR1 activity,
   the MD data was analyzed by essential collective dynamics (ECD), a novel
   approach that allows the identification, with atomic resolution, of
   persistent dynamic correlations based on relatively short MD
   trajectories. Employing the ECD method, the effects of select mutations
   on the structure and dynamics of the PYR1 complexes were investigated
   and considered in the context of experimentally determined constitutive
   activities against HAB1. Approaches to rationally design constitutively
   active PYR1 constructs to increase PP2C inhibition are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{We propose a novel method for rendering a circular inclusion harmonic
   even in the presence of non-uniform loading. Most significantly, the
   condition that the inclusion be harmonic is shown to be independent of
   the specific form of the loading. In addition, we demonstrate that the
   harmonicity condition obtained actually leads to the stronger property
   of neutrality when the loading takes a particular form. Our method is
   based on the idea of `multi-coating' (surrounding the inclusion with a
   specified number of coatings each with its own separate elastic
   properties) used in the design of cloaking structures for the
   conductivity problem. Consequently, the harmonic inclusions designed
   here can also be thought of as special kinds of `near-cloaking'
   structures in plane elasticity (in the sense that they are invisible to
   any changes in mean stress in the structure).}},

Abstract = {{The design of tunnels in hard rocks must consider two general forms of
   potential instability: (1) blocks/wedges formed by intersecting
   discontinuities and falling under gravitational loading, and (2)
   spalling/slabbing caused by over-stressing of the intact matrix between
   the discontinuities. While much effort has been placed on identifying
   the ground conditions that can lead to gravity driven block/wedge
   instability, the ground conditions required for spalling remain poorly
   defined and often get mixed with the conditions for wedge instability.
   From a tunnel design perspective two issues must be addressed: (1) what
   procedure should be used during the site characterization phase to
   assess if spalling should be anticipated during construction, and (2) if
   spalling is expected, what design procedure should be used to assess the
   lateral and radial extent of the spalled zone. Both of these questions
   are addressed using case history examples.}},

Abstract = {{Disk membranes generated from high-purity natural clinoptilolite mineral
   rock have shown promising water desalination and de-oiling performance.
   In order to scale up production of these types of membranes for
   industrial wastewater treatment applications, a coating strategy was
   devised. A composite mixture of natural clinoptilolite from St. Cloud
   (Winston, NM, USA) and aluminum phosphate was deposited on the inner
   surface of porous stainless steel tubes by the slip casting technique.
   The commercial porous stainless steel tubes were pre-coated with a TiO2
   layer of about 10 mu m. Phase composition and morphology of the coating
   materials were investigated using X-ray diffraction and scanning
   electron microscopy. Water softening performance of the fabricated
   membranes was evaluated using Edmonton (Alberta, Canada) municipal tap
   water as feed source. Preliminary experimental results show a high water
   flux of 7.7 kg/(m(2) h) and 75\% reduction of hardness and conductivity
   in a once-through membrane process at 95 W C and feed pressure of 780
   kPa. These results show that natural zeolite coated, stainless steel
   tubular membranes have high potential for large-scale purification of
   oil sands steam-assisted gravity drainage water at high temperature and
   pressure requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Copper sulfide semiconductors made from earth-abundant elements have an
   optical absorption edge at ca. 1.2 eV, nearly ideal for solar energy
   harvesting. We report the growth and formation mechanism of vertically
   oriented arrays of copper sulfide nanostructures formed by
   electrochemical anodization. Key parameters that affect the morphology
   and phase of the nanostructures are type and strength of electrolyte,
   anodization voltage and duration. Cu2S and CuS nanostructures were
   obtained on both copper foil and copper-coated flexible Kapton
   substrates, and depending on the anodization parameters, consisted of
   vertically oriented arrays of nanowalls, nanoleafs or rods with branched
   nanodendrites. The anodization parameters also controlled the phase and
   stoichiometry of the nanostructures. p-type conduction for Cu2S
   nanostructures and n-type conduction for CuS nanostructures were
   revealed by admittance spectroscopy and Mott Schottky analysis. We also
   observed a weak, but nevertheless promising and previously unnoticed,
   photocatalytic action in copper sulfide nanorod and platelet arrays for
   the sunlight-driven conversion of CO2 into CH4. Under irradiation by AM
   1.5G simulated sunlight at room temperature, a CH4 production rate as
   high as 38 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) was obtained using the copper sulfide
   nanostructure arrays as stand-alone photocatalysts for CO2
   photoreduction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce and solve a particular generalization of the
   quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem which is
   frequently encountered in different fields of signal processing and
   communications. Specifically, we consider such generalization of the
   QCQP problem that comprises compositions of one-dimensional convex and
   quadratic functions in the constraint and the objective functions. We
   show that this class of problems can be precisely or approximately
   recast as the difference-of-convex functions (DC) programming problem.
   Although the DC programming problem can be solved through the
   branch-and-bound methods, these methods do not have any worst-case
   polynomial-time complexity guarantees. Therefore, we develop a new
   approach with worst-case polynomial-time complexity that can solve the
   corresponding DC problem of a generalized QCQP problem. It is
   analytically guaranteed that the point obtained by this method satisfies
   the Karsuh-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. Furthermore, the
   global optimality can be proved analytically under certain conditions.
   The new proposed method can be interpreted in terms of the Newton's
   method as applied to a non-constrained optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of jammers suppression in colocated multiple-input

   beamspace techniques aim at designing optimal beamspace matrices based
   on reasonable tradeoffs between the desired in-sector source distortion
   and the powerful jammer (possibly in-sector) attenuation when conducting
   the jammers suppression. These designs are cast as convex optimization
   problems which are derived using second-order cone programming.
   Meanwhile, we study the MUSIC-based direction-of-arrival estimation
   performance of the proposed beamspace designs by comparing to the
   conventional algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate that the capability of
   efficient powerful in-sector jammers suppression using these designs is
   unique in MIMO radar.}},

   (DC) programming problem. We develop an algorithm, termed alternating
   matrix POTDC algorithm, based on alternating optimization of the
   eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix. The
   proposed alternating matrix POTDC method provides insights into the

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are water-soluble components of petroleum. The
   characterization and quantification of NAs by analytical methods have
   proved quite challenging, whilst the toxic effects of these
   water-soluble compounds on a variety of organisms adversely affecting
   reproduction and steroid production is becoming apparent. In this study,
   we report a fluorescence-based competitive binding method for rapid
   sensing of the presence of NAs using cellulosic peptide array strips as
   sensors. The peptide array was designed from sequences derived from the
   estrogen receptor (ER). Several of these peptides were able to detect
   the presence of NAs at low micromolar (similar to 5 mg L-1) levels in
   different oil sands process affected water samples. The specific binding
   of one of the peptides, peptide 17 (EGXVEIFDXLLATS) with NAs was
   evaluated using isothermal titration calorimetry. The results show that
   peptide 17 interacts strongly with NAs with an apparent binding constant
   (K-a) of 96 x 10(6) M-1, and may bind NAs in a similar fashion as ER
   interacts with estrogen. Finally, the data support that the peptides
   displaying high affinity for NAs can be used for developing disposable

Title = {{Variable Speed Limit Control Strategy with Collision Probability
   Assessments Based on Traffic State Prediction}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2435}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Abstract = {{An increasing number of vehicles on roadways has made traffic safety a
   serious challenge for transportation engineers. For the mitigation of
   traffic safety concerns, a variety of active traffic control measures,
   such as the variable speed limit (VSL), have been intensively
   investigated and deployed. VSL is usually adopted to advise drivers of a
   lower speed limit that is more appropriate to a congested traffic
   condition and takes advantage of the homogeneous traffic flow effect.
   However, in earlier studies, because of the absence of traffic state
   prediction, the impact of applied VSL control was not quantitatively
   analyzed. In this study, a model predictive control framework was
   adopted for predicting and assessing future traffic states. Taking into
   consideration the impact of VSL control, the study used a macroscopic
   traffic flow model. The collision probabilities of the predicted traffic
   states were assessed with a precursor-based collision prediction model
   to determine the optimized control signal. With this design, the
   proposed algorithm controller provided a robust method for determining
   the VSL control plan to optimize safety performance over a traffic
   network. The proposed control algorithm was evaluated with a simulation
   study based on field data that was conducted to reproduce a major ring
   road in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The proposed algorithm was used to
   implement VSL control on the studied 11-km freeway stretch. The proposed

Abstract = {{In large-scale industrial processes and other complex systems, elements
   are not independent. To describe the relationship between process
   variables, different concepts, such as connectivity and causality, are
   often used. The background and motivation of investigatingconnectivity
   and causality in complex systems are discussed; these two concepts are
   clarified with examples. Causality describes the cause-effect
   relationship between changes of process variables; while connectivity is
   generally concerned with physical and information paths in a process.
   The causality relationships can be described by process topology. A
   brief chapter preview is then included to give a big picture of this
   brief, and to provide guidance for interested readers to different
   topics covered in the brief.}},

Abstract = {{Connectivity and causality have a lot of potential applications, among
   which we focus on analysis and design of large-scale complex industrial
   processes. A direct application by establishing connectivity and
   causality is to build a topological model before parameter
   identification for complex industrial processes that areusually
   multi-input, multi-output systems with many internal closed loops. In
   abnormal situation management, process topology can be employed for root
   cause analysis, risk analysis, and consequential alarm identification
   using the information of fault propagation. These potential applications
   include both off-line analysis andon-line diagnosis. In addition,
   process topology can eventually be used in design of control structures
   because process topology determinesthe natural structure of the

   network; and higher order statistics, such as the Patel's pairwise

   discuss some remaining methods. Based on the results of pairwise
   causality analysis, one can construct a causal network that is composed

Abstract = {{Gene therapy is an important therapeutic strategy in the treatment of a
   wide range of genetic disorders. Delivery of genetic materials into
   patient cells is limited since nucleic acids are vulnerable to
   degradation in extra- and intra-cellular environments. Design of
   delivery vehicles can overcome these limitations. Polymers and lipids
   are effective non-viral nucleic acid carriers; they can form stable
   complexes with nucleic acids known as polyplexes and lipoplexes. Despite
   the great amount of experimental work pursued on polymer or lipid based
   gene delivery systems, detailed atomic level information is needed for a
   better understanding of the roles the polymers and lipids play during
   delivery. This chapter will review molecular dynamics simulations
   performed on polyplexes and lipoplexes at critical stages of gene
   delivery. Interactions between various carriers and nucleic acids during
   the formation of polyplexes/lipoplexes, condensation and aggregation of
   nucleic acids facilitated by the carriers, binding of the
   polyplexes/lipoplexes to cell membrane, as well as their intracellular
   pathway are reviewed; and the gaps in the theoretical field are

Abstract = {{Biological functions are regulated through the interactions among genes,
   proteins and other molecules in a cell. Among various approaches to
   modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs), Boolean networks (BNs) and its
   probabilistic extension, probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs), have
   been effective means; in particular, PBNs consider molecular and genetic
   noise, so they provide significant insights into the understanding of
   the dynamics of GRNs. The applications of PBNs, however, are hindered by
   the complexities involved in the computation of the state transition
   matrix and steady-state distribution of a PBN. This chapter discusses
   stochastic logic networks as computationally efficient gene network
   models. Initially, stochastic Boolean networks (SBNs) are presented as a
   novel implementation of PBNs. SBNs are based on the notions of
   stochastic logic and stochastic computation. To further exploit the
   simplicity of logical models, a multiple-valued network employs gene
   states that are not limited to binary values, thus providing a finer
   granularity in the modeling of GRNs. Subsequently, stochastic
   multiple-valued networks (SMNs) are presented for modeling the effects
   of noise and gene perturbation in a GRN. These novel logical models
   provide accurate and efficient simulations of probabilistic Boolean and
   multiple-valued networks (PBNs and PMNs). The analysis of a p53-Mdm2
   network and a WNT5A network shows that the stochastic logic networks are
   efficient in evaluating the network dynamics and steady state
   distribution of gene networks under random gene perturbation. These
   techniques are potentially useful in the investigation of intracellular
   delivery and drug discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Leukemic cancers arise from genetic alterations in normal hematopoietic
   stem or progenitor cells, leading to impaired regulation of
   proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and survival of the malignant
   cells. A range of molecular alterations is beginning to be elucidated in
   specific types of leukemias, providing potential targets for molecular
   modulation as the basis of a therapy. With the advent of RNA
   interference (RNAi) and, in particular, the short interfering RNA
   (siRNA) as its pharmacological mediator, it is becoming possible to
   specifically modulate desired leukemic targets at will. This chapter
   will summarize the current attempts to utilize siRNAs in leukemic
   therapy using chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a prototypical disease
   model. We first provide a brief background on the CML disease with
   particular emphasis on molecular mediators critical in this disease and
   the current drug therapy. The limitations of current drugs and potential
   of RNAi are presented. We then provide a summary of delivery efforts
   employed to deliver siRNA to CML cells, with emphasis on non-viral
   delivery approach due to its better safety profile for utility in a
   clinical setting. Important factors involved in intracellular delivery
   of siRNA are highlighted, emphasizing features critical for non-viral
   delivery. We conclude with a perspective on the future of siRNA therapy
   for the CML disease.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid technique for quantitative detection and discrimination of DNA
   strands without using immobilized probe molecules is demonstrated using
   an opto-calorimetric, self-powered sensor based on a Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O-3

   provides excellent chemical selectivity based on the unique molecular
   vibrational characteristics of each nucleotide in the mid IR region. The
   piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of the PZT microcantilever
   were exploited in the quantitative detection and discrimination of
   adsorbed DNA strands with their spectral characteristics. We report the
   unique spectral characteristics of different DNA nucleotides that are
   monitored by wavelength-dependent temperature variations for different
   relative molar ratio of each nucleotide. This approach offers a fast,
   label-free technique which is highly sensitive and selective for the
   detection of single nucleotide differences in DNA strands and has the
   potential to be used as a rapid prescreening biosensor for various

Title = {{The energy release rate of a pressurized crack in soft elastic
   materials: effects of surface tension and large deformation}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{39}},
Pages = {{7723-7729}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a theoretical study on how surface tension
   affects fracture of soft solids. In classical fracture theory, the
   resistance to fracture is partly attributed to the energy required to
   create new surfaces. Thus, the energy released to the crack tip must
   overcome the surface energy in order to propagate a crack. In soft
   materials, however, surface tension can cause significant deformation
   and can reduce the energy release rate for crack propagation by
   resisting the stretch of crack surfaces. We quantify this effect by
   studying the inflation of a penny-shaped crack in an infinite elastic
   body with applied pressure. To avoid numerical difficulty caused by
   singular fields near the crack tip, we derived an expression for the
   energy release rate which depends on the applied pressure, the surface
   tension, the inflated crack volume and the deformed crack area. This
   expression is evaluated using a newly developed finite element method
   with surface tension elements. Our calculation shows that, when the
   elasto-capillary number omega equivalent to sigma/Ea is sufficiently
   large, where sigma is the isotropic surface tension, E is the small
   strain Young's modulus and a is the initial crack radius, both the
   energy release rate and the crack opening displacement of an
   incompressible neo-Hookean solid are significantly reduced by surface
   tension. For a sufficiently high elasto-capillary number, the energy
   release rate can be negative for applied pressure less than a critical
   amount, suggesting that surface tension can cause crack healing in soft
   elastic materials.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Effect of Weather States on Crash Severity and Type by Use
   of Full Bayesian Multivariate Safety Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2432}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Abstract = {{Rather than investigate the isolated effects of individual weather
   elements on crash occurrence, this study investigated the aggregated
   effect of weather states, defined as a combination of various weather
   elements (e.g., temperature, snow, rain, and wind speed), on crash
   occurrence. The main argument was that a combination of weather elements
   might better represent a particular weather condition and subsequent
   safety outcome. Therefore, to explore the effect of various weather
   states on crash severity and type, this study defined 12 weather states,
   based on temperature, snow, rain, and wind speed, and developed
   multivariate safety models by using 11 years of daily weather and crash
   data for Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The proposed models were estimated
   in a full Bayesian context via a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation,
   while a posterior predictive approach assessed the models' goodness of
   fit. Results suggested that property-damage-only (PDO) crashes increased
   by 4.5\% to 45\% because of adverse weather states and showed that PDO
   crashes were more affected by adverse weather states than were severe
   (injury and fatal) crashes. For crash type, adverse weather states were
   associated with an increase of 9\% to 73.7\% for all crash types, with
   the highest increase for run-off-the-road crashes. Duration of daylight
   was found to be significant and negatively related to all crash types
   and PDO crashes. Sudden weather changes of major snow or rain were
   statistically significant and positively related to all crash types.
   Days of the week and seasons of the year were used as dummy variables
   and were statistically significant in relation to crash occurrence.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{19685-19695}},
Abstract = {{Partially ordered but not graphitized carbons are widely employed for
   sodium and lithium ion battery (NIB and LIB) anodes, either in their
   pure form or as a secondary supporting phase for oxides, sulfides and
   insertion electrodes. These ``pseudographitic{''} materials ubiquitously
   display a poor initial coulombic efficiency (CE), which has been
   historically attributed to solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation
   on their large surface areas (up to similar to 2500 m(2) g(-1)). Here we
   identify the other sources CE loss by examining a pseudographitic carbon
   with a state-of-the-art capacity (>350 mA h g(-1) for NIB, > 800 mA h
   g(-1) for LIB), but with a purposely designed low surface area (14.5
   m(2) g(-1)) that disqualifies SEI from having a substantial role. During
   the initial several (<5) cycles both Na and Li are irreversibly trapped
   in the bulk, with the associated CE loss occurring at higher
   desodiation/delithiation voltages. We measure a progressively increasing
   graphene interlayer spacing and a progressively increasing Raman G band
   intensity, indicating that the charge carriers become trapped not only
   at the graphene defects but also between the graphene planes hence
   causing them to both dilate and order. For the case of Li, we also
   unambiguously detected irreversible metal underpotential deposition
   ({''}nanoplating{''}) within the nanopores at roughly below 0.2 V. It is
   expected that in conventional high surface area carbons these mechanisms
   will be a major contributor to CE loss in parallel to classic SEI
   formation. Key implications to emerge from these findings are that
   improvements in early cycling CE may be achieved by synthesizing
   pseudographitic carbons with lower levels of trapping defects, but that
   for LIBs the large cycle 1 CE loss may be unavoidable if highly porous
   structures are utilized.}},

   this test. Four motions of the modified BB test were analyzed to
   establish kinematic data for upper-limb and trunk motion. The test was
   repeated for right and left arms in standing and seated positions. Data
   were compared using a nonparametric Friedman test. No differences were
   found between right- and left-hand performance other than for task
   completion time. Small but significant differences were found for
   standing and seated performance, with slightly greater ranges in
   standing for axial trunk rotation, medial-lateral sternum displacement,
   and anterior-posterior hand displacement. The kinematic trajectories,
   however, were very consistent. The consistency in our nondisabled data
   suggests that normative kinematic trajectories can be defined for this
   task. This motion capture procedure may add to the understanding of
   movement in upper-limb impairment and may be useful for measuring the
   effect of interventions to improve upper-limb function.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{995-1004}},
Abstract = {{Current practices for measuring high heat flux in scenarios such as
   wildland forest fires use expensive, thermopile-based sensors, coupled
   with mathematical models based on a semi-infinite-length scale. Although
   these sensors are acceptable for experimental testing in laboratories,
   high error rates or the need for water cooling limits their applications
   in field experiments. Therefore, a one-dimensional, finite-length scale,
   transient-heat conduction model was developed and combined with an
   inexpensive, thermocouple-based rectangular sensor, to create a rapidly
   deployable, non-cooled sensor for testing in field environments. The
   proposed model was developed using concepts from heat conduction and
   with transient temperature boundary conditions, to avoid complicated
   radiation and convection conditions. Constant heat flux and tree-burning
   tests were respectively conducted using a mass loss cone calorimeter and
   a propane-fired radiant panel to validate the proposed analytical model
   and sensor as well as test the sensor in a simulated forest fire
   setting. The sensor was mounted directly beside a commercial
   Schmidt-Boelter gauge to provide data for comparison. The proposed heat
   flux measurement method provided results similar to those obtained from
   the commercial heat flux gauge to within one standard deviation. This
   suggests that the use of a finite-length scale model, coupled with an
   inexpensive thermocouple-based sensor, is effective in estimating the
   intense heat loads from wildland fires.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition on silica surfaces of two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains

   cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Batch (batch soaking) and continuous flow
   (quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation) methods were used to
   evaluate the impact of CNCs on bacterial initial adhesion. This study
   demonstrated that bacterial initial adhesion to solid surfaces can be
   significantly hindered by CNCs using both methods. In the presence of
   CNCs, it was observed that bacteria with more EPS aggregated more
   significantly compared to bacteria with less EPS, and that bacterial
   deposition under this condition decreased to a greater extent. The
   classic DLVO theory failed to predict bacterial adhesion behavior in
   this study. A detailed discussion is provided regarding potential

Abstract = {{Capacitor switching transients is an important power quality concern.
   The power quality impact of a capacitor switching event is traditionally
   evaluated with the Electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulation program.
   This requires the creation of EMT cases for studying the event, which
   can be a very time consuming process. All utility companies conduct load
   flow and short-circuit studies for their systems and cases are always
   available for such studies. This paper presents an idea to conduct
   capacitor switching study using short-circuit program. The proposed
   method can be integrated into the program, resulting in significant
   saving of engineering time for capacitor switching studies. The proposed
   method conducts transients studies in frequency ( harmonic) domain. It
   models a capacitor switching event as a harmonic voltage source.
   Short-circuit calculation method is used to establish the
   frequency-responses of the study system.}},

   technology. Over the last several decades significant progress has been
   made in increasing their performance and durability, of which
   continuum-level modeling of the transport processes has played an

   approaches, with a goal of elucidating the knowledge gaps and needs
   going forward in the field. In particular, the focus is on multiphase
   flow, especially in terms of understanding interactions at interfaces,
   and catalyst layers with a focus on the impacts of ionomer thin-films
   and multiscale phenomena. Overall, we highlight where there is consensus
   in terms of modeling approaches as well as opportunities for further
   improvement and clarification, including identification of several
   critical areas for future research. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by

Abstract = {{Media webcasting and conferencing that involve many geographically
   distributed participants contribute significantly to congestion in the
   Internet. The current usage-based data pricing model does not take into
   account the hidden cost imposed by media streaming in the Internet core,
   including the network cost of replicating and relaying traffic in video
   multicast, and could potentially exacerbate congestion. In lieu of the
   recently emerged content sponsoring, in this paper, we present a simple
   congestion pricing model for ISPs (e. g. Comcast) to charge media
   streaming operators (e. g. Netflix) based on the bandwidth-delay product
   on each overlay link (either server-to-server or server-touser) that the
   media streaming operator has chosen to use. The proposed pricing policy
   incentivizes different media streaming applications to collectively
   reduce their ``waiting packets{''} in the Internet, alleviating
   congestion. We formulate the min-cost single and multiple multicast
   problems for the applications to construct their streaming overlays,
   based on a dense pool of CDN nodes. An efficient EM algorithm is given
   to solve the proposed geometric optimization problem and is evaluated
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a long-term simulation of an environmental
   monitoring system. This innovative approach combines harvesting-aware
   power management with primary batteries used as a back-up. It
   significantly extends the operational life of the device, while avoiding
   loss of data due to insufficient solar energy during winter in the harsh
   Arctic environment. The simulation considers the device to be located in
   the Arctic environment. Its main operation modes involve measurement
   from sensor interface, data storage and transmission. To perform an
   effective data-for-energy exchange, the device is controlled by a fuzzy
   energy management strategy. The new structure of the fuzzy rule-based
   system independently controls two separate variables related to data
   collection and the operation of a data buffer. The simulator uses
   meteorological data from Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, to
   estimate the amount of energy available for solar harvesting. This site,
   located above the polar circle, receives very limited amounts of solar
   radiation during winter. Operation of the device is evaluated over a
   two-year period. The simulation results are described both numerically
   and using time-series plots of energy- and data-related variables. The
   performance is adequate for unsupervised operation of the system with
   annual maintenance visits to replace batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical sensors based on micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (M/NEMS)
   offer many advantages. However, obtaining chemical selectivity in M/NEMS
   sensors using chemoselective interfaces has been a longstanding
   challenge. Despite their many advantages, M/NEMS devices relying on
   chemoselective interfaces do not have sufficient selectivity. Therefore,
   highly sensitive and selective detection and quantification of chemical
   molecules using real-time, miniature sensor platforms still remains as a
   crucial challenge. Incorporating photothermal/photoacoustic
   spectroscopic techniques with M/NEMS using quantum cascade lasers can
   provide the chemical selectivity without sacrificing the sensitivity of
   the miniaturized sensing system. Point sensing is defined as sensing
   that requires collection and delivery of the target molecules to the
   sensor for detection and analysis. For example, photothermal cantilever
   deflection spectroscopy, which combines the high thermomechanical
   sensitivity of a bimetallic microcantilever with high selectivity of the
   mid infrared (IR) spectroscopy, is capable of obtaining molecular
   signatures of extremely small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules
   (tens of picogram). On the other hand, standoff sensing is defined as
   sensing where the sensor and the operator are at distance from the
   target samples. Therefore, the standoff sensing is a non-contact method
   of obtaining molecular signatures without sample collection and
   processing. The distance of detection depends on the power of IR source,
   the sensitivity of a detector, and the efficiency of the collecting
   optics. By employing broadly tunable, high power quantum cascade lasers
   and a boxcar averager, molecular recognition of trace explosive
   compounds (1 mu g/cm(2) of RDX) on a stainless steel surface has been
   achieved at a distance of five meters.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between organic fractions in oil sands process-affected
   water (OSPW) and three polymeric membranes with varying hydrophilicity
   (nylon, polyvinylidene fluoride and polytetrafluoroethylene) at
   different pHs was studied to evaluate the impact of filtration on the
   quantification of acid-extractable fraction (AEF) and naphthenic acids
   (NAs). Four functional groups predominated in OSPW (amine, phosphoryl,
   carboxyl and hydroxyl) as indicated by the linear programming method.
   The nylon membranes were the most hydrophilic and exhibited the lowest
   AEF removal at pH of 8.7. However, the adsorption of AEF on the
   membranes increased as the pH of OSPW decreased due to hydrophobic
   interactions between the membrane surfaces and the protonated molecules.
   The use of ultra pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass
   spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS) showed insignificant adsorption of NAs on the
   tested membranes at pH 8.7. However, 26 +/- 2.4\% adsorption of NAs was
   observed at pH 5.3 following the protonation of NAs species. For the
   nylon membrane, excessive carboxylic acids in the commercial NAs caused
   the formation of negatively charged assisted hydrogen bonds, resulting
   in increased adsorption at pH 8.2 (25\%) as compared to OSPW (0\%). The
   use of membranes for filtration of soluble compounds from complex oily
   wastewaters before quantification analysis of AEF and NAs should be
   examined prior to application.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we provide analytical solutions for the streaming
   potential and electroviscous effects in soft nanochannels. The analysis
   is based on the solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation,
   valid for small electrostatic potentials. We identify the important
   dimensionless parameters that dictate these two effects. Results are
   provided for a large range of electric double layer (EDL) thickness
   values, spanning from the case of very thin to very large overlapped EDL
   thicknesses. We compare the results with those of a rigid nanochannel,
   having zeta potential equal to the electrostatic potential at the
   solid-polyelectrolyte interface of the soft nanochannels. For the soft
   nanochannel, the streaming potential varies very weakly with the EDL
   thickness and can be substantially larger than that corresponding to the
   rigid nanochannel. The electroviscous effects for the soft nanochannel,
   unlike the rigid nanochannel, virtually always exhibit a monotonic
   decrease with the EDL thickness, and for certain parameter ranges can be
   several times larger than that for a rigid nanochannel. Most
   importantly, for the soft nanochannels the electrochemomechanical energy
   conversion, associated with the generation of streaming potential, is
   found to be highly efficient, with the efficiency being several times
   higher than that of a rigid nanochannel.}},

Title = {{Integrated assessment of global water scarcity over the 21st century
   under multiple climate change mitigation policies}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2859-2883}},
Abstract = {{Water scarcity conditions over the 21st century both globally and
   regionally are assessed in the context of climate change and climate
   mitigation policies, by estimating both water availability and water
   demand within the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a leading
   community-integrated assessment model of energy, agriculture, climate,
   and water. To quantify changes in future water availability, a new
   gridded water-balance global hydrologic model - namely, the Global Water
   Availability Model (GWAM) - is developed and evaluated. Global water
   demands for six major demand sectors (irrigation, livestock, domestic,
   electricity generation, primary energy production, and manufacturing)
   are modeled in GCAM at the regional scale (14 geopolitical regions, 151
   sub-regions) and then spatially downscaled to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees
   resolution to match the scale of GWAM. Using a baseline scenario (i.e.,
   no climate change mitigation policy) with radiative forcing reaching 8.8
   W m(-2) (equivalent to the SRES A1Fi emission scenario) and three
   climate policy scenarios with increasing mitigation stringency of 7.7,
   5.5, and 4.2 W m(-2) (equivalent to the SRES A2, B2, and B1 emission
   scenarios, respectively), we investigate the effects of emission
   mitigation policies on water scarcity. Two carbon tax regimes (a
   universal carbon tax (UCT) which includes land use change emissions, and
   a fossil fuel and industrial emissions carbon tax (FFICT) which excludes
   land use change emissions) are analyzed. The baseline scenario results
   in more than half of the world population living under extreme water
   scarcity by the end of the 21st century. Additionally, in years 2050 and
   2095, 36\% (28\%) and 44\% (39\%) of the global population,
   respectively, is projected to live in grid cells (in basins) that will
   experience greater water demands than the amount of available water in a
   year (i.e., the water scarcity index (WSI) > 1.0). When comparing the
   climate policy scenarios to the baseline scenario while maintaining the
   same baseline socioeconomic assumptions, water scarcity declines under a
   UCT mitigation policy but increases with a FFICT mitigation scenario by
   the year 2095, particularly with more stringent climate mitigation
   targets. Under the FFICT scenario, water scarcity is projected to
   increase, driven by higher water demands for bio-energy crops.}},

Abstract = {{The linear quadratic control synthesis for a set of coupled first-order

   Solving the algebraic equations and substituting them into the partial
   differential equations (PDEs) results in a model consisting of a set of
   pure hyperbolic PDEs. The resulting PDE system involves a hyperbolic
   operator in which the velocity matrix is spatially varying,
   non-symmetric, and its eigenvalues are not necessarily negative through
   of the domain. The C-0-semigroup generation property of such an operator
   is proven and it is shown that the generated C-0-semigroup is
   exponentially stable and, consequently, the ORE has a unique and
   non-negative solution. Conversion of the ORE into a matrix Riccati
   differential equation allows the use of a numerical scheme to solve the

   electrochemical anodization technique}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{4421-4435}},
Abstract = {{Due to increased awareness and interest in the biomedical implant field
   as a result of an aging population, research in the field of implantable
   devices has grown rapidly in the last few decades. Among the biomedical
   implants, metallic implant materials have been widely used to replace
   disordered bony tissues in orthopedic and orthodontic surgeries. The
   clinical success of implants is closely related to their early
   osseointegration (ie, the direct structural and functional connection
   between living bone and the surface of a load-bearing artificial
   implant), which relies heavily on the surface condition of the implant.
   Electrochemical techniques for modifying biomedical implants are
   relatively simple, cost-effective, and appropriate for implants with
   complex shapes. Recently, metal oxide nanotubular arrays via
   electrochemical anodization have become an attractive technique to build
   up on metallic implants to enhance the biocompatibility and bioactivity.
   This article will thoroughly review the relevance of electrochemical
   anodization techniques for the modification of metallic implant surfaces
   in nanoscale, and cover the electrochemical anodization techniques used
   in the development of the types of nanotubular/nanoporous modification
   achievable via electrochemical approaches, which hold tremendous
   potential for bio-implant applications. In vitro and in vivo studies
   using metallic oxide nanotubes are also presented, revealing the
   potential of nanotubes in biomedical applications. Finally, an outlook
   of future growth of research in metallic oxide nanotubular arrays is
   provided. This article will therefore provide researchers with an
   in-depth understanding of electrochemical anodization modification and
   provide guidance regarding the design and tuning of new materials to
   achieve a desired performance and reliable biocompatibility.}},

Journal = {{KYBERNETES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{686-698}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In a risk analysis system, different underlying indices often
   play different roles in identifying the risk scale of the total target
   in a system, so a concept of discriminatory weight is introduced first.
   With the help of discriminatory weight and membership functions, a new
   method for information security risk analysis is proposed. The purpose
   of this paper is to discuss the above issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, a concept of discriminatory weight
   is introduced. Second, with the help of fuzzy sets, risk scales are
   captured in terms of fuzzy sets (namely their membership functions).
   Third, a new risk analysis method involving discriminatory weights is
   proposed to realize a transformation from the membership degrees of the
   underlying indices to the membership degrees of the total target. At
   last, an example of information security risk analysis shows the
   effectiveness and feasibleness of the new method.
   Findings - The new method generalizes the weighted-average method. The
   comparative analysis done with respect to other two methods show that
   the proposed method exhibits higher classification accuracy. Therefore,
   the proposed method can be applied to other risk analysis system with a
   hierarchial.

   monolayer-functionalized TNAs in polar liquids is explained by fakir or
   Cassie-states whilst the wetting behavior of bare nanotubes in every
   liquid is explained by Wenzel-type states. On the other hand, a
   transition between the Cassie and Wenzel states due to closed pores in
   the TNA architecture dictates the wetting behavior of functionalized
   TNAs in apolar liquids. The wetting behavior of functionalized TNAs is
   understood considering the synergistic effect of geometric and chemical
   surface modification. PFDPA-functionalized TNAs were found to be
   resilient to 24 hours of exposure to water and ethylene glycol at a
   static fluid pressure of 0.105 MPa, and are one step closer towards the
   realization of a mechanically robust omniphobic surface. At the same
   time, an understanding of wetting behavior will be useful in the design
   and optimization of a wide range of interface-sensitive devices such as
   metal oxide nanotube/nanopore array based sensors, implants,
   flow-through membranes, photocatalysts and heterojunction solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{We present a magnetic field-assisted oxidation and etching process that
   transforms Ti thin films on arbitrary substrates into self-organized
   TiO2 nanotube arrays without the direct application of an anodization
   voltage between the cathode and the Ti film/substrate. In effect, the Ti
   film/substrate electrode is at a floating potential determined by the
   ionic Hall voltage. The development of such a magnetic field-assisted
   electroless anodization process, frees the anodization technique of
   forming nanostructured semiconductors and metal oxides from the
   constraints of substrate conductivity and film continuity imposed by the
   traditional anodization process, and allows the creation of uniform
   anodic nanostructures on pre-existing high-aspect ratio patterns as well
   as on substrates containing both conductive and non-conductive areas.
   Using magnetic field assisted electroless anodization, we demonstrate
   the formation of microscale patterns of high quality TiO2 nanotubes from
   discontinuous Ti films deposited on thermal oxide-coated Si substrates
   and patterned by a lift-off process.}},

Title = {{Distributed Binary Quantization of a Noisy Source in Wireless Sensor
   Networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{In distributed (decentralized) estimation in wireless sensor networks,
   an unknown parameter must be estimated from some noisy measurements
   collected at different sensors. Due to limited communication resources,
   these measurements are typically quantized before being sent to a fusion
   center, where an estimation of the unknown parameter is calculated. In
   the most stringent condition, each measurement is converted to a single
   bit. In this study, we propose a distributed quantization scheme which
   is based on single-bit quantized data from each sensor and achieves high
   estimation accuracy at the fusion centre. We do this by designing some
   local binary quantizers which define a multithreshold quantization rule
   for each sensor. These local binary quantizers are initially designed so
   that together they mimic the functionality of a multilevel quantizer.
   Later, their design is improved to include some error-correcting
   capability, which further improves the estimation accuracy from the
   sensors' binary data. The distributed quantization formed by such local
   binary quantizers along with the proper estimator proposed in this work
   achieves better performance, compared to the existing distributed binary
   quantization methods, specially when fewer sensors with low measurement
   noise are available.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel criterion to study the stability of

   well-known Raisbeck's passivity criterion for 2-port networks. The
   proposed conditions are used to study the passivity (and consequently
   the stability) of a dual-user haptic system for control of a single

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{29975-29987}},
Abstract = {{Laminar flow lithography (LFL) is a fabrication technique that leverages
   the tendency of multiple fluids flowing in a microfluidic channel to
   remain confined to distinct parallel streams, enabling the substrate to
   be selectively etched to form patterned lines. The purpose of this
   investigation was to evaluate LFL as a fabrication technique for
   patterning multiple layers of parallel metal electrodes to produce
   microfluidic electrochemical cells. To understand how channel geometry
   impacts the location and width of the etched structures, finite element
   modelling (FEM) was used to simulate the profiles of the diffusive
   gradients that govern the extent and location of etching. LFL was then
   employed to fabricate two different electrochemical devices requiring
   parallel electrodes of different materials. First, a three layer
   Ag-Au-Ni thin film stack was patterned by LFL, yielding a three
   electrode device with electrically isolated and independently sized Ag,
   Au, and Ni electrodes within a cyclic-olefin copolymer (COC)
   microchannel. Second, a functional alkaline direct methanol fuel cell
   was fabricated by performing two sequential LFL processes to pattern a
   bi-metallic Ag-Ni film also deposited in a COC microchannel. The
   electrical characteristics of these Ag-Ni devices were then evaluated.
   Ag-Ni fuel cells produced a peak open circuit voltage of 185 mV and a
   peak power density of 12.0 +/- 0.4 mu W cm(-2) (equivalent to 696 +/- 20
   mu W cm(-3), in terms of chamber volume) while flowing 10 mu L min(-1)
   of dilute methanol anolyte and dilute hydrogen peroxide catholyte
   solutions. Fabrication methods presented in this investigation are
   applicable to many aspects of microfluidics and can be adapted for other
   types of microfluidic devices where in situ etching is required.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interfacial properties of soft
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels covering an oil-water
   interface is essential for engineering stimuli-responsive emulsions
   stabilized by soft microgel particles. This study presents a systematic
   study on the interfacial properties of the PNIPAM-microgel-laden
   heptane-water interface as a function of temperature. We measured the
   interfacial tensions as well as dilatational rheology properties of the
   microgel-laden heptane-water interface using a pendant drop tensiometer.
   From fresh droplet experiments, the anomalous interfacial tension minima
   of the microgels covered oil-water interface were observed around the
   volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) of the PNIPAM microgels. Such
   interfacial tension minima are observable regardless of the microgel
   aggregates. Both dynamic and static parameters contributed to the
   observed interfacial tension minima around VPTT. The PNIPAM microgel
   deformability dynamically dominated the microgel spreading at the
   heptane-water interface in the early states, while PNIPAM microgel
   packing and interactions dominated the final static equilibrium states.
   Combining the interfacial tension and the dilatational rheology
   properties, we propose that the microgels would approach three
   distinctive states at temperatures below, around, and above VPTT at the
   heptane-water interface. Single droplet experiments further demonstrate
   that there exists an irreversible transition among these three states.
   The results of this study deepen our understanding of soft, porous, and
   deformable microgels' behaviors at the oil-water interface and have
   important implications for engineering microgels as stimuli-responsive
   emulsion stabilizers.}},

Title = {{Effect of Circadian Rhythms and Driving Duration on Fatigue Level and
   Driving Performance of Professional Drivers}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2402}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Abstract = {{Circadian rhythms, inherent in all humans, consist of 24-h biological
   patterns that affect a person's fatigue level. The effect of circadian
   rhythms on driving performance was explored in an on-road driving study.
   Fifteen middle-aged professional daytime drivers were recruited to
   participate in the experiment. Participants were classified into three
   groups: (a) a morning group that started driving at 09:00, (b) a noon
   group that started driving at 12:00, and (c) an evening group that
   started driving at 21:00. Each group completed a 6-h driving task. The
   self-reported Karolinska sleepiness scale score was recorded every 5
   min, and data on driving performance parameters, such as steering and
   lane positioning, were also acquired. The results indicated that both
   circadian rhythms and driving duration had significant effects on
   self-reported fatigue levels and that the fatigue level increased faster
   in the evening group than the morning and noon groups. The results of
   the circadian rhythm analysis showed that a driver was most likely to
   feel tired between 14:00 and 16:00 and between 02:00 and 04:00, when the
   ability to stay within designated lane lines (lane maintenance) was
   significantly impaired for drivers in all three groups. The evening
   group drivers were the most at risk. The steering performance did not
   show a significant relationship with the self-reported fatigue level.
   The self-reported fatigue level is the result of the interactive effect
   of circadian rhythms and driving duration. The standard deviation of
   lane position was more correlated with circadian rhythms than with the
   steering reversal rate.}},

Title = {{Nanometer-scale Sn coatings improve the performance of silicon nanowire
   LIB anodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{11261-11279}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that a thin partially dewetted coating of Sn will improve
   the cycling performance of silicon nanowire (SiNWs) lithium ion battery
   (LIB) anodes. The optimum architecture 3Sn/SiNWs (i.e. a Sn layer with
   an average film thickness of a 3 nm covering the nanowire) maintained a
   reversible capacity of 1865 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.1
   C. This is almost double of the baseline uncoated SiNWs, where the
   reversible capacity after 100 cycles was 1046 mA h g(-1) (similar to
   78\% improvement). The 1Sn/SiNWs and 3Sn/SiNWs electrodes demonstrated
   much improved cycling coulombic efficiency, with > 99\% vs. 94-98\% for
   the baseline. At a high current density of 5 C, these nanocomposite
   offered 2x the capacity retention of bare SiNWs (similar to 20 vs.
   similar to 10\% of 0.1 C capacity). It is demonstrated that the Sn
   coating both lithiates and delithiates at a higher voltage than Si and
   thus imparts a compressive stress around the nanowires. This confines
   their radial expansion in favor of longitudinal, and reduces the
   well-known failure mode by lithiation-induced nanowire stranding and
   fracture. TOF-SIMS analysis on the post-cycled delithiated specimens
   shows enhanced Li signal near the current collector due to accelerated
   SEI formation at the interface. FIB demonstrates concurrent en-masse
   delamination of SEI agglomerated sections of the nanowires from the
   current collector. Both of these deleterious effects are lessened by the
   presence of the Sn coatings.}},

Abstract = {{A 2D(1D) multi-scale membrane electrode assembly mathematical model is
   proposed to study the effect of micro-scale transport losses due to
   catalyst aggregation in the cathode catalyst layer of a fuel cell. In
   order to develop an analytical expression for micro-scale transport
   losses, previous agglomerate models assumed an oxygen reduction reaction
   order of one and neglected any proton transport effects. In this
   article, a numerical micro-scale spherical ionomer-filled agglomerate
   model is integrated with a two-dimensional membrane electrode assembly
   model in order to develop a flexible framework to study different
   charge, mass, and kinetic transport models that cannot generally be
   analyzed with an analytical formulation. Results show that there is a
   significant interplay between scales and that changes in micro-scale
   agglomerate properties can significantly affect agglomerate
   effectiveness and current density distributions in the catalyst layer
   while not significantly affecting overall cell performance. Using the
   proposed framework, the effects of: a) proton conductivity inside
   agglomerates, b) a non-equilibrium oxygen dissolution boundary
   condition, and c) electrochemical models with different oxygen reaction
   orders, are studied. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{Quantitative photoacoustic microscopy (qPAT) is challenging. We present
   an algorithm which consecutively reconstructs absorption and scattering
   coefficient distributions with an iterative scheme in
   multiple-illumination photoacoustic tomography (MIPAT). In each
   iteration, the absorption distribution is estimated with the
   least-squares fixed-point iteration method. Then the diffusion
   coefficient is estimated with an updated version of optical fluence
   based on the previously modified absorption information. This procedure
   is repeated till an acceptable results is achieved. Simulation examples
   demonstrate the capability of this method in faithfully recovering the
   absorption and diffusion coeffient distributions, and fast convergence.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic imaging is a novel imaging technology for visualizing
   optically-absorbing structures in vivo with simultaneous high contrast
   and high spatial resolution. However, differentiation of photoacoustic
   signals is non-trivial hence specificity can be poor. We propose
   multimodality photoacoustic and Raman imaging system using
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering nanoparticles, previously demonstrated
   to have extremely high specificity and multiplexing capabilities.
   Moreover, we propose to target cancer cells with both magnetic and
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering nanoparticles, which can further
   improve our system to be used for magnetic enrichment and detection of
   circulating tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{Standard sumps are an important component of our stormwater drainage
   system. Recently they have received significant attention as a
   stormwater pre-treatment device to remove sediment from stormwater
   runoff. The objective of this research is to explore some simple
   structures to be installed inside standard sumps to improve sediment
   removal efficiency. A number of structures were tested and two
   structures were found to be most effective in sediment removal. Both
   structures can increase the sediment removal rate by around 20-25\% for
   sediment sizes of 80-140 mu m and 110-170 m under all tested flowrates,
   and 10-20\% for sediment of 160-240 mu m. The flow patterns in these
   structures were simulated using a numerical model, and the energy loss
   was also examined. The results of this study offer a new direction for
   the development of stormwater treatment devices.}},

   temperature were fully investigated, through which the pore structure

   optimized. When studied as an adsorbent for CO2 capture, the optimized
   porous carbon exhibited a high CO2 capture capacity of 4.50 mmol g(-1),
   high multi-cycle sorption/desorption stability and highly selective
   adsorption of CO2 over N-2 (0.27 mmol g(-1)) at 25 degrees C. This

Title = {{Scheduling of Changes in Complex Engineering Design Process via Genetic
   Algorithm and Elementary Effects Method}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Engineering design changes constantly occur in a complex engineering
   design process. Designers have to put an appropriate procedure in place
   to handle these changes in order to realize successful product
   development in a timely and cost-effective manner. When many change
   propagation paths are present, selection of the best change evolution
   paths and distribution of change results to downstream tasks become
   critical to the progress management of the project. In this paper, based
   on the available change propagation simulation algorithm, a global
   sensitivity analysis method known as elementary effects (EE) is employed
   to rank the importance of each potential propagation path with those
   involved design dependencies in the process. Further, an EE-based
   heuristic design dependency encoding method is applied to the genetic
   algorithm which is then adopted to schedule the change updating process.
   Finally, the optimal results obtained by the complete search and the
   heuristic dependency encoding methods are compared to illustrate the
   improvements and effectiveness of the latter method.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The effect of polymerization conditions on thermal and mechanical
   properties of ethylene/1-butene copolymers synthesized through
   titanium-magnesium-supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts was studied. The
   increase in hydrogen pressure leads to a decrease in molecular weight
   (MW), storage modulus, and melting temperature. However, it yields an
   increase in molecular weight distribution (MWD), tan delta, \%
   crystallinity, tensile modulus, yield stress, and strain at break. The
   effects of ethylene pressure and polymerization temperature on the
   copolymer MW, MWD and thermal and mechanical properties have been
   investigated. However, the impacts of ethylene pressure and
   polymerization temperature on copolymer modulus, tensile strength,\%
   crystallinity, crystallization peak temperature, yield stress, strain at
   break, and yield strain are marginal. The hydrogen pressure plays a
   major role in controlling the copolymer properties because it acts as an
   efficient chain transfer agent during polymerization reaction. The MW is
   the key parameter that influences flow activation energy. However, the
   other mechanical, dynamic mechanical, and thermal properties not only
   depend on MW but are also influenced by other parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of lubrication on the polish rate and the
   surface quality of highly boron-doped polysilicon is presented. The
   mechanical effects of polishing were studied by altering the CMP process
   and lubrication regime. It was shown that increasing the polish velocity
   and slurry flow rate does not always increase the polish rate and that
   the lubrication behavior plays a dominant role in this process.
   Increasing the mechanical forces and altering the lubrication regime to
   boundary and dry lubrication were the key factors which resulted in a
   maximum polish rate. The maximum polish rate for the boron-doped
   polysilicon with 3.4 m Omega.cm(-1) resistivity was similar to 0.75
   mu/min and achieved in the dry lubrication regime. The coefficient of
   friction (COF) was also studied and agreed with the polish rate values
   where the dry lubrication polishing showed highest COF following the
   Stribeck curve. Finally the surface quality of the polished wafers were
   studied by AFM and it was shown that the lubrication behavior and
   friction force had minor effect on the surface roughness and all the
   wafers were perfectly smooth after polishing (Rq similar to 2 angstrom).

Title = {{Effect of Nanocomposite Structures on Fracture Behavior of Epoxy-Clay
   Nanocomposites Prepared by Different Dispersion Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The effects of organic modifier and processing method on morphology and
   mechanical properties of epoxy-clay nanocomposites were investigated. In
   this study, the preparation of nanocomposites by exfoliation-adsorption
   method involved an ultrasonic mixing procedure, and mechanical blending
   was used for in situ intercalative polymerization. The microstructure
   study revealed that the organoclay, which was ultrasonically mixed with
   the epoxy, partially exfoliated and intercalated. In contrast,
   organoclay remained in phase-separated and flocculated state after the
   mechanical blending process. Tensile stiffness increased significantly
   for the nanocomposite prepared by ultrasonic dispersion method through
   realizing the reinforcing potential of exfoliated silicate layers.
   Nanocomposites with exfoliated and intercalated nanoclay morphology were
   ineffective in enhancing the fracture toughness whereas nanocomposites
   with phase-separated and flocculated morphology have improved crack
   resistance predominantly by crack deflecting and pinning mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Knolker's iron catalyst is characterized by low toxicity and relatively
   low price in comparison with precious metal catalysts. Density
   functional theory was used to explore improvements to this catalyst. It
   was found that electron-withdrawing substituents on the CpOH ring are
   favorable for improving the efficiency of iron catalysts. Increasing the
   acidity of CpOH is also an available means of improving the catalytic
   efficiency. However, replacing the hydroxyl of CpOH with the amino group
   is not a valid choice for improvement. In contrast, substituting
   phosphine ligands for carbonyls is the most effective method for
   improving the catalytic activity of the iron catalyst. But the PR3
   ligand must have electron-donating groups and its steric effect should
   be controlled in a suitable range. Replacing carbonyl groups by PH3 and
   PPhH2 ligands can effectually improve the catalytic activity for
   hydrogenation of ketones.}},

Title = {{Bioconversion of coal: new insights from a core flooding study}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{22779-22791}},
Abstract = {{A pressurized core flooding experiment was performed to better
   understand in situ coal bioconversion processes. The core flooding
   experiment was conducted using a biaxial core holder packed with
   subbituminous coal particles (250-150 mu m grain size) obtained from the
   Highvale mine in Alberta, Canada. The coal pack was inoculated with a
   methanogenic microbial culture enriched from coal and was continuously
   flooded with mineral salt medium and an organic carbon/nitrogen nutrient
   supplement (tryptone). The changes in the physical properties of the
   coal pack during the core flooding suggested coal bioconversion to
   methane under the experimental conditions. Colonization and
   bioconversion of coal by microbes was evident from the change in core
   permeability and presence of metabolites and gas (CH4 and CO2) in the
   effluent. A total of 1.52 mu mol of CH4 was produced per gram of coal
   during the 90 days experiment at 22 degrees C. Signature metabolites
   consistent with anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons, e.g.,
   carboxylic acids, were identified in effluent samples throughout
   incubation. The transient nature of metabolites in effluent samples
   supports fermentation of coal constituents and nutrient supplement to
   simple molecules such as acetic acid, which served as a substrate for
   methanogenesis during the bioconversion process. Accumulation of
   carboxylic acids such as succinic acid in the effluent also demonstrates
   that the coal bioconversion process may be used for extraction of other
   value-added products apart from CH4 generation. Importantly, results
   presented here suggest that coal bioconversion by biostimulation under
   reservoir conditions is a scalable technology with potential for energy
   generation and for overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of welding parameters on material consolidation are examined
   during friction stir butt welding of 2 mm Al 5083 alloy aluminium sheet
   with a surface cladding of Al 3025 alloy, which was co-cast from the
   melt. The influence of welding parameters on joint consolidation is
   investigated when tool revolutions per minute, travel speed and
   penetration depth were varied. It was found that modifying the pin of
   the welding tool to have a two-flat profile improves material
   consolidation and avoids defect formation during welding, and optimum
   welding parameters involve a combination of high tool rotation speed and
   travel speed. Optical and electron microscopy revealed that the
   integrity of the surface cladding layer could be maintained during
   friction stir welding while avoiding defect formation within the stir
   zone of the weld. The tensile strength of the joint was similar to 58\%
   of the base material due to softening within the stir zone.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{A combination of steady-state fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime
   measurements and the determination of time-resolved emission spectra
   were employed to characterize asphaltene toluene solutions. Lifetime
   measurements were shown to be insensitive to the source of asphaltene or
   the alkane solvent from which asphaltene was precipitated. This
   insensitivity suggests that either the composition of Athabasca and Cold
   Lake asphaltene is very similar or that the fluorescence behavior is
   dominated by the same subset of fluorophores for the different samples.
   These results highlight the limitations in using fluorescence to
   characterize asphaltene solutions. Different dependencies were observed
   for the average lifetimes with the asphaltene concentration when
   measured at two different emission wavelengths (420 nm and 520 nm). This
   result suggests that different fluorophores underwent diverse
   interactions with other asphaltene molecules as the asphaltene
   concentration was raised, suggesting that models for asphaltene
   aggregation need to include molecular diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are either entirely disordered
   or contain disordered regions in their native state. IDPs were found to
   be abundant across all kingdoms of life, particularly in eukaryotes, and
   are implicated in numerous cellular processes. Experimental annotation
   of disorder lags behind the rapidly growing sizes of the protein
   databases and thus computational methods are used to close this gap and
   to investigate the disorder. MFDp2 is a novel webserver for accurate
   sequence-based prediction of protein disorder which also outputs
   well-described sequence-derived information that allows profiling the
   predicted disorder. We conveniently visualize sequence conservation,
   predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, and
   alignments to chains with annotated disorder. The webserver allows
   predictions for multiple proteins at the same time, includes help pages
   and tutorial, and the results can be downloaded as text-based (parsable)
   file. MFDp2 is freely available at

Title = {{Effect of Nonviral Plasmid Delivered Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor and
   Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound on Mandibular Condylar Growth: A
   Preliminary Study}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is an important
   regulator of tissue growth. Previous studies have shown that low
   intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulates bone growth. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the possible synergetic effect
   of LIPUS and local injection of nonviral bFGF plasmid DNA (pDNA) on
   mandibular growth in rats. Design. Groups were control, blank pDNA, bFGF
   pDNA, LIPUS, and bFGF pDNA + LIPUS. Treatments were performed for 28
   days. Significant increase was observed in mandibular height and
   condylar length in LIPUS groups. MicroCT analysis showed significant
   increase in bone volume fraction in bFGF pDNA + LIPUS group.
   Histomorphometric analysis showed increased cell count and condylar
   proliferative and hypertrophic layers widths in bFGF pDNA group.
   Results. Current study showed increased mandibular condylar growth in
   either bFGF pDNA or LIPUS groups compared to the combined group that
   showed only increased bone volume fraction. Conclusion. It appears that
   there is an additive effect of bFGF + LIPUS on the mandibular growth.}},

Journal = {{COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{93-103}},
Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that exposure of all compost particles to
   temperatures 55 degrees C for at least three consecutive days is a
   sufficient criterion for a compost to be considered hygienic.
   Nonetheless, there are no known studies confirming that routine
   composting operations consistently provide the conditions to meet this
   criterion. The objectives of this study were: (i) to develop a
   self-contained temperature probe capable of mimicking random particle
   behavior in compost and recording the temperature it is exposed to,
   while withstanding adverse operating conditions; (ii) to validate the
   probe's physical characteristics in a field-scale operation; and (iii)
   to assess the recovery of probes from a full-scale compost operation.
   Two field trials found the probes do behave like random particles and
   that the aluminum case adequately protected the probe's circuitry and
   cryovial. Another two trials were conducted to analyze probe recovery.
   Temperature probes were randomly introduced into a freshly built aerated
   static pile. In the first trial, 80m(3) of material was screened in one
   day and the probe recovery efficiency was 100\%. In the second trial,
   screening of 440m(3) of material was completed in three days and 79\% of
   the probes were recovered. The inability to achieve a recovery rate of
   at least 90\% could be due to the high moisture content (50\%) of the
   material being screened, the high fraction of oversized material, and,
   most importantly, the heavy reliance on visually locating the probes in
   the screen overs.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{833-842}},
Abstract = {{Locally delivered plasmid DNA (pDNA) is currently pursued as gene-based
   therapy for regenerative medicine, but important information on in situ
   pDNA pharmacokinetics and transgene expression is lacking in animal
   models. To investigate pDNA pharmacokinetics in implants, low molecular
   weight (2 kDa) polyethylenimine (PEI) and linoleic acid substituted 2
   kDa PEI (PEI-LA) were used for pDNA delivery in gelatin sponges. An
   efficient pDNA extraction method combined with quantitative PCR (qPCR)
   was found to give equivalent quantitation of naked and polymer-bound
   pDNA, making it suitable to assess pDNA polyplexes in implants. Naked
   pDNA implanted in a rat subcutaneous model was > 98\% lost after 24
   hours whereas PEI and PEI-LA delivered pDNA remained intact in implants
   for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Using a plasmid expressing DsRed as a
   reporter gene, mRNA and protein expression was observed only for PEI-LA
   despite the extended retention and cellular uptake of PEI complexes. The
   in vivo data were in agreement with in vitro results showing that only
   PEI-LA was an effective transfection agent even though both PEI and
   PEI-LA complexes were internalized by the cells. Dose dependence was
   observed for mRNA expression, with a 20 mu g dose giving faster onset
   and higher expression levels compared to a 5 mu g pDNA dose. The mRNA
   expression after PEI-LA mediated delivery was sustained for at least 4
   weeks and a significant correlation between pDNA retention in sponges
   and mRNA expression was observed. In addition to establishing a
   promising gene carrier for gene delivery, these studies provided
   important information about the retention and transgene expression by
   implanted non-viral carriers.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a technique which helps to print
   a smaller depth of focus and smoother surface in micro fabrication
   industry. In this project, boron doped polysilicon is used as a fill
   material for Through Silicon Vias (TSV) creating a 3D package. It is
   shown that the presence of boron as dopant suppresses the polysilicon
   polish rate. To increase the polish rate, understanding the mechanism of
   polish rate retardation is essential. We believe that the electrical
   effects play the major role in this phenomenon and by reducing this
   effect we are able to increase the polish rate.}},

Title = {{The intrinsic disorder status of the human hepatitis C virus proteome}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1345-1363}},
Abstract = {{Many viral proteins or their biologically important regions are
   disordered as a whole, or contain long disordered regions. These
   intrinsically disordered proteins/regions do not possess unique
   structures and possess functions that complement the functional
   repertoire of ``normal{''} ordered proteins and domains, with many
   protein functional classes being heavily dependent on the intrinsic
   disorder. Viruses commonly use these highly flexible regions to invade
   the host organisms and to hijack various host systems. These disordered
   regions also help viruses in adapting to their hostile habitats and to
   manage their economic usage of genetic material. In this article, we
   focus on the structural peculiarities of proteins from human hepatitis C
   virus (HCV) and use a wide spectrum of bioinformatics techniques to
   evaluate the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the completed proteomes
   of several human HCV genotypes, to analyze the peculiarities of disorder
   distribution within the individual HCV proteins, and to establish
   potential roles of the structural disorder in functions of ten HCV
   proteins. We show that the intrinsic disorder or increased flexibility
   is not only abundant in these proteins, but is also absolutely necessary
   for their functions, playing a crucial role in the proteolytic
   processing of the HCV polyprotein, the maturation of the individual HCV
   proteins, and being related to the posttranslational modifications of
   these proteins and their interactions with DNA, RNA, and various host
   proteins.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the fracture parameters of bond in stone masonry
   beams bound with plain and fiber-reinforced mortar. Sandstone blocks
   were joined together with a modern Type S mortar conforming to the
   Canadian standard. A companion series was examined employing a hydraulic
   lime mortar, typically used in the restoration of historical masonry.
   Based on a previous study, polypropylene microfibers were incorporated
   at up to 0.50\% by volume to achieve superior crack growth resistance.
   This study evaluated the critical stress intensity factor, the critical
   effective crack length, and the critical crack mouth opening
   displacements. The masonry beams were subjected to quasi-static flexure
   as per ASTM and dynamic bending through a drop weight impact machine
   that generated stress rates up to 107kPa/s. The study reveals that there
   is an improvement in the bond strength due to fibers but a difference in
   the fracture performance between the Type S and hydraulic lime mortars.
   Whereas with Type S mortar, fibers promote failure through fracture in
   the stone block especially under dynamic loading, in the hydraulic lime
   mortar fiber reinforcement moves the failure plane from the interface to
   within the bulk mortar.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effect of geometrically similar specimen size on
   the mechanical properties of cement-based foams. The experimental study
   also investigates fracture-mechanical parameters under flexural impact.
   A preformed foam was employed to prepare the specimens using a synthetic
   foaming agent that was known to achieve a stable bubble structure. The
   cement-based foams were prepared to a cast density of 475kg/m3 and were
   examined under compression and flexure. Along with a plain unreinforced
   mix, polypropylene fiber at a volumetric fraction of 0.2\% was used to
   study the effect of microfiber reinforcement. The tested specimens
   scaled between one to four times in dimension. Parameters associated
   with their dynamic-fracture mechanics were evaluated under flexure with
   the help of a drop-weight impact tester equipped with a high speed
   imaging system. Baant's size effect model and the multifractal scaling
   model were employed to describe the size effect. It was seen that when
   subjected to compression, the fiber-reinforced specimens demonstrate a
   noticeable size effect, whereas, under quasi-static flexure, the more
   significant size effect was observed for the plain specimens. As
   expected, fiber reinforcement improved the Mode I fracture toughness at
   all sizes.}},

Abstract = {{We detail a new ultrafast scanning tunneling microscopy technique called
   THz-STM that uses terahertz (THz) pulses coupled to the tip of a
   scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to directly modulate the STM bias
   voltage over subpicosecond time scales {[}1]. In doing so, THz-STM
   achieves ultrafast time resolution via a mode complementary to normal
   STM operation, thus providing a general ultrafast probe for stroboscopic
   pump-probe measurements. We use THz-STM to image ultrafast carrier
   trapping into a single InAs nanodot and demonstrate simultaneous
   nanometer (2 nm) spatial resolution and subpicosecond (500 fs) temporal
   resolution in ambient conditions. Extending THz-STM to vacuum and low
   temperature operation has the potential to enable studies of a wide
   variety of subpicosecond dynamics on materials with atomic resolution.}},

   resonators through two-photon absorption photogenerated free-carriers is
   studied using self-consistent 3-D finite difference time domain (FDTD)
   simulations. The self-consistent FDTD simulations incorporate the
   two-photon absorption, free carrier absorption, and plasma dispersion
   effects in silicon. The nanorings are aperture coupled to
   Ag/HfO2/Si(100nm)/HfO2/Ag MISIM waveguides by 300nm wide and 50nm deep
   apertures. The effects of pump pulse energy, HfO2 spacer thickness, and

   radius is varied between 540nm and 1 mu m, the HfO2 spacer thickness is
   varied between 10nm and 20nm, and the pump pulse energy is explored up
   to 60pJ. Modulation amplitude, switching time, average generated carrier
   density, and wavelength resonant shift is studied for each of the device
   configurations. In a compact device footprint of only 1.4 mu m(2), a
   13.1dB modulation amplitude was obtained with a switching time of only
   2ps using a modest pump pulse energy of 16.0pJ. The larger bandwidth
   associated with more compact nanorings and thinner spacer layers is

Title = {{A model for simultaneous matrix depletion into natural and hydraulic
   fracture networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{57-69}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Existing transient triple-porosity models for fractured horizontal wells
   do not converge to linear dual-porosity models (DPM) in the absence of
   micro-fractures (MF). The reason is the assumption of
   sequential-depletion from matrix to MF, and from MF to
   hydraulic-fractures (HF). This can result in unreasonable estimates of
   MF and/or HF parameters. Hence, a quadrilinear flow model (QFM) is
   proposed which relaxes the sequential-depletion assumption.
   To allow simultaneous matrix-MF and matrix-HF depletion, the matrix
   volume is conceptually divided into two sub-domains; one feeds HF and
   the other feeds MF. This breaks a single 2-D problem into two 1-D
   problems. Using Laplace transforms, the flow equations are solved under
   constant-rate and constant-pressure well constraints. Type-curves are
   generated by numerically inverting the resulting Laplace-space solutions
   to time-space using Gaver-Stefhest algorithm. QFM converges to the
   linear sequential triple-porosity model (STPM) in the absence of
   matrix-HF communication; and converges to the DPM in the absence of MF.
   Flow-regimes observed comprise linear, bilinear, and boundary dominated.
   QFM matches production history of two fractured horizontal wells
   completed in Bakken and Cardium Formations. This match yields reservoir
   parameters like half-length and permeability; these parameters are
   estimated as range of values instead of single values to reflect the
   non-uniqueness in the match.
   Results from this study are significant when selecting the appropriate
   model for interpreting production data from multifractured horizontal
   wells in formations with/without natural-fracture (NF/MF) reactivation.
   DPM is appropriate if analog studies (e.g. outcrop, micro-seismic and
   image log analyses) reveal high spacing aspect ratio (negligible MF) in
   the reservoir. Spacing aspect ratio is MF spacing divided by HF spacing.
   STPM is appropriate if analog studies reveal low spacing aspect ratio
   (e.g. matrix-HF face damage or high MF density within a given HF
   spacing). QFM is appropriate for all spacing aspect ratios. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work, the physical and electrochemical behavior in a room
   temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), 1-butyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (BMP-TFSI) has been investigated.
   Water was added to BMP-TFSI and the effect of added water on
   conductivity, electrochemical window (ECW) and oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) was explored. The results show that for water amounts up to 1.0
   wt\%, water addition to BMP-TFSI slightly increases the conductivity of
   BMP-TFSI due to ``shear relaxation{''} in the water-ionic liquid
   mixture. As a result of an ``impurity effect{''}, an increase in water
   addition to BMP-TFSI brings about a reduction in the ECW for the
   mixture. The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique has confirmed
   that the ORR process in as-received BMP-TFSI can be assigned to
   one-electron transfer: O-2 + e(-) <-> O-2(-center dot). The
   reversibility of the O-2/O-2(-center dot) redox couple is greatly
   reduced with the addition of water. The suppressed anodic peak is likely
   attributable to the fact that the superoxide readily reacts with water.
   In water added BMP-TFSI, the ORR peak occurs at a more positive
   potential with an increased current density. The improved ORR activity
   is attributed to a proton effect and the increase in electron transfer
   number of the ORR in water added BMP-TFSI. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{In this work, we have investigated the conductivity, electrochemical
   window (ECW) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in various
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI)-based room temperature ionic
   liquids (RTILs). In an attempt to improve ORR activity in RTILs, water
   and/or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are added to one TFSI-based RTIL,
   1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
   (BMP-TFSI), and the effect of additives on its conductivity, ECW and
   ORR. is explored. The results show that as-received TFSI-based ionic
   liquids (ILs) have a low conductivity due to their large constituent
   ions. The addition of water and/or DMSO has considerable effect on the
   conductivity of the IL mixture. The studied TFSI-based RTILs have wide
   ECWs and the presence of water and/or DMSO causes an apparent narrowing
   of the observed potential window. For all TFSI-based ILs, the oxygen
   redox peaks can be assigned to an O-2/O-2(-center dot) one-electron
   transfer process. By adding water, the O-2/O-2(-center dot) redox
   potential shifts in a more positive direction in BMP-TFSI; e.g., about
   0.27 V more positive in BMP-TFSI with 1 wt\% water addition, due to its
   high acceptor number (AN) and the proton effect. The addition of DMSO
   also contributes to the improvement in ORR activity in BMP-TFSI through
   enhanced conductivity and redox reversibility. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The effects of pH on sulfur-induced passivity degradation of Alloy 800
   in simulated crevice chemistries were evaluated using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS), secondary ion, mass spectroscopy (SIMS),
   and Mott-Schottky analysis methods. Experimental results reveal that the
   detrimental effect of impurities containing sulfur at the reduced or
   intermediate oxidation level (S-x) on the passivity of Alloy 800 depends
   significantly on the solution pH. In neutral crevice (NC) chemistry
   containing chloride ions, the S-x obstructs the healing process during
   repassivation, retards the dehydration reaction and also incorporates H,
   OH and S into the passive film. However, the detrimental effect of S-x
   is insignificant in an alkaline crevice (AKC) solution due to a change
   in surface adsorption and surface charge. Impurities containing sulfur
   at the reduced or intermediate oxidation level would cause Alloy 800 to
   lose its passivity and become active in an acidic crevice (AC)
   chemistry. Experimental evidence also indicates that the solution pH
   alters the semiconductor type of the surface film from n-type in NC
   solution to p-type in AKC solution. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{The electrochemical performance of two infiltrated SOFCs (solid oxide

   NiO-SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) was infiltrated into a porous 8YSZ (8 mol\%

   (La(0.80)Sr(0.20)MuO(3)) or Nd-nickelate (Nd2NiO4) was infiltrated into
   a thin porous YSZ layer to form the cathode. The power density of the
   Nd-nickelate infiltrated cell is higher than that of the LSM infiltrated
   cell suggesting it as a suitable cathode for intermediate temperature
   applications. The microstructure of these infiltrated solid oxide fuel
   cells shows a reasonable distribution of fine particles (50-100 nm) near
   the interface of electrodes and electrolyte and within the bulk
   electrodes. Despite having much lower Ni content than conventional anode
   supported cells, the infiltrated fuel cells exhibit a reasonable power
   density at low temperatures and an excellent robustness against redox
   cycling when air is used as the anode oxidant. (C) 2014 The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{43-50}},
Abstract = {{Untreated water can intrude into water distribution systems through pipe
   leaks and cracks when negative pressure events occur inside drinking

   of intrusion flow rate, which ignores the impact of the soil surrounding
   the pipeline. This paper presents the results of an experimental study
   on the effect of porous media surrounding pipelines and the flow
   Reynolds number on intrusion flow rate for a circular orifice. The
   porous media, orifice size, and flow regime affect the discharge
   coefficient of the orifice equation. A new expression was suggested for
   predicting the intrusion flow rate. A discontinuity in the discharge
   coefficient was also found at a large Reynolds number. The effect of the
   pipe curvature on the discharge coefficient was found to be
   insignificant.}},

   REMOVAL}},
Journal = {{FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{355-362}},
Abstract = {{A series of modified nano-Fe-0 and nano-Fe-0/Cu were synthesized by the
   liquid phase reduction method and used to remove bromate from water. The
   results show that the PVP or ethanol added in the synthesis of NZVI
   could reduce nanoparticle aggregation, and then enhance its reactivity
   for bromate removal. The characterizations of BET and TEM show that the
   nano-Fe-0 and nano-Fe-0/Cu particles with 25\% ethanol addition during
   synthesis have smaller diameter and higher surface areas of 64 m(2)/g
   and 92 m(2)/g, respectively, increasing significantly compared with that
   without modification. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu plays a
   catalytic role in the process of bromate reduction, which can enhance
   bromate removal efficiency. About 60\% bromate removal efficiency was
   achieved using nano-Fe-0/Cu even under the DO value of 6.5 mg/L, which
   was higher than that of using NZVI without ethanol addition during
   synthesis. Additionally, the influence of the presence of anions on
   bromate removal efficiency followed the order of PO43->SO42- >NO3-
   >ClO3- >NO2-. However, bromate could completely be removed with a
   greater amount of nano-Fe-0/Cu under the presence of anions. This study
   shows that nano-Fe-0/Cu is a potentially efficient material for the
   bromate removal.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the effect of the substrate material on the radio-frequency
   (RF) behavior of carbon-nanotube transistors by considering the impact
   of substrate polar phonons (SPPs). We consider SPP scattering from AlN,
   SiO2, HfO2, and ZrO2 substrates within a semiclassical approach by
   solving the time-dependent Boltzmann transport equation
   self-consistently with the Poisson equation. Various RF figures of
   merit, such as the unity-current gain frequency f(T), the
   unity-power-gain frequency f(max), the transconductance g(m), and the
   two-port y-parameters, are determined in order to characterize the
   impact of SPP scattering. We first consider the impact of SPP scattering
   on the RF behavior of an intrinsic single-tube carbon nanotube
   field-effect transistor (CNFET). These single-tube results are then
   combined with the external parasitic elements to analyze the
   pitch-dependent, RF behavior of an extrinsic array-based CNFET. It is
   shown that AlN substrates have the least impact in degrading the RF
   performance of a CNFET, while the more polar substrates (HfO2 or ZrO2)
   have a greater impact. This varying behavior can be attributed to the
   SPP energies, which are higher in AlN compared to the other materials,
   making CNFETs with AlN substrates less susceptible to SPP scattering
   even at room temperature. Our results suggest that substrate engineering
   will become an important component in the design process of emerging
   devices to achieve an optimized RF performance.}},

Abstract = {{We report here the preparation of dual-temperature and pH responsive
   (ethylene glycol)-based nanogels via the reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization under
   aqueous conditions. The core-shell structures of the nanogels were
   composed of 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate (MEO(2)MA),
   oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA), and di(ethylene glycol)
   dimethacrylate as a cross-linker. Both the core and shell structures of
   the nanogels showed a lower critical solution temperature (LCST).
   Interestingly, the LCST of the shell was strongly affected by the
   solution pH and salt concentration due to the presence of carboxyl
   groups at the nanogel surface. These dual temperature and pH responsive
   nanogels are expected to be non-toxic and therefore can be used as novel
   biomaterials for drug delivery applications.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{909-914}},
Abstract = {{Microsensor techniques were used to investigate in situ the simultaneous
   occurrence of sulfate reduction and nitrogen removal in a membrane
   aerated biofilm reactor. H2S, O-2, pH, ORP, NH4+ and NO3- microsensors
   were fabricated and used to measure the profiles inside the membrane
   aerated biofilm. Production and consumption rates of H2S, O-2, NH4+ and
   NO3- were estimated using corresponding concentration profiles. The
   results showed that in anoxic zone, located from the interface between
   biofilm and bulk liquid to about 550 mu m below the interface, both
   sulfate reduction and denitrification occurred. Highest H2S production
   rates (around 0.27 mg L-1 s(-1)) were found about 400 to 450 mu m below
   the interface. Below the anoxic zone, an aerobic zone was present. High
   H2S oxidation activity occurred at around 550-700 mu m below the
   interface. High oxygen consumption rates (0.34 mg L-1 s(-1)) occurred at
   around 750-900 mu m below the interface. Nitrification activity occurred
   at about 500-650 mu m below the interface. Along the entire biofilm
   depth, pH changed slightly (within 0.2 unit). Near the interface of the
   aerobic and anoxic zone, there was a drastic redox potential change.
   These results demonstrated simultaneous sulfate reduction and nitrogen
   removal in a piece of membrane aerated biofilm.}},

   results reveal that the coating resistance, charge transfer resistance
   and noise resistance decrease with the prolongation of storage time. The
   iron and tin contents in cans increase with the storage time, while the
   bump height of coating surface increases from 30 nm to 80 nm during the
   corrosion of twelve months. The existence of deformation would enhance
   the corrosion process of tinplate cans. Finally, the corrosion mechanism

Title = {{Can integration difficulties affect innovation and satisfaction?}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{183-202}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The difficulties in the integration of management systems
   (MSs) and their relationship with innovation and customer satisfaction
   are explored by proposing a model that links these three concepts
   together. Integration, innovation and customer satisfaction are relevant
   issues for the competitiveness of companies, especially for the ones
   that have implemented several MS standards. The paper aims to discuss
   these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data for the study derives from a survey
   carried out in 76 Spanish organizations registered to at least both ISO
   9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 standards for quality MSs and environmental
   MSs, respectively. An exploratory factor analysis and structural
   equation modeling (SEM) are utilized to assess and confirm the proposed
   scales validity and the relationships of the conceptual model.
   Findings - Based on the empirical study, the second-order SEM shows that
   the difficulties of integration are directly and negatively related to
   both of MS documentation and procedures. This level is also directly
   related to the innovation and satisfaction. Nevertheless, no
   relationships were found between the difficulties of integration and the
   integration level of MS human resources. Moreover, no direct
   relationships were found between the difficulties of integration and
   both the constructs of innovation and satisfaction. Also, the results
   showed the integration level of MS procedures was not related to the
   construct of innovation.
   Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to relate
   integration difficulties with innovation and customer satisfaction, with
   a conclusion that an organization should give more importance to the
   difficulties of integrated MSs that have been uncovered to have a
   relationship with innovation and customer satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of limestone rocks was estimated
   by indentation testing on small rock fragments. The effects of rock

   area normal to loading direction has little effect on the indentation
   indices, while the sample thickness has major influence on the results.
   To reduce size dependency, the results of indentation test were
   normalized by a thickness function.
   The proposed empirical equations were verified against independent data
   pertaining to other limestone rocks not used in developing the
   correlations, which showed agreement between the estimated and measured
   UCS. Statistical analysis was used to determine the minimum number of
   required indentation tests in relation to the project importance. This
   study shows that the uniaxial compressive strength of rocks can be
   estimated reasonably well from indentation testing of small rock

Title = {{High field structural MRI reveals specific episodic in the subfields of
   the hippocampus memory correlates}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{233-245}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The involvement of the hippocampus (HC) in episodic memory is well
   accepted; however it is unclear how each subfield within the HC
   contributes to memory function. Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   studies suggest differential involvement of hippocampal subfields and
   subregions in episodic memory. However, most structural MRI studies have
   examined the HC subfields within a single subregion of the HC and used
   specialised experimental memory paradigms. The purpose of the present
   study was to determine the association between volumes of HC subfields
   throughout the entire HC structure and performance on standard
   neuropsychological memory tests in a young, healthy population. We
   recruited 34 healthy participants under the age of 50. MRI data was
   acquired with a fast spin echo (FSE) sequence yielding a 0.52 x 0.68 x
   1.0 mm(3) native resolution. The HC subfields - the cornu ammonis 1-3
   (CA), dentate gyrus (DG), and subiculum (SUB) - were segmented manually
   within three hippocampal subregions using a previously defined protocol.
   Participants were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale, 4th edition
   (WMS-IV) to assess performance in episodic memory using verbal (Logical
   Memory, LM) and visual (Designs, DE; visual-spatial memory, DE-Spatial;
   visual-content memory, DE-Content) memory subtests. Working memory
   subtests (Spatial Addition, SA; and Symbol Span, SSP) were included as
   well. Working memory was not associated with any HC volumes. Volumes of
   the DG were correlated with verbal memory (LM) and visual-spatial memory
   (DE-Spatial). Posterior CA volumes correlated with both visual-spatial
   and visual-object memory (DE-Spatial, DE-Content). In general, anterior
   subregion volumes (HC head) correlated with verbal memory, while some
   anterior and many posterior HC subregion volumes (body and tail)
   correlated with visual memory scores (DE-Spatial, DE-Content). In
   addition, while verbal memory showed left-lateralized associations with
   HC volumes, visual memory was associated with HC volumes bilaterally.
   This the first study to examine the associations between hippocampal
   subfield volumes across the entire hippocampal formation with
   performance in a set of standard memory tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The event-triggered state estimation problem for linear time-invariant
   systems is considered in the framework of Maximum Likelihood (ML)
   estimation in this paper. We show that the optimal estimate is
   parameterized by a special time-varying Riccati equation, and the
   computational complexity increases exponentially with respect to the
   time horizon. For ease in implementation, a one-step event-based ML
   estimation problem is further formulated and solved, and the solution
   behaves like a Kalman filter with intermittent observations. For the
   one-step problem, the calculation of upper and lower bounds of the
   communication rates from the process side is also briefly analyzed. An
   application example to sensorless event-based estimation of a DC motor
   system is presented and the benefits of the obtained one-step
   event-based estimator are demonstrated by comparative simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{Cyclic proteins (CPs) have circular chains with a continuous cycle of
   peptide bonds. Their unique structural traits result in greater
   stability and resistance to degradation when compared to their acyclic
   counterparts. They are also promising targets for
   pharmaceutical/therapeutic applications. To date, only a few hundred CPs
   are known, although recent studies suggest that their numbers might be
   substantially higher. Here we developed a first-of-its-kind, accurate
   and high-throughput method called CyPred that predicts whether a given
   protein chain is cyclic. CyPred considers currently well-represented CP
   families: cyclotides, cyclic defensins, bacteriocins, and trypsin
   inhibitors. Empirical tests demonstrate that CyPred outperforms commonly
   used alignment methods. We used CyPred to estimate the incidence of CPs
   and found similar to 3500 putative CPs among 5.7+ million chains from
   642 fully sequenced proteomes from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.
   The median number of putative CPs per species ranges from three for
   archaea proteomes to two for eukaryotes/bacteria, with 7\% of archaea,
   11\% of bacterial, and 16\% of eukaryotic proteomes having 10+ CPs. The
   differences in the estimated fractions of CPs per proteome are as large
   as three orders of magnitude. Among eukaryotes, animals have higher
   ratios of CPs compared to fungi, while plants have the largest spread of
   the ratios. We also show that proteomes enriched in cyclic proteins
   evolve more slowly than proteomes with fewer cyclic chains. Our results
   suggest that further research is needed to fully uncover the scope and
   potential of cyclic proteins. A list of putative CPs and the CyPred
   method are available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/CyPred/. This

Abstract = {{Silicon based hollow nanostructures are receiving significant scientific
   attention as potential high energy density anodes for lithium ion
   batteries. However their cycling performance still requires further
   improvement. Here we explore the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) of
   TiO2, TiN and Al2O3 on the inner, the outer, or both surfaces of hollow
   Si nanotubes (SiNTs) for improving their cycling performance. We
   demonstrate that all three materials enhance the cycling performance,
   with optimum performance being achieved for SiNTs conformally coated on
   both sides with 1.5 nm of Li active TiO2. Substantial improvements are
   achieved in the cycling capacity retention (1700 mA h g(-1) vs. 1287 mA
   h g(-1) for the uncoated baseline, after 200 cycles at 0.2 C),
   steady-state coulombic efficiency (similar to 100\% vs. 97-98\%), and
   high rate capability (capacity retention of 50\% vs. 20\%, going from
   0.2 C to 5 C). TEM and other analytical techniques are employed to
   provide new insight into the lithiation cycling-induced failure
   mechanisms that turn out to be intimately linked to the microstructure

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{B3167-B3172}},
Abstract = {{Microcantilever as sensing platform has been proven to be extremely
   sensitive for investigating various biochemical events. Despite of its
   rapid and label-free detection, obtaining molecular finger print for
   simultaneous detection of biomarkers is limited due to the difficulty in
   simultaneous functionalization of cantilevers. Though capillary based
   functionalization has been considered as one of the best method for
   simultaneous functionalization, it is limited by alignment of different
   sized capillary arrays. In the present work, we demonstrated the
   challenges and opportunities available for capillary based
   functionalization of microcantilever arrays and address the challenges
   by proposing an innovative capillary functionalization using on-chip
   V-grooves connected to flexible capillaries. Cantilever array chip
   comprising 8 cantilevers spaced at 250 mu m distance is simultaneously
   functionalized with different biomolecules by inserting into
   dimensional-matched V-groove arrays. We demonstrated that a simple
   on-chip V-groove capillary functionalization is an easy, effective and
   highly repeatable by performing a standard sandwich immunoassay for
   detecting various cardiac markers such as myoglobin and troponin T. (C)

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The as-welded microstructure of laser-welded Ti-6Al-4V is characterized
   as a function of CO2 key-hole mode laser welding speed. Martensitic
   alpha' is the predominant phase, with some alpha and retained beta.
   Phase transformation is affected by the cooling rate through laser
   welding speed. A higher welding speed of 1.6 to 2.0 m/min produced more
   martensite alpha' and less retained beta in the welds. 1.4 m/min welding
   speed produced small amounts of alpha, besides the martensite alpha'. A
   trace of delta titanium hydride phase seems to have formed in the weld
   fusion zone. Moire fringes are a common feature in the TEM
   microstructure, due to abundance of multi-phase interfaces. Tensile
   twins and clusters of dislocations indicate that plastic deformation has
   happened in the as-welded microstructure, indicating the local stress
   levels to be approaching the yield stress on-cooling during laser
   welding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Janus droplets are compound droplets that consist of two adhering drops
   of different fluids that are suspended in a third fluid. We use the
   Shan-Chen lattice Boltzmann method for multicomponent mixtures to
   simulate Janus droplets at rest and in shear. In this simulation model,
   interfacial tensions are not known a priori from the model parameters
   and must be determined using numerical experiments. We show that
   interfacial tensions obtained with the Young-Laplace law are consistent
   with those measured from the equilibrium geometry. The regimes of
   adhering, separated, and engulfing droplets were explored. Two different
   adhesion geometries were considered for two-dimensional simulations of
   Janus droplets in shear. The first geometry resembles two adhering
   circles with small overlap. In the second geometry, the two halves are
   semicircular. For both geometries, the rotation rate of the droplet
   depends on its orientation. The width of the periodic simulation domain
   also affects the rotation rate of both droplet types up to an aspect
   ratio of 6: 1 (width:height). While the droplets with the first geometry
   oscillated about the middle of the domain, the droplets of the second
   geometry did not translate while rotating. A four-pole vortex structure
   inside droplets of the second geometry was found. These simulations of
   single Janus droplets reveal complex behaviour that implies a rich range
   of possibilities for the rheology of Janus emulsions. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Stable pH is an established biomarker of health, relevant to all tissues
   of the body, including the heart. Clinical monitoring of pH in a
   practical manner, with high spatiotemporal resolution, is particularly
   difficult in organs such as the heart due to its soft mechanics,
   curvilinear geometry, heterogeneous surfaces, and continuous, complex
   rhythmic motion. The results presented here illustrate that advanced
   strategies in materials assembly and electrochemical growth can yield
   interconnected arrays of miniaturized IrOx pH sensors encapsulated in
   thin, low-modulus elastomers to yield conformal monitoring systems
   capable of noninvasive measurements on the surface of the beating heart.
   A thirty channel custom data acquisition system enables spatiotemporal
   pH mapping with a single potentiostat. In vitro testing reveals
   super-Nernstian sensitivity with excellent uniformity (69.9 +/- 2.2
   mV/pH), linear response to temperature (-1.6 mV degrees C-1), and
   minimal influence of extracellular ions (<3.5 mV). Device examples
   include sensor arrays on balloon catheters and on skin-like stretchable
   membranes. Real-time measurement of pH on the surfaces of explanted
   rabbit hearts and a donated human heart during protocols of
   ischemia-reperfusion illustrate some of the capabilities. Envisioned

Abstract = {{Porous chromium carbide (Cr3C2) ceramics exhibiting a uniform and
   accessible porous structure comprised of three-dimensional connected
   struts were synthesized using a reactive sintering method. The effect of
   sintering temperature on the resulting microstructure of the porous
   Cr3C2 was studied. Young's modulus of the porous carbides was measured
   by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and a semi-empirical model
   E=E-0(1-P/P-c)(1/J) was developed (based on the generalized mixture rule
   (GMR)), to describe the porosity dependence of Young's modulus for this
   type of carbide. The constants P-c=0.8 and J=0.355 were determined by
   fitting the model to the measured values. The relationship between the
   micro-hardness of the material and the microstructure of the pores was
   also investigated. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{The use of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as potential
   electrolytes for rechargeable Zn-anode batteries suffers from a
   disadvantage of insufficient conductivity. In this study, water added
   ionic liquids composed of pyrrolidinium/imidazolium cations and
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions were investigated with regard
   to their physicochemical behavior and their response to Zn/Zn(II) redox
   reactions. Peak conductivity was achieved by adding water within the
   range of 2.0-2.5 wt\%. The best kinetic properties for Zn/Zn(II) redox,
   including decreased redox overpotential and on average three times the
   diffusion rate and exchange current density, were also achieved for this
   composition range. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed
   that water addition led to the weakening of Zn-TFSI bonds and,
   consequently, an increase in the concentration of Zn2+ dissolved in
   RTILs and involved in the redox reaction, which accounts for the
   improved Zn redox kinetics. Water also affected the morphology of Zn
   electrodeposited from RTILs. Zinc deposits grew from nanocrystalline to
   microcrystalline in scale with poorer adhesion in water added RTILs with
   pyrrolidinium cations. However, Zn deposits obtained from water added
   RTILs with imidazolium cations showed no obvious change in size and
   adhesion properties. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of different rotor asymmetry rotation faults
   on the power loss variations in Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) is
   studied deeply. To fulfill this objective, SRM's core losses including
   hysteresis and eddy current losses accompanied with its copper losses
   are firstly introduced theoretically in detail. Then a 6 by 4 SRM is
   simulated and motor profiles as well as power losses factors are
   measured in presence of three common eccentricity faults namely as;
   static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and mixed
   eccentricity (ME) faults. The numerical analysis and simulations are
   done by the three-dimensional Time-Step Finite Element Method
   (3D-TSFEM). In next step, a similar test rig is designed and built for
   experimental measurements and confirmations. It was realized that, these
   types of eccentricity faults directly affect the power loss value and
   can enhance it abundantly. In other word, the more severity in fault
   levels conclude the more reduction in output power and the more
   increment in power losses that can be used as diagnosis index. (C) 2013

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Traditional compressed sensing considers sampling a 1D signal. For a
   multidimensional signal, if reshaped into a vector, the required size of
   the sensing matrix becomes dramatically large, which increases the
   storage and computational complexity significantly. To solve this
   problem, the multidimensional signal is reshaped into a 2D signal, which
   is then sampled and reconstructed column by column using the same
   sensing matrix. This approach is referred to as parallel compressed
   sensing, and it has much lower storage and computational complexity. For
   a given reconstruction performance of parallel compressed sensing, if a
   so-called acceptable permutation is applied to the 2D signal, the
   corresponding sensing matrix is shown to have a smaller required order
   of restricted isometry property condition, and thus, lower storage and
   computation complexity at the decoder are required. A zigzag-scan-based
   permutation is shown to be particularly useful for signals satisfying
   the newly introduced layer model. As an application of the parallel
   compressed sensing with the zigzag-scan-based permutation, a video
   compression scheme is presented. It is shown that the zigzag-scan-based
   permutation increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio of reconstructed
   images and video frames.}},

Title = {{A Particle Swarm Optimization Variant with an Inner Variable Learning
   Strategy}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Although Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has demonstrated competitive
   performance in solving global optimization problems, it exhibits some
   limitations when dealing with optimization problems with high
   dimensionality and complex landscape. In this paper, we integrate some
   problem-oriented knowledge into the design of a certain PSO variant. The
   resulting novel PSO algorithm with an inner variable learning strategy
   (PSO-IVL) is particularly efficient for optimizing functions with
   symmetric variables. Symmetric variables of the optimized function have
   to satisfy a certain quantitative relation. Based on this knowledge, the
   inner variable learning (IVL) strategy helps the particle to inspect the
   relation among its inner variables, determine the exemplar variable for
   all other variables, and then make each variable learn from the exemplar
   variable in terms of their quantitative relations. In addition, we
   design a new trap detection and jumping out strategy to help particles
   escape from local optima. The trap detection operation is employed at
   the level of individual particles whereas the trap jumping out strategy
   is adaptive in its nature. Experimental simulations completed for some
   representative optimization functions demonstrate the excellent
   performance of PSO-IVL. The effectiveness of the PSO-IVL stresses a
   usefulness of augmenting evolutionary algorithms by problem-oriented
   domain knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{The diffuse literature on drop oscillation is reviewed, with an emphasis
   on capillary wave oscillations of constrained drops. Based on the
   review, a unifying conceptual framework is presented for drop and bubble
   oscillations, which considers free and constrained drops/bubbles,
   oscillation of the surface or the bulk (i.e. center of mass) of the
   drop/bubble, as well as different types of restoring forces (surface
   tension, gravity, electromagnetic, etc). Experimental results (both from
   literature and from a new set of experiments studying sessile drops in
   cross flowing air) are used to test mathematical models from literature,
   using a novel whole profile analysis technique for the new experiments.
   The cause of oscillation (cross flowing air, vibrated surface, etc.) is
   seen not to affect oscillation frequency. In terms of models, simplified
   models are seen to poorly predict oscillation frequencies. The most
   advanced literature models are found to be relatively accurate at
   predicting frequency. However it is seen that no existing models are
   reliably accurate across a wide range of contact angles, indicating the
   need for advanced models/empirical relations especially for drops
   undergoing the lowest frequency mode of oscillation (the order 1 degree
   1 non-axisymmetric `bending' mode that corresponds to a lateral
   `rocking' motion of the drop). (C) 2013 Elsevier BM. All rights

Abstract = {{Oxygen production in an economic way is critical to oxy-firing
   combustion, a carbon capture technology. Oxygen-deficient oxides have
   been used for absorption of oxygen from air and desorption of oxygen in
   recycled flue gas for oxy-firing combustion. Cuprous/cupric oxide
   equilibrium with alumina can be used as an alternative for oxygen
   production and absorption. In this work, the effect of the spinel phase
   (CuAl2O4) content on oxygen sorptive/desorptive properties of
   CuO-CuAl2O4 sorbents has been investigated using thermogravimetric
   analysis. The desorption rate and oxygen sorption capacity were shown to
   be dependent upon the amount of alumina addition. The effect of SO2 and
   H2O in flue gas was investigated using FACTSage over a range of
   conditions. It was found that, at temperatures above 750 degrees C, CuO
   is inert to these species, making it a proper choice for oxygen carrier.
   Cyclic stability was also investigated using the same instrument. The
   molar CuAl2O4 content of 20\% was observed to have the most positive
   cyclic stability effect. A stable morphology was observed in the
   scanning electron microscopy microstructure of the sorbent with this
   CuAl2O4 content. Sintering at a lower CuAl2O4 content and attrition
   because of second-phase agglomeration can destabilize the sorbents.}},

Abstract = {{The role of different types of caustics in bitumen extraction from
   Canadian oil sands is investigated by analyzing their effect on
   subprocesses involved in bitumen extraction. Both sodium hydroxide and
   ammonium hydroxide were shown to improve bitumen liberation, which is
   favorable for bitumen recovery, but increased induction time of
   bitumen-bubble attachment, which is harmful for bitumen recovery.
   Although a similar performance was observed at pH of similar to 8.5, at
   pH 11.3, the use of ammonium hydroxide led to a shorter induction time
   of bitumen-bubble attachment and, hence, better bitumen recovery than
   the use of sodium hydroxide to achieve the same slurry pH. The better
   performance of ammonium hydroxide is attributed to a more hydrophobic
   surface and a less negative zeta potential of bitumen in the process
   water because of the release of less amount of natural surfactants in
   ammonium hydroxide solutions than in sodium hydroxide solutions of the
   same solution pH. Overall, ammonium hydroxide was found to be a suitable
   replacement for sodium hydroxide. Although this study was mainly
   concerned with mining-extraction operations, the major findings derived
   from this study could be applied readily to in situ thermal bitumen
   production operations, because ammonia can be delivered with steam to
   oil sands formations.}},

Abstract = {{Trunk instability during sitting is a major problem following
   neuromuscular injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. In order
   to develop new strategies for alleviating this problem, a better
   understanding of the intrinsic contributions of the healthy trunk to
   sitting control is needed. As such, this study set out to propose and
   validate a novel methodology for determining multidirectional trunk
   stiffness during sitting using randomized transient perturbations.
   Fifteen healthy individuals sitting naturally on a custommade seat were
   randomly perturbed in eight horizontal directions. Trunk stiffness and
   damping were quantified using force and trunk kinematics in combination
   with translational and torsional models of a mass-spring-damper system.
   The results indicate that stiffness and damping of the healthy trunk are
   roughly symmetrical between the two body sides. Moreover, both
   quantities are smallest in the anterior and largest in the lateral
   directions. In conclusion, a novel protocol for identifying intrinsic
   trunk stiffness and damping has been developed, eliminating anticipation
   effects with respect to perturbation timing and direction. Subsequent
   studies will use these findings as a reference not only for quantifying
   trunk stiffness and damping in individuals with various neuromuscular
   disorders, but also for assessing whether neuroprostheses could increase
   upper body stiffness and, hence, stability. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Poly-L-lysine (PLL), in alpha-helix or beta-sheet configuration, was
   used as a model peptide for investigating the effect of secondary
   structures on adsorption events to poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) modified
   surfaces formed using theta solvents. Circular dichroism results showed
   that the secondary structure of PLL persisted upon adsorption to Au and
   PEO modified Au surfaces. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   (QCM-D) was used to characterize the chemisorbed PEO layer in different
   solvents (theta and good solvents), as well as the sequential adsorption
   of PLL in different secondary structures (alpha-helix or beta-sheet).
   QCM-D results suggest that chemisorption of PEO 750 and 2000 from theta
   solutions led to brushes 3.8 +/- 0.1 and 4.5 +/- 0.1 nm thick with layer
   viscosities of 9.2 +/- 0.8 and 4.8 +/- 0.5 cP, respectively. The average
   number of H2O per ethylene oxides, while in theta solvent, was
   determined as similar to 0.9 and similar to 1.2 for the PEO 750 and 2000
   layers, respectively. Upon immersion in good solvent (as used for PLL
   adsorption experiments), the number of H2O per ethylene oxides increased
   to similar to 1.5 and similar to 2.0 for PEO 750 and 2000 films,
   respectively. PLL adsorbed masses for alpha-helix and beta-sheet on Au
   sensors was 231 +/- 5 and 1087 +/- 14 ng cm(-2), with layer viscosities
   of 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 1.2 +/- 0.1 cP, respectively; suggesting that the
   alpha-helix layer was more rigid, despite a smaller adsorbed mass, than
   that of beta-sheet layers. The PEO 750 layer reduced PLL adsorbed
   amounts to similar to 10 and 12\% of that on Au for alpha-helices and
   beta-sheets respectively. The PLL adsorbed mass to PEO 2000 layers
   dropped to 12\% and 4\% of that on Au, for alpha-helix and beta-sheet
   respectively. No significant differences existed for the viscosities of
   adsorbed alpha-helix and beta-sheet PLL on PEO surfaces. These results
   provide new insights into the fundamental understanding of the effects
   of secondary structures of peptides and proteins on their surface
   adsorption. (C) 2013 Acts Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the relationship between magnetic resonance (MR)
   imaging markers of iron content and disease severity in patients with
   multiple sclerosis (MS) over a 2-year period.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the local
   ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all
   participants. Seventeen patients with MS and 17 control subjects were
   examined twice, 2 years apart, by using phase imaging and transverse
   relaxation (R2{*}) mapping at 4.7 T. Quantitative differences in iron
   content in deep gray matter between patients and control subjects were
   evaluated with repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance
   separately for R2{*} mapping and phase imaging. Multiple regression
   analysis was used to evaluate correlations of MR imaging measures, both
   2-year-difference and single-time measurements, to baseline disease
   severity.
   Results: R2{*} mapping using 2-year-difference measurements had the
   highest correlation to disease severity (r = 0.905, P < .001) compared
   with R2{*} mapping using single-time measurements (r = 0.560, P =.019)
   and phase imaging by using either single-time (r = 0.539, P = .026) or
   2-year-difference (r = 0.644, P = .005) measurements. Significant
   increases in R2{*} occur during 2 years in the substantia nigra (P <
   .001) and globus pallidus (P = .035), which are both predictors of
   disease in regression analysis, in patients compared with control
   subjects. There were group differences in the substantia nigra, globus
   pallidus, pulvinar thalamus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus, compared
   with control subjects with R2{*} mapping (P < .05), and group
   differences in the caudate nucleus and pulvinar thalamus, compared with
   control subjects with phase imaging (P < .05).
   Conclusion: There are significant changes in deep gray matter iron
   content in MS during 2 years measured with MR imaging, changes that are
   strongly related to physical disability. Longitudinal measurements may
   produce a higher correlation to disease severity compared with
   single-time measurements because baseline iron content of deep gray
   matter is variable among subjects. (C) RSNA, 2013}},

Abstract = {{Hot liquid hazards present in work environments are well known to be a
   considerable risk in workplace safety for numerous industries. In this
   work, the effects of different liquids and temperatures on penetration
   performance of fabrics were investigated, and the influence of
   impingement angle on protective performance of liquid penetration was
   also studied. Several kinds of fabrics for protective clothing were used
   to characterize the penetration behaviors of protective materials. The
   results showed the liquid temperature had a significant impact on the
   stored and penetrated amount of liquids. Different liquids can lead to
   distinct damage to fabrics. The impingement angle affects liquid
   transfer (storage and penetration) through the fabric. The addition of a
   thermal liner or moisture barrier can sharply decrease the penetration.
   The results provide new insights into the development of functional
   garments/materials and better methods for evaluating the performance of
   these materials under hazardous work environments.}},

Abstract = {{A 3- and 2-fold increase in selectivities toward 2-ethyltoluene and
   n-propylbenzene, respectively, in indan ring opening (RO) was achieved
   by introducing palladium to the ruthenium catalyst. The product
   selectivities for the Ru-Pd system with the 4:1 molar ratio were the
   same as those for monometallic iridium, known for its outstanding single
   cleavage selectivity; the lights formation was suppressed as compared
   with the monometallic platinum catalyst. A further increase in the Pd
   amount did not result in the selectivity improvement and brought down
   the activity to the low level of Pd. The bimetallic catalysts were
   synthesized in the presence of poly-(vinylpyrrolidone). The bimetallic
   systems revealed sintering resistance up to 400 degrees C, as compared
   with their monoforms. The indan RO activity was maximized after
   precalcination at 200 degrees C. The suggested nanoparticles'
   bimetallicity was consistent with the results of CO-TPD, CO DRIFTS,
   thermal stability tests, and a chemical probe reaction (olefin
   hydrogenation, in which only Pd is active). The Pd-Ru system is
   envisioned as a viable alternative to monometallic Ir for RO.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first targeted review of the synthesis - microstructure -
   electrochemical performance relations of MoS2 - based anodes and
   cathodes for secondary lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Molybdenum
   disulfide is a highly promising material for LIBs that compensates for
   its intermediate insertion, voltage (similar to 2 V vs. Li/Li+) with a
   high reversible capacity (up to 1290 mA h g(-1)) and an excellent rate
   capability (e.g. 554 mA h g(-1) after 20 cycles at 50 C). Several themes
   emerge when surveying the scientific literature on the subject: first,
   we argue that there is excellent data to show that truly nanoscale
   structures, which often contain a nanodispersed carbon phase,
   consistently possess superior charge storage capacity and cycling
   performance. We provide several hypotheses regarding why the measured
   capacities in such architectures are well above the theoretical
   predictions of the known MoS2 intercalation and conversion reactions.
   Second, we highlight the growing microstructural and electrochemical
   evidence that the layered MoS2 structure does not survive past the
   initial lithiation cycle, and that subsequently the electrochemically
   active material is actually elemental sulfur. Third, we show that
   certain synthesis techniques are consistently demonstrated to be the
   most promising for battery applications, and describe these in detail.
   Fourth, we present our selection of synthesis methods that we believe to
   have a high potential for creating improved MoS2 LIB electrodes, but are
   yet to be tried.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{45-58}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The processing of oil sands generates large volumes of slurry, known as
   tailings, that is impounded in tailings ponds. Oil sands operators are
   committed to develop reclamation plans to ensure that the mine site is
   restored to a natural or economically usable landscape. Since most of
   the material that is needed for capping of the tailings pond is produced
   in mining operation, it is reasonable to include material requirement
   for reclamation as part of mine planning. In this paper, an integrated
   long-term mine planning model is proposed that includes tailings
   capacity and reclamation material requirements. A mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) model is developed to test the performance of the
   proposed model. The MILP model is coded in Matlab (R). It is verified by
   carrying out a case study on an actual oil sands dataset, and has
   resulted in an integer solution within a 2\% gap to the optimality. The
   resulted production schedule meets the capacity constraint of the
   tailings facility and guarantees the production of the required
   reclamation material. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Performing surgery on fast-moving heart structures while the heart is
   freely beating is next to impossible. Nevertheless, the ability to do
   this would greatly benefit patients. By controlling a teleoperated robot
   to continuously follow the heart's motion, the heart can be made to
   appear stationary. The surgeon will then be able to operate on a
   seemingly stationary heart when in reality it is freely beating. The
   heart's motion is measured from ultrasound images and thus involves a
   non-negligible delay due to image acquisition and processing, estimated
   to be 150 ms that, if not compensated for, can cause the teleoperated
   robot's end-effector (i.e., the surgical tool) to collide with and
   puncture the heart. This research proposes the use of a Smith predictor
   to compensate for this time delay in calculating the reference position
   for the teleoperated robot. The results suggest that heart motion
   tracking is improved as the introduction of the Smith predictor
   significantly decreases the mean absolute error, which is the error in
   making the distance between the robot's end-effector and the heart
   follow the surgeon's motion, and the mean integrated square error.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are introducing a new category of wafer-level
   micromachined rectangular waveguide devices and illustrate a new
   transition of these devices to Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) lines for
   millimeter-wave applications. The 3-D fabrication process used in this
   paper utilizes a combination of thin film and thick film processes and
   produces a simple three-mask fabrication process. As a result, all the
   on-wafer elements such as the waveguide, the CPW lines, and their
   transition are simultaneously fabricated, which eliminates the
   ever-existing requirement of hybrid assembly of the waveguide parts. A
   metalized post is employed to couple the signal from the CPW line to the
   waveguide. Unlike the previous designs that are mostly based on
   capacitive coupling, the proposed CPW to waveguide transition is based
   on inductive coupling, which simplifies the fabrication requirements and
   improves the performance. Here, the entire back-to-back structure is
   designed, fabricated, and measured on a 10 mm(2) wafer area. A wide-band
   RF performance is measured for the proposed waveguide structure. Our
   measured results show an insertion loss of as low as 1 dB at 72 GHz
   range. The proposed technique to realize wafer-level waveguides has
   great potential to include a variety of waveguide topologies including
   bends and arcs. Besides, this method allows for further expansion of the
   topic to integrate MEMS components inside the waveguide.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the economical and environmental concerns, the importance of
   distributed generation-based microgrids is increasing. However, the
   presence of induction motor (IM) loads in converter-based microgrids
   might induce source-load admittance mismatch between the IM load and
   microgrid converters leading to medium-frequency instabilities,
   particularly in isolated microgrids. To overcome this issue, this paper
   presents detailed small-signal admittance models, analysis, and
   stabilization of a voltage-source inverter (VSI)-based microgrid with
   direct online IM load. The resultant source (VSI) and load (IM)
   admittances form a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system. Using the
   generalized Nyquist stability criterion, it is shown that the
   interactions between the lightly-damped dynamics of IMs and isolated
   VSI-based microgrid have significant destabilizing effect. Active
   compensation techniques are proposed to maintain the system stability.
   Time-domain simulations and experimental results are presented to
   validate the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{It has become standard in the helicopter UAV control literature to use
   the main and tail rotor thrusts, and the main rotor flapping angles as
   inputs. However, the physically-controllable inputs are servomotors
   which actuate the main rotor cyclic and collective pitch, and the tail
   rotor collective pitch. Precise treatments of the helicopter model exist
   which study the physical inputs. However, these models remain
   intractable for practical implementation motivating researchers to use
   rough approximations such as simple gain relationships between thrust
   and collective. We propose and identify a physical input model which
   retains the accuracy of a general model but is algebraically simple
   enough for its use in control design. As a result of experimental
   validation, the vehicle's velocity is incorporated into the model to
   improve its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{A Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) testbed design for small unmanned
   helicopters which provides a safe and low-cost platform to implement
   control algorithms and tune the control gains in a controlled
   environment is described. Specifically, it allows for testing the
   robustness of the controller to external disturbances by emulating the
   hover condition. A 6-DOF nonlinear mathematical model of the helicopter
   has been validated in real flight tests. This model is implemented in
   real-time to estimate the states of the helicopter which are then used
   to determine the actual control signals on the testbed. Experiments of
   the longitudinal, lateral and heading control tests are performed. To
   minimize the structural stress on the fuselage in case of controller
   failure or a subsystem malfunction, a damping system with a negligible
   parasitic effect on the dynamics of the helicopter around hover is
   incorporated. The HIL testbed is capable of testing the helicopter in
   hover, as well as on any smooth trajectories such as cruise flight,
   figure-8, etc. Experimentally tuning the controller on the HIL testbed
   is described and results in a controller which is robust to the external
   disturbances, and achieves an accuracy of +/- 2.5 cm in the position
   control on the longitudinal and lateral trajectory tracking, and +/- 5
   deg accuracy around the yaw axis on the heading trajectory tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Fault detection from the vibration measurement data of rotating
   machinery is significant for avoiding serious accidents. However,
   non-stationary vibration signal with a large amount of noise makes this
   task challenging. Multiwavelet not only owns the advantage on
   multi-resolution analysis but also can offer multiple wavelet basis
   functions. So it has the possibility of detecting various fault features
   preferably. However, the fixed basis functions which are not related to
   the given signal may lower the accuracy of fault detection. Moreover,
   another major intrinsic deficiency of multiwavelet lies in its
   critically sampled filter-bank, which causes shift-variance and is
   harmful to extract the feature of periodical impulses. To overcome these
   deficiencies, a new method called customized redundant multiwavelet
   (CRM) is constructed via increasing multiplicity (IM). IM is a simple
   method to design a series of changeable multiwavelet which are available
   for the subsequent optimization process. By the rule of the envelope
   spectrum entropy minimum principle, optimal multiwavelet is searched
   for. Based on the customized multiwavelet filters, the filters of CRM
   can be calculated by inserting zeros. The proposed method is applied to
   analyze the simulation, gearbox and rolling element bearing vibration
   signals. Compared with some other conventional methods, the results
   demonstrate that the proposed method possesses robust performance in
   detecting fault features of rotating machinery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Hip protectors are often prescribed to the elderly who are at risk of
   falling, with the goal of preventing hip fractures. However, determining
   the effectiveness of hip protectors has been hampered by unreliable
   compliance data. This study reports a reliable objective method of
   measuring compliance and the developed method could be used in any
   climate, regardless of temperature. Custom compliance monitors were
   built and embedded inside hip protectors. An algorithm was developed to
   utilize both temperature and acceleration to determine compliance. Seven
   young volunteers (age 24.6 +/- A 4.2 years old) wore the protectors for
   a total of 667 h while closely recording their compliance. One female
   (77 years old) who had hip fracture history wore the compliance monitors
   for 91.6 \% of the time during a 1-week stay in a hospital. From the
   volunteers' trial, using temperature alone overpredicted compliance by
   1.2 \% and using acceleration alone overpredicted by 5.4 \%, but using a
   combination of the two methods plus a correction factor only
   underestimated by 0.6 \%. From the elderly data, the average compliance
   recorded from the temperature, acceleration, and combined methods with
   correction was 94.6, 88.9, and 90.2, respectively. The high accuracy of
   temperature sensors in this study will not be attainable in hot climates
   where most of the worldwide increase in hip fractures is occurring. The
   developed monitor with the algorithm provided high accuracy in
   determining compliance and was able to determine both the longitudinal
   and cross-sectional compliance at any time.}},

Title = {{Investigating ASTM F 1962 arching factor for Polyethylene pipes

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Earth pressure on a pipe crown is one of the most significant
   operational loads considered in the design of Polyethylene (PE) pipes
   installed by Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). The amount of earth
   pressure depends on the long-term bore conditions as well as the
   development of a sliding wedge resulting from deformation of the bore
   due to the overcut and deformation of the PE pipe itself under loadings.
   Current practices for designing PE pipes in North America is based upon
   American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F 1962, which is a
   modified version of Terzaghi's arching model for earth pressure
   estimation. There are some concerns regarding the inaccuracy of the ASTM
   F 1962 arching model. In this study, the ASTM F 1962 arching model for
   the design of PE pipes installed by HDD is reviewed and compared with
   other available standards. It was observed that, the ASTM F 1962 arching
   factor decreases as the soil friction angle increases from 0 degrees to
   40 degrees, however, it was mathematically proven that the respective
   equation shows a minimum at a friction angle of 26.6 degrees, which does
   not seem to have a physical interpretation. The ASTM F 1962 arching
   model was also compared with some of the European standards for HDD
   pipeline design. This study revealed that, the ASTM F 1962 arching model
   contains some inconsistencies, which are due to the improper
   modification of Terzaghi's arching model. Discussions are provided on
   the issues that exist with regard to the current ASTM F 1962 arching
   model including the effects of cohesion and soil type on the arching
   factor. Results of using ASTM F 1962 and the Dutch arching factors in
   design of some sample PE pipes in three soil conditions for operational
   loads are also presented. This paper provides some clarifications on the
   ASTM F 1962 standard, which will assist engineers and contractors in
   designing PE pipes installed by HDD more accurately. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of pH on the corrosion resistance of Alloy 800, one of the
   preferred nuclear steam generator tubing materials, was investigated
   using in-situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The experimental results
   show that positive feedback is observed in the probe approach curve
   (PAC) in acidic chloride solutions, indicating that Alloy 800 is active
   in acidic solutions; the EIS at the corrosion potential in acidic
   solutions exhibits an intact capacitance arc. However, negative
   feedbacks are observed in the PAC in either neutral or basic chloride
   solutions, showing that Alloy 800 is self-passivated in these two
   solutions. The EIS plots at different anodic potentials show incomplete
   capacitance arcs, and the arc radius decreases with increasing
   potential, indicating that the corrosion resistance of the passive film
   decreases. The SECM images show that the surface reactivity increases
   (or the dissolution rate of the passive film increases) as the
   polarization potential increases from the corrosion potential to the
   positive direction; this is verified by an increased tip current. Some
   ``active spots{''} can be seen on the SECM images in neutral or basic

   The governing equations and BCs are reduced to a set of nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and the corresponding BCs,
   respectively. The dependencies of solutions on Prandtl number Pr, Lewis
   number Le, Brownian motion number Nb, and thermophoresis number Nt are
   studied in detail. The results show that the reduced Nusselt number and
   the reduced Sherwood number increase for the BCs of Case 2 compared with
   Case 1. The increases of Nb, Nt, and Le numbers cause a decrease of the
   reduced Nusselt number, while the reduced Sherwood number increases with
   the increase of Nb and Le numbers. For low Prandtl numbers, an increase
   of Nt number can cause to decrease in the reduced Sherwood number, while
   it increases for high Prandtl numbers.}},

Abstract = {{In cold regions, weather introduces a great deal of uncertainty to
   weather-sensitive construction activities, resulting in project
   schedules that deviate from plans. To maximize construction process

   Faced with winter weather uncertainty in cold regions, this task becomes
   quite challenging. This paper follows the framework that was proposed in
   the literature for simulating weather-sensitive construction projects
   executed under cold weather conditions. In the literature, the authors
   applied the framework steps to enable simulating and planning pipeline
   construction activities under severe cold weather. The proposed
   framework sets out a work breakdown structure of activities to account
   for and quantify weather impact on the project schedule. The steps
   outlined in the framework are followed to enable simulating and planning
   tunnelling construction activities executed under severe cold weather
   conditions. Relevant simulation findings, which clarify the impact of
   cold weather events on construction projects and can assist in project
   planning and decision support, are reported.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment of decentralized control systems: An iterative
   approach}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{252-263}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, an efficient approach for performance assessment of
   decentralized control systems based on a general quadratic performance
   index involving both system states and inputs is proposed. The
   performance assessment problem is formulated as an optimization problem
   subject to constraints in the form of linear/bilinear matrix
   inequalities which explicitly take the block-diagonal structural
   constraint on decentralized control systems into account. In order to
   solve the optimization problem efficiently, an iterative approach based
   on the original optimization problem and an equivalent transformation of
   the original one is proposed. Specifically, the proposed approach under
   the assumption that the full state feedback is available is first
   presented; and then the approach is extended to the case that only
   output feedback is available. The proposed approach solves for both the
   best achievable performance and the corresponding controller (and
   observer) gains. The application of the proposed approach to two
   examples including a reactor separator chemical process example
   illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In nonrigid image registration, similarity measures including spatial
   information have been shown to perform better than those measures
   without spatial information. In this work, we provide new insight to the
   relationships among regional mutual information, regional probability
   distribution functions (PDFs) and global PDFs, and propose a novel
   nonrigid registration scheme with spatially weighted global probability
   distribution function (SWGPDF). Similarity measures based on SWGPDF
   (SWGPDFSM) are constructed. Three different spatial sub-region division
   methods are compared: the equally spaced sub-region (ESSR), the local
   binary pattern sub-region (LBPSR) and the gradient sub-region (GSR). The
   registration scheme applies B-spline based free form deformations (FFDs)
   as the transformation model. A Parzen window and linear interpolation
   are used to construct histograms. The SWGPDFSM registration scheme with
   ESSR space division is compared with the traditional global mutual
   information (gMI), the traditional global normalized mutual information
   (gNMI), regional mutual information and the SWGPDFSM with LBPSR or GSR
   space division. The test results show that SWGPDFSM scheme with ESSR
   space division outperforms the other schemes for elastically aligning
   images in the presence of big geometrical transformations, bias fields
   and illumination changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved,}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{131-143}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A new hybrid analytical/numerical model that describes the formation of
   structured microparticles from evaporating microdroplets is presented.
   It is applicable when diffusion and surface recession are the main
   mechanisms of mass transport in the droplets. The model accounts for the
   transient nature of the solute concentration profiles during the
   evaporation process and thereby extends previously published models to
   particle formation processes in which the droplet surface recession rate
   is much faster than the diffusion in the droplets, i.e., in cases with
   large Peclet numbers. Furthermore, the model is useful when the initial
   concentration of solutes in the droplets is close to saturation. The
   model also predicts the dry particle diameter, assuming a spherical
   particle, particle density, and aerodynamic diameter. For hollow
   particles formed at large Peclet numbers the shell thickness can be
   approximated. The model is capable of predicting the radial distribution
   of the components in the final dry particle in the case of
   multi-component formulations. The results of the model were recast in a
   simple analytical form, which can be used in particle design without the
   need for numerical tools. Predictions of the model were found to be in
   good agreement with numerical and experimental results in the
   literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{172-180}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flotation recovery and selectivity problems have been reported in the
   flotation of fine sulphide minerals in gypsum supersaturated process
   water. In this study, the effect of gypsum supersaturated solution on
   the interactions between silica and sphalerite (ZnS) minerals was
   examined by observing deposition behaviour of silica nanoparticles on
   sphalerite surface using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   (QCM-D). Significant deposition of silica nanoparticles on ZnS coated
   sensor surface was observed in the gypsum supersaturated solution,
   indicating consequential slime coating of silica fines on sphalerite
   mineral surface. Substantial deposition of silica nanoparticles on SiO2
   coated surface was also observed suggesting strong homo-aggregation of
   silica fines in the gypsum supersaturated solution. The interaction
   behaviour between silica-sphalerite and silica-silica is mainly
   attributed to the high calcium concentration of the gypsum
   supersaturated solution. Similar deposition behaviour of silica
   nanoparticles onto ZnS or SiO2 coated sensor surface was observed in 800
   ppm calcium solution, which is similar to the calcium concentration of
   the gypsum supersaturated solution. Colloidal force measurement between
   a silica particle and a fractured sphalerite surface or a silica wafer
   surface by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed attractive van der
   Waals force between the mineral particles in both gypsum supersaturated
   solution and 800 ppm calcium solution. The high calcium concentration of
   the gypsum supersaturated solution induced the hetero-aggregation
   between silica and sphalerite, accounting for the observed decrease in
   flotation selectivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we assess future water demands for the agricultural
   (irrigation and livestock), energy (electricity generation, primary
   energy production and processing), industrial (manufacturing and
   mining), and municipal sectors, by incorporating water demands into a
   technologically-detailed global integrated assessment model of energy,
   agriculture, and climate change - the Global Change Assessment Model
   (GCAM). Base-year water demands - both gross withdrawals and net
   consumptive use - are assigned to specific modeled activities in a way
   that maximizes consistency between bottom-up estimates of water demand
   intensities of specific technologies and practices, and top-down
   regional and sectoral estimates of water use. The energy, industrial,
   and municipal sectors are represented in fourteen geopolitical regions,
   with the agricultural sector further disaggregated into as many as
   eighteen agro-ecological zones (AEZs) within each region. We assess
   future water demands representing six socioeconomic scenarios, with no
   constraints imposed by future water supplies. The scenarios observe
   increases in global water withdrawals from 3710 km(3) year(-1) in 2005
   to 6195-8690 km(3) year(-1) in 2050, and to 4869-12,693 km(3) year(-1)
   in 2095. Comparing the projected total regional water withdrawals to the
   historical supply of renewable freshwater, the Middle East exhibits the
   highest levels of water scarcity throughout the century, followed by
   India; water scarcity increases over time in both of these regions. In
   contrast, water scarcity improves in some regions with large base-year
   electric sector withdrawals, such as the USA and Canada, due to capital
   stock turnover and the almost complete phase-out of once-through flow
   cooling systems. The scenarios indicate that: 1) water is likely a
   limiting factor in meeting future water demands, 2) many regions can be
   expected to increase reliance on non-renewable groundwater, water reuse,
   and desalinated water, but they also highlight an important role for
   development and deployment of water conservation technologies and
   practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   stratification that develops due to architectural exchange flow}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{33-46}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{When a common rectangular barrier between two zones with slightly
   different densities is partially removed mimicking the sudden opening of
   a door, a two-layer exchange flow develops and two qualitatively
   different, though highly coupled, kinds of flow are observed to either
   side of the barrier. In the zone that initially contained the dense
   fluid, a buoyant plume ascends resulting, over time, in a vertical
   density stratification through a filling-box process. Depending on the
   geometric parameters two scenarios are possible. Either the terminal
   position of the first front lies above the bottom of the barrier, or it
   lies below. Special attention is devoted to the latter case, which is
   favored for large doorway heights and when the zone that initially
   contains the dense fluid is comparatively small in volume. The
   associated complications are (i) the nature of the exchange flow changes
   once the downward-propagating first front surpasses the bottom of the
   barrier, and, (ii) the terminal stratification in the zone that
   initially contains the light fluid contains an intermediate layer in
   which the density varies continuously with height. We also present a
   model that presumes that both zones remain well-mixed. Similitude
   experiments help to identify the limitations of both categories of
   analytical models discussed above. The implications of our results on
   the design of buildings that exploit heat gains by attached solaria are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the supercritical spreading of radial flow in a
   horizontal basin indicates that the variation of depth, velocity, and
   Froude number normalized by corresponding inlet values becomes
   independent of the inlet Froude number F0 when F0>5, both for inviscid
   and viscous flows. Assuming a linear variation of the hydrostatic
   pressure force along the hydraulic jump, a generalized equation for the
   sequent depth ratio is developed, which is valid for the free and
   submerged jumps both in radial and rectangular basins. This is simpler
   than existing equations and is verified with experimental data available
   in the literature. A new scale is proposed such that the sequent depth
   ratio for different F0 and the radius ratio collapse into a single line.
   A procedure to approximately locate the position of a free radial jump
   and determine the type of the jump is also described.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins with long disordered regions (LDRs), defined as having 30 or
   more consecutive disordered residues, are abundant in eukaryotes, and
   these regions are recognized as a distinct class of biologically
   functional domains. LDRs facilitate various cellular functions and are
   important for target selection in structural genomics. Motivated by the
   lack of methods that directly predict proteins with LDRs, we designed
   Super-fast predictor of proteins with Long Intrinsically DisordERed
   regions (SLIDER). SLIDER utilizes logistic regression that takes an
   empirically chosen set of numerical features, which consider selected
   physicochemical properties of amino acids, sequence complexity, and
   amino acid composition, as its inputs. Empirical tests show that SLIDER
   offers competitive predictive performance combined with low
   computational cost. It outperforms, by at least a modest margin, a
   comprehensive set of modern disorder predictors (that can indirectly
   predict LDRs) and is 16 times faster compared to the best currently
   available disorder predictor. Utilizing our time-efficient predictor, we
   characterized abundance and functional roles of proteins with LDRs over
   110 eukaryotic proteomes. Similar to related studies, we found that
   eukaryotes have many (on average 30.3\%) proteins with LDRs with
   majority of proteomes having between 25 and 40\%, where higher abundance
   is characteristic to proteomes that have larger proteins. Our
   first-of-its-kind large-scale functional analysis shows that these
   proteins are enriched in a number of cellular functions and processes
   including certain binding events, regulation of catalytic activities,
   cellular component organization, biogenesis, biological regulation, and
   some metabolic and developmental processes. A webserver that implements
   SLIDER is available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/SLIDER/.Proteins

Abstract = {{Processing an increasing volume of data, especially in industrial and
   manufacturing domains, calls for advanced tools of data analysis.
   Knowledge discovery is a process of analyzing data from different
   perspectives and summarizing the results into some useful and
   transparent findings. To address such challenges, a thorough extension
   and generalization of well-known techniques such as regression analysis
   becomes essential and highly advantageous. In this paper, we extend the
   concept of regression models so that they can handle hybrid data coming
   from various sources which quite often exhibit diverse levels of data
   quality. The major objective of this study is to develop a sound vehicle
   of a hybrid data analysis, which helps in reducing the computing time,
   especially in cases of real-time data processing. We propose an
   efficient real-time fuzzy switching regression analysis based on a
   genetic algorithm-based fuzzy C-means associated with a convex
   hull-based fuzzy regression approach. The method enables us to deal with
   situations when one has to deal with heterogeneous data which were
   derived from various database sources (distributed databases). In the
   proposed design, we emphasize a pivotal role of the convex hull
   approach, which is essential to alleviate the limitations of linear
   programming when being used in modeling of real-time systems. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose an analytic approach to coordinate distributed
   model predictive control (MPC) systems that are subject to equality
   constraints. The main idea behind the coordinated distributed model
   predictive (CDMPC) is to improve the performance of an existing
   decentralized control system with a minor modification applied to the
   existing distributed control system. As such, the enhancement can be
   interpreted as a bilevel optimization problem, which consists of
   modified local controllers and a coordination level that ensures optimal
   centralized behavior of the plant. The modification to the decentralized
   MPC controllers would be equivalent to relaxing local versions of the
   overall interaction constraint using a price vector to penalize
   violations. In the proposed price-driven CDMPC scheme, local variables
   are parameterized in terms of the price vector. As a result, an analytic
   closed-loop solution to the optimal price vector can be developed. The
   effectiveness of the proposed CDMPC is illustrated using a chemical
   process example.}},

Abstract = {{In the identification of switched Auto-Regressive eXogenous (SARX)
   models, the number of local models is often assumed to be known a
   priori. However, in many industrial applications the prior process
   knowledge or the available information about the plant operation might
   not be sufficient to determine the number of local models. In such
   cases, the optimal number of local models needs to be inferred from
   collected operational data. The switching mechanism of the process is
   also often unknown. Therefore, classical SARX identification methods
   assuming a piecewise affine system fail to accurately identify randomly
   switched models. Furthermore, classical identification methods result in
   single-point estimates of unknown parameters, thereby ignoring the
   parameter uncertainty. The main objective of this work is to formulate
   and solve the problem of SARX model identification under the variational
   Bayesian framework through which the aforementioned challenging issues
   can be addressed. As a full Bayesian system identification approach, the
   proposed method not only provides a posterior distribution over model
   parameters to reveal the level of uncertainty of the estimated values,
   but also determines the optimal number of local models automatically.
   Since the identification pair identity at each sampling instant can be
   inferred from the data set, the switching mechanism will not influence
   the identification results. The effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian
   approach is demonstrated through a simulation case study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the vibration properties of a planetary gear
   set. A two-dimensional lumped mass model is developed to simulate the
   vibration signals of a planetary gear set in the perfect and crack

   individual component can be simulated, including the vibration signals
   of the sun gear, each planet gear, and the ring gear. By incorporating
   the effect of transmission path, resultant vibration signals of the
   gearbox at the transducer location are obtained. Results show obvious
   fault symptoms in the signals of an individual component, such as the
   sun gear. After going through the transmission path, amplitude
   modulation is shown in the resultant vibration signals. When there is a
   crack on a sun gear tooth, a large amount of sidebands appears in the
   vibration spectrum. The locations of these sidebands are investigated
   and identified, which are helpful for fault detection.}},

Abstract = {{Power from some renewable energy sources can be highly variable and
   difficult to predict, which in turn can lead to fluctuations in produced
   power. These fluctuations may lead to a decrease in the power quality,
   which may be mitigated, or its impact lessened by foreknowledge of its
   occurrence. In order to relate quality of power produced from small
   scale renewable energy installations to the meteorological values that
   drive them, a number of different prediction methods are used. Data from
   an experimental, small scale, residential installation, which includes
   photovoltaic and wind power, are used to build the models, which are
   then used to estimate the values of short and long term flicker
   severity, as well as the total harmonic distortion of voltage. Forecast
   horizons of one and ten minutes were considered. Estimates for long term
   flicker severity and total harmonic distortion of voltage were better
   predicted than short term flicker severity, which had errors such that
   the predictions may be useful. The extreme learning machine method
   consistently performed well, however both it and other methods failed to
   capture sudden large spikes present in the data.}},

Abstract = {{During last few decades wind energy has become one of the fastest
   growing renewable sources. Recent research interest in wind power
   forecasting community is focused on wind ramps, sudden changes in wind
   power output. Conventional ramp prediction methods derive future ramp
   estimates from power forecast series. We suggest to analyze real wind
   power series or other weather parameters searching for specific patterns
   and dependencies signalizing forthcoming wind ramp event.
   In this paper, principal component analysis of wind speed time series is
   presented. Analyzed power production and wind speed data were collected
   from August 2011 to July 2012 on sample wind farm located close to
   Lethbridge, AB Canada. Sensitivity of analysis is defined by length of
   selected time frame. Frequency tables for first three principal
   components are used to evaluate conditional probability of forthcoming
   wind ramp event. Advantage of proposed methodology compared to
   conventional methods is that numerical weather prediction (NWP) model
   producing wind forecasts is not required.}},

Abstract = {{In smart grid, a huge amount of privacy data need to be transmitted
   securely and efficiently. Compressed sensing can be used to improve the
   transmission efficiency by exploiting the data sparsity, while this
   sparsity is usually destroyed by the encryption process, making
   compressed sensing inapplicable. A possible workaround is to perform
   compressed sensing first and then encrypt the compressed data. However,
   this two-step workaround lowers the efficiency. In this paper, we
   propose a novel data transmission scheme EncryCS. Compressed sensing in
   EncryCS provides security and simultaneously enhances the transmission
   efficiency in one step. The prerequisite of compressed sensing is to
   construct a measurement matrix satisfying the restricted isometry
   property that ensures the perfect recovery of the signal. To make the
   matrix secret and feasible, we generate it with a pseudorandom sequence
   generator. By using this matrix, EncryCS transforms a large amount of
   plaintext data into a small amount of ciphertext data. EncryCS is proven
   to possess a high security. Extensive simulations are performed based on
   the real-world data obtained from the PowerNet project at Stanford
   University. The results demonstrate that EncryCS can compress data by
   order of magnitude, and the transmitted data can be almost perfectly
   recovered.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an underlay cognitive relay network coexisting with a
   primary multicast network (e.g. digital television (TV) broadcasting
   network), in which secondary user (SU) transmissions are power
   constrained to limit the interference on any primary receiver in the
   network. The primary receivers and SU relays are randomly located due to
   irregular deployments and/or mobility and thus, their spatial
   distributions are modeled by two independent Poisson point processes
   (PPPs). In this paper, we analyze an opportunistic relaying scenario and
   develop a relay-selection scheme by considering the interference
   constraints on all the primary receivers in the network. We then
   analytically evaluate the relaying performance in terms of outage
   probability by using tools from stochastic geometry and point process
   theory, and finally compare the performance against that of direct
   communication. Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage
   probabilities of both the relay and direct links, along with their
   high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics.}},

Abstract = {{Performance analysis of the energy detector (ED) in fading channels has
   received enormous attention recently. However, averaging the generalized
   Marcum-Q function over fading statistics often results in complicated
   special functions and/or infinite series based expressions. Motivated by
   the need for simple expressions without compromising the accuracy, we
   propose a new representation for the probability density function (PDF)
   of the fading channel gain. This representation is then used to derive
   simple, unified expression for asymptotic miss-detection probability in
   closed-form. The derived expression is evaluated for several fading
   channels and antenna diversity schemes. Numerical results reveal its
   high accuracy over a wide range of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) (as low
   as 0 dB) unlike the existing asymptotic expression which is accurate
   only for high SNR regime (say, SNR >= 20 dB).}},

   The estimate is then used to optimize the expected system throughput by

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes how transmit power control affects the aggregate
   interference arising from a Poisson field of underlay cognitive radio
   (CR) transmitter nodes distributed in a finite area. We consider three
   per-user, location dependent power control schemes, when each CR
   transmitter is associated with the nearest CR receiver, where the CR
   receivers form a Poisson field in the entire 2-dimensional space. The 3
   schemes are based on: 1) CR transmitter-receiver distance r(c) 2) r(c)
   and a constant cut-off power level 3) r(c) and a random cut-off power
   level, respectively. For each of these, the exact moment generating
   function (MGF) and mean of aggregate interference power are derived. We
   also investigate the primary system outage due to aggregate
   interference. Rayleigh fading and exponential path loss links are
   assumed. Monte-Carlo simulation results validate our analysis and also
   show that the CR power thresholds and node densities significantly
   affect the aggregate interference.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cognitive transmission scheme for
   Amplify-and-Forward (AF) two-way relay networks (TWRNs) and investigate
   its joint sensing and transmission performance. Specifically, we derive
   the overall false alarm probability, the overall detection probability,
   the outage probability of the cognitive TWRN over Rayleigh fading
   channels. Furthermore, based on these probabilities, the spectrum hole
   utilization efficiency of the cognitive TWRN is defined and evaluated.
   It is shown that smaller individual or overall false alarm probability
   can result in less outage probability and thus larger spectrum hole
   utilization efficiency for cognitive TWRN, and also produce more
   interference to the primary users. Interestingly, it is found that given
   data rate, more transmission power for the cognitive TWRN does not
   necessarily obtain higher spectrum hole utilization efficiency.
   Moreover, our results show that a maximum spectrum hole utilization
   efficiency can be achieved through an optimal allocation of the time
   slots between the spectrum sensing and data transmission phases.
   Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate our proposed

Abstract = {{A pneumatic actuator with solenoid valves is a discontinuous-input
   system because each valve can be either in on or off state. For such an
   actuator, this paper proposes a sliding-mode control scheme based on an
   averaged continuous-input equivalent model for the open-loop system. The
   averaged model is obtained from the nonlinear dynamics of the open-loop
   discontinuous-input system undergoing pulse-width-modulation (PWM) at
   the input (i.e., valve open/close action). The PWM duty cycle will be
   regarded as a continuous input to the proposed averaged model, and thus
   generated by the proposed sliding-mode controller. By adjusting the PWM
   duty cycle, the controller switches between seven modes of operation of
   the open-loop system in order to select the ones with necessary and
   sufficient amounts of drive energy to achieve position tracking. We will
   show that this results in reduced position error and valve switching
   activity for the actuator. The proposed control scheme is experimentally
   used in the position control of a pneumatic actuator and the results are

Abstract = {{Beating-heart surgery is not currently possible for most surgical
   procedures as it requires superhuman skill to manually track the heart's
   motion while performing a surgical task. However, if a surgical tool
   could track the motion of the point of interest (POI) on the heart,
   then, with respect to the surgical tool tip the POI would appear
   stationary. Such a system can be created with a teleoperated surgical
   robot that is controlled to track the combination of the heart's and the
   surgeon's motion, as input through a separate user console. To develop
   such a system, the motion of the heart is found in ultrasound images
   where the image acquisition introduces delays of approximately 40 ms and
   image processing further increases this delay. Directly using this
   delayed position measurement in the feedback control loop can lead to
   instability and poor tracking. The generalized predictive controller
   used in this work compensates for this time delay despite large
   disturbances with velocities up to 210 mm/s and accelerations up to 3800
   mm/s 2 caused by the moving heart.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) will have a significant
   impact on the demand response (DR) in smart grids (SGs). How to
   encourage EV users to voluntarily join vehicle-to-grid (V2G) market has
   been one of the significant challenges to SGs engineers and scientists.
   On the other hand, dealing with the randomness of renewable distributed
   energy resources (DERs) output is critical for microgrids to maintain
   their efficiency and reliability. In this work, a distributed charging
   and discharging scheduling scheme (DCD) for EVs in microgrids is
   proposed to provide electric vehicle (EV) users with energy cost
   reduction while promoting the integration of renewable energy sources
   (RESs) by reducing the negative impact of highly intermittent
   characteristics of RESs. The comparison results based on the real
   measured renewable energy and load data show that the proposed scheme
   enables EVs to become promisingly important contributors to microgrids.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an underlay secondary network comprising of K
   transmitter-receiver pairs sharing the spectrum of a primary network,
   which is divided into n, non-overlapping frequency bands (subchannels).
   Each secondary pair can communicate over only one subchannel and should
   keep the interference generated to the primary network below a
   threshold. A decentralized multiple access algorithm is used by the
   secondary pairs to select a proper subchannel. We study the performance
   of a modified version of the medium access control (MAC) protocol
   proposed by Elkashlan et al., referred to as the general order selection
   algorithm. We obtain the statistics of the output signal-to-noise ratio
   of the algorithm, and the statistics of the achievable capacity per
   secondary pair. Closed form expressions for the outage probability,
   average bit error rate of the secondary users, and the aggregate
   throughput of the secondary network are derived. Assessment of the
   analytical work of this paper is done through comparisons with
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a possible and interesting manufacturing defect
   related to a clamping bolt endangered by lightning surge is simulated.
   The electric field stress distributions in the oil region around a
   defective clamping bolt used in the limbs of a Preventive
   Autotransformer (PA) is computed using 2D Finite Element (FE)-based
   software. Two scenarios of bolt were analyzed in this paper: 1) long tip
   metallic bolt, 2) metallic bolt without tip. The maximum field stress
   was computed in the oil ducts of the PA. The simulated results were
   compared with the critical field stress calculated from an analytical
   formula. The long tip metallic bolt revealed a possible dielectric
   breakdown in the oil ducts. To reduce the risk of potential failures,
   thermoplastic bolts were used instead. A thermoplastic bolt was analyzed
   and the results compared with those of the defective metallic bolt. It
   was shown that, the appropriate selection of clamping bolt materials in
   transformers can help avoiding/reducing the impact of manufacturing
   errors on the serviceability of power equipment.}},

Abstract = {{The Resource Description Framework (RDF) proposed as a part of Semantic

   methods for extraction of information and knowledge embedded in the RDF
   data. In the paper, we proposed a procedure to construct a model of data
   that has been experienced, i.e., discovered and collected, by software
   agents and systems. The process is based on processing previously
   constructed concepts of data. The model is represented as a hierarchy
   that contains definitions of concepts, their instances, as well as
   relations found in the data. Each concept definition is represented as a
   set of features. The features are relations between a given concept
   definition and definitions of other concepts. The proposed methodology
   allows for determining importance of features and their degrees of
   contribution to definitions. This reflects realistic, real-life
   connections and dependencies existing between generalized concepts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a self-tuning control scheme for local
   adjustment of water quality, through treatment by using Generalized
   Minimum-Variance Control (GMVC). It incorporates a self-tuning estimator
   with Recursive Extended Least-Squares (RELS) method to approximate the
   unknown parameters of a discrete-time single-input single-output local
   water quality model. The proposed self-tuning scheme can be implemented
   on-line to automatically tune the parameters and derive the controller
   using an indirect self-tuning procedure. When deriving the controller,
   the closed-loop tracking performance in achieving the desired level of
   the particular water quality parameter at the measured node is the
   primary consideration. Additionally, the influence of noise and
   disturbance on the local water quality model is considered. The good
   performances of the set-point tracking and disturbance rejection in the
   simulation examples show the effectiveness and reliability of the
   designed self-tuning controller in improving the local quality of water
   through automated water treatment.}},

   (SGs) and VSCs, and switching between grid-connected and islanded modes.
   To overcome these problems the concept of synchronous converters is
   introduced to facilitate a general framework for interfacing VSCs to
   smart grids with emulated inertia, generality for all operational modes,
   constant frequency and current and voltage regulation capacities
   augmented in one compact structure. The proposed controllers are also
   applicable to conventional SGs realizing a unified control strategy for
   all types of generation units. To integrate VSCs to power system with
   dc-link voltage regulation ability such as rectifiers, dc, and hybrid
   dc/ac grids concept of synchronous-VSC and hybrid dc/ac droop or
   equivalently dc-link vs. frequency droop is developed which provide a
   tool for bidirectional power flow from dc-link capacitor similar to a
   virtual rotor. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to
   validate the practicability of the controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Customer-oriented manufacturing competes on timely responses to customer
   requirements, and precise scheduling control for delivery. This
   challenge demands engineering design and production planning to be fully
   integrated via advanced enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This
   paper proposes a generic feature association method and a detailed
   framework that can unify product and process models in order to satisfy
   customer orders with small batch sizes and high variations. A conceptual
   solution is introduced by integrating two traditionally separate feature
   domains: design configuration features and manufacturing process
   features. To achieve the proposed method, a customer feature class is
   suggested for the characterization of customers' profiles related to the
   manufacturer. An instantiated customer feature object functionally
   tracks each customer's selection of product configurations related to
   its requirements, specific orders, and production schedules with dynamic
   associations to the live manufacturing capacity. With the new
   associative integration method, a preliminary order acceptance system
   (OAS) prototype system has been implemented within an ERP order
   management system and its conceptual structure model is demonstrated
   within a multi-facet feature framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Inertial sensing algorithms for long-term foot angle monitoring for

Abstract = {{When children walk on their toes for no known reason, the condition is
   called Idiopathic Toe Walking (ITW). Assessing the true severity of ITW
   can be difficult because children can alter their gait while under
   observation in clinic. The ability to monitor the foot angle during
   daily life outside of clinic may improve the assessment of ITW. A
   foot-worn, battery-powered inertial sensing device has been designed to
   monitor patients' foot angle during daily activities. The monitor
   includes a 3-axis accelerometer, 2-axis gyroscope, and a low-power
   microcontroller. The device is necessarily small, with limited battery
   capacity and processing power. Therefore a high-accuracy but
   low-complexity inertial sensing algorithm is needed. This paper compares
   several low-complexity algorithms' aptitude for foot-angle measurement:
   accelerometer-only measurement, finite impulse response (FIR) and
   infinite impulse response (IIR) complementary filtering, and a new
   dynamic predict-correct style algorithm developed using fuzzy c-means
   clustering. A total of 11 subjects each walked 20 m with the inertial
   sensing device fixed to one foot; 10 m with normal gait and 10 m
   simulating toe walking. A cross-validation scheme was used to obtain a
   low-bias estimate of each algorithm's angle measurement accuracy. The
   new predictcorrect algorithm achieved the lowest angle measurement
   error: < 58 mean error during normal and toe walking. The IIR
   complementary filtering algorithm achieved almost-as good accuracy with
   less computational complexity. These two algorithms seem to have good
   aptitude for the foot-angle measurement problem, and would be good
   candidates for use in a long-term monitoring device for toewalking
   assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   way, DC capacitor voltage overshoot problem can be avoided, which
   greatly improves the safety and reliability of the proposed power
   electronics. The paper presents the theory necessary to understand how
   to model AC bridge voltage trend under various motor loading conditions

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the identification problems of linear
   parameter varying (LPV) systems with randomly missing output data. Since
   one local linearized model cannot capture the global dynamics of the
   nonlinear industrial process, the multiple-model LPV model in which the
   global model is constructed by smoothly weighted combination of multiple
   local models is considered here. The problem of missing output variables
   data is commonly encountered in practice. In order to handle the
   multiple-model identification problems of LPV systems with incomplete
   data, the local model is taken to have a finite impulse response (FIR)
   model structure and the generalized expectation-maximization (EM)
   algorithm is adopted to estimate the unknown parameters of the global
   LPV model. To avoid the problems of ill conditioned matrices and high
   sensitivity of parameters to noise, the prior information on the
   coefficients of each local FIR model is employed to construct the prior
   probability of unknown parameters. Then the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
   estimates of the global model parameters are derived via the generalized
   EM algorithm. The numerical example is presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of biomass for production of liquid fuels can help in
   reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which are predominantly
   generated by combustion of fossil fuels. Adding oxymethylene ethers
   (OMEs) in conventional diesel fuel has the potential to reduce soot
   formation during the combustion in a diesel engine. OMEs are downstream
   products of syngas, which can be generated by the gasification of
   biomass. In this research, a thermodynamic analysis has been conducted
   through development of data intensive process models of all the unit
   operations involved in production of OMEs from biomass. Based on the
   developed model, the key process parameters affecting the OMEs
   production including equivalence ratio, H-2/CO ratio, and extra water
   flow rate were identified. This was followed by development of an
   optimal process design for high OMEs production. It was found that for a
   fluidized bed gasifier with heat capacity of 28 MW, the conditions for
   highest OMEs production are at an air amount of 317 tonne/day, at H-2/CO
   ratio of 2.1, and without extra water injection. At this level, the
   total OMEs production is 55 tonne/day (13 tonne/day OME3 and 9 tonne/day
   OME4). This model would further be used in a techno-economic assessment
   study of the whole biomass conversion chain to determine the most
   attractive pathways. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rock failure is observed around boreholes often with certain types of
   failure zones, which are called breakouts. Laboratory-scale drilling
   tests in some high-porosity quartz-rich sandstone have shown breakouts
   in the form of narrow localized compacted zones in the minimum
   horizontal stress direction. They are called fracture-like breakouts.
   Such compaction bands may affect hydrocarbon extraction by forming
   barriers that inhibit fluid flow and may also be a source of sand
   production. This paper presents the results of numerical simulations of
   borehole breakouts using 3D discrete element method to investigate the
   mechanism of the fracture-like breakouts and to identify the role of
   far-field stresses on the breakout dimensions. The numerical tool was
   first verified against analytical solutions. It was then utilized to
   investigate the failure mechanism and breakout geometry for drilled
   cubic rock samples of Castlegate sandstone subjected to different
   pre-existing far-field stresses. Results show that failure occurs in the
   zones of the highest concentration of tangential stress around the
   borehole. It is concluded that fracture-like breakout develops as a
   result of a nondilatant failure mechanism consisting of localized grain
   debonding and repacking and grain crushing that lead to the formation of
   a compaction band in the minimum horizontal stress direction. In
   addition, it is found that the length of fracture-like breakouts depends
   on both the mean stress and stress anisotropy. However, the width of the
   breakout is not significantly changed by the far-field stresses.

Abstract = {{Buried steel pipelines are one of the most efficient means of
   transporting oil and gas from their resource deposits to their markets.
   The pipeline industry is experiencing an increased demand for larger
   diameter pipelines along with the implementation of thinner walls and
   higher operating pressures.
   In these cases, the external pipeline loads have significant effect on
   the pipeline stresses and deformations, thus influencing wall thickness
   and associated cost effectiveness. The external loads are made up of the
   weight of the backfill material combined with live and impact loads due
   to traffic.
   For the designs of buried pipelines, API RP1102, CSA Z662, American
   Lifelines Alliance (ALA) ``Guidelines for the Design of Buried
   Pipelines{''}, ASCE ``Design and Installation of Buried Pipes{''} and
   AWWA Manual M11 are commonly used to calculate external loads on buried
   pipelines. For the calculation of backfill loads, these methods are
   based mainly on the same theory, i.e., Marston load theory, while the
   calculation of live load, due to traffic loads, is based on different
   approaches. Depending on the design methodology selected, there is a
   large variation in the calculated external loads due to both backfill
   and live loads. In this paper, the experimental results of a field
   monitoring program will be compared with the calculated results from the
   various methods. An alternative approach for calculating external loads
   is presented and verified to field studies.
   In addition, for the design of onshore pipelines the industry uses
   design criteria which are based on allowable stress and ovalization
   deformation limits. Pipe stresses and deformations resulting from the
   external loads are commonly based on the Spangler stress and the Iowa
   equations. The parameters in the formulas include pipe and soil
   properties, pipe-soil stiffness and the geometric relation of a pipe
   section during deformation. As pipe materials, pipe sizes, operating
   means and pipe coating techniques change over time, the allowable design
   criteria shall be re-examined, especially for the ovalization
   deformation limits. In this paper the allowable strain and the
   corresponding ovalization deformation limits are re-examined by
   reviewing experimental results and industrial requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Elbows are used frequently in pipeline systems. Manufacturing of elbows
   tends to cause the primary circular sections to ovalize. Ovalization
   intensifies when elbows are subjected to internal hoop pressure. The
   total ovality in elbows comprises both manufacturing and pressurization
   ovality. Elbows with oval cross sections under internal pressure tend to
   straighten. This effect is called the Bourdon Effect. If these effects
   are not taken into consideration, unanticipated deformations and higher
   stress levels could be present at the location of elbows.
   The Canadian oil and gas pipeline code (CSA Z662-11) has limited the
   ovality in elbows to 3 and 6 percent for progressive and non-progressive
   ovalizations, respectively. A mere imposition of two limits cannot
   determine the safety factor of pipeline. Also, consequences of using
   elbows with large ovality remain ambiguous as well. Understanding the
   influence of the Bourdon Effect and ovalization on the elbow design
   parameters is required.
   In this paper, the influence of the Bourdon Effect on the stress and
   ovalization developed in the elbows are investigated. Four Nominal Pipe
   Sizes (12, 24, 36, and 42) are selected. Elbows and straight pipe
   segments connected to them are analyzed using Finite Element Analysis.
   Geometric dimensions of actual scanned pipeline elbows are used to
   represent the actual situation in the field. Under the operating
   pressure, the maximum stress, ovality, and the Bourdon Effect in elbows
   for different elbow thicknesses and straight pipe lengths connected to
   the elbows are monitored.
   In addition, in this paper, the effect of the initial ovality was
   investigated for NPS 24 with constant straight pipe length. It was shown
   that the increase or decrease in the final ovality of the pipe is
   dependent on the initial ovality of the elbow cross section.}},

Abstract = {{Coating disbondment on pipelines is a common phenomenon that leads to
   exposure of the pipeline metal to ground water solutions, promoting a
   corrosive environment which is associated with stress corrosion cracking
   (SCC). This investigation aims to understand the corrosion behavior and
   rate of pipeline steel under coating disbondments of varying sizes based
   on field data and experimental studies. In the analysis of the field
   data, dig reports provided by a Canadian gas transportation company were
   analyzed for cases of anaerobic corrosion under tape coatings. The
   analyzed field data provided a correlation and between the tape coating
   disbondment size and corrosion rate found under the coating. The
   experimental studies aimed to understand the field findings. The
   analyses were performed on X-65 pipeline steel coupons placed in a
   vertical coupon holder with a PMMA shielding. To imitate the variation
   in the disbondment size, the gap size between the metal coupons and the
   shielding was varied (2 mm, 5 mm; and 10 mm, and infinite). The general
   corrosion rates were obtained through weight loss calculations. The
   experimental results were compared and correlated with dig-report data
   from the field for a development of cathodic protection and pipeline

Abstract = {{Pressure fluctuations are recognized as the driving force for the crack
   growth of pipeline steels in near-neutral pH environments; however, the
   crack growth mechanisms are still not fully understood. Difficulty in
   understanding the crack growth mechanisms is present due to two dilemmas
   between laboratory testing and field findings: high frequency study in
   the laboratory versus low frequency pressure fluctuations in the field;
   constant amplitude cyclic laboratory tests versus random pressure
   fluctuations in the actual spectra. To bridge the dilemmas, the crack
   growth behavior of X60 pipeline steel was investigated in near-neutral
   pH solution at frequencies as low as 1 x 10(-5) Hz under variable
   amplitude cyclic loading. Special attention was given to the loading
   scheme consisting of minor cycles with R ratios (minimum stress/maximum
   stress) as high as 0.9 and underloads with a relatively lower R ratio of
   0.5. It was found that the constant amplitude crack growth rate in
   near-neutral pH solution in the frequency region below 1 x 10(-3) Hz
   decreases with decreasing loading frequency, and it reaches a constant
   value at very low frequencies. This crack growth rate frequency relation
   is opposite of that found in the high loading-frequency regime, where
   crack growth rate was found to increase with decreasing loading
   frequency. Crack growth rate was observed to increase by a factor of up
   to 10 when the underload plus minor cycle loading scheme, as mentioned
   previously, was applied. Based on the findings obtained from the
   investigation, recommendations of pressure control were also made to
   minimize the crack growth during pipeline operation.}},

Abstract = {{Pipe elbow is a common feature in pipelines and piping systems as a
   means to changing directions of otherwise straight pipelines.
   Irrespective of the processes involved in manufacturing pipe elbows, it
   is of interest to investigate whether they have any geometric
   imperfections. Researchers at the University of Alberta have devised a
   technique to measure `initial imperfection of straight pipes prior to
   testing, using high resolution 3D surface profiler in conjunction with
   3D reverse engineering software. The objective of the current study is
   to extend the imperfections measurement technique from measuring
   straight pipe segments to pipe elbows. Six (6) ninety (90) degree elbows
   are measured in this research with outside diameters ranging from NPS 12
   inch to NPS 42 inch. A 3D laser scanner is used to acquire surface data
   and create 3D models corresponding to each elbow. A method for the
   geometric analysis of the elbows is developed using 3D inspection and
   reverse engineering software Geomagic. The geometric idealization of a
   pipe elbow is a torus, which can be defined by a circle revolving around
   an axis, coplanar with the circle. The idealized geometry for each elbow
   is obtained through the developed method of geometric analysis, which
   includes the diameter of the circle defining the torus, and its distance
   from the axis of revolution. The difference between the ideal torus and
   the scanned geometry is considered as imperfection of each pipe elbow.
   The wall thickness values at the ends or edges of select pipe elbows are
   also measured from the scanned data and are reported as percentage
   deviation from the specified wall thickness around the perimeter at
   different cross sections. The 3D reverse engineering of the elbows
   indicated that they resemble the ideal geometry very closely. The
   ovalization imperfections are seen to be well within the value specified
   by CSA Z662-11. The wall thickness deviations are seen to vary between
   -10\% to +25\% of the specified value, with increased thickness being
   more prominent in the elbows. Finite element analysis of an elbow with
   thickness imperfection shows that higher hoop stress appears on the
   intrados than initially intended.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of crack speed on dynamic fracture toughness of pipeline
   steel has been observed in some recent tests, although it is still a
   challenge to obtain a specific relationship between dynamic fracture
   toughness and crack speed due to the expensive costs of experiments.
   Meanwhile, the understanding of the dependence of fracture toughness on
   crack speed is critical for material selection and crack-arrest design
   in high-strength steel pipelines. The present work develops a strain
   rate-dependent cohesive zone model and related finite element model to
   analyze speed-dependent dynamic fracture of pipeline steels observed in
   recent drop weight tear tests. Different than most of existing cohesive
   zone models, the traction-separation law of the present model considers
   the role of rate of separation, and a strain rate dependent
   elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model is employed for the bulk
   material. The speed-dependences of crack-tip opening angle (CTOA) and
   energy dissipation observed in experiments are reproduced in our
   simulations for crack speed up to 150 m/s. A remarkable feature of the
   present work is that the present rate-dependent model can predict
   speed-dependent fracture as a consequence of the strain rate effect even
   when all fixed material parameters are speed-independent. These results
   suggest that the strain rate effect in the bulk material could be
   largely responsible for the speed-dependent dynamic fracture of pipeline
   steels, and the present rate-dependent model could be used to simulate
   dynamic fracture of pipeline steels especially when experiments are
   difficult or too expensive.}},

Abstract = {{Cold bending is applied at locations where the pipeline direction has to
   be changed in a horizontal or vertical plane. The process of cold
   bending usually results in residual stresses as well as changes in the
   material properties at the vicinity of the cold bend location which
   makes the study of the mechanical behaviour of cold bends indispensable.
   Due to discontinuous permafrost in arctic regions as well as slope
   instabilities and earthquakes cold bends within pipelines constructed in
   such locations can be subjected to significant tensile or compressive
   forces.
   Experimental Studies were carried out by Sen et al {[}1]{[}2]{[}3]in
   order to investigate the buckling behaviour of pressurized cold bends.
   In these experiments the curvature of the cold bend is increased in the
   presence of a constant internal pressure. In their experimental study a
   total of 8 full scale tests were conducted with a variety of pipe
   diameters, diameter to wall thickness ratio and steel grade. In this set
   of full scale tests one of the pipes with grade X65 failed due to
   fracture at the extrados after buckling and formation of wrinkles at the
   intrados {[}1].
   Our previous work {[}4], {[}5] on this subject showed the simulations of
   this case using finite element analysis. These simulations demonstrated
   that indeed pipe body tensile side fracture can be observed for this
   particular pipe specification. Whereby the tension side fractures are
   expected starting from a specific internal pressure level. The
   simulation results showed that the equivalent plastic strain values at
   the cold bend extrados increase dramatically starting from a certain
   level of applied curvature in load cases with an internal pressure
   higher than a transition value. In this paper the effect of steel grade
   on this transition from compressive to tensile failure is investigated.
   Parametric studies are conducted for the entire range of steel grades
   tested in the experimental study of Sen et al. It is found that there is
   a linear proportionality between the steel grade and the transition
   internal pressure for steel grades between X60 and X80.}},

Abstract = {{Pipelines can be subjected to significant amounts of tensile forces due
   to geotechnical movements like slope instabilities and seismic
   activities as well as due to frost heave and thaw cycles in arctic
   regions. The tensile strain capacity (epsilon(crit)(t) of pipelines is
   crucial in the prediction of rupture and loss of containment capability
   in these load cases. Currently the Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems code CSA
   Z662-11 0 contains equations for the prediction of Efrit as a function
   of geometry and material properties of the pipeline. These equations
   resulted from extensive experimental and numerical studies carried out
   by Wang et al {[}2]-{[}6] using curved wide plate tests on pipes having
   grades X65 and higher. Verstraete et al 0 conducted curved wide plate
   tests at the University of Ghent which also resulted in tensile strain
   capacity prediction methods and girth weld flaw acceptability criteria.
   These criteria are included in the European Pipeline Research Group
   (EPRG) Tier 2 guidelines. Furthermore Verstrate et al 0 introduced a
   pressure correction factor of 0.5 in order to include the effect of
   internal pressure in the tensile strain capacity predictions in a
   conservative way. Further research by Wang et al with full scale pipes
   having an internal pressure factor of 0.72 also showed that Efrit
   decreases in the presence of internal pressure {[}10]{[}15]. In their
   work, Wang et al presented a clear methodology for the design of full
   scale experiments and numerical simulations to study the effect of
   internal pressure on the tensile strain capacity of pipes with girth
   weld flaws {[}10]-{[}15] However, there has been limited testing to
   enable a precise understanding of the tensile strain capacity of pipes
   with grades less than X65 as a function of girth weld flaw sizes and the
   internal pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate forecasts of weather conditions are of the utmost importance
   for the management and operation of renewable energy sources with
   intermittent (stochastic) production. With the growing amount of
   intermittent energy sources, the need for precise weather predictions
   increases. Production of energy from renewable power sources, such as
   wind and solar, can be predicted using numerical weather prediction
   models. These models can provide high-resolution, localized forecast of
   wind speed and solar irradiation. However, different instances of
   numerical weather prediction models may provide different forecasts,
   depending on their properties and parameterizations. To alleviate this
   problem, it is possible to employ multiple models and to combine their
   outputs to obtain more accurate localized forecasts. This work uses the
   machine-learning tool of Support Vector Regression to amalgamate
   downward short-wave radiation forecasts of several numerical weather
   prediction models. Results of SVR-based multi-model forecasts of
   irradiation at a large set of locations show a significant improvement

Abstract = {{Remote environmental monitoring systems require effective energy
   management to allow reliable long-term operation without frequent
   maintenance to replace or recharge batteries. To design and analyze
   relevant energy management strategies, we have developed Simulink-based
   models of a recently constructed monitoring device to evaluate its
   potential performance. The model uses long-term solar energy data from
   two locations, Chamela, Mexico, and Fairview, Canada, to estimate the
   energy harvesting capabilities of the device. Using the simulator, we
   have developed and evaluated a fuzzy energy management strategy that
   determines how the device should operate to match the solar energy
   profile in each location. Solar energy in Chamela, Mexico is abundant
   and consistent so an energy harvesting remote monitoring device could
   have a high activity level without risking device failure. Fairview,
   Canada, has limited solar resources in the winter but plenty in the
   summer; a device dependent upon this energy source must adapt its
   activity level to match energy availability or risk running out of
   energy. While the simulated device in Mexico outperforms the one in
   Canada, both succeed in matching the available environmental resources
   and largely avoid energy related device failure. In the future, their
   performance can be improved by optimizing the designed strategies and
   further improving the details of the simulation.}},

   (PERT) simulation, the occurrence of uncertain events is represented by
   probability distributions for activity durations in an implicit fashion.
   In this paper, a bi-level project simulation methodology is proposed to
   (1) determine the optimal resource quantities and activity times for
   each work package and (2) estimate total project duration and man-hour
   budget at the upper level for project planning through Monte Carlo
   simulation, based on defining a limited quantity of likely scenarios for
   each work package. An industrial plant shutdown and turnaround project
   serves as case study to illustrate application of the proposed
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In a steel fabrication shop, jobs from different clients and projects
   are generally processed simultaneously in order to streamline processes,
   improve resource utilization, and achieve cost-effectiveness in serving
   multiple concurrent steel-erection sites. Reliable quantity takeoff on
   each job and accurate estimate of shop fabrication man-hour requirements
   are crucial to plan and control fabrication operations and resource
   allocation on the shop floor. Building information modeling (BIM), is
   intended to integrate multifaceted characteristics of a building
   facility, but finds its application in structural steel fabrication
   largely limited to design and drafting. This research focuses on
   extending BIM's usage further to the planning and control phases in
   steel fabrication. Using data extracted from BIM-based models, a linear
   regression model is developed to provide the man-hour requirement
   estimate for a particular job. Actual data collected from a steel
   fabrication company was used to train and validate the model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper specifies the configuration of a harvester for absorbing
   energy from ambient oscillation with broadband frequencies. Two major
   methodologies for broadband harvesting have been developed, one is the
   use of a nonlinear oscillator, and the other is the use of multiple
   resonators. We focus on the traditional way of assembling multiple
   resonators but suggest some nontrivial improvements in the
   configuration. In order to make a variety of resonant frequencies,
   resonators can be connected in series, in the form of a tree-like
   structure. The energy absorption of the tree configuration harvester
   under broadband frequency excitation is tested, and additionally the
   placement of multiple resonators is also considered. The numerical
   results indicate that our proposal of the tree configuration might be
   useful under broadband frequency excitation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the dynamic modeling and simulation of the AIRBUS
   A380 wing. The governing equations of motion which describe the
   vibrational motion of the wing were derived using the extended
   Hamilton's principle. The elastic wing structure is assumed to follow a
   Bernoulli-Euler cantilever beam clamped on the moving fuselage and
   carrying two Trent-900 engines on its span which were treated as lumped
   masses. The obtained equations of motion of the wing model were analyzed
   by means of the unconstrained modal analysis and the system natural
   frequencies were estimated. In order to verify the obtained results, the
   dynamic response was simulated using the Finite Element (FE)
   computational software by which the vibrational response was generated
   under several types of excitation. The obtained results showed good
   match between the natural frequencies extracted from the mathematical
   model and the corresponding ones generated by FE simulation. Also the
   developed computational model in this investigation was found successful
   in capturing the vibrational motions of a wide spectrum of relevant
   aerodynamic and unbalance loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of K2CO3 with ash-free coal in N-2 or CO2 atmospheres
   were studied at 700 degrees C by thermogravimetry and in situ X-ray
   diffraction. Upon heating in a N-2 atmosphere, K2CO3 influenced the
   pyrolysis of the ash-free coal by reducing the temperature from 320 to
   240 degrees C at which the maximum rate of devolatilization occurred. At
   650 degrees C, the devolatilization of ash-free coal was finished.
   However, ash-free coal mixed with K2CO3 exhibited a further weight
   decrease due to the release of CO from the carbonate while heating in
   N-2 at 700 degrees C. In this step, the potassium catalyst was reduced
   to a -COK and/or -CK surface complex, which might be the active species
   in the catalytic gasification process. In situ X-ray diffraction
   analysis also suggested that K2CO3 does not exist in inert gas (N-2) and
   gasification (CO2) atmospheres at 700 degrees C. At this temperature,
   the evaporation of potassium is negligible. A faster CO2 gasification
   rate was achieved by holding the sample (ash-free coal mixed with K2CO3)
   for 150 min at 700 degrees C in N-2 prior to switching to the reaction
   gas, compared with no holding time. This result indicates that catalyst
   reduction is necessary for a fast char conversion and also shows that
   the reaction gas (i.e., CO2) itself inhibits the reduction process. (C)

Abstract = {{Several studies of Web server workloads have hypothesized that these
   workloads are self-similar. The explanation commonly advanced for this
   phenomenon is that the distribution of Web server requests may be
   heavy-tailed. However, there is another possible explanation:
   self-similarity can also arise from deterministic, chaotic processes. To
   our knowledge, this possibility has not previously been investigated,
   and so existing studies on Web workloads lack an adequate comparison
   against this alternative. We conduct an empirical study of workloads
   from two different Web sites: one public university, and one private
   company, using the largest datasets that have been described in the
   literature. Our study employs methods from nonlinear time series
   analysis to search for chaotic behavior in the web logs of these two
   sites. While we do find that the deterministic components (i.e. the
   well-known ``weekend effect{''}) are significant components in these
   time series, we do not find evidence of chaotic behavior. Predictive
   modeling experiments contrasting heavy-tailed with deterministic models
   showed that both approaches were equally effective in modeling our
   datasets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have appeared as a promising technology
   for a wide variety of potential commercial applications to lessen the
   urgency of energy shortage and environmental pollution associated with
   using conventional fossil fuels. Among the worldwide SOFCs research
   activities, the progress of SOFCs fed with hydrocarbon fuels that
   contain trace amount of H2S is one of the most important research
   directions. Thereby, it becomes crucial to design novel electrode
   materials with enhanced catalytic activity, stability and tolerances to
   carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning. La-substituted SrTiO3 (LST)
   based perovskite anodes have been widely investigated because of their
   high electronic conductivity in reducing atmospheres, excellent
   dimensional and chemical stability upon redox cycling and outstanding
   sulfur and coking tolerances. In this review paper, we will describe the
   development of LST-based anode materials for SOFCs in recent years. The
   synthesis, structure and fuel cell performance of the doped LST and
   LST-based composite anode materials are summarized in detail. The
   mechanism of H2S-induced enhancement effect for electrochemical
   reactions on the LST-based anode materials is explored. The challenges
   related to the future developments of LST-based anode materials for

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on selective maintenance for multi-state
   series-parallel systems with economically dependent components. In the
   selective maintenance problem, the maintenance manager has to decide
   which components should receive maintenance activities within a finite
   break between missions. All the system reliabilities in the next
   operating mission, the available budget and the maintenance time for
   each component from its current state to a higher state are taken into
   account in the optimization models. In addition, the components in
   series-parallel systems are considered to be economically dependent.
   Time and cost savings will be achieved when several components are
   simultaneously repaired in a selective maintenance strategy. As the
   number of repaired components increases, the saved time and cost will
   also increase due to the share of setting up between components and
   another additional reduction amount resulting from the repair of
   multiple identical components. Different optimization models are derived
   to find the best maintenance strategy for multi-state series-parallel
   systems. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization models.
   The decision makers may select different components to be repaired to
   different working states based on the maintenance objective, resource
   availabilities and how dependent the repair time and cost of each
   component are. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The highly diversified conceptual and algorithmic landscape of Granular
   Computing calls for the formation of sound fundamentals of the
   discipline, which cut across the diversity of formal frameworks (fuzzy
   sets, sets, rough sets) in which information granules are formed and
   processed. The study addresses this quest by introducing an idea of
   granular models - generalizations of numeric models that are formed as a
   result of an optimal allocation (distribution) of information
   granularity. Information granularity is regarded as a crucial design
   asset, which helps establish a better rapport of the resulting granular
   model with the system under modeling. A suite of modeling situations is
   elaborated on; they offer convincing examples behind the emergence of
   granular models. Pertinent problems showing how information granularity
   is distributed throughout the parameters of numeric functions (and
   resulting in granular mappings) are formulated as optimization tasks. A
   set of associated information granularity distribution protocols is
   discussed. We also provide a number of illustrative examples. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Pulse-width-modulated (PWM) voltage-source converters (VSCs) are gaining
   widespread acceptance in modern power systems. It has been shown
   recently that full-scale high-power PWM VSCs can induce negative
   electrical damping at subsynchronous frequencies. However, active
   reshaping of the VSC incremental output impedance to minimize the
   negative impacts of a VSC on subsynchronous damping is not reported. To
   fill out this gap, this paper presents: 1) an extended analysis of the
   output impedance of a PWM-based two-level VSC; and 2) more importantly,
   three simple and robust active reshaping techniques to maximize the
   positive electrical damping in the subsynchronous frequencies without
   affecting the converter control performance. The first reshaping
   technique uses the grid voltage and an active-damping controller to
   generate active impedance that modifies the VSC impedance in the
   subsynchronous range. The second reshaping technique uses an internal
   active damping controller to modify the dynamics of the phase-locked
   loop, which has significant contribution to the negative impedance of
   the VSC. The third reshaping technique combines the first and second
   techniques. The proposed active mitigation methods show excellent
   performance in reshaping the VSC impedance and inducing positive
   electrical damping to mitigate possible subsynchronous interactions
   between the VSC and the power network. Further, the proposed
   compensators show robust control performance at different output power
   levels of the VSC without significant impact on the converter control
   performance. A theoretical analysis and comparative time-domain
   simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the validity
   and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The common-mode voltage (CMV) produced from a converter system is a
   source of many problems, e.g., in the motor drive system, CMV might
   appear at the neutral point of the motor stator windings with respect to
   the ground and induce destructive bearing current. Reduced CMV
   space-vector modulation (RCMV SVM) methods have been proposed in both
   voltage-source converter (VSC) and current-source converter (CSC)
   systems. The available RCMV SVMs reduce the CMV by avoiding using
   zero-state vectors. However, this will lead to some negative effects,
   such as shrink of modulation index range, increase of switching
   frequencies, bipolar line-to-line voltage pulse patterns in VSCs, and
   power quality performance deterioration. In this paper, a RCMV SVM
   method for CSCs is proposed. By allowing the use of zero-state vectors,
   the proposed RCMV SVM still produces much lower CMV. However, its other
   performance indices, such as switching frequency and harmonic
   performance, are unaffected and comparable to the conventional SVMs. The
   effectiveness of the proposed RCMV SVM for CSCs is verified in the
   simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The vapour-liquid-solid glancing angle deposition (VLS-GLAD) process is
   capable of producing complex nanotree structures with control over
   azimuthal branch orientation and height. We have developed a thin film
   growth simulation including ballistic deposition, simplified surface
   diffusion, and droplet-mediated cubic crystal growth for the VLS-GLAD
   process using the Unreal (TM) Development Kit. The use of a commercial
   game engine has provided an interactive environment while allowing a
   custom physics implementation. Our simulation's output is verified
   against experimental data, including a volumetric film reconstruction
   produced using focused ion beam and scanning-electron microscopy (SEM),
   crystallographic texture, and morphological characteristics such as
   branch orientation. We achieve excellent morphological and texture
   agreement with experimental data, as well as qualitative agreement with
   SEM imagery. The simplified physics in our model reproduces the
   experimental films, indicating that the dominant role flux geometry
   plays in the VLS-GLAD competitive growth process responsible for
   azimuthally oriented branches and biaxial crystal texture evolution. The
   simulation's successful reproduction of experimental data indicates that

Title = {{Multiple time step molecular dynamics in the optimized isokinetic
   ensemble steered with the molecular theory of solvation: Accelerating
   with advanced extrapolation of effective solvation forces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{We develop efficient handling of solvation forces in the multiscale
   method of multiple time step molecular dynamics (MTS-MD) of a
   biomolecule steered by the solvation free energy (effective solvation
   forces) obtained from the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation
   (three-dimensional reference interaction site model complemented with
   the Kovalenko-Hirata closure approximation). To reduce the computational
   expenses, we calculate the effective solvation forces acting on the
   biomolecule by using advanced solvation force extrapolation (ASFE) at
   inner time steps while converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations only
   at large outer time steps. The idea of ASFE consists in developing a
   discrete non-Eckart rotational transformation of atomic coordinates that
   minimizes the distances between the atomic positions of the biomolecule
   at different time moments. The effective solvation forces for the
   biomolecule in a current conformation at an inner time step are then
   extrapolated in the transformed subspace of those at outer time steps by
   using a modified least square fit approach applied to a relatively small
   number of the best force-coordinate pairs. The latter are selected from
   an extended set collecting the effective solvation forces obtained from
   3D-RISM-KH at outer time steps over a broad time interval. The MTS-MD
   integration with effective solvation forces obtained by converging
   3D-RISM-KH at outer time steps and applying ASFE at inner time steps is
   stabilized by employing the optimized isokinetic Nose-Hoover chain (OIN)
   ensemble. Compared to the previous extrapolation schemes used in
   combination with the Langevin thermostat, the ASFE approach
   substantially improves the accuracy of evaluation of effective solvation
   forces and in combination with the OIN thermostat enables a dramatic
   increase of outer time steps. We demonstrate on a fully flexible model
   of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution that the
   MTS-MD/OIN/ASFE/3D-RISM-KH multiscale method of molecular dynamics
   steered by effective solvation forces allows huge outer time steps up to
   tens of picoseconds without affecting the equilibrium and conformational
   properties, and thus provides a 100- to 500-fold effective speedup in
   comparison to conventional MD with explicit solvent. With the
   statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM-KH account for effective solvation
   forces, the method provides efficient sampling of biomolecular processes
   with slow and/or rare solvation events such as conformational
   transitions of hydrated alanine dipeptide with the mean life times
   ranging from 30 ps up to 10 ns for ``flip-flop{''} conformations, and is
   particularly beneficial for biomolecular systems with exchange and
   localization of solvent and ions, ligand binding, and molecular
   recognition. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to second-generation
   biofuels and valuable chemicals requires decomposition of resilient
   plant cell wall structure. Cell wall recalcitrance varies among plant

   the noncellulosic matrix. Changing the amount and composition of
   branches attached to the hemicellulose backbone can significantly alter
   the cell wall strength and microstructure. We address the effect of
   hemicellulose composition on primary cell wall assembly forces by using
   the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation, which provides statistical
   mechanical sampling and molecular picture of hemicellulose arrangement
   around cellulose. We show that hemicellulose branches of arabinose,
   glucuronic acid, and especially glucuronate strengthen the primary cell
   wall by strongly coordinating to hydrogen bond donor sites on the
   cellulose surface. We reveal molecular forces maintaining the cell wall
   structure and provide directions for genetic modulation of plants and
   pretreatment design to render biomass more amenable to processing.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we demonstrate that the electron work function (EWF) as
   an intrinsic parameter can provide information or clues in a simple or
   straightforward way for material design, modification, and development.
   A higher work function of a material represents a more stable electronic
   state, which consequently generates a higher resistance to any attempt
   of changing the electronic state and other corresponding states, e. g.,
   changes in structure or microstructure caused by mechanical and
   electrochemical actions. Using Cu-Ni alloy as an example, we demonstrate
   the correlation between the EWF and Young's modulus of the material as
   well as its hardness. The properties of a material can be modified using
   elements with appropriate work functions. This is also applicable for
   tailoring inter-phase boundaries or interfaces. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{A surface dominant sub-bandgap photo-carrier generation has been
   observed in multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) nanowires, which is mainly
   attributed to the depopulation of surface states that exist within the
   bandgap. Mapping of surface potential using Kelvin probe force
   microscopy (KPFM) further supports the depopulation of surface states in
   BFO nanowires under sub-bandgap illumination. The mechanism of
   photovoltage generation in BFO nanowires is investigated by measuring
   the photoresponse with local illumination of visible laser pulses at
   different positions of the BFO nanowires. Interestingly, large
   photovoltage signals were observed when the laser spot was focused close
   to contact electrodes, showing a position dependent effect of
   photoresponse in the BFO nanowires. The sub-bandgap excitation of
   surface states in multiferroic nanowires offers potential new strategies
   for application in photovoltaic devices.}},

Abstract = {{We present models of trucks and shovels in oil sand surface mines. The

   (which determines the shovel's productivity) and the number of trucks
   assigned to the shovel via a simple approximation, based on the theory
   of finite source queues. We use linearization to incorporate this
   expression into linear integer programs. We assume in our integer
   programs that each shovel is assigned a single truck size but we outline
   how one could account for multiple truck sizes per shovel in an
   approximate fashion. The linearization of shovel idle probabilities
   allows us to formulate more accurate truck allocation models that are
   easily solvable for realistic-sized problems. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Adsorptive drying of CO2 using low grade heat and humid, ambient air}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{354-361}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Adsorptive separation of water from CO2 is an appealing alternative to
   liquid absorbers for post-combustion capture systems. In all cases, the
   purified CO2 stream from a PCC system will have a high moisture content
   and, due to equipment corrosion issues and the risk of hydrate
   formation, the CO2 stream must be rigorously dried prior to being
   compressed. This work reports the first study on solid adsorbent
   selection for CO2 drying using low grade heat and ambient air as a
   regeneration gas. Different types of adsorbents, chosen for their range
   of water adsorption characteristics, have been investigated for the
   desiccation of a pure CO2 stream. When destined for sequestration the
   CO2 product gas has little value and so the drying process should
   require no supporting process operations and should consume little
   additional energy. However, due to the costs and complexity of
   separating and purifying CO2 from a flue gas stream, the drying process
   should return as much CO2 as possible to the compression stage. An ideal
   desiccant for CO2 drying should have a high moisture capacity and
   selectivity and should be regenerable using waste heat and ambient,
   humid air. The CO2 drying performance of Na-, Ca-, and Ca/H- forms of
   ETS-10 were compared to that of commercial silica and 4A zeolite.
   Ca-ETS-10 was found to have the highest moisture capacity using a
   temperature swing of 30-70 degrees C and a CO2 feed stream of 50-100\%
   relative humidity. Due to the intrinsic selectivity for water over CO2
   on solid adsorbents, all desiccants tested had a CO2 recovery greater
   than 95\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coordinated-distributed model predictive control
   (CDMPC) scheme is presented for discrete-time linear process systems.
   The coordinated-distributed control scheme proposed in this work
   benefits from using local model predictive controllers that can be
   coordinated to achieve the plantwide (centralized) optimal performance.
   The ``price-driven{''} method is used to coordinate the local
   controllers. Newton's method, along with a sensitivity analysis
   technique, is used to update the price in the price-driven method.
   Convergence of the performance obtained with the CDMPC controllers to
   the plantwide optimal performance is shown. Simulation examples,
   including a forced-circulation evaporator process, are used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated-distributed
   control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{RNAi represents a new alternative for treatment of chronic myeloid
   leukemia (CML) to overcome the difficulties of current drug treatments
   such as the acquired resistance. However, potent carriers that can
   overcome delivery barriers to RNAi agents and have therapeutic efficacy
   especially in difficult-to-transfect CML cells are needed. Here, we
   explored the use of lipid-modified polyethylenimines (PEI) of low
   molecular weights (0.6, 1.2 and 2.0 kDa) in K562 cells and showed that
   the delivery efficiency was dependent on the type of lipid used for
   polymer modification, degree of lipid substitution and polymer molecular
   weight. Among the lipid-substituted polymers investigated, palmitic acid
   (PA)-substituted 1.2 kDa PEI (similar to 2 lipids/PEI) has proven to be
   highly efficient in delivering siRNA and silencing of the reporter gene
   green fluorescent protein (GFP). The silencing efficacy achieved with
   this polymer was found to be higher than the 25 kDa PEI and is similar
   to commercial reagent Lipofectamine (TM) 2000. Moreover, when BCR-ABL
   protein was targeted in K562 cells, a reduction in the corresponding
   mRNA levels was observed, as well as an induction of early and late
   stage apoptosis. The results of this study demonstrated that
   PA-substitutions on low MW polymers could be useful for siRNA delivery
   in CML cells for therapeutic purposes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we unravel new scaling regimes for streaming potential
   and electroviscous effects in a nanocapillary with thick overlapping
   Electric Double Layers (EDLs). We observe that the streaming potential,
   for a given value of the capillary zeta (zeta) potential, varies with
   the EDL thickness and a dimensionless parameter R, quantifying the
   conduction current. Depending on the value of R, variation of the
   streaming potential with the EDL thickness demonstrates distinct scaling
   regimes: one can witness a Quadratic Regime where the streaming
   potential varies as the square of the EDL thickness, a Weak Regime where
   the streaming potential shows a weaker variation with the EDL thickness,
   and a Saturation Regime where the streaming potential ceases to vary
   with the EDL thickness. Effective viscosity, characterizing the
   electroviscous effect, obeys the variation of the streaming potential
   for smaller EDL thickness values; however, for larger EDL thickness the
   electroosmotic flow profile dictates the electroviscous effect, with
   insignificant contribution of the streaming potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{24-31}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, UCS of limestone rock was determined by indentation
   testing on rock fragments. The size of the fragments was in the range of
   2-5 mm, which is within the size range of drill cuttings. Here, scatter
   of the data was investigated by calculating the coefficient of variation
   that showed the size dependency of the conventional indentation
   parameters; Indentation Modulus (IM) and Critical Transition Force
   (CTF). Thus, it is recommended that the results of indentation tests
   should be normalized by the fragment size and presented in the form of
   Normalized Indentation Modulus (IMn) and Normalized Critical Transition
   Force (CTFn). Regression analysis was carried out to show the
   relationship between the IMn or CTFn and the UCS. Linear and exponential
   regression provided reasonable correlation coefficients of higher than
   0.74 and 0.85, respectively. The proposed empirical equations for
   estimation of the intact rock UCS from the normalized indentation
   indices were verified using independent data from limestone rocks not
   used in developing the correlations. The outcome was a strong agreement
   (R similar to 1.00) between the estimated and measured UCS. Based on the
   statistical analysis, minimum number of indentation test was determined
   for random size samples. It is suggested that indentation testing will
   be carried out using uniform fragment sizes to reduce the required
   number of indentation tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Use of nano-metal particles as catalyst under electromagnetic heating
   for in-situ heavy oil recovery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{258-265}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In order for heavy oil and bitumen recovery to be efficient, all
   components present within the oil must be produced. To achieve a highly
   efficient production process it is essential that we are able to produce
   asphaltenic components and limit their precipitation. Solvent and
   conventional thermal techniques are largely limited in their ability to
   crack asphaltenic components; thus, new techniques and catalysts are
   needed to more efficiently recover heavy oil.
   When nano-size metal particles are present they catalyze the breaking of
   carbon sulfur bonds within asphaltenic components. The result of this
   process is an increase in saturates and aromatics, while simultaneously
   reducing the asphaltene content This process dramatically lowers the
   viscosity of heavy oil and bitumen by significantly reducing the average
   molecular weight This effect can be dramatically increased by having a
   strong hydrogen donor present and can be completely inhibited by the
   removal of all hydrogen donors. When conducting these types of reactions
   in-situ, it is very difficult and expensive to introduce strong hydrogen
   donors. Therefore, it is imperative that hydrogen donors be created
   within the oil rather than be introduced from an external source.
   In this paper, we investigated the effects of microwave radiation, using
   a 2.45 GHz emitter, on the recovery of heavy oil from a sand pack.
   Experiments were conducted with and without nano-size nickel catalyst
   being present Heavy oil samples were heated at differing power levels
   until recovery of heavy oil leveled out In all cases, the nano-nickel
   catalysts performed better than their microwave-only counterparts due to
   the increased cracking and vaporization demonstrated by Greff and
   Babadagli (2011) place in the presence of nano-size metal catalysts and
   microwaves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   transmission and (ii) non-pairwise zero-forcing transmission, for
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-way

   upper bounds of the outage probability, the corresponding high
   signal-to-noise ratio outage probability approximations, the achievable
   sum rate, and the fundamental diversity-multiplexing trade-off are
   derived in closed-form. The proposed pairwise zero-forcing transmission
   strategy possesses a lower practical implementation complexity as each
   node requires only the instantaneous respective node-to-relay channel
   knowledge. Counter intuitively, the non-pairwise zero-forcing
   transmission strategy achieves higher spatial multiplexing gains over
   the pairwise counterpart at the expense of higher relay processing
   complexity and more stringent channel state information requirements.
   Moreover, numerical results are presented to further validate our
   analysis and thereby to obtain valuable insights into practical MIMO AF

Abstract = {{In this review, we briefly introduce our efforts to reconstruct cellular
   life processes by mimicking natural systems and the applications of
   these systems to energy and environmental problems. Functional units of
   in vitro cellular life processes are based on the fabrication of
   artificial organelles using protein-incorporated polymersomes and the
   creation of bioreactors. This concept of an artificial organelle
   originates from the first synthesis of
   poly(siloxane)-poly(alkyloxazoline) block copolymers three decades ago
   and the first demonstration of protein activity in the polymer membrane
   a decade ago. The increased value of biomimetic polymers results from
   many research efforts to find new applications such as functionally
   active membranes and a biochemical-producing polymersome. At the same
   time, foam research has advanced to the point that biomolecules can be
   efficiently produced in the aqueous channels of foam. Ongoing research
   includes replication of complex biological processes, such as an
   artificial Calvin cycle for application in biofuel and specialty
   chemical production, and carbon dioxide sequestration. We believe that
   the development of optimally designed biomimetic polymers and
   stable/biocompatible bioreactors would contribute to the realization of
   the benefits of biomimetic systems. Thus, this paper seeks to review
   previous research efforts, examine current knowledge/key technical
   parameters, and identify technical challenges ahead.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a laser wakefield generated X-ray probe to directly
   measure the temporal evolution of the ionization states in warm dense
   aluminum by means of absorption spectroscopy. As a promising alternative
   to the free electron excited X-ray sources, Betatron X-ray radiation,
   with femtosecond pulse duration, provides a new technique to diagnose
   femtosecond to picosecond transitions in the atomic structure. The X-ray
   probe system consists of an adjustable Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) microscope
   for focusing the Betatron emission to a small probe spot on the sample
   being measured, and a flat Potassium Acid Phthalate Bragg crystal
   spectrometer to measure the transmitted X-ray spectrum in the region of
   the aluminum K-edge absorption lines. An X-ray focal spot size of around
   50 mu m was achieved after reflection from the platinum-coated
   10-cm-long KB microscope mirrors. Shot to shot positioning stability of
   the Betatron radiation was measured resulting in an rms shot to shot
   variation in spatial pointing on the sample of 16 mu m. The entire probe
   setup had a spectral resolution of similar to 1.5 eV, a detection
   bandwidth of similar to 24 eV, and an overall photon throughput
   efficiency of the order of 10(-5). Approximately 10 photons were
   detected by the X-ray CCD per laser shot within the spectrally resolved
   detection band. Thus, it is expected that hundreds of shots will be
   required per absorption spectrum to clearly observe the K-shell
   absorption features expected from the ionization states of the warm
   dense aluminum. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{North-flowing rivers of the pan-Arctic region have important effects on
   the Arctic Ocean, but their river-ocean interfaces, including some with
   vast deltas such as the Mackenzie, have complex hydrology and remain
   poorly understood. Analysis of 39 years (1973-2011) of water-levels and
   river discharge at the head of the Mackenzie Delta, 48 years (1964-2011)
   of water-levels in the mid-delta, and 28 years (1984-2011) of
   water-levels in the outer delta permitted evaluation of changes in the
   timing, duration, and magnitude of peak annual water-levels during
   river-ice breakup. The initiation date of freshet-discharge into the
   delta has not changed, but the duration from freshet initiation until
   peak water-levels in the central delta (i.e., duration of ice clearance)
   has shortened from 35 to 27 days since 1964. The height of annual
   water-level peaks in the outer delta at Reindeer Channel may have
   declined by approximate to 0.4 m from 1984 to 2010, but complicating
   factors may be influencing this result. Winter-discharge has increased
   by approximate to 21\% from 1973 to 2011, but this amount is too small
   to cause a trend in total Mackenzie discharge. Breakup-discharge (i.e.,
   occurring during ice clearance through the central delta) has not
   significantly changed. The lag time from freshet-discharge initiation
   into the delta until initial breakage of the river ice-sheet has
   declined by 6.6 days from 1974 to 2007 and is sufficient to account for
   the shortened period of river-ice clearance. Declining snow-pack depths
   during April suggest that river-ice may be melting earlier and more
   rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{A series of nonporous, amine-functionalized sodium titanates was
   prepared and the thermal and adsorptive behavior of the samples were
   characterized. Engelhard titanosilicate 2 was chosen as a substrate for
   its high surface area (approximate to 300 m(2)/g), native surface
   hydroxyl concentration, and lack of microporosity; eliminating the risk
   of fouling the adsorbent under certain process conditions. Aminosilanes
   containing a single (N1), two (N2), and three (N3) amine groups were
   chemically grafted to the surface of the substrate and the adsorption
   capacity for CO2 measured through thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy
   (TG-MS) desorption, volumetric adsorption, and gravimetric
   adsorption/desorption cycling. The N3 sample displayed complete
   monolayer coverage and was capable of adsorbing five times as much
   atmospheric CO2 as the N1 sample. Testing under anhydrous conditions
   only engages the primary amine on the tether and the data consistently
   suggests a correlation between amine utilization and the proportion of
   monolayer coverage for these adsorbents. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{A systematic analysis of several vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) cycles
   with Zeochem zeolite 13X as the adsorbent to capture CO2 from dry, flue
   gas containing 15\% CO2 in N-2 is reported. Full optimization of the
   analyzed VSA cycles using genetic algorithm has been performed to obtain
   purity-recovery and energy-productivity Pareto fronts. These cycles are
   assessed for their ability to produce high-purity CO2 at high recovery.
   Configurations satisfying 90\% purity-recovery constraints are ranked
   according to their energy-productivity Pareto fronts. It is shown that a
   4-step VSA cycle with light product pressurization gives the minimum
   energy penalty of 131 kWh/tonne CO2 captured at a productivity of 0.57
   mol CO2/m(3) adsorbent/s. The minimum energy consumption required to
   achieve 95 and 97\% purities, both at 90\% recoveries, are 154 and 186
   kWh/tonne CO2 captured, respectively. For the proposed cycle, it is
   shown that significant increase in productivity can be achieved with a
   marginal increase in energy consumption. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{In the process industry, alarms are configured on the control system to
   provide indication of abnormal events to the control room operators. In
   the presence of improper design of alarm generating algorithm or lack of
   appropriate tuning, alarms are announced more frequently than what is
   typically sufficient to alert the operator, a condition commonly known
   as `alarm chatter'. Chattering alarms are the most common form of
   nuisance alarms. The concept of run length is introduced in the alarm
   management context to study alarm chatter and an index is proposed to
   quantify the degree of alarm chatter based on run length distributions
   obtained exclusively from readily available historical alarm data.
   Chatter index hence plays a crucial role in routine assessment of
   industrial alarm systems. Prominent features of the proposed chatter
   index and its variant are demonstrated using industrial data. (C) 2013

   the erosion process and a rectangular box with the outlet on the side
   wall to show the internal erosion process. The quantitative influences
   of the four factors on the erosion-void shape, volume, and length were
   analyzed. It is found that the geometry of the erosion void is
   determined by water head and soil height. Relationships were developed

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an empirically driven, non-parametric method to
   isolate and estimate the effects that changes in demand and changes in
   throughput have on delay in particular, arrival and departure flight
   delay at airport runways. Classic queuing concepts were used to develop
   a method by which an intermediate, or counterfactual, queuing scenario
   could be constructed, to isolate the delay effects due to shifts in
   demand and throughput. This method includes the development of a
   stochastic throughput function that is based entirely on data and has
   three key features. Firstly, the function relies on non-parametric,
   empirically-based probability distributions of throughput counts.
   Secondly, facility capacity needs not be explicitly defined, as it is
   implicitly included in the probability distributions of throughput.
   Thirdly, the throughput performance function preserves the effect of
   factors that cause capacity (and, therefore, throughput) to fluctuate
   over a given period. Temporal sequences of high, moderate, and low
   capacity are maintained between the observed and counterfactual
   scenarios. The method was applied to a case study of the three major New
   York area airports of LaGuardia (LGA), Newark Liberty (EWR), and John F.
   Kennedy (JFK), using operational data extracted from the Federal
   Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Aviation System Performance Metrics
   (ASPM) database. The focus was on the peak summer travel seasons of 2006
   and 2007, as these airports experienced record levels of delay in 2007.
   The results indicate that decreases in both demand and throughput were
   experienced at LGA and EWR, although the decreases in throughput had
   more significant effects on operational delays as they increased overall
   at these airports. At JFK, the increase in departure throughput was not
   sufficient to offset the increase in departure demands. For arrivals,
   demand increased and throughput decreased. These trends caused a
   significant growth in delay at JFK between 2006 and 2007. (C) 2013

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{How grain faces are arranged in three-dimensional grain structures is
   one of the outstanding problems in physics, biology and materials
   science. Based on the topological analysis of 477 real pure iron grains
   and 6093 Monte Carlo simulated grains, two forms of topological
   correlations are studied. The first correlation is Rivier's relation
   (Philos. Mag. B, 52 (1985) 795), in which the average number of edges
   M-f(e) of faces neighboring to e-edged faces on f-faceted grains is
   related to e and f; and the second correlation is the one derived in the
   current paper, in which a typical e-edged face in a polycrystal is a
   function of the average number of edges of its neighboring faces M(e).
   Both correlations are verified by experimental and simulation data.

Abstract = {{Technological advances in cytotoxicity analysis have now made it
   possible to obtain real time data on changes in cell growth, morphology
   and cell death. This type of testing has a great potential for reducing
   and refining traditional in vivo toxicology tests. By monitoring the
   dynamic response profile of living cells via the xCELLigence real-time
   cell analyzer for high-throughput (RTCA HT) system, cellular changes
   including cell number (cell index, CI) are recorded and analyzed. A
   special scaled index defined as normalized cell index (NCI) is used in
   the analysis which reduces the influence of inter-experimental
   variations. To assess the extent of exposure of the tested chemicals, a
   two-exponent model is presented to describe rate of cell growth and
   death. This model is embodied in the time and concentration-dependent
   cellular response curves, and the parameters k(1) and k(2) in this model
   are used to describe the rate of cell growth and death. Based on
   calculated k(2) values and the corresponding concentrations, a
   concentration-response curve is fitted. As a result, a cytotoxicity
   assessment named KC50 is calculated. The validation of the proposed
   method is demonstrated by exposing six cell lines to 14 chemical
   compounds. Our findings suggest that the proposed KC50-based toxicity
   assay can be an alternative to the traditional single time-point assay
   such as LC50 (the concentration at which 50\% of the cells are killed).
   The proposed index has a potential for routine evaluation of
   cytotoxicities. Another advantage of the proposed index is that it
   extracts cytotoxicity information when CI fails to detect the low
   toxicity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bitumen froth treatment is an integrated process step in the Athabasca
   oil sands bitumen recovery operations. Its objective is to separate
   mineral solids and water from the bitumen froth. The bitumen froth is
   diluted with naphthenic or paraffinic solvents to lower its viscosity to
   facilitate the separation; therefore, bitumen froth treatment is the
   removal of inorganics (mineral particles and water droplets) from a
   bitumen organic solvent solution. The micrometer sized mineral particles
   (mainly clays) and water-in-oil emulsion droplets are the most difficult
   to remove from the bitumen froth. Research has been carried out that has
   led to an understanding of the formation, stabilization and properties
   of the water-in-oil emulsions in the bitumen organic solvent solution.
   It is known that the water-in-oil emulsions are formed by water
   entrained into the bitumen froth during the water-based extraction
   process and stabilized by natural surfactants in bitumen (especially
   asphaltene) and fine mineral particles. In fact, the fine mineral
   particles are the main detriments in stabilizing the water-in-oil
   emulsions, for the emulsified water droplets were found to be easy to
   destabilize and remove in the absence of fine mineral particles.
   Effective removal of the fine mineral particles and water droplets
   requires both (1) that the fine mineral particles form larger aggregates
   and (2) that the water-in-oil emulsions can be destabilized. Different
   demulsifiers have been studied in froth treatment, but the focus was
   more on the ``surfactant-stabilized{''} water-in-oil emulsions.
   Therefore, this approach can only partly contribute to item (2). No
   efforts were made to aggregate the fine mineral particles. Therefore, it
   was proposed that a possible approach for the effective bitumen froth
   treatment would be to develop and use process aids that can both
   aggregate the fine mineral particles and destabilize the water-in-oil
   emulsions. Several other potential directions to improve bitumen froth
   treatment have also been pointed out based on the literature review.}},

Abstract = {{Jumping and weightlifting tasks involve impact phases, where work is
   performed by the lower extremity to absorb energies present at contact.
   This study compared the lower extremity kinematic and kinetic strategies
   to absorb energy during the impact phase of jumping and weightlifting
   activities. Ten women experienced in jumping and weightlifting performed
   4 tasks (landing from a jump, drop landing, clean, and power clean) in a
   motion analysis laboratory. Work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle
   were calculated during the landing and receiving phases of jumping and
   weightlifting tasks, respectively. Additionally, segment and joint
   kinematics and net joint moments were determined. The most lower
   extremity work was performed in the clean and drop landing, followed by
   landing from a jump, and the least work was performed in the power clean
   (p < 0.05). For all tasks, work performed by the knee extensors was the
   greatest contributor to lower extremity work. Knee extensor net joint
   moment was greater in the power clean than jump and drop landings, and
   greater in the clean than all other tasks (p < 0.05). Knee flexion angle
   was not different between the power clean and jump landing (p > 0.05)
   but greater in the drop landing and clean (p < 0.05). A common
   characteristic of the impact phase of jumping and weightlifting tasks is
   a large contribution of knee extensor work. Further, the correspondence
   in kinematics between impact phases of jumping and weightlifting tasks
   suggests that similar muscular strategies are used to perform both types
   of activities. Weightlifting tasks, particularly the clean, may be
   important exercises to develop the muscular extensor net joint moments.}},

   (PICs), which produce long-lasting periods of depolarization under
   conditions of low synaptic drive, can be activated in trigeminal
   motoneurons following the application of the monoamine serotonin. Here
   we examined if PICs are activated in human trigeminal motoneurons during
   voluntary contractions and under physiological levels of monoaminergic
   drive (e. g., serotonin and norepinephrine) using a paired motor unit
   analysis technique. We also examined if PICs activated during voluntary
   contractions are larger in participants who demonstrate involuntary
   chewing during sleep (bruxism), which is accompanied by periods of high
   monoaminergic drive. In control participants, during a slowly increasing
   and then decreasing isometric contraction, the firing rate of an
   earlier-recruited masseter motor unit, which served as a measure of
   synaptic input to a later-recruited test unit, was consistently lower
   during derecruitment of the test unit compared with at recruitment
   (Delta F = 4.6 +/- 1.5 imp/s). The Delta F, therefore, is a measure of
   the reduction in synaptic input needed to counteract the depolarization
   from the PIC to provide an indirect estimate of PIC amplitude. The range
   of Delta F values measured in the bruxer participants during similar
   voluntary contractions was the same as in controls, suggesting that
   abnormally high levels of monoaminergic drive are not continually
   present in the absence of involuntary motor activity. We also observed a
   consistent ``onion skin effect{''} during the moderately sized
   contractions (<20\% of maximal), whereby the firing rate of higher
   threshold motor units discharged at slower rates (by 4-7 imp/s) compared
   with motor units with relatively lower thresholds. The presence of lower
   firing rates in the more fatigue-prone, higher threshold trigeminal
   motoneurons, in addition to the activation of PICs, likely facilitates
   the activation of the masseter muscle during motor activities such as
   eating, nonnutritive chewing, clenching, and yawning.}},

Abstract = {{We created graphene blisters that cover and seal an annular
   cylinder-shaped microcavity in a SiO2 substrate filled with a gas. By
   controlling the pressure difference between the gas inside and outside
   of the microcavity, we switch the graphene membrane between multiple
   stable equilibrium configurations. We carried out experiments starting
   from the situation where the pressure, of the gas inside and outside of
   the microcavity is set equal to a prescribed charging pressure, p(0) and
   the graphene membrane covers the cavity like an annular drum, adhered to
   the central post and the surrounding substrate due to van der Waals
   forces. We decrease the outside pressure to a value, p(e) which causes
   it to bulge into an annular blister. We systematically increase the
   charging pressure by repeating this procedure causing the annular
   blister to continue to bulge until a critical charging pressure p(c)(i)
   is reached. At this point the graphene membrane delaminates from the
   post in an unstable manner, resulting in a switch of graphene membrane
   shape from an annular to a spherical blister. Continued increase of the
   charging pressure results in the spherical blister growing with its
   height increasing, but maintaining a constant radius until a second
   critical charging pressure p(c)(o) is reached at which point the blister
   begins to delaminate from the periphery of the cavity in a stable
   manner. Here, we report a series of experiments as well as a mechanics
   and thermodynamic model that demonstrate how the interplay among system
   parameters (geometry, graphene stiffness (number of layers), pressure,
   and adhesion energy) results in the ability to controllably switch
   graphene blisters among different shapes. Arrays of these blisters can
   be envisioned to create pressure-switchable surface properties where the
   difference between patterns of annular versus spherical blisters will
   impact functionalities such as wettability, friction, adhesion, and
   surface wave characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The study introduces a concept of mappings realized in presence of
   information granules and offers a design framework supporting the
   formation of such mappings. Information granules are conceptually
   meaningful entities formed on a basis of a large number of experimental
   input-output numeric data available for the construction of the model.
   We develop a conceptually and algorithmically sound way of forming
   information granules. Considering the directional nature of the mapping
   to be formed, this directionality aspect needs to be taken into account
   when developing information granules. The property of directionality
   implies that while the information granules in the input space could be
   constructed with a great deal of flexibility, the information granules
   formed in the output space have to inherently relate to those built in
   the input space. The input space is granulated by running a clustering
   algorithm; for illustrative purposes, the focus here is on fuzzy
   clustering realized with the aid of the fuzzy C-means algorithm. The
   information granules in the output space are constructed with the aid of
   the principle of justifiable granularity (being one of the underlying
   fundamental conceptual pursuits of Granular Computing). The construct
   exhibits two important features. First, the constructed information
   granules are formed in the presence of information granules already
   constructed in the input space (and this realization is reflective of
   the direction of the mapping from the input to the output space).
   Second, the principle of justifiable granularity does not confine the
   realization of information granules to a single formalism such as fuzzy
   sets but helps form the granules expressed any required formalism of
   information granulation. The quality of the granular mapping (viz. the
   mapping realized for the information granules formed in the input and
   output spaces) is expressed in terms of the coverage criterion
   (articulating how well the experimental data are ``covered{''} by
   information granules produced by the granular mapping for any input
   experimental data). Some parametric studies are reported by quantifying
   the performance of the granular mapping (expressed in terms of the
   coverage and specificity criteria) versus the values of a certain
   parameters utilized in the construction of output information granules
   through the principle of justifiable granularity. The plots of
   coverage-specificity dependency help determine a knee point and reach a
   sound compromise between these two conflicting requirements imposed on
   the quality of the granular mapping. Furthermore, quantified is the
   quality of the mapping with regard to the number of information granules
   (implying a certain granularity of the mapping). A series of experiments
   is reported as well.}},

Abstract = {{The role of capacitive coupling between RF coil elements of MRI arrays
   is studied extensively in this paper and comprehensive models are
   obtained. At higher MRI frequencies, capacitive coupling greatly impacts
   coil coupling and therefore cannot be neglected. We compare lumped and
   distributed capacitance models and show that they correctly predict
   impedance variations due to stray and intentional mutual capacitance.
   The distributed model takes into account the dispersed nature of the
   mutual impedance, and it is more accurate than the lumped model. The
   value of stray capacitance obtained by fitting simulated results is
   shown to depend strongly on substrate and phantom permittivity, while
   being mostly invariant to changes in frequency. A novel result of this
   investigation is a method of completely eliminating mutual impedance
   between adjacent coils, including the mutual resistance. Until recently
   it was believed that only mutual reactance could be eliminated with
   lossless passive circuits. The SNR performance of two and four coil
   arrays with varying degrees of coupling is compared, showing that there
   is no SNR degradation when the mutual resistance is eliminated in
   addition to mutual reactance. This result has applications in arrays
   used in transmission, where mutual resistance leads to losses that
   degrade transmit efficiency.}},

   polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mn = 1100 g mol(-1)) wax, a phase-change

Abstract = {{Prion-induced diseases are a global health concern. The lack of
   effective therapy and 100 \% mortality rates for such diseases have made
   the prion protein an important target for drug discovery. Previous NMR
   experimental work revealed that thiamine and its derivatives bind the
   prion protein in a pocket near the N-terminal loop of helix 1, and
   conserved intermolecular interactions were noted between thiamine and
   other thiamine-binding proteins. Furthermore, water-mediated
   interactions were observed in all of the X-ray crystallographic
   structures of thiamine-binding proteins, but were not observed in the
   thiamine-prion NMR study. To better understand the potential role of
   water in thiamine-prion binding, a docking study was employed using
   structural X-ray solvent. Before energy minimization, docked thiamine
   assumed a ``V{''} shape similar to some of the known thiamine-dependent
   proteins. Following minimization with NMR-derived restraints, the
   ``F{''} conformation was observed. Our findings confirmed that water is
   involved in ligand stabilization and phosphate group interaction. The
   resulting refined structure of thiamine bound to the prion protein
   allowed the 4-aminopyrimidine ring of thiamine to pi-stack with Tyr150,
   and facilitated hydrogen bonding between Asp147 and the amino group of
   4-aminopyrimidine. Investigation of the pi-stacking interaction through
   mutation of the tyrosine residue further revealed its importance in
   ligand placement. The resulting refined structure is in good agreement
   with previous experimental restraints, and is consistent with the
   pharmacophore model of thiamine-binding proteins.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate how introducing a deliberate defect on the overhanging
   caps of strongly adhering mushroom shaped dry adhesive fibers can
   produce directional adhesion behavior. We find that the shape and
   location of this defect controls both the total adhesion force and the
   degree of directionality for these bio-inspired adhesives. Linear beam
   theory is used to demonstrate how the application of a shear load to a
   fiber in tension can create a small compressive load to an asymmetric
   crack, thereby delaying adhesion failure and producing directional
   adhesion, and the theory is confirmed with finite element models and
   empirical data. Anisotropic adhesives have been fabricated and tested
   and can demonstrate normal adhesion force up to similar to 250 kPa with
   a shear displacement of 15 mu m away from the defect and as small as
   similar to 5 kPa when sheared the same amount towards the defect.}},

Abstract = {{Modular construction brings improved safety and mitigates risks of
   hazard and injury. However, modular construction technology is also
   challenged with a degree of uncertainty resulting from such internal and
   external factors as engineering, occupational, cultural, socio-economic,
   and financial. Since modular construction is by nature distinct from
   conventional construction, existing risk management research for onsite
   construction cannot be directly applied to modular construction. This
   paper describes research on the risk management associated with modular
   construction, focusing on: (1) identifying risk factors and (2)
   assessing the impacts of the identified risk factors on project cost and
   duration. The primary risk factors associated with modular construction
   are identified, and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized
   to rank these factors; simulation techniques are employed to assess the
   risks of projects. The risk identification and ranking are evaluated by
   a focus group of experts from the modular construction industry;
   t-distribution and chi-squared distribution are applied to analyze the
   results. The case of a project in Edmonton, Canada is presented to
   illustrate application of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{A TEM horn antenna with modified radiation pattern customized for oil
   well monitoring application is presented in this paper. The antenna is
   designed to operate in an oil saturated medium in the frequency range
   between 1.4 to 11 GHz. A complete design procedure for the proposed TEM
   horn antenna with a method to modify the radiation pattern is introduced
   here. The modification is conducted using nonuniform expansion of the
   antenna flares. Applying this technique eliminates ripples in the
   antenna's main-lobe radiation pattern at higher frequencies, a problem
   which exists for conventional TEM horn antennas. The design coefficients
   which control the flare openings are optimized using CST Microwave
   Studio to achieve smooth main-beam radiation patterns while maintaining
   return loss more than 10 dB. Simulations are performed both in oil and
   free space. Free space simulations are done to provide a valid reference
   for antenna radiation pattern measurement as radiation pattern cannot be
   measured in oil. Simulation results are followed by the measurement
   results with a very good agreement. The fabricated dimensions of the
   antenna including balun section are limited to 89.2 x 49.2 x 78.2 mm.
   The designed antenna is utilized as a part of an ultrawideband radar
   system for oil well monitoring.}},

Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{690-695}},

Abstract = {{The size distribution of pharmaceutical aerosols delivered by nebulizers
   normally contains a fraction that is larger than is optimal for drug
   delivery to the lungs; thus a noticeable fraction of droplets deposits
   in the extra-thoracic airways. However, because of the volatile nature
   of these droplets, their size can be reduced by controlled evaporation.
   Two approaches to size reduction are investigated in the present study.
   They are aimed at altering the vapor pressure balance between the
   surface of the droplets and the carrier air. In the first approach, the
   aerosol stream is heated. This increases the vapor pressure at the
   surface of the droplets, allowing them to evaporate and shrink. In the
   second approach, solid sodium chloride particles are added to the
   aerosol stream. These particles serve as sinks for water vapor and give
   rise to evaporation of the saline droplets. Hygroscopic size changes
   involve two-way coupled mass and heat transfer between the dispersed
   droplets and their surrounding air. These size changes are simulated by
   numerical solution of the governing mass and heat transfer equations.
   The results indicate that the two approaches are effective in terms of
   decreasing unwanted deposition in the extra-thoracic airways, while
   increasing deposition in the alyeolar regions of the lung. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether 3-dimensional notch volume, measured with
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), differs significantly between knees
   with torn and intact anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) after sports
   injury in a skeletally immature pediatric population. Methods: MRI
   studies of 50 pediatric patients (age range, 10 to 17 years) with ACL
   tears were compared with 50 age-and sex-matched intact-ACL control
   patients. All patients had open physes and underwent MRI after a sports
   injury. Notch volume was calculated through manual segmentation of notch
   boundaries seen on axial 1.5-T proton density-weighted images.
   Two-dimensional (2D) measurements (notch width and notch width index)
   were made on coronal proton density-weighted MRI studies. Notch volume
   was compared between groups by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson
   correlation coefficients were also calculated between indices. Results:
   Notch volume was significantly lower in knees with ACL tears than in
   control knees (5.5 +/- 1.1 cm(3) v 6.4 +/- 1.5 cm(3), P = .002), whereas
   2D notch width and notch width index did not differ significantly
   between these groups. Girls had significantly smaller notch volumes than
   boys (5.4 +/- 1.2 cm(3) v 6.5 +/- 1.3 cm(3), P < .001). Notch volume was
   not correlated with age but was moderately correlated with 2D notch
   width (r = 0.485, P < .001). Conclusions: In adolescent patients with
   sports injuries, the 3-dimensional notch volume was significantly
   smaller in knees with ACL tears than in intact-ACL control knees. Notch
   volume was also significantly smaller in girls than in boys and did not
   vary significantly with age.}},

Abstract = {{Edgewise orthodontic treatment utilizes a force couple in order to
   achieve labial-lingual tooth angulation. Two self-ligating brackets
   (Damon Q and Speed) were examined across a range of clinically relevant
   torques in order to assess the loading and unloading curves and bracket
   deformation.
   A previously developed torquing and load measurement system was utilized
   to rotate a 0.199 x 0.25 in stainless steel wire in a fixed bracket slot
   to the following angles: 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 40 degrees.
   The torque on the bracket was measured during both wire loading and
   unloading cycles. The torque play for the Damon brackets was determined
   to increase by less than 0.4 degrees when torqued to 70 Nmm, whereas the
   increase for the Speed brackets was 2.1 degrees at the same torque
   magnitude. The deformation curves for the Damon and Speed brackets were
   found to be different for loading and unloading. Speed brackets were
   found to start to plastically deform when torqued to 24 degrees (26 Nmm
   of torque), while Damon brackets did not plastically deform until 28
   degrees (38 Nmm of torque).
   Damon brackets were found not to plastically deform as easily and to
   have a smaller increase in torque play than Speed brackets. Both the
   Damon and the Speed brackets demonstrated minimal effect of plastic
   deformation and torque play at maximum angles of twist less than 20
   degrees. Torque measured in the brackets was different for loading and
   unloading.}},
