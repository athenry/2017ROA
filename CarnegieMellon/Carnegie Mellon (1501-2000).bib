Abstract = {{Granger causality is an established statistical measure of the ``causal
   influence{''} that one stochastic process X has on another process Y.
   Along with its more recent generalization - Directed Information -
   Granger Causality has been used extensively in neuroscience, and in
   complex interconnected systems in general, to infer statistical causal
   influences. More recently, many works compare the Granger causality
   metrics along forward and reverse links (from X to Y and from Y to X),
   and interpret the direction of greater causal influence as the
   ``direction of information flow{''}. In this paper, we question whether
   the direction yielded by comparing Granger Causality or Directed
   Information along forward and reverse links is always the same as the
   direction of information flow. We explore this question using two simple
   theoretical experiments, in which the true direction of information flow
   (the ``ground truth{''}) is known by design. The experiments are based
   on a communication system with a feedback channel, and employ a strategy
   inspired by the work of Schalkwijk and Kailath. We show that in these
   experiments, the direction of information flow can be opposite to the
   direction of greater Granger causal influence or Directed Information.
   We also provide information-theoretic intuition for why such
   counterexamples are not surprising, and why Granger causality-based
   information-flow inferences will only get more tenuous in larger
   networks. We conclude that one must not use comparison/difference of
   Granger causality to infer the direction of information flow.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed in the clinical and biosciences community that
   Electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamentally limited in the spatial
   resolution achieved using a few hundred electrodes. This belief rests on
   the well known decay of high-spatial frequencies as the signal passes
   from the brain surface to the scalp surface. These high spatial
   frequencies carry high spatial resolution information about the source.
   However, recent experimental work as well as our theoretical and
   numerical analyses strongly suggest that EEG's resolution could be
   improved significantly through increased electrode density despite this
   decay. Somewhat counterintuitively, instead of viewing this decay of
   spatial frequencies as a detriment to signal quality (which it is), in
   this work we propose an information-theoretic strategy to harness this
   decay to reduce circuit area and energy needed for high-resolution
   signal acquisition. This is made possible by the observation that this
   spatial-low-pass filtering of the signal as it passes from the brain to
   the scalp induces large spatial correlations that can be exploited
   information-theoretically. The proposed techniques are shown in
   idealized head models to reduce requirements on energy required for
   sensing by 3x. These results are being applied towards an ongoing
   project on developing the ``Neural Web,{''} a 10,000 electrode portable
   EEG system at CMU.}},

Abstract = {{In urban vehicular networks, Road-Side Units (RSUs) take a crucial role
   in improving the performance of the network, by working as content
   distribution points, relays for time-critical broadcasts, and points of
   central coordination. The high costs associated with the installation
   and maintenance of RSUs, however, keep these units from seeing
   widespread deployment. One approach to this problem is for cars to be
   used opportunistically as RSUs, and in urban areas, the presence of
   large numbers of parked cars make these entities promising candidates
   for establishing vehicular support networks.
   In this paper we introduce new methods for parked cars to self-organize
   and act as a support network to the existing urban vehicular network,
   alleviating the need for costly deployments of fixed road-side units.
   Our approach considers parked cars that can both complement existing
   fixed RSUs and take the role of RSUs themselves, improving the network's
   performance on multiple applications. We show that even a small number
   of parked cars can bring considerable improvements to the network, and
   that our proposed methods for self-organization create support networks
   of parked cars that can cover the urban area with an optimal numbers of
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Steady state analysis of power grids is typically performed using power
   flow analysis, where nonlinear balance equations of real and reactive
   power are solved to calculate the voltage magnitude, phase, and power at
   every bus. Transient analysis of the same power grids are performed
   using circuit simulation methods. We propose a novel approach to
   modeling the nonlinear steady state behavior of power grids in terms of
   equivalent circuits with currents and voltages as the state variables
   that is a step toward unifying transient and steady state models. A
   graph theoretic formulation approach is used to solve the circuits that
   enables incorporation of switch models for contingency analyses.
   Superior nonlinear steady state convergence is demonstrated by use of
   current as a state variable and application of circuit simulation
   methods. Furthermore, current and voltage state variables will offer
   greater compatibility with future smart grid components and monitors.}},

Abstract = {{The recent trend towards accommodating more distributed resources in
   power systems motivates a transition from the current highly centralized
   control structure to a more distributed control structure. In this
   paper, we propose an asynchronous iterative distributed solution
   approach for the DC Optimal Power Flow problem. This approach
   constitutes an iterative procedure that solves first order optimality
   conditions of the Optimal Power Flow problem in a distributed manner. In
   this distributed algorithm, each bus is responsible for updating a few
   local variables, and network coordination is achieved through local
   information exchanges between neighboring buses. Since information
   exchange at each variable update iteration might be prohibitive for an
   actual implementation, we propose an asynchronous iterative procedure.
   The asynchronous implementation divides the buses into areas, and
   requires the buses in the same area to exchange information after each
   iteration, while communication between the areas occurs only after
   multiple iterations. We further suggest that sharing additional
   information appropriately between areas without physical connections
   across the system can speed up the convergence of the algorithm. A proof
   of concept is provided using the IEEE RTS and IEEE 118-bus test systems.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-based security indexes can be used as a constraint in OPF to
   determine the most economic generation dispatch while ensuring that the

   this paper, a risk-constrained AC OPF that limits the individual risk of
   each considered system state is proposed. The resulting optimization
   problem is solved by a centralized method and iterative algorithm based
   on locational security impact factors, which quantify the impact of a
   change of a generator output on the risk of a certain system state. The
   comparison of these methods in terms of the simulation time and solution
   accuracy as well as the analysis of limiting the total versus individual

Abstract = {{Numerical measures of similarity/distance between objects represented by
   binary vectors are common in a wide range of disciplines. Searching in
   large-scale chemical databases requires billions of comparisons between
   molecules that are represented by binary fingerprints to capture the
   atomic structure. The performance bottleneck here is the enumeration of
   set bits in vectors (population count). Due to the discrete
   representation, similarity measures between binary fingerprints should
   fit well to FPGAs. We present an architecture to accelerate binary
   similarity assessment, evaluate various design points, and compare
   performance to highly optimized CPU and GPU implementations. We
   implement an RTL generation software, SimGenRTL, to generate
   accelerators of various sizes based on the proposed architecture. We
   find that accelerators with fewer and wider population counters allow
   better distribution of the hardware resources, outperforming
   significantly accelerators with more and narrower bit-enumeration
   components. SimGenRTL is available for download to allow rapid design
   space exploration of the computational core ahead of a full custom

Abstract = {{Upsampling of a multi-dimensional data-set is an operation with wide
   application in image processing and quantum mechanical calculations
   using density functional theory. For small upsampling factors as seen in
   the quantum chemistry code ONETEP, a time-shift based implementation
   that shifts samples by a fraction of the original grid spacing to fill
   in the intermediate values using a frequency domain Fourier property can
   be a good choice. Readily available highly optimized multidimensional
   FFT implementations are leveraged at the expense of extra passes through
   the entire working set. In this paper we present an optimized variant of
   the time-shift based upsampling. Since ONETEP handles threading, we
   address the memory hierarchy and SIMD vectorization, and focus on
   problem dimensions relevant for ONETEP. We present a formalization of
   this operation within the SPIRAL framework and demonstrate
   auto-generated and auto-tuned interpolation libraries. We compare the
   performance of our generated code against the previous best
   implementations using highly optimized FFT libraries (FFTW and MKL). We
   demonstrate speed-ups in isolation averaging 3x and within ONETEP of up
   to 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Programmers often need to revert some code to an earlier state, or
   restore a block of code that was deleted a while ago. However, support
   for this backtracking in modern programming environments is limited.
   Many of the backtracking tasks can be accomplished by having a selective
   undo feature in code editors, but this has major challenges: there can
   be conflicts among edit operations, and it is difficult to provide
   usable interfaces for selective undo. In this paper, we present AZURITE,
   an Eclipse plug-in that allows programmers to selectively undo
   fine-grained code changes made in the code editor. With AZURITE,
   programmers can easily perform backtracking tasks, even when the desired
   code is not in the undo stack or a version control system. AZURITE also
   provides novel user interfaces specifically designed for selective undo,
   which were iteratively improved through user feedback gathered from
   actual users in a preliminary field trial. A formal lab study showed
   that programmers can successfully use AZURITE, and were twice as fast as
   when limited to conventional features.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates two alternatives to today's noise-limited
   single-transmitter broadcast television systems, either of which would
   improve spectrum efficiency. One alternative is to increase the transmit
   power of each broadcaster's only transmitter. The other alternative is
   to replace that single transmitter with a multi-transmitter single
   frequency network (SFN). For both approaches, this paper calculates the
   relationship between the maximum achievable spectrum efficiency and the
   cost required to achieve that efficiency as a function of the most
   important design parameters. Results suggest that increasing power of
   traditional single-transmitter broadcasters could reduce the amount of
   spectrum needed for TV by roughly 30\%, and would be cost-effective
   today through much of the U.S. A switch to SFNs could reduce the amount
   of spectrum needed for TV by roughly 60\%, but at a higher cost. Results
   suggest that the SFN approach could be cost-effective in the most
   densely populated regions where spectrum is most valuable.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum Aggregation (SA) technology has been introduced in cellular
   standards: Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced is expected to aggregate
   multiple Component Carriers (CC) to fulfill the high data rate
   requirement. In this paper, we use simulation to compare the performance
   of a cellular system using spectrum aggregation to systems that operates
   carriers independently, and to systems with contiguous spectrum. We vary
   a large number of assumptions to generate a comprehensive picture of
   spectrum aggregation's impact on cellular network performance. Under
   spectrum aggregation, users are assigned resource blocks from across all
   carriers. For Independent Carrier (IC) systems we model a simple carrier
   selection technique, which assigns a single carrier to each user. To
   fully understand the impact of SA, spectrum allocation is varied from
   contiguous to fragmented carriers across bands ranging from UHF to 2.6
   GHz. This creates multiple network scenarios including intra-band and
   inter-band spectrum aggregation systems. Results show that LTE systems
   that use spectrum aggregation over fragmented blocks of spectrum can
   have better performance compared to independent carrier systems.
   Moreover, at low inter-site distances, the performance of inter-band SA
   is equivalent to that of contiguous low band spectrum, and superior to
   contiguous high band spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the integration of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Smart
   grid technologies is proposed as an avenue for increasing the volume of
   sustainable energy supply. Agriculture constitutes a large load to
   accomplish tasks such as irrigation, crop collection and processing.
   Furthermore, it has an untapped potential for generation of energy from
   agricultural residue and waste. PA involves exacting and precise
   measurements of different variables of interest, be it related to
   consumption or generation of energy. This provides information that can
   increase the accuracy of energy demand and supply forecasting, the basis
   of better load management in Smart grid. Such integration has the
   potential to benefit agricultural systems through reduced costs of input
   including costs of waste disposal. Furthermore it may also positively
   benefit the environment through consumption of carbon neutral fuels. In
   addition, if the better energy management is utilized to give some
   excess power to the villages around smart farms, it can form the basis
   for power generation for remote communities.}},

   criterion to control mechanical systems and optimize their energy
   consumptions, few studies examined individual thermal comfort
   preferences and their implications. This study aims to investigate the
   individual thermal comfort preferences in an office space. An online
   dashboard is developed to collect subjective thermal comfort data from
   office workers. The data then is compared and correlated with the
   measured key environmental data, such as air temperature and relative
   humidity. The data analysis results suggested that different occupants
   have various preferences about thermal comfort yet each individual has
   fair consistent thermal preference over time. In future study, the
   dashboard could be linked to the real-time control system to provide
   individual thermal control for office workers.}},

Abstract = {{Designing massively scalable, highly available big data systems is an
   immense challenge for software architects. Big data applications require
   distributed systems design principles to create scalable solutions, and
   the selection and adoption of open source and commercial technologies
   that can provide the required quality attributes. In big data systems,
   the data management layer presents unique engineering problems, arising
   from the proliferation of new data models and distributed technologies
   for building scalable, available data stores. Architects must
   consequently compare candidate database technology features and select
   platforms that can satisfy application quality and cost requirements. In
   practice, the inevitable absence of up-to-date, reliable technology
   evaluation sources makes this comparison exercise a highly exploratory,
   unstructured task. To address these problems, we have created a detailed
   feature taxonomy that enables rigorous comparison and evaluation of
   distributed database platforms. The taxonomy captures the major
   architectural characteristics of distributed databases, including data
   model and query capabilities. In this paper we present the major
   elements of the feature taxonomy, and demonstrate its utility by
   populating the taxonomy for nine different database technologies. We
   also briefly describe QuABaseBD, a knowledge base that we have built to
   support the population and querying of database features by software
   architects. QuABaseBD links the taxonomy to general quality attribute
   scenarios and design tactics for big data systems. This creates a
   unique, dynamic knowledge resource for architects building big data
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic manipulators that use joystick interfaces for telemanipulation
   take time and effort to master and lack an intuitive basis for human
   robot interaction. These factors can hamper operator performance,
   increase cognitive workload, and limit overall user effectiveness on
   highly dexterous tasks. Master-slave interfaces (MSIs) used in the
   fields of animatronics, telesurgery, and hazardous materials handling
   are intuitive and improve operator performance, but are limited because
   they typically operate in a controlled environment and lack robustness.
   When Master Slave (MS) controllers use force-feedback errors can
   accumulate and create instabilities due to the synchronous bilateral
   communication between the remote and local systems. Instability can be
   mitigated and errors reduced in these systems by separating the
   bilateral communication into a dual-unilateral (DU) asynchronous
   communication. This research focused on comparing and analyzing current
   MSI controllers with a new DU control method that reduces or eliminates
   MSI issues such as latency, error, and information loss while providing
   the user with accurate force-feedback capability and transparency during
   operation. It used a simulation-based approach to determine which
   selected MSI controllers provide users with robust control of dexterous
   manipulators under time delay. Users performed a variety of dexterous
   force-feedback tasks with different controllers and the study measured
   objective task performance and completion time success along with
   cognitive workload related to user perceived task interaction and mental
   demands through subjective ratings on the NASA (National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration) Task Load Index (TLX). The research findings will
   help to develop MSI controllers designed to provide operators robust and
   intuitive interfaces for low-level control of dexterous manipulators.}},

   optimized coefficients to increase the surface continuity to G(1).

Abstract = {{Building automation systems are believed to hold the key to
   significantly reducing the average energy consumption of our residential
   and commercial building stock, which in the U.S. is responsible for 41\%
   of the total annual energy use in 2014. As these systems become more
   widespread and inexpensive, the complexity and challenges associated
   with their installation, maintenance and upkeep will increase. One of
   the primary challenges is the generation and update of the meta-data
   associated with the sensors and control points distributed throughout
   the facility. Previous research has attempted to reduce the human input
   required to perform these activities, by leveraging different signal
   processing and statistical analysis approaches to infer the sensor types
   and locations from measurements and/or tags obtained through a BAS.
   However, because of the relatively small sample size, the feasibility of
   applying these type approaches on large buildings, as well as their
   generalizability, remain as unsolved questions. In this paper, we
   propose a meta-data inference framework to learn from BAS measurement
   data in a semi-automated way. Furthermore, we evaluate the framework on
   two large buildings instrumented with thousands sensors and show the
   feasibility of applying data-driven approaches in the real world. We
   present the results of our study and provide recommendations for future
   work in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Non-Technical Loss (NTL) represents a major challenge when providing
   reliable electrical service in developing countries, where it often
   accounts for 11-15\% of total generation capacity {[}1]. NTL is caused
   by a variety of factors such as theft, unmetered homes, and inability to
   pay which at volume can lead to system instability, grid failure, and
   major financial losses for providers.
   In this paper, we investigate error sources and techniques for
   separating NTL from total losses in microgrids. Our approach models the
   primary sources of state uncertainty including line losses, transformer
   losses, meter calibration error, packet loss, and sample synchronization
   error. We conduct an extensive data-driven simulation on 72 days of
   wireless meter data from a 430-home microgrid deployed in Les Anglais,
   Haiti. We show that the model can be used to determine uncertainty
   bounds that can help in separating NTL from total losses.}},

   spacings to different surface resolutions. Moreover, an anisotropy
   defined from an input scalar field can also be achieved. From the
   parameterization results, we extract adaptive and anisotropic T-meshes
   for the further T-spline surface construction. Finally, a gradient
   flow-based method is developed to improve the T-mesh quality, with the
   anisotropy preserved in the quadrilateral elements. The effectiveness of
   the presented algorithm has been verified using several large

Abstract = {{Most existing packet-based on-chip networks assume routers have buffers
   to buffer packets at times of contention. Recently, deflection-based
   bufferless routing algorithms have been proposed as an alternative
   design to reduce the area, power, and complexity disadvantages
   associated with buffering in routers. While bufferless routing shows
   significant promise at an algorithmic level, these algorithms have not
   been shown to be efficiently implementable in practice. Neither were
   they extensively compared to existing buffered routing algorithms in
   realistic designs. This paper presents our comparative evaluation of and
   experiences with realistic FPGA and ASIC designs of state-of-the-art (1)
   virtual-channel buffered, (2) deflection-based bufferless, and (3)
   deflection-based buffered routing algorithms using two different network
   topologies and network sizes. We show that bufferless routing algorithms
   are implementable without significant complexity, and compare their
   performance, area, frequency, and power consumption to their buffered
   counterparts. Our results indicate that bufferless routing can lead to
   significant area (38\%), power consumption (30\%), and router cycle time
   (8\%) reductions over the best buffered router implementation on 65nm
   ASIC design, while operating at higher frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Dirt Jumper is a powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) family of
   toolkits (e.g., includes Drive version x, Dirt Jumper version x, and
   Pandora) sold in online black markets. The buyers are typically
   individuals who seek to infect computers globally and incite them to
   collectively emit crippling unsolicited network traffic to unsuspecting
   targets, often for criminal purposes. The Dirt Jumper Family (DJF) of
   botnets is not new; however, new variants have made the family more
   destructive and more relevant. The DJF has caused millions of dollars of
   damage across several different business sectors. Notably in 2014, a
   European media company was attacked with a 10-hour, 200 gigabit per
   second DDoS campaign with an estimated impact of \$20M. Traditional
   defensive measures, like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and
   defense-in-depth, are not always effective. The threat may hasten the
   emergence of active defenses to protect Internet-based revenue streams
   or intellectual property. In practice, some companies have either found
   legal loopholes that provide immunity, or have decided to leverage the
   budding relationship between the government and the private sector to
   Hack Back with implied immunity. Either way, tools are currently being
   used to defend against hacking. This paper provides: (1) an overview of
   the present threat posed by the Dirt Jumper family of DDoS toolkits, (2)
   an overview of the Hacking Back debate and clear examples of the use of
   legal loopholes or implied immunity, and (3) novel offensive campaigns
   that could be used to stop active DDoS attacks by exploiting
   vulnerabilities in the botnet's command and control (C\&C). Our work
   could be the first steps toward a cyber-deterrence strategy for hacking
   and cyber espionage, which is a National Security imperative.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately estimating the rare failure rates for nanoscale memory
   circuits is a challenging task, especially when the variation space is
   high-dimensional. In this paper, we summarize two novel techniques to
   address this technical challenge. First, we describe a subset simulation
   (SUS) technique to estimate the rare failure rates for continuous
   performance metrics. The key idea of SUS is to express the rare failure
   probability of a given circuit as the product of several large
   conditional probabilities by introducing a number of intermediate
   failure events. These conditional probabilities can be efficiently
   estimated with a set of Markov chain Monte Carlo samples generated by a
   modified Metropolis algorithm. Second, to efficiently estimate the rare
   failure rates for discrete performance metrics, scaled-sigma sampling
   (SSS) can be used. SSS aims to generate random samples from a distorted
   probability distribution for which the standard deviation (i.e., sigma)
   is scaled up. Next, the failure rate is accurately estimated from these
   scaled random samples by using an analytical model derived from the
   theorem of ``soft maximum{''}. Our experimental results of several
   nanoscale circuit examples demonstrate that SUS and SSS achieve
   significantly improved accuracy over other traditional techniques when
   the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a few hundred.}},

   (e.g., wireless transceivers). In this paper we propose a novel
   algorithm to find the optimal macromodel that minimizes the modeling
   error based on measurement data, while simultaneously guaranteeing
   passivity. The key idea is to attack the passive macromodeling problem
   by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP)
   problems. As such, the proposed method can iteratively find the optimal
   poles and zeros for macromodeling. Our experimental results with several
   commercial RF circuit examples demonstrate that the proposed
   macromodeling method reduces the modeling error by 1.31-2.74x over other
   conventional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a post-layout waveform prediction method by
   System Identification (SI) based on the fact that the waveforms of
   pre-layout and post-layout are always correlated. Mathematical models
   are built to describe the relationships between the pre-layout and
   post-layout simulation results via SI techniques. The model parameters
   are calibrated by using the simulation results of the first few data
   points of pre-layout and post-layout stages. By taking the corresponding
   pre-layout simulation results as inputs of the calibrated models, the
   rest post-layout waveforms can thus be predicted as the output of the
   models. Several examples demonstrate the efficiency of the prediction,
   which helps the designers have a quick view of the post-layout waveforms
   in the design process.}},

Abstract = {{The classical Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm is defined within a
   framework of synchronous repeated play. In practice, the global
   synchronization assumed in classical FP can be difficult to achieve in
   large-scale multi-agent settings. The paper considers FP with
   asynchronous updates-a variant of FP in which players are permitted to
   be either ``active{''} or ``idle{''} in each stage of the repeated play
   process. The FP process with asynchronous updates is shown to be a
   generalization of classical FP. Analytical convergence results are given
   for the asynchronous variant of FP. Furthermore, the paper studies an
   asynchronous continuous-time embedding of FP. The continuous-time
   embedded FP process may be implemented in a real-world setting where no
   global clock is available. Sufficient conditions for convergence of the
   continuous-time embedded process are provided as a consequence of the
   convergence analysis for FP with asynchronous updates. Example
   implementations that attain the sufficient condition are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We study the spread of two strains of virus competing for space in a
   network modeled by the classical logistic ordinary differential
   equations. In large-scale complex networks, the underlying nonlinear
   dynamical system is high-dimensional and performing qualitative analysis
   of the differential equation becomes prohibitive. The study of such
   systems is often deferred to numerical simulations or local analysis
   about equilibrium points of the system. In this paper, we extend the
   work developed in {[}1], to formally establish a simple sufficient
   condition for (exponentially fast) survival of the fittest in a bi-layer
   weighted digraph: the weaker strain dies out regardless of the initial
   conditions if its maximum in-flow rate of infection across nodes is
   smaller than the minimum in-flow rate of the stronger strain. We bound
   any solution of the logistic ODE by one-dimensional solutions over
   certain homogeneous networks, for which the system is well understood.
   Our global stability approach via bounds readily applies to the
   discrete-time logistic model counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has a rich mix of renewable energy sources
   (RES) most of which are massively underutilized in as far as electricity
   generation from them is concerned. This is largely attributed to the
   lack of adequate energy infrastructure and the high capital costs
   associated with the deployment of requisite infrastructure. In order to
   attract and justify investment in this area, there is need for
   sustainable demand with sufficient loads able to sink the generated
   power. However, this is not the case in the region as many communities
   are poor especially those in rural and remote areas. It is also worth
   noting that lack of electricity is closely correlated with poverty and
   thus the need to avail these communities with affordable electricity as
   to attain long-term mutual benefits. Since most of the RES in the region
   are wide spread and populations live in clusters, generation is expected
   to be distributed. This justifies the use of standalone autonomous
   systems, i. e.-Microgrids that are able to connect to the grid.
   Microgrids offer an affordable and reliable solution as compared to grid
   extension to areas that are located far from the grid. They also allow
   for renewable and fossil fuel incorporation thus serving as the most
   ideal solution to addressing SSA's source, storage and load
   interconnection needs. In this paper, the effects of lack of electricity
   in SSA are investigated, the challenges facing rural electrification in
   the region are analyzed and some feasible technical and financial
   solutions needed to avert these shortcomings are proposed. HOMER
   simulation results for optimal microgrid configurations in Nyakabanda,
   Rwanda as a test case are also documented.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids are gaining momentum in the modern power world. This is
   largely due to their proximity to loads, their relatively high renewable
   energy penetration and their minimal complexity. Microgrids with high
   renewable energy content suit well developing countries and Sub-Saharan
   African countries in particular. Because these countries consist of
   primarily distributed and mostly remote rural communities whose energy
   needs are relatively low, grid extension becomes quite a costly option.
   Luckily, Sub-Saharan Africa is endowed with lots of untapped renewable
   energy potentials, and only by fully tapping them can it achieve
   sustainable socio-economic development through increased rural
   electrification. In this paper, energy potentials of the Sub-Saharan
   region as well as various challenges that impede rural electrification
   efforts in this part of the continent are presented first. Then,
   feasible solutions are suggested for this poverty stricken region in
   general and, finally, Rwanda is particularly considered as a focus case.
   Electrification solutions for Rwamiko village in Rwanda are simulated
   using HOMER and a microgrid made up by PV, batteries and a microhydro
   plant proved to be a more viable solution than grid extension to the
   village. These results can serve as a reference for future rural
   electrification projects in Rwanda and Sub-Saharan Africa in general.}},

Abstract = {{Modern power utility systems consist of multiple substations forming a
   complex energy network. These substations are being automated with
   globally accepted communication standard IEC 61850. The automation
   results in efficient operation and enhanced protection of power network
   with communication system. Implementing the protection schemes modelled
   with communication configurations with standardized information exchange
   will lead to digital power grid. Designing a protection scheme between
   multiple substations based on IEC 61850 communication configuration is a
   challenge. This paper presents communication configuration for line
   current differential protection schemes applied between two automated
   substations. This paper also presents the simulation of communication
   configuration network between two substations for its performance
   evaluation using a network simulator tool. These simulation results will
   result in realizing robust protection scheme with IEC 61850 based
   communication configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical modeling of cellular/subcellular shapes is required for
   quantifying shape variations and understanding complex cell behaviors.
   Such statistical models rely on the choice of a proper similarity
   measure. In this paper we introduce a symmetric deformation-based

   based on finding an optimal diffeomorphic mapping between shape images
   that minimizes a physically meaningful energy function. We compare our
   proposed method to the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping
   (LDDMM) and the standard Euclidean metric on a nuclei dataset and show
   that the proposed method outperforms the others in capturing the

Abstract = {{Intracellular transport is the process of distributing and collecting
   materials, often packaged in different forms of cargoes, to fulfill
   changing structural and functional needs within the cell. Although the
   molecular machinery for intracellular transport has largely been
   identified, how this process is regulated globally in space and time
   remains unclear. In a step towards answering this question, we developed
   an image-based computational method for characterizing spatiotemporal
   dynamics of intracellular transport at the whole-cell scale to separate
   signals of moving and stationary cargoes. Specifically, we extended an
   algorithm that we developed previously for removing background
   fluorescence of static images. This separation allows us to extract from
   time-lapse images the global pattern of cargo movement without single
   particle tracking of individual cargoes. Based on this separation, we
   characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular transport in
   terms of the spatial localization of stationary cargoes and the
   spatiotemporal patterns of cargo movement, respectively. We first tested
   and validated our methods using synthetic images. We then used our
   methods to analyze time-lapse images of Lamp1 transport and found
   different global patterns of transport behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Super resolution localization microscopy (SRLM) techniques such as STORM
   and PALM overcome the similar to 200nm diffraction limit of conventional
   light microscopy by randomly activating separate fluorophores over time
   and computationally aggregating their nanometer resolution detected
   locations for image reconstruction. However, a basic limitation of
   current SRLM approaches for live cell imaging is their low temporal
   resolution due to motion blur, which arises if image objects move during
   image acquisition of the substantial number of raw images required for
   constructing the super-resolution image for a given time point. To
   overcome this limitation, we propose a sliding-window data aggregation
   method, which exploits the temporal correlation between the collected
   fluorescence images to achieve significantly higher frame rate and
   therefore better temporal resolution than current approaches.
   Specifically, images within a sliding window are aligned so that
   locations of detected fluorophores within them are aggregated to
   accelerate image reconstruction for higher temporal resolution. We
   tested and validated our method using both simulated and real live cell
   STORM image data.}},

Abstract = {{TCP/IP is the predominant communication protocol in modern networks but
   also one of the most demanding. Consequently, TCP/IP offload is becoming
   increasingly popular with standard network interface cards. TCP/IP
   Offload Engines have also emerged for FPGAs, and are being offered by
   vendors such as Intilop, Fraunhofer HHI, PLDA and Dini Group. With the
   target application being high-frequency trading, these implementations
   focus on low latency and support a limited session count. However, many
   more applications beyond high-frequency trading can potentially be
   accelerated inside an FPGA once TCP with high session count is available
   inside the fabric. This way, a network-attached FPGA on ingress and
   egress to a CPU can accelerate functions such as encryption,
   compression, memcached and many others in addition to running the
   complete network stack.
   This paper introduces a novel architecture for a 10 Gbps line-rate
   TCP/IP stack for FPGAs that can scale with the number of sessions and
   thereby addresses these new applications. We prototyped the design on a
   VC709 development board, demonstrating compatibility with existing
   network infrastructure, operating at full 10 Gbps throughput full-duplex
   while supporting 10,000 sessions. Finally, the design has been described
   primarily using high-level synthesis, which accelerates development time
   and improves maintainability.}},

   anomaly detection system based on the concept of flow similarity. It
   stems from the observation that, in general, the number of responses
   generated by a component closely follows the number of received
   requests, but this relation stops holding in presence of performance
   anomalies. In FSAD, components are regarded as black boxes, and time
   series of incoming and outgoing packets are fed to the flow similarity

   the work carried out at the previous iterations of the International
   Workshop on Realizing Artificial Intelligence Synergies in Software
   Engineering, which were held at ICSE in 2012, 2013 and 2014. RAISE 2015
   brought together researchers and practitioners from the artificial
   intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE) disciplines to build on
   the interdisciplinary synergies that exist and to stimulate further
   interaction across these disciplines. Mutually beneficial
   characteristics have appeared in the past few decades and are still
   evolving due to new challenges and technological advances. Hence, the
   question that motivates and drives the RAISE Workshop series is: ``Are
   SE and AI researchers ignoring important insights from AI and SE?{''}.
   To pursue this question, RAISE'15 explored not only the application of
   AI techniques to SE problems but also the application of SE techniques
   to AI problems. RAISE not only strengthens the AI-and-SE community but
   also continues to develop a roadmap of strategic research directions for
   AI and SE.}},

Abstract = {{Software engineers and architects of complex software systems need to
   balance hard quality attribute requirements while at the same time
   manage risks and make decisions with a system-wide and long-lasting
   impact. To achieve these tasks efficiently, they need quantitative
   information about design-time and run-time system aspects through usable
   and quick tools. While there is body of work focusing on code quality
   and metrics, their applicability at the design and architecture level
   and at scale are inconsistent and not proven. We are interested in
   exploring whether architecture can assist with better contextualizing
   existing system and code quality and metrics approaches. Furthermore, we
   ask whether we need additional architecture-level metrics to make
   progress and whether something as complex and subtle as software
   architecture can be quantified. The goal of this workshop is to discuss
   progress, gather empirical evidence, and identify priorities for a
   research agenda on architecture and metrics in the software engineering
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Differing perceptions and expectations are obstacles to collaboration
   between software engineering (SE) researchers and practitioners:
   Researchers often have a view that practitioners are reluctant to share
   real data. Practitioners believe that researchers are mostly working on
   topics which are divorced from real industrial needs. Researchers
   believe that practitioners are looking for quick fixes. Practitioners
   have a view that case studies in research do not represent the
   complexities of real projects. Researchers may expect a few years to do
   research on a problem whereas practitioners expect a quick solution that
   pays off immediately.
   Researchers and practitioners need to identify the gaps and to discover
   the ways to collaborate to strengthen SE research and industrial
   practice (IP). The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together
   researchers and practitioners to discuss the current state of SE
   research and IP and to enhance collaboration between them. The SER\&IP
   2015 workshop provided a platform to share success stories of SE
   research-practice partnerships as well as to discuss the challenges,
   through a day-long agenda of keynotes, paper presentations and round
   table discussions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose Last Writer Slicing (LWS), a mechanism for tracking data
   provenance information in multithreaded code in a production setting.
   Last writer slices dynamically track provenance of values by recording
   the thread and operation that last wrote each variable. We show that
   this information complements core dumps and greatly improves
   debugability. We also propose communication traps (CTraps), an
   extensible framework that uses LWS to interpose on operations that lead
   to inter-thread communication. We show how to use CTraps to implement
   multiple dynamic analysis tools for mulithreaded programs. Our
   evaluation on server programs and PARSEC benchmarks shows that LWS has
   low run time overheads (0-15\%) for many applications, including
   memcached, LevelDB, MySQL, and Apache. Our debugging case studies of
   real, buggy programs shows that LWS are indeed useful for debugging.}},

Abstract = {{Side channel attacks exploit inadvertent information leakage from the
   physical implementation of computing systems, bypassing the theoretical
   strength of cryptographic algorithms. Of particular concern are software
   side-channel attacks which can be mounted remotely without access or
   alteration of the hardware system. One type of attack that has been
   demonstrated to be highly effective is cache timing attacks that exploit
   cache replacement policies to discern information about the data being
   processed. In this paper, we present a secure cache design that defeats
   software side-channel attacks targeted at hardware caches. The
   memory-to-cache mapping is dynamic and randomized by replacing the
   address decoder of a conventional cache with a CAM. We fabricated a
   prototype 32kB secure cache along with a conventional 8-way version for
   comparison on a 65nm bulk CMOS process. The prototype operates at 500
   MHz, dissipating 117 mW at the nominal 1V VDD. Compared to the
   conventional design, the secure cache has an 10\% area overhead, 20\%
   power overhead at iso-performance.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-meters benefit many grid and building-level energy management
   applications like automated load control and load scheduling. However,
   installing and maintaining large and/ or long term deployments of such
   meters requires assignment and updating of the identity (labels) of
   electrical loads connected to them. Although the literature on
   electricity disaggregation and appliance identification is extensive,
   there is no consensus on the generalizability of the proposed solutions,
   especially with respect to the features that are extracted from voltage
   and current measurements. In this paper, we begin to address this
   problem by comparing the discriminative power of commonly used features.
   Specifically, we carry out tests on PLAID, a publicly available
   high-frequency dataset of hundreds of residential appliances. By
   examining how the classification accuracy changes with sampling
   frequency, we also explore the computational complexity of these
   techniques to understand the feasibility and design of a hardware setup
   that can perform these calculations in near real-time.}},

Abstract = {{Metering of electricity consumption, both at the building-level and
   appliance-level, provides stakeholders like residents, facility
   managers, building owners, etc. with information requisite to engage in
   energy efficient practices. Currently available solutions for
   appliance-level energy metering require the installation of plug-through
   power meters; this is often difficult and costly for appliances with
   inaccessible wires/outlets, or for appliances that draw large amounts of
   current. In this paper, we utilize a framework that performs the step of
   energy estimation for load disaggregation, in order to substitute the
   need of plug-level sensors with cheap and easily deployable contactless
   sensors (e.g., light, sound, magnetic field sensors). The framework
   combines data from these contactless sensors and aggregate metering, in
   order to virtually meter the electricity consumption of specific
   appliances. The solution requires minimal calibration, and is easily
   performed using commercially available sensors. We test it in a
   commercial building with 6 appliances that are monitored using magnetic
   field sensors and find that the inferred energy values have an average
   error of 10.9\%.}},

Abstract = {{The interest in distributed control methods for power systems is
   motivated by the need for scalable solutions to handle the coordination
   of an increasing number of distributed resources. This paper presents a
   fully distributed multilevel method to solve the DC Optimal Power Flow
   problem (DC-OPF). Our proposed approach constitutes a distributed
   iterative mechanism to solve the first order optimality conditions of
   the DC-OPF problem using the fact that optimality conditions involve
   local variable couplings. The proposed distributed structure requires
   each bus to update a few local variables and exchange information with
   neighboring buses. Our multilevel distributed approach distributes the
   computation at several levels, i.e., nodes, subareas and areas. It
   allows for synchronous information exchanges, i.e., after each
   iteration, at the nodal level and asynchronous communication, i.e.,

Abstract = {{Identifying the source of network diffusion is an important task in
   applications such as epidemics management and understanding the trend
   propagation over social networks. As observing each node carries a cost,
   we study the problem of sequential selection of observed nodes from two
   aspects: which nodes to observe such that the source is localized with
   the lowest cost, and for a pre-specified number of time-steps, which
   nodes to observe such that the resulting number of possible source
   candidates is the lowest. We show that both problems can be framed,
   under a simple propagation scenario, as dynamic programing with
   imperfect state knowledge. The proposed approach is optimal, but
   computationally intensive, hence we propose two simple greedy
   strategies. Using adaptive submodularity, we provide performance
   guarantees for one greedy algorithm. We evaluate the proposed approaches
   through simulation.}},

   Taking advantage of a context-based region of interest, we are able to

   in road coordinates enables finding the distance-keeping target on any
   curved road, while a commercial Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system
   works best on straight roads. We demonstrate that the overall
   performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of a
   commercial ACC system. The distance-keeping target can either be used
   for lane following for a standalone ACC system or an autonomous vehicle.
   Our object tracking algorithm can also be extended to find the target of

   measurement to identify NoSQL products that fit data model and query use
   cases, and meet performance requirements. We found that database
   throughput varied by a factor of 10, read operation latency varied by a
   factor of 5, and write latency by a factor of 4 (with the highest
   throughput product delivering the highest latency). We also found that
   the throughput for workloads using strong consistency was 10-25\% lower
   than workloads using eventual consistency. We conclude by reflecting on
   some of the fundamental difficulties of performing detailed technical
   evaluations of NoSQL databases specifically, and big data systems in

Abstract = {{Hardware true random number generators are an essential functional block
   in many secure systems. Current designs that use bi-stable elements
   balanced in the metastable region are capable of both high randomness
   and high bitrate. However, these designs require extensive support
   circuits to maintain balance in the metastable region, complex built-in
   self test loops to configure the support circuits, and suffer from
   sensitivity to environmental conditions. We propose a true random number
   generator design based around sense amplifier circuits that are balanced
   in the metastable region using hot carrier injection, rather than
   complex support circuits. Further, we show an architecture that
   maintains high entropy output across a range of +/- 20\% voltage
   variation. Experimental results from a prototype design in a 65nm bulk
   CMOS process demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed TRNG architecture,
   which passes all NIST tests.}},

Abstract = {{Differential power analysis (DPA) has been shown to be a highly
   effective and easy to mount side-channel attack. One effective method of
   increasing DPA resistance is to use three-phase dual-rail pre-charge
   logic (TDPL), but this type of logic is vulnerable to manipulation of
   the clock generation/distribution hardware. If an attacker can slow down
   the clock, separate the evaluate phase from the discharge phase, or
   eliminate the discharge phase entirely, the DPA resistance of TDPL is no
   better than a basic dynamic dual rail logic family. To counter such
   attacks, we propose a self-timed three-phase dual-rail pre-charge logic
   family (ST-TDPL), which internally generates the discharge clock in a
   distributed manner. Thus, an attacker cannot split the discharge phase
   from the evaluate phase. We compare the area, energy, and normalized
   energy deviation (NED) of ST-TDPL against Simple TDPL, Simple TDPL with
   no discharge phase, and static CMOS using an iso-performance design
   point (i.e., all gates have the same delay) in an industrial 65nm bulk
   CMOS. The results show that ST-TDPL achieves a similarly low NED value
   as TDPL, while also providing protection against attacks on the clocking
   infrastructure.}},

   significant occlusion from weeds and branches as well as non-standing

   Parts Model (DPM) algorithms from the literature, as well as our own
   implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We show that the
   traditional performance metric used in the pedestrian detection
   literature is extremely sensitive to parameterization. When applied in
   domains like this one, where localization is challenging due to high
   background texture and occlusion, the choice of overlap threshold
   strongly affects measured performance. Using a permissive overlap
   threshold, we found that ACF, DPM, and CNN perform similarly overall in

   controller guarantees transient stability of a generator as well as
   regulation of its terminal voltage during transients and zero real power
   exhange of the STATCOM/BESS with the grid in steady-state. First, we
   derive the decoupled real (P) and reactive power (Q) controller using a
   Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and the Backstepping method. By using
   the derived controller and a proper membership function we derive a
   Multi-Objective controller that additionally regulates the STATCOM/BESS
   real current output to zero after the transients. We demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed controller against a benchmark controller on
   the modified IEEE 14 bus system during a critical contingency scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization problems in power systems become larger and larger due
   to the increased number of variables from distributed generation and
   flexible loads. Hence, there has been growing interest in decomposition
   methods that facilitate distributed decision making. However, limited
   effort has been spent on the actual implementation of decomposition
   methods including determining how to partition the problem and what
   information to exchange among subproblems, which may greatly impact the
   efficiency of decomposition methods. In this paper, we evaluate the
   effects of partitioning on the convergence speed of decomposition
   methods for solving the AC Optimal Power Flow problem. In addition, we
   propose a speed-up method for the Optimality Condition Decomposition by
   adding a correction term to refine the search direction. Simulations on
   the IEEE-30 system show that the convergence speed of the decomposition
   method can be significantly improved by using a proper partition of the
   system and the correction term.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum smelting is an energy-intensive electrolytic process that is
   widely used to produce aluminum. The electricity cost thereby
   constitutes a significant portion of the total operation cost. At the
   same time, the smelting process is able to change its power consumption
   both accurately and quickly by controlling the pots' DC voltage, without
   affecting the production quality. Hence, an aluminum smelter has both
   the motivation and the ability to participate in demand-side management.
   By bidding into the electricity market, the smelter provides flexibility
   to the power system operator and gets compensation which reduces the
   overall electricity cost. In this paper, we focus on determining the
   optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead energy and spinning reserve
   markets for an aluminum smelter. The approach is based on stochastic
   programming in which the market prices are the stochastic variables.
   Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and provide
   insights into the demand-side management for industrial plants.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum smelting is an energy-intensive electrolytic process that is
   widely used to produce aluminum. The electricity cost thereby
   constitutes a significant portion of the total operation cost. At the
   same time, the smelting process is able to change its power consumption
   both accurately and quickly by controlling the pots' DC voltage, without
   affecting the production quality. Hence, an aluminum smelter has both
   the motivation and the ability to participate in demand-side management.
   By bidding into the electricity market, the smelter provides flexibility
   to the power system operator and gets compensation which reduces the
   overall electricity cost. In this paper, we focus on determining the
   optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead energy and spinning reserve
   markets for an aluminum smelter. The approach is based on stochastic
   programming in which the market prices are the stochastic variables.
   Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and provide
   insights into the demand-side management for industrial plants.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a vision-based highway border detection algorithm using
   structured Hough voting. Our approach takes advantage of the geometric
   relationship between highway road borders and highway lane markings. It
   uses a strategy where a number of trained road border and lane marking
   detectors are triggered, followed by Hough voting to generate
   corresponding detection of the border and lane marking. Since the
   initially triggered detectors usually result in large number of
   positives, conventional frame-wise Hough voting is not able to always
   generate robust border and lane marking results. Therefore, we formulate
   this problem as a joint detection-and-tracking problem under the
   structured Hough voting model, where tracking refers to exploiting
   inter-frame structural information to stabilize the detection results.
   Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of
   the proposed structured Hough voting model over a number of baseline
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Enforcing a specific topology in image segmentation is a very important
   but challenging problem, which has attracted much attention in the
   computer vision community. Most recent works on topology-constrained
   image segmentation focus on binary segmentation, where the topology is
   often described by the connectivity of both foreground and background.
   In this paper, we develop a new multi-labeling method to enforce
   topology in multi-label image segmentation. In this case, we not only
   require each segment to be a connected region (intra-segment topology),
   but also require specific adjacency relations between each pair of
   segments (inter-segment topology). We develop our method in the context
   of segmentation propagation, where a segmented template image defines
   the topology, and our goal is to propagate the segmentation to a target
   image while preserving the topology. Our method requires good spatial
   structure continuity between the template and the target such that the
   template segmentation can be used as a good initialization for
   segmenting the target. In addition, we focus on multi-label segmentation
   where a segment and its adjacent segments form a ring structure, which
   is among the most complex type of inter-segment topology for 2D
   structures. We apply the proposed method to segment 3D metallic image
   volumes for the underlying grain structures and achieve better results
   than several comparison methods. Finally, we also apply the proposed
   method to interactive segmentation and stereo matching applications.}},

Abstract = {{The configuration bitstream is a persistent source of vulnerability in
   FPGA designs, and thus FPGA vendors have implemented bitstream
   encryption. A number of attacks on these countermeasures have been
   demonstrated including direct probing of the configuration storage
   cells, side-channel attacks on the decryption blocks, and attacks on the
   scan chain. Thus, we present an FPGA design that never stores the
   configuration data in the clear, even at the lowest level of the
   hardware. We deeply hardware entangle the reconfigurable logic and
   interconnect by one time pad encrypting the bitstream using a PUF
   response. By leveraging recent work in high performance, high density,
   high reliability, and low power PUF design, we tightly integrate a PUF
   bit with every configuration bit. This has significant security benefits
   including high resistance to probing attacks and unique per-die
   configuration bitstreams, while only requiring minor modification of the
   FPGA design. Based on overheads from a PUF implementation in an
   industrial 65nm bulk CMOS process, we simulate such an FPGA design and
   achieve modest overheads in power, area, and performance across multiple
   security-focused benchmark applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a platform that
   can be used for time synchronization and indoor positioning of mobile
   devices. The platform uses the Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA) of
   multiple ultrasonic chirps broadcast from a network of beacons placed
   throughout the environment to find an initial location as well as
   synchronize a receiver's clock with the infrastructure. These chirps
   encode identification data and ranging information that can be used to
   compute the receiver's location. Once the clocks have been synchronized,
   the system can continue performing localization directly using
   Time-of-Flight (TOF) ranging as opposed to TDOA. This provides similar
   position accuracy with fewer beacons (for tens of minutes) until the
   mobile device clock drifts enough that a TDOA signal is once again
   required.
   Our hardware platform uses RF-based time synchronization to distribute
   clock synchronization from a subset of infrastructure beacons connected
   to a GPS source. Mobile devices use a novel time synchronization
   technique leverages the continuously free-running audio sampling
   subsystem of a smartphone to synchronize with global time. Once
   synchronized, each device can determine an accurate proximity from as
   little as one beacon using TOF measurements. This significantly
   decreases the number of beacons required to cover an indoor space and
   improves performance in the face of obstructions. We show through
   experiments that this approach outperforms the Network Time Protocol
   (NTP) on smartphones by an order of magnitude, providing an average 720
   mu s synchronization accuracy with clock drift rates as low as 2ppm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a comprehensive technique to obtain accurate
   three-dimensional (3D) micromachining forces for frequency bandwidths up
   to 25 kHz. The capability to precisely measure cutting forces is central
   to gaining fundamental understanding on micromachining mechanics and
   dynamics Multi-axis dynamometers are used to measure 3D machining
   forces. Forces experienced during micromachining involve very high
   frequencies due to the ultra-high spindle speeds used during the
   process. However, the specified bandwidths of the dynamometers do not
   meet high frequency requirements of micromachining forces; this
   limitation stems from the structural-dynamics response of the
   dynamometers. Therefore, it is important to develop approaches to
   compensate for the distortions arising from the dynamic effects of the
   dynamometer's structure in order to accurately measure micromachining
   forces. This paper presents a fully 3D compensation approach to enable
   accurate determination of 3D micromachining forces within a wide
   frequency range. The presented approach involves: (1) accurate
   identification of 3D force measurement characteristics of the
   dynamometer in the form of 3x3 force-to-force frequency response
   functions (F2F-FRF5) matrix within a 25 kHz bandwidth, (2) design of an
   optimal inverse filter for post-processing the measured force data to
   remove the influence of structural dynamics of the dynamometer; and (3)
   validation of the compensation approach through impact testing where the
   actual applied force data acquired by the reference force sensor is
   compared with the corrected dynamometer measurements. Subsequently, the
   presented approach is demonstrated by obtaining 3D micromachining forces
   during micromilling of a brass workpiece. It is concluded that the
   presented approach is effective in high-frequency correction of
   dynamometer measurements for accurate measurement of 3D micromachining
   forces within the 025 kHz frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{In scientific simulation, scientists use measured data to create
   numerical models, execute simulations and analyze results from advanced
   simulators executing on high performance computing platforms. This
   process usually requires a team of scientists collaborating on data
   collection, model creation and analysis, and on authorship of
   publications and data. This paper shows that scientific teams can
   benefit from a user environment called Akuna that permits subsurface
   scientists in disparate locations to collaborate on numerical modeling
   and analysis projects. The Akuna application is built on the Velo
   software platform that provides a desktop client environment for
   conducting and analyzing simulations, a knowledge management server for
   project and data management, annotation, collaboration, job execution,
   and event-based communication, and a Tool Integration Framework for
   connecting any type of software application - from desktop tools to
   simulator codes into the Velo framework. Akuna is a customized Velo
   deployment that is tailored for subsurface modeling and is designed to
   support any type of simulator. Simulator extensibility is achieved by
   providing a customizable suite of desktop tools for simulator setup and
   execution that utilize Velo's Tool Integration Framework and are based
   on data-driven user interface generation. This paper describes the
   collaborative aspects of the Velo platform, how Velo was customized for
   Akuna, and Akuna's extensible ``toolset{''} framework that creates a
   collaborative research environment for subsurface modelers. A use case
   example is provided, which demonstrates creating and executing a 3D

Abstract = {{For any society energy is identified as a pillar of social and economic
   development. During the production of sustainable electricity there is
   degradation and pollution of the immediate environment. Hydro-power (HP)
   is one available source that is clean and renewable and which can be
   used to manage power supply/ demand options. A pumped storage hydropower
   (PSH) system allows water reuse while eliminating environmental
   pollution. Apart from PSH being used as a huge battery, storing energy
   in the water of an upper reservoir until its release for instant power
   generation on demand, it may also be also engaged in reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions - a major threat to humanity. To fully explore the world
   of PSH this paper sought to identify potential distribution, possible
   capacity and current technologies involved in Africa's five regions.
   This approach is common for large hydropower plants, but for this study,
   PSH was used with a small hydropower unit to model a hybrid power plant
   using a reversible turbine. Flowcode V5 and Proteus were used to design
   the study's control aspect. Two floaters were installed in a PHS upper
   reservoir, one at its lowest level to halt generation, another at the
   top of the reservoir to avoid spill during pumping activity. Results
   obtained in this study established technically the concept of pumped
   storage for small hydropower project could be used to meet peak demand
   for a rural or farm community.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) chipsets on mobile
   devices has lead to a wide variety of user-installable tags and beacons
   designed for location-aware applications. In this paper, we present the
   Acoustic Location Processing System (ALPS), a platform that augments BLE
   transmitters with ultrasound in a manner that improves ranging accuracy
   and can help users configure indoor localization systems with minimal
   effort. A user places three or more beacons in an environment and then
   walks through a calibration sequence with their mobile device where they
   touch key points in the environment like the floor and the corners of
   the room. This process automatically computes the room geometry as well
   as the precise beacon locations without needing auxiliary measurements.
   Once configured, the system can track a user's location referenced to a
   map.
   The platform consists of time-synchronized ultrasonic transmitters that
   utilize the bandwidth just above the human hearing limit, where mobile
   devices are still sensitive and can detect ranging signals. To aid in
   the mapping process, the beacons perform inter-beacon ranging during
   setup. Each beacon includes a BLE radio that can identify and trigger
   the ultrasonic signals. By using differences in propagation
   characteristics between ultrasound and radio, the system can classify if
   beacons are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) to the mobile phone. In cases
   where beacons are blocked, we show how the phone's inertial measurement
   sensors can be used to supplement localization data. We experimentally
   evaluate that our system can estimate three-dimensional beacon location
   with a Euclidean distance error of 16.1cm, and can generate maps with
   room measurements with a two-dimensional Euclidean distance error of
   19.8cm. When tested in six different environments, we saw that the
   system can identify Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signals with over 80\%
   accuracy and track a user's location to within less than 100cm.}},

   it can synchronize its audio clock with the transmission infrastructure
   to perform TOF-based localization, which provides similar position
   accuracy to TDOA-based localization with fewer beacons. Multilateration
   and trilateration processing for each device's location is offloaded
   onto a cloud-based solver that can provide localization as a service to

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new efficient statistical method for failure
   probability estimation of analog circuits with rate failure events,
   which is a time-consuming process using the existing Monte Carlo method.
   On top of this, the new method can also provide the estimation of
   parameter regions to achieve targeted performance to facilitate the
   design process, which is missing in the traditional fast statistical
   methods such as the statistical blockage based method. The new method
   employs two new techniques to speed up the analysis. First, to reduce
   the large number of samples for rare event analysis, the new approach
   employs a smart sample selection scheme, which can consider the
   effectiveness of samples and well-coverage for the parameter space. As a
   result, it can reduce an additional simulation costs by pruning less
   effective samples while keeping the accuracy of failure estimation.
   Second, the new approach identifies the failure regions in terms of
   parameters to provide a good design guideline for designers and
   optimization tools. This is enabled by applying the variance based
   feature selection to find the dominant parameters. A quasi-random
   sampling with dominant parameters is then applied to determine in-spec
   boundaries of those parameters. In addition, we also provide the
   complete formula for the probability determinations of failure regions
   in the iterative failure region searching framework. We demonstrate the
   advantage of our proposed method using two test benches: 6T-SRAM reading
   failure diagnosis with 27 process parameters, charge pump operation
   failure diagnosis in a PLL circuit with 81 process parameters.
   Experimental results show that the new method can be 4X more accurate
   than the recently proposed REscope method. Furthermore, the new method
   reduces the simulation cost by 2X than the recursive statistical
   blockage (RSB) method with same accuracy level. Our approach also
   provides the precise guidance of diverse parameters with 1.21\%
   estimation error.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new method called the Pokerface for extreme face
   illumination normalization. The Pokerface is a two-phase approach. It
   first aims at maximizing the minimum gap between adjacently-valued
   pixels while keeping the partial ordering of the pixels in the face
   image under extreme illumination condition, an intuitive effort based on
   order theory to unveil the underlying structure of a dark image. This
   optimization can be formulated as a feasibility search problem and can
   be efficiently solved by linear programming. It then smooths the
   intermediate representation by repressing the energy of the gradient
   map. The smoothing step is carried out by total variation minimization
   and sparse approximation. The illumination normalized faces using our
   proposed Pokerface not only exhibit very high fidelity against neutrally
   illuminated face, but also allow for a significant improvement in face
   verification experiments using even the simplest classifier.
   Simultaneously achieving high level of faithfulness and expressiveness
   is very rare among other methods. These conclusions are drawn after
   benchmarking our algorithm against 22 prevailing illumination
   normalization techniques on both the CMU Multi-PIE database and Extended
   Yale B database that are widely adopted for face illumination problems.}},

   and complex interactions among the systems. Many of existing system
   models for Cloud are based on utilization metrics such as CPU, memory,
   network and I/O. Such system models are quite complex and their anomaly
   detection mechanisms are mostly based on threshold scheme. Utilization
   metrics exceeding a certain threshold would trigger an alarm. In fact,
   it is impossible to determine proper threshold for all anomalies. These
   system models fail to assess the state of the system accurately. We
   propose a novel anomaly detection system based on user perception rather
   than complex system models. In our Perception-Based Anomaly Detection
   system (PBAD), each component within multi-tier applications monitors
   response time and determines whether overall service response time is
   adequate. PBAD also locates the anomaly by analyzing component
   behaviors. PBAD masks the complexity of Cloud and addresses what
   matters, how user perceives the service provided by the Cloud
   applications. The key advantages of the proposed algorithm are
   simplicity and scalability. We implement and deploy PBAD in our
   production datacenter environment. The experimental results show that
   PBAD detects numerous types of anomalies as well as the combination of
   anomalies where existing systems fail.}},

Abstract = {{The automatic discovery of dependencies in distributed Cloud
   applications is very useful for large scale deployments. Dependencies
   can be used to identify the anomalies due to errors, failures or the
   performance bottleneck in applications. Although existing dependency
   models can be useful, we believe more comprehensive dependency model
   would improve anomaly detection in large scale distributed applications.
   We propose a VM dependency discovery system and introduce dependency
   primitives that incorporate complex application behavior/interaction
   patterns. We also formulate response time characteristics for each
   dependency primitive. Using the component dependencies and traffic
   monitoring, we develop a stochastic model to estimate the response time
   probability distribution for components and overall application. We
   evaluate and validate our system with various production applications.
   Experiments show that we can accurately discover application
   dependencies and also predict not only the average response time but the
   95th percentile response time within 8\% of the actual response time.{*}}},

Abstract = {{In commercial Video-on-Demand (VoD) systems, user's Quality of
   Experience (QoE) is the key factor for user satisfaction. In order to
   improve user's QoE, VoD providers replicate popular videos in
   geo-distributed Cloud and deploy cache servers close to users.
   Generally, the VoD provider selects a server for the user request
   according to the user's location. Usually geographically closely located
   servers would provide lower network delay. However, the performance of
   VoD servers deployed in cloud virtual machines (VM) depends not only on
   the network delay but also resource contention due to other VMs and
   highly dynamic user demands. Thus, QoE offered by the server varies
   greatly over time as user demands and network traffic fluctuate
   regardless of the location. Selecting a server close to users sometimes
   reduces the network delay but cannot guarantee QoE in general. We
   believe that end-users have the best perception of server performance in
   terms of their QoE rather than the servers themselves. What user
   perceives incorporate performance of all elements, such as network delay
   and server response time in VoD service. We propose VoD server selection
   schemes that dynamically select servers according to user's QoE
   feedback. We integrate our server selection schemes with Dynamic
   Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) clients and evaluate our system both
   in simulation and in Google Cloud. Results show our system improves user
   QoE up to 20\% compared to existing solutions(1).}},

   supporting beams, hence alleviating the trade-off between power
   consumption and Q-factor; moreover, heaters are placed externally to the
   resonator body, hence eliminating the deleterious effects of serpentines
   on the acoustic properties of the device. More importantly, this
   ovenization technique is independent of the resonator geometry, so it is
   broadly applicable to any resonator frequency (70MHz to 1.16GHz in this

Abstract = {{Modern touch screen sensors are capable of detecting and reporting
   finger presence not only upon contact but also as the finger is
   approaching the screen. This gives us a wealth of additional
   information, which to the best of our knowledge, has never been analyzed
   before. Using these new sensor capabilities, we can see exactly how a
   user performs gestures starting from the finger's approach through the
   actual touching of the screen.
   We decode proximity data which we collect from the mobile phone sensor
   and extract finger ``traces{''} from each user along with the contact
   area shapes, which we use to distinguish between the owner and one of
   the other users. To further improve the classifier's accuracy, we
   develop a sequential classification approach using a probability ratio
   test of artificial neural network outputs which makes a decision in
   minimal time based on pre-defined accuracy goals. The data not only
   allows discrimination between users but also detection of their dominant
   hand. These techniques could be used in many practical applications,
   such as passive user authentication or personalization.
   Our experiments show that after just 5 touches, or in 12.6 seconds on
   average, we can correctly distinguish the primary user from any of 14
   other known users using proximity data to model the finger's approach

Abstract = {{On-chip test/diagnosis is proposed to be an effective method to ensure
   the lifetime reliability of integrated systems. In order to manage the
   complexity of such an approach, an integrated system is partitioned into
   multiple modules where each module can be periodically tested, diagnosed
   and repaired if necessary. The limitation of on-chip memory and
   computing capability, coupled with the inherent uncertainty in
   diagnosis, causes the occurrence of misdiagnoses. To address this
   challenge, a novel incremental-learning algorithm, namely dynamic
   k-nearest-neighbor (DKNN), is developed to improve the accuracy of
   on-chip diagnosis. Different from the conventional KNN, DKNN employs
   online diagnosis data to update the learned classifier so that the
   classifier can keep evolving as new diagnosis data becomes available.
   Incorporating online diagnosis data enables tracking of the fault
   distribution and thus improves diagnostic accuracy. Experiments using
   various benchmark circuits (e.g., the cache controller from the
   OpenSPARC T2 processor design) demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy can
   be more than doubled.}},

Abstract = {{We study the fundamental k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search problem on
   distributed time series. A server has constantly received various
   reference time series Q of length X and seeks the exact kNN over a
   collection of time series distributed across a set of M local sites.
   When X and M are large, and when the amount of query increases, simply
   sending each Q to all M sites incurs high communication bandwidth costs,
   which we would like to avoid. Prior work has presented a
   communication-efficient kNN algorithm for the Euclidean distance
   similarity measure. In this paper, we present the first
   communication-efficient kNN algorithm for the dynamic time warping (DTW)
   similarity measure, which is generally believed a better measure for
   time series. To handle the complexities of DTW, we design a new
   multi-resolution structure for the reference time series, and
   multi-resolution lower bounds that can effectively prune the search
   space. We present a new protocol between the server and the local sites
   that leverages multi-resolution pruning for communication efficiency and
   cascading lower bounds for computational efficiency. Empirical studies
   on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that our method reduces
   communication bandwidth by up to 92\%.}},

Abstract = {{While big data analytics continue to grow in popularity among companies
   and organizations, their largescale analytic implementations are often
   completed by software developers with little or no formal training in
   machine learning or data analysis. These developers are skilled at
   writing code but they do not have the understanding of the data
   analytics process to be efficient or necessarily accurate at it. These
   developers use processes and tools that are often ad hoc and incomplete
   as they learn by doing. We followed a development team through two
   analytics development cycles and analyzed their interactions with their
   data and tools. In this paper, we first describe the tools the
   developers used and then present concrete opportunities for the big data
   community to create tools that empower these developers to build more
   accurate analytics more efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{The comprehensive and innovative evaluation of climate models with newly
   available global observations is critically needed for the improvement
   of climate model current-state representation and future-state
   predictability. A climate model diagnostic evaluation process requires
   physics-based multi-variable analyses that typically involve
   large-volume and heterogeneous datasets, making them both
   computation-and data-intensive. With an exploratory nature of climate
   data analyses and an explosive growth of datasets and service tools,
   scientists are struggling to keep track of their datasets, tools, and
   execution/study history, let alone sharing them with others. In
   response, we have developed a cloud-enabled, provenance-supported,
   web-service system called Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer (CMDA). CMDA
   enables the physics-based, multi-variable model performance evaluations
   and diagnoses through the comprehensive and synergistic use of multiple
   observational data, reanalysis data, and model outputs. At the same
   time, CMDA provides a crowdsourcing space where scientists can organize
   their work efficiently and share their work with others. CMDA is
   empowered by many current state-of-the-art software packages in web
   service, provenance, and semantic search.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices have become for many the preferred way of interacting
   with the Internet, social media and the enterprise. However, mobile
   devices still do not have the computing power or battery life that will
   allow them to perform effectively over long periods of time or for
   executing applications that require extensive communication or
   computation, or low latency. Cyber-foraging is a technique enabling
   mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading
   computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in
   single-hop proximity. This paper presents a catalog of architectural
   tactics for cyber-foraging that was derived from the results of a
   systematic literature review on architectures for cyber-foraging
   systems. Elements of the architectures identified in the primary studies
   were codified in the form of Architectural Tactics for Cyber-Foraging.
   These tactics will help architects extend their design reasoning towards
   cyber-foraging as a way to support the mobile applications of the
   present and the future.}},

Abstract = {{Hadoop is an open source implementation of the MapReduce programming
   model, and provides the runtime infrastructure for map and reduce
   functions programmed in individual applications. Commercial clouds such
   as Amazon Elastic MapReduce provides the Hadoop architecture with IaaS
   support. In this architecture, the map and reduce functions are major
   determinants of end-to-end application latency, along with the framework
   components responsible for data access and exchange. In this paper, we
   aim to explore modeling methods that capture the performance
   characteristic and the semantics of a Hadoop architecture. We present
   our early results for modeling the performance of a Hadoop application
   given the design of map and reduce functions using Layered Queueing
   Network (LQN). We build two different LQN models to represent the data
   parallel computing of these functions and calibrate both models using
   monitored performance data. The output of both models produces
   converging results that are within similar to 10\% of observed
   performance. From our modeling experience, we further discuss the issues
   of modeling Hadoop architecture using LQN in general and describe our
   future work.}},

   several signals are sent simultaneously. To allow users' differentiation

   addition, the proposed scheme uses error correcting codes and
   soft-decision demodulation to reduce residual multi-user interference
   and channel noise at the receiver. Simulation results show that the

Abstract = {{Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common consequence of ventricular
   remodeling in heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction and
   is associated with diminished survival rates. Characterization of
   patient-specific anatomy and function of the regurgitant mitral valve
   (MV) can enhance surgical decision making in terms of medical device
   choice and deployment strategy for minimally invasive endovascular
   approaches for MV repair. As a first step toward pre-operative planning
   for MV repair, we examine the feasibility of using cardiac magnetic
   resonance (CMR) images acquired in multiple orientations to resolve
   leaflet function and timing. In this study, MV motion of a HF patient
   with ischemic heart disease exhibiting both adverse ventricular
   remodeling and MR was compared pre-operatively against a normal control
   from the Sunnybrook cardiac database, starting with manually segmented
   2D MV contours from tine CMR images acquired in multiple orientations.
   We find that MV motion analysis from CMR imaging is feasible and
   anatomical reconstruction using oriented segmentations from a
   combination of imaging slices acquired in multiple orientations can help
   overcome inherent limitations of CMR image data in terms of resolving
   small anatomical features, owing to finite slice-thicknesses and partial
   volume effects.}},

Abstract = {{Modern day law enforcement banks heavily on the use of commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) face recognition systems (FRS) as a tool for
   biometric evaluation and identification. However, in many real-world
   scenarios, when the face of an individual is occluded or degraded in
   some way, commercial recognition systems fail to accept the face for
   evaluation or simply return unusable matched faces. In these kinds of
   cases, forensic experts rely on image processing techniques and tools,
   to make the face fit to be processed by the commercial recognition
   systems (e.g. use partial face images from another subject to fill in
   the occluded parts of the face of interest, or have a tight crop around
   the face). In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of commercial
   recognition systems to such forensic techniques. More specifically, we
   study the change in the rank-I identification result that is caused by
   forensic processing of faces-of-interest that are unusable by the
   commercial recognition systems. Further, forensic processing of such
   faces is more of an art and it is extremely difficult to process faces
   consistently such that there is a predictable effect on the rank-n
   identification result. This study is meant to serve as an evaluation of
   the effect of a few forensic techniques intended to allow commercial
   recognition systems to process and match face images that were otherwise
   unusable. Our results indicate that COTS FRS can be sensitive to the
   subjectivity in facial part swapping and cropping, resulting in
   inconsistencies in the identification rankings and similarity scores.}},

Abstract = {{A lot of real-world data is spread across multiple domains. Handling
   such data has been a challenging task. Heterogeneous face biometrics has
   begun to receive attention in recent years. In real-world scenarios,
   many surveillance cameras capture data in the NIR (near infrared)
   spectrum. However, most datasets accessible to law enforcement have been
   collected in the VIS (visible light) domain. Thus, there exists a need
   to match NIR to VIS face images. In this paper, we approach the problem
   by developing a method to reconstruct VIS images in the NIR domain and
   vice-versa. This approach is more applicable to real-world scenarios
   since it does not involve having to project millions of VIS database
   images into learned common subspace for subsequent matching. We present
   a cross-spectral joint l(0) minimization based dictionary learning
   approach to learn a mapping function between the two domains. One can
   then use the function to reconstruct facial images between the domains.
   Our method is open set and can reconstruct any face not present in the
   training data. We present results on the CASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 database and
   report state-of-the-art results.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial-multiplexing cameras have emerged as a promising alternative to
   classical imaging devices, often enabling acquisition of `more for
   less'. One popular architecture for spatial multiplexing is the
   single-pixel camera (SPC), which acquires coded measurements of the
   scene with pseudo-random spatial masks. Significant theoretical
   developments over the past few years provide a means for reconstruction
   of the original imagery from coded measurements at sub-Nyquist sampling
   rates. Yet, accurate reconstruction generally requires high measurement
   rates and high signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we enquire if one
   can perform high-level visual inference problems (e.g. face recognition
   or action recognition) from compressive cameras without the need for
   image reconstruction. This is an interesting question since in many
   practical scenarios, our goals extend beyond image reconstruction.
   However, most inference tasks often require non-linear features and it
   is not clear how to extract such features directly from compressed
   measurements. In this paper, we show that one can extract nontrivial
   correlational features directly without reconstruction of the imagery.
   As a specific example, we consider the problem of face recognition
   beyond the visible spectrum e.g in the short-wave infra-red region
   (SWIR) - where pixels are expensive. We base our framework on smashed
   filters which suggests that inner-products between high-dimensional
   signals can be computed in the compressive domain to a high degree of
   accuracy. We collect a new face image dataset of 30 subjects, obtained
   using an SPC. Using face recognition as an example, we show that one can
   indeed perform reconstruction-free inference with a very small loss of
   accuracy at very high compression ratios of 100 and more.}},

Abstract = {{The harmful effects of cell phone usage on driver behavior have been
   well investigated and the growing problem has motivated several several
   research efforts aimed at developing automated cell phone usage
   detection systems. Computer vision based approaches for dealing with
   this problem have only emerged in recent years. In this paper, we
   present a vision based method to automatically determine if a driver is
   holding a cell phone close to one of his/her ears (thus keeping only one
   hand on the steering wheel) and quantitatively demonstrate the method's
   efficacy on challenging Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) face
   view videos from the head pose validation data that was acquired to
   monitor driver head pose variation under naturalistic driving
   conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such
   evaluation carried out using this relatively new data. Our approach
   utilizes the Supervised Descent Method (SDM) based facial landmark
   tracking algorithm to track the locations of facial landmarks in order
   to extract a crop of the region of interest. Following this, features
   are extracted from the crop and are classified using previously trained
   classifiers in order to determine if a driver is holding a cell phone.
   We adopt a through approach and benchmark the performance obtained using
   raw pixels and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features in
   combination with various classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Biometrics has come a long way over the past decade in terms of
   technologies and devices that are used to verify user identities. Three
   of the more well studied modalities in this field are the face, iris and
   fingerprint, with the latter two reporting very high user
   identification/verification rates. In the biometric community there has
   been little work in studying biomedical signals for user recognition
   purposes. In this paper, we propose using electromyograph (EMG) signals
   as a person's biometric signature. The EMG records the motor unit action
   potentials (MUAP) during any physical motion. Our study is done within
   the context of a person using a keyboard to type a password or any other
   fixed phrase. Along with EMG signals, we log key press times for the
   user and study the feasibility of using this data too as a biometric
   feature. Keypress timings alone if used as a biometric, are very easy to
   spoof and hence we fuse this modality with EMG signals. In order to
   classify these features, we use subspace modeling as well as Bayesian
   classifiers. The experiments have been performed within the context of a
   user typing a fixed pass phrase at a workstation. The idea is to monitor
   both biometric modalities when this action is performed and study user
   verification across data capture sessions and within capture sessions.
   Our approach yields high values of verification rates, which shows the
   promise of using these modalities as user specific biometric signatures.}},

Abstract = {{Timely delivery of critical traffic is a major challenge in industrial
   applications. The Wireless Dominance (WiDOM) medium access control
   protocol offers a very large number of priority levels to suit time
   sensitive application requirements. In particular, assuming that its
   overhead is properly modeled, WiDOM enables an accurate evaluation of
   the network response time in the wireless domain, through the power of
   the schedulability analysis, based on non-preemptive and static priority
   scheduling. Recent research proposed a new version of WiDOM (dubbed
   Slotted WiDOM), which offers a lower overhead as compared to the
   original version. In this paper, we propose a new schedulability
   analysis for Slotted WiDOM and extend it to handle message streams with
   release jitter. In order to provide a more accurate timing analysis, the
   effect of transmission faults must be taken into account. Therefore, in
   our novel analysis we consider the case where messages are transmitted
   in a realistic wireless channel, affected by noise and interference.
   Evaluation is performed on a real test-bed and the results from
   experiments provide a firm validation of our findings.}},

   algorithm is impractical in large games due to demanding communication
   requirements and high computational complexity. A variant of FP is
   presented that aims to mitigate both issues. Complexity is mitigated by
   use of a computationally efficient Monte-Carlo based best response rule.
   Demanding communication problems are mitigated by implementing the
   algorithm in a network-based distributed setting, in which player to
   -player communication is restricted to local subsets of neighboring
   players as determined by a (possibly sparse, but connected) preassigned
   communication graph. Results are demonstrated via a simulation example.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prediction system based on
   machine learning techniques. Our work features the novel development and
   application of machine learning methods over traditional ASD evaluation
   protocols. Specifically, we are interested in discovering the latent
   patterns that possibly indicate the symptom of ASD underneath the
   observations of eye movement. A group of subjects (either ASD or
   non-ASD) are shown with a set of aligned human face images, with eye
   gaze locations on each image recorded sequentially. An image-level
   feature is then extracted from the recorded eye gaze locations on each
   face image. Such feature extraction process is expected to capture
   discriminative eye movement patterns related to ASD. In this work, we
   propose a variety of feature extraction methods, seeking to evaluate
   their prediction performance comprehensively. We further propose an ASD
   prediction framework in which the prediction model is learned on the
   labeled features. At testing stage, a test subject is also asked to view
   the face images with eye gaze locations recorded. The learned model
   predicts the image-level labels and a threshold is set to determine
   whether the test subject potentially has ASD or not. Despite the
   inherent difficulty of ASD prediction, experimental results indicates
   statistical significance of the predicted results, showing promising
   perspective of this framework.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, computational complexities and lack of detailed,
   nonlinear dynamic models have stood as main obstacles to widespread
   industrial adoption of model-based on-line optimization for operation of
   batch and semi-batch reactors. With recent advances in both dynamic
   modeling techniques and nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers, it is
   conceivable now to use significantly-sized. nonlinear models directly
   for on-line state/parameter estimation and optimal control calculations.
   In this study, we propose a framework for doing this. In the proposed
   framework, nonlinear first principles dynamic model-based optimizations
   are performed at several time points throughout a batch run over a fixed
   horizon, in order to estimate the current state of the model and to
   refine the target batch time and input variables. Here we combine
   shrinking horizon nonlinear model predictive control (sh-NMPC) with
   expanding horizon least squares estimation (eh-LSE). This framework is
   tested on a large-scale anionic propylene oxide (PO) polymerization
   process. whose operation considers not only certain end-product
   specifications but also safety constraints. It is shown that the
   proposed method is not only computationally feasible (averaging less
   than 10 CPU seconds at each sampling time) but leads to excellent
   performance, satisfying the product specification target despite
   initialization errors and measurement noise. (C) 2015, IFAC

Abstract = {{Dual model predictive control (DMPC) optimally combines plant excitation
   and control based on current and predicted parameter estimation errors.
   Exact solution of dual control problems with constraints is in general
   computationally prohibitive. Our deterministic equivalent of the
   stochastic optimal control problem enables convergence toward optimality
   for a specific class of finite-horizon problems. The cost function shows
   that the optimal controls are functions of the current and future
   parameter-estimate error covariances. Our proposed objective-function
   reformulation provides the optimal combination of caution, probing, and
   nominal control. We show that the nonconvex optimization problem can be
   solved as a quadratic program with bilinear constraints. This type of
   problem can be efficiently solved with existing algorithms based on
   branch and bound with McCormick-type estimators. We demonstrate the
   application of DMPC to a singe-input single-output (SISO) finite impulse
   response (FIR) system. In the simulation example the parameter estimates
   converge quickly, and accurate and precise estimates are obtained even
   though the excitation vanishes. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design and evaluate the feasibility of a system which
   minimizes residential electricity cost of individual homes by shifting
   demand over a daily forecast price cycle. Ideally, our system will
   accept use-time preferences from consumers and optimize their
   appliances' operation around those given patterns. However, using the
   system to recommend optimum use-times to consumers is also possible by
   accepting ideal use preferences from an external load manager and
   computing the cost savings of these preferences relative to the cost of
   the consumer's current use patterns.
   We implement the optimization problem in two stages by using Mixed
   Integer Linear Programming (MILP). In the first stage, we obtain the
   optimum scheduling for appliances to be connected to the outlet; the
   output of this stage only shows the hours that we can use the appliance
   and does not reflect the actual consumption hours of each appliance. In
   the second stage, we model the random behavior of users via Monte Carlo
   simulation by running the appliances within the times they receive
   power, specified in the first stage. Finally, we evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of cost savings by
   considering three appliances and four pricing schemes.}},

   based on a previously solved point. Both forward stepping and backward
   stepping are proposed so that the proposed PSM can trace both the upper
   and lower halves of the PV curve. The collapse point is estimated as the
   intersection of the two half curves. Compared with the conventional
   continuation method, our PSM is numerically more robust. Compared with
   the conventional embedding method, our PSM offers superior accuracy and

Abstract = {{Electricity needs are increasing with more ownership of air conditioning
   systems in houses. Air conditioning loads are a significant portion of
   the overall peak load on grids. In order to match generation and load in
   a more optimal way and reduce the strain on the grids, we need load
   information of houses in advance. The main problem is that the majority
   of houses are still not smart enough to notify the grids about future
   loads. Even the smart houses with such capability, the users need to
   keep track of it, which is a cumbersome manual task. Furthermore, the
   houses do not have the ability to sense the occupant and air
   conditioning requirements if the occupant is on the road. In this paper
   we have proposed a system to tackle these problems. The proposed system
   is a smart agent developed by combining existing technologies such as
   smart phones, GPS sensors, Internet over GSM networks, cloud services,
   and a novel application of image processing to combine interfaces of
   different components and technologies. Development of this smart agent
   requires low cost, less resources, and no modification to the existing
   systems. Lab results show that the prototype agent can easily sense and
   notify the upcoming air conditioning loads to the grid operator. A
   conservative estimate of the proposed systems' effect on the grid shows
   that in peak hours by just keeping 1000 ACs away from the grid for a
   single minute may result in a significant reduction of grid load by 1
   MW.}},

Abstract = {{Collections of time-series data appear in a wide variety of contexts. To
   gain insight into the underlying phenomenon (that the data represents),
   one must analyze the time-series data. Analysis can quickly become
   challenging for very large data (similar to terabytes or more) sets, and
   it may be infeasible to scan the entire data-set on each query due to
   time limits or resource constraints. To avoid this problem, one might
   pre-compute partial results by scanning the data-set (usually as the
   data arrives). However, for complex queries, where the value of a new
   data record depends on all of the data previously seen, this might be
   infeasible because incorporating a large amount of historical data into
   a query requires a large amount of storage.
   We present an approach to performing complex queries over very large
   data-sets in a manner that is (i) practical, meaning that a query does
   not require a scan of the entire data-set, and (ii) fixed-cost, meaning
   that the amount of storage required only depends on the time-range
   spanned by the entire data-set (and not the size of the data-set
   itself). We evaluate our approach with three different data-sets: (i) a
   4-year commercial analytics data-set from a production content-delivery
   platform with over 15 million mobile users, (ii) an 18-year data-set
   from the Linux-kernel commit-history, and (iii) an 8-day data-set from
   Common Crawl HTTP logs. Our evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and
   practicality of our approach for a diverse set of complex queries on a
   diverse set of very large data-sets.}},

Abstract = {{Resistive switching devices and neuromorphic computing systems, while an
   attractive solution to minimize compute bottlenecks, suffer from
   sneak-path problem and area inefficient implementations respectively.
   This has prompted research in developing beyond-CMOS functional blocks
   that can serve as a compact single device circuit block (selector and
   oscillator respectively). In this work, we explore amorphous-Si based
   metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) devices to serve this function. CMOS
   compatible Pt/a-Si/Cu stacks show negative differential resistance (NDR)
   that enables their operation as oscillatory elements and as non-linear
   threshold switches. As a first demonstration of oscillations in a-Si, we
   report frequency tunability from 5 kHz to 80 MHz by modulating the
   series ballast and by changing the source voltage. The devices show
   low-voltage (< 1.2 V), low-power operation (< 100 mu W). As threshold
   switches, these devices show a resistance change of > 800 between ON and
   OFF states with a peak current density of > 0.3 MA/cm(2) at 1 V. Through
   an analysis of the change in the snap-back time (persistence) and the
   peak ON-state current, we evaluate the change in the modes of operation
   of the device as a threshold switch and as an oscillator.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale characterization of an adhesive bondline is performed to
   investigate the fabrication defects dependent failure mechanisms of an
   I-beam under four point bending. To obtain a realistic representative
   volume of the bondline at its microscopic level, a 3D all-hexahedral
   mesh generator is used to create the unit cell model, which is capable
   of considering multiple material domains. The unit cell model contains
   the geometric information of glass beads, matrix of adhesive material
   and voids that are based on their micro-structural descriptions from the
   sectional 2D X-ray scanned images. The adhesive layer is modeled by
   cohesive interaction in the macro-beam model. The cohesive properties at
   the macroscopic level are extracted based on the average stress
   displacement curve to reserve the equivalent energy dissipation. Using
   the fabrication defects dependent cohesive properties, the numerical
   simulation predicts a local-buckling driven failure, which is consistent
   with the static test observation. Based on the shear dominant bondline
   failure pattern observed under the fatigue test, a parametric study of
   cohesive properties is performed to investigate the root cause of shear
   failure under fatigue which is different from the failure mode under the
   static test.}},

Abstract = {{In emerging non-safety unicast applications of vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs) such as Internet Access, Content, Map, or Database Download
   (CMDD), end-to-end and connection-oriented transmission control must be
   employed to guarantee a desired level of performance. It is envisioned
   that in the future, these non-safety applications will involve several
   concurrent flows. Providing a fair distribution of goodput and bandwidth
   among these concurrent flows will therefore be crucial. To tackle this
   significant issue, in this paper we propose a Cooperative Routing
   Protocol (CROP) which, in conjunction with the local packet scheduling
   and queue management, can reduce the inherent unfairness of the
   transport layer as well as MAC protocol used in the DSRC standard. Our
   results show that the proposed cooperative routing concept provides
   significant improvement in terms of per-flow goodput, end-to-end delays,
   jitter, and fairness at the expense of a very small decrease in the
   overall system goodput.}},

Abstract = {{We address the following problem in refractive shape estimation: given a
   single light-ray correspondence, what shape information of the
   transparent object is revealed along the path of the light-ray, assuming
   that the light-ray refracts twice. We answer this question in the form
   of two depth-normal ambiguities. First, specifying the surface normal at
   which refraction occurs constrains the depth to a unique value. Second,
   specifying the depth at which refraction occurs constrains the surface
   normal to lie on a 1D curve. These two depth-normal ambiguities are
   fundamental to shape estimation of transparent objects and can be used
   to derive additional properties. For example, we show that
   correspondences from three light-rays passing through a point are needed
   to correctly estimate its surface normal. Another contribution of this
   work is that we can reduce the number of views required to reconstruct
   an object by enforcing shape models. We demonstrate this property on
   real data where we reconstruct shape of an object, with light-rays
   observed from a single view, by enforcing a locally planar shape model.}},

   We then landmark the shape contour to obtain points around the contour
   of the image using a combination of two algorithms, a novel non-uniform
   sampling algorithm, and points obtained from SIFT. We utilize these
   landmark points to extract inner distance-based shape context features.
   Finally, these features are used as inputs for a tensor product

Abstract = {{Coronary arteries (CA) segmentation from an angiographic sequence is
   essential to guide the cardiologists during percutaneous interventions

   in contrast in the sequence in addition to the CA's complex topology. In
   this paper, we propose a hierarchical segmentation method that extends
   the Vessel Walker model using a temporal prior and multiscale
   information to extract CA with a higher level of accuracy. In this
   method, the vessel located in frame I-t at time t is extracted by
   utilizing the segmentation result at frame It-1 together with Histogram
   of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features and a shape matching technique. Our
   experiments conducted on five paediatric angiograms have shown promising
   qualitative and quantitative results with a mean Dice coefficient of

Abstract = {{Vibration-based damage detection research aims to develop efficient
   algorithms to identify structural damage from monitoring data. One of
   the main categories of such algorithms is data-driven techniques which
   extract features from measured signals, and identify the damage by
   evaluating the significance of potential changes in these features. This
   paper presents application of several data-driven damage identification
   methodologies on a multivariate simulated data set. First, general
   regression models are applied to data collected through clusters of
   sensors and damage sensitive features are extracted. For systems with
   linear topology, it is shown that substructural regression modeling can
   also be performed on time-and frequency-domain transforms of the
   measured signals to estimate local stiffness of the structure as damage
   features. Subsequently, change detection techniques are utilized to
   statistically determine the significance of changes in the extracted
   features in order to distinguish between assignable changes as a result
   of damage and common changes due to environmental factors. Finally, a
   toolsuite is developed to facilitate application of the developed
   algorithms and improve the damage identification performance through
   incorporation of various combinations of regression models, damage
   features and statistical tests.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we examine several wing designs for a motor-driven,
   flapping-wing micro air vehicle capable of liftoff. The full system
   consists of two wings independently driven by geared pager motors that
   include a spring in parallel with the output shaft. The linear
   transmission allows for resonant operation, while control is achieved by
   direct drive of the wing angle. Wings used in previous work were chosen
   to be fully rigid for simplicity of modeling and fabrication. However,
   biological wings are highly flexible and other micro air vehicles have
   successfully utilized flexible wing structures for specialized tasks.
   The goal of our study is to determine if wing flexibility can be
   generally used to increase wing performance. Two approaches to lift
   improvement using flexible wings are explored, resonance of the wing
   cantilever structure and dynamic wing twisting. We design and test
   several wings that are compared using different figures of merit. A
   twisted design improved lift per power by 73.6\% and maximum lift
   production by 53.2\% compared to the original rigid design. Wing twist
   is then modeled in order to propose optimal wing twist profiles that can
   maximize either wing efficiency or lift production.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the autonomous tracking and following of a marine
   vessel by an Unmanned Surface Vehicle in the presence of dynamic
   obstacles while following the International Regulations for Preventing
   Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) rules. The motion prediction for the target
   vessel is based on Monte-Carlo sampling of dynamically feasible and
   collisionfree paths with fuzzy weights, leading to a predicted path
   resembling anthropomorphic driving behavior. This prediction is
   continuously optimized for a particular target by learning the necessary
   parameters for a 3-degree-of-freedom model of the vessel and its
   maneuvering behavior from its path history without any prior knowledge.
   The path planning for the USV with COLREGS is achieved on a grid-based
   map in a single stage by incorporating A{*} path planning with
   Artificial Terrain Costs for dynamically changing obstacles. Various
   scenarios for interaction, including multiple civilian and adversarial
   vessels, are handled by the planner with ease. The effectiveness of the
   algorithms has been demonstrated both in representative simulations and
   on-water experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a fiber
   optically sensorized robotic hand for multi purpose manipulation tasks.
   The robotic hand has three fingers that enable both pinch and power
   grips. The main bone structure was made of a rigid plastic material and
   covered by soft skin. Both bone and skin contain embedded fiber optics
   for force and tactile sensing, respectively. Eight fiber optic strain
   sensors were used for rigid bone force sensing, and six fiber optic
   strain sensors were used for soft skin tactile sensing. For
   characterization, different loads were applied in two orthogonal axes at
   the fingertip and the sensor signals were measured from the bone
   structure. The skin was also characterized by applying a light load on
   different places for contact localization. The actuation of the hand was
   achieved by a tendon-driven under-actuated system. Gripping motions are
   implemented using an active tendon located on the volar side of each
   finger and connected to a motor. Opening motions of the hand were
   enabled by passive elastic tendons located on the dorsal side of each
   finger.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel nonlinear compliant link. It has two major
   properties: bi-directionality and stiffening compliance.
   Bi-directionality means it can be stretched and compressed, and is
   realized by antagonistic arrangement of an extension spring and a
   compression spring. Stiffening compliance means it becomes stiffer as it
   is stretched, and is realized by asymmetric geometry. The links are
   parts of Simple Hand. Because Simple Hand gives limited space for links,
   current iteration of links is not obviously nonlinear. However,
   nonlinearity should be more obvious if links are designed for larger
   grippers.}},

Abstract = {{A key challenge of developing robots that work closely with people is
   creating a user interface that allows a user to communicate complex
   instructions to a robot quickly and easily. We consider a walking
   logistics support robot, which is designed to carry heavy loads to
   locations that are too difficult to reach with a wheeled or tracked
   vehicle. In this application the robot is carrying equipment and
   supplies for a group of pedestrians, and the primary task for the user
   interface is to keep the robot traveling with the overall group in the
   right formation. This paper presents a marker tracking system that uses
   near infrared cameras, retro-reflective markers, and LIDAR to allow a
   particular user to designate himself as the robot's leader, and guide
   the robot along a desired path. We provide an extensive quantitative
   evaluation to show that the proposed system is able to detect and track
   a leader through unconstrained and cluttered off-road environments under
   a wide variety of illumination and motion conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Stair Climbing is a key functionality desired for robots deployed in
   Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios. A novel compliant modular
   robot was proposed earlier to climb steep and big obstacles. This work
   extends the functionality of this robot to ascend and descend stairs of
   dimensions that are also typical of an urban setting. Stair Climbing is
   realized by equipping the robot's link joints with optimally designed
   passive spring pairs that resist clockwise and counter clockwise moments
   generated by the ground during the climbing motion. This 3-module robot
   is only propelled by wheel actuators. Desirable stair climbing
   configurations are estimated a-priori and used to obtain the optimal
   stiffness for springs. Extensive numerical simulation results over
   different stair configurations are shown. The numerical simulations are
   corroborated by experimentation using the prototype and its performance
   is tabulated for different types of surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method for generating interpretable descriptions of inputs
   that cause faults in high-dimensional software interfaces. Our method
   models the set of fault-triggering inputs as a Cartesian product and
   identifies this set by actively querying the system under test. The
   active sampling scheme is very efficient in the common case that few
   fields in the interface are relevant to causing the fault. This scheme
   also solves the problem of efficiently finding sufficient examples to
   model rare faults, which is problematic for other learning-based
   methods. Compared to other techniques, ours requires no parameter
   turning or post-processing in order to produce useful results. We
   analyze the method qualitatively, theoretically, and empirically. An
   experimental evaluation demonstrates superior performance and
   reliability compared to a basic decision tree approach. We also briefly
   discuss how the method has assisted in debugging a commercial autonomous
   ground vehicle system.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in soft sensors using microfluidic liquid conductors
   enabled sensing of large deformation of soft structures. However, the
   use of liquids as conductive media carries a risk of leakage in many
   cases. Furthermore, it could be harmful when exposed to the human body
   in certain applications. To address these issues, a different sensing
   mechanism was proposed: highly stretchable optical sensors that could
   detect multiple modes of deformation. The method of operation involves a
   simple waveguide and its housing which are both made of silicone
   elastomer. The soft waveguide is coated with a thin gold reflective
   layer to encapsulate light propagating internally, with an
   light-emitting diode ( LED) and a photodiode embedded at each end. When
   the sensor is stretched, compressed, or bent, micro-cracks within the
   reflective layer form and allow part of the light to escape, resulting
   in optical power losses in the light transmission. In this paper, we
   describe the design and fabrication of the proposed soft sensors. A
   prototype was created and characterized for pressure, strain, and
   curvature up to 350 kPa, 90\%, and 0.12 mm(-1), respectively, showing
   promising results of reasonable repeatability and linearity in certain
   ranges.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we derive and implement an algorithm for an indoor mobile
   robotics platform to estimate the manipulability of initially unknown
   obstacles while navigating through its environment to a pre-specified
   goal. The environment is represented by an evidence grid, where each
   cell contains a gamma-distributed cost as well as visual feature data in
   the form of a color histogram. While navigating, the robot associates
   visual features of objects occupying a given cell with manipulability
   cost estimates of that cell, learning whether an object or obstacle can
   be moved or not in the robot's attempt to reach the goal. We derive and
   utilize a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimate for the cost of each
   cell in order to incorporate an exploration (versus pure exploitation)
   element to the robot's search for the lowest-cost path. Combining the
   LCB cost estimates with the dynamic replanning search algorithm
   D{*}-Lite, we can quickly compute optimal navigation paths regardless of
   the numerous changes occurring in the robot's environmental belief
   state. We explain the probabilistic representation of cost in the
   evidence grid and provide simulation and real-world results for our
   algorithm in a navigation scenario with static and movable objects.}},

Abstract = {{Electric transportation is one of the key elements of the future power
   systems since conventional power networks are rapidly evolving towards
   smart grids. This transition creates the need for systematic utilization
   of electric vehicles (EV) in order to avoid unpredictable effects on the
   power systems. An accurate and efficient method for demand forecasting
   of EVs is needed to perform a feasible scheduling of resources in order
   to supply the predicted load sufficiently.
   This paper presents a method for electricity demand forecasting
   considering EV parking lots' charging demand using historical load data.
   The method is based on auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
   model for medium-term demand forecasting. The proposed approach improves
   the forecasting accuracy. Probabilistic hierarchical EVs' parking lot
   demand modeling is used to estimate the expected load for each parking
   lots' daily charging demand. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach, it is implemented on PJM historical load data.
   The simulation results show the high accuracy of the proposed method for
   electricity demand forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Smart Grid was introduced to achieve an
   environmentally-friendly, adequate, secure and fossil fuel-independent
   power system. The large scale smart grid studies require accurate state
   estimation to obtain an acceptable adequacy level. There exist some
   challenges regarding anomalous power flow studies which motivate grid
   operators to utilize robust and accurate estimation methods. Therefore,
   power system state estimators play a pivotal role in real-time grid
   management. In this paper, a sequential linear minimum mean square error
   (LMMSE) estimator is utilized to solve the DC power flow problem. First,
   we introduce the classic linear estimator model which assumes that
   to-be-estimated parameter values are unknown but deterministic. The
   LMMSE estimator will be discussed which treats the to-be-estimated
   parameter as a random variable with a known prior probability density
   function (pdf). We evaluate the accuracy of the LMMSE estimator by
   comparing it with maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Finally, the
   effect of covariance matrix topology will be studied by defining three
   scenarios with different noise covariance matrices.}},

Abstract = {{A novel passivity-based controller using three time-scale separations is
   introduced for variable speed drives of flywheel energy storage systems.
   The time-scale separation between the power electronics, the electrical
   machine variables, and the mechanical machine variables is used in order
   to design a nested three-layer controller. Since the dynamics of the
   variable speed drive are non-linear, the controller uses passivity-based
   control logic to achieve regulation of both the flywheel speed and the
   currents into the power electronics. Finally, the controller is
   demonstrated for transient stabilization of an interconnected power
   system in response to a large sudden wind generator disturbance.}},

   The proposed control scheme can enable the wind generator to provide new

   design a controller for the rotor side converter (RSC) that guarantees
   maximum power point tracking (MPPT) while the controller for the grid
   side converter (GSC) guarantees transient stabilization of a neighboring

Abstract = {{With improvements in smart sensing and digital instrumentation
   technologies, small, low-cost sensors have been installed in power
   networks, thus providing new opportunities for smart monitoring. Smart
   monitoring consists of analog/digital sensors, measurement units,
   control devices, and protective relays inside a digital communication
   network working together to gather local information about the power
   grid, to be recorded in the servers and to demonstrate human machine
   interfaces ( HMI). To keep a power system operating reliably, it is
   necessary to continuously monitor and indicate crucial points of the
   power network. This paper introduces various aspects of power system
   monitoring and indication and proposes a mathematic model to numerically
   assess the positive effects of smart monitoring on the power system's
   reliability. Based on the Markov model, the formulation used to
   calculate the updated failure and repair rates of the power equipment is
   extracted.}},

Abstract = {{The recent interest in distributed control strategies is motivated by
   the fact that the future electric power grid is expected to accommodate
   significantly more distributed resources. This future distributed
   infrastructure requires more autonomous control schemes for its
   scattered components, e. g., power flow control devices as considered in
   this paper. To this end, this paper presents a distributed control
   scheme for solving the DC Optimal Power Flow problem for an electricity
   network in which transmission lines are potentially instrumented with
   Distributed Flexible AC Transmission Systems (D-FACTS). Our approach
   constitutes a distributed iterative procedure which aims to solve the
   first order optimality conditions of the corresponding optimization
   problem. In this iterative algorithm, the responsibility of each bus
   includes updating a few local variables and exchanging updated variables
   with a few neighboring buses. Specifically, the updates at each bus
   include local innovation terms that are derived from the first order
   optimality conditions and preserve the coupling between the neighboring
   Lagrange multipliers and enforce the supply/demand balance. Due to the
   non-convexity of the primal problem, global optimality is not
   guaranteed, however, our results show that the distributed procedure
   converges to a solution of the first order optimality conditions
   yielding a local optimum. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated
   using the IEEE 14-bus and the IEEE-118 bus test systems.}},

Abstract = {{Wind intermittency is the main obstacle to wider integration of wind
   generation. Jay Apt et. al. claim that wind power generation is so
   unreliable that 100\% of scheduled wind generation must be backed up by
   spinning non-renewable generators. We believe that the requirements for
   spinning reserve can be reduced by effective short-term forecasting on
   both spatial and temporal information. Although similar work has been
   reported {[}1] in the past, we analyze the available information using
   different data sets and machine learning methods to provide a comparison
   of multiple statistical approaches. The training data includes
   historical wind speed and direction at locations close to the site of
   interest. The used machine learning methods are sequential minimal
   optimization (SMO) regression, linear regression, multilayer perceptron,
   and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network.}},

   framework of current scheduling and two-settlement processes carried out

Abstract = {{Ankle inversion-eversion compliance is an important feature of
   conventional prosthetic feet, and control of inversion, or roll, in
   robotic prostheses could improve balance for people with amputation. We
   designed a tethered ankle-foot prosthesis with two
   independently-actuated toes that are coordinated to provide
   plantarflexion and inversion-eversion torques. This configuration allows
   a simple lightweight structure with a total mass of 0.72 kg. Strain
   gages on the toes measure torque with less than 2.7\% RMS error, while
   compliance in the Bowden cable tether provides series elasticity.
   Benchtop tests demonstrated a 90\% rise time of less than 33 ms and peak
   torques of 180 N.m in plantarflexion and +/- 30 N.m in
   inversion-eversion. The phase-limited closedloop torque bandwidth is 20
   Hz with a 90 N.m amplitude chirp in plantarflexion, and 24 Hz with a 20
   N.m amplitude chirp in inversion-eversion. The system has low
   sensitivity to toe position disturbances at frequencies of up to 18 Hz.
   Walking trials with five values of constant inversion-eversion torque
   demonstrated RMS torque tracking errors of less than 3.7\% in
   plantarflexion and less than 5.9\% in inversion-eversion. These
   properties make the platform suitable for haptic rendering of virtual
   devices in experiments with humans, which may reveal strategies for
   improving balance or allow controlled comparisons of conventional
   prosthesis features. A similar morphology may be effective for
   autonomous devices.}},

Abstract = {{Lower-limb exoskeletons capable of comfortably applying high torques at
   high bandwidth can be used to probe the human neuromuscular system and

   and series elastic elements for improved torque control. Both devices
   have low mass (<0.88 kg), are modular, structurally compliant in

   The exoskeletons are actuated by an off-board motor, and torque is
   controlled using a combination of proportional feedback and damping
   injection with iterative learning during walking tests. We tested
   closed-loop torque control by commanding 50 N.m and 20 N.m linear chirps
   in desired torque while the exoskeletons were worn by human users, and
   measured bandwidths greater than 16 Hz and 21 Hz, respectively. During
   walking trials, we demonstrated 120 N.m peak torque and 2.0 N.m RMS
   torque tracking error. These performance measures compare favorably with
   existing devices and with human ankle musculature, and show that these
   exoskeletons can be used to rapidly explore a wide range of control
   techniques and robotic assistance paradigms as elements of versatile,
   high-performance testbeds. Our results also provide insights into

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and manufacturing of soft artificial

   hand gestures by measuring joint motions of five fingers. The proposed
   skin was made of a hyperelastic elastomer material with embedded
   microchannels filled with two different liquid conductors, an ionic
   liquid and a liquid metal. The ionic liquid microchannels were used to
   detect the mechanical strain changes of the sensing material, and the
   liquid metal microchannels were used as flexible and stretchable
   electrical wires for connecting the sensors to an external control
   circuit. The two heterogeneous liquid conductors were electrically
   interfaced through flexible conductive threads to prevent the two liquid
   from being intermixed. The skin device was connected to a computer
   through a microcontroller instrumentation circuit for reconstructing the
   3-D hand motions graphically. The paper also presents preliminary

Abstract = {{Vibration-driven locomotion has been widely used for crawling robot
   studies. Such robots usually have a vibration motor as the actuator and
   a fibrillar structure for providing directional friction on the
   substrate. However, there has not been any studies about the effect of
   fiber structure on robot crawling performance. In this paper, we develop
   Fiberbot, a custom made mini vibration robot, for studying the effect of
   fiber angle on robot velocity, steering, and climbing performance. It is
   known that the friction force with and against fibers depends on the
   fiber angle. Thus, we first present a new fabrication method for making
   millimeter scale fibers at a wide range of angles. We then show that
   using 30 degrees angle fibers that have the highest friction anisotropy
   (ratio of backward to forward friction force) among the other fibers we
   fabricated in this study, Fiberbot speed on glass increases to 13.8 +/-
   0.4 cm/s (compared to v = 0.6 +/- 0.1 cm/s using vertical fibers). We
   also demonstrate that the locomotion direction of Fiberbot depends on
   the tilting direction of fibers and we can steer the robot by rotating
   the fiber pad. Fiberbot could also climb on glass at inclinations of up
   to 10 degrees when equipped with fibers of high friction anisotropy. We
   show that adding a rigid tail to the robot it can climb on glass at 25
   degrees inclines. Moreover, the robot is able to crawl on rough surfaces
   such as wood (v = 10.0 +/- 0.2 cm/s using 30 degrees fiber pad).
   Fiberbot, a low-cost vibration robot equipped with a custom-designed
   fiber pad with steering and climbing capabilities could be used for
   studies on collective behavior on a wide range of topographies as well
   as search and exploratory missions.}},

Abstract = {{Successful deployment of a snake robot in search and rescue tasks
   requires the capability of generating controls which can adapt to
   unknown environments in real-time. However, available motion generation
   techniques can be computationally expensive and lack the ability to
   adapt to the surroundings. This work considers modeling the rolling
   motion of a snake robot by applying the Bellows model with computation
   reduction techniques. One benefit of this is that controllers are
   defined with physically meaningful parameters, which in turn allows for
   higher level control of the robot. Another benefit is that it allows
   controllers to be defined by `` composing shapes{''}, which enables
   developing controllers that can adapt to the surroundings. Using shape
   composition, we implemented a novel gait, named rolling hump, which
   forms a contour-fitting hump to negotiate obstacles. The efficacy of a
   snake robot climbing over obstacles by using the rolling hump is
   experimentally evaluated. An autonomous control strategy is presented
   and realized in simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Few comparisons have been performed across torque controllers for
   exoskeletons, and differences among devices have made interpretation
   difficult. In this study, we designed, developed and compared the
   torque-tracking performance of nine control methods, including
   variations on classical feedback control, model-based control, adaptive
   control and iterative learning. Each was tested with four high-level
   controllers that determined desired torque based on time, joint angle, a
   neuromuscular model, or electromyography. Controllers were implemented
   on a tethered ankle exoskeleton with series elastic actuation.
   Measurements were taken while one human subject walked on a treadmill at
   1.25 m.s(-1) for one hundred steady-state steps. The combination of
   proportional control with damping injection and iterative learning
   resulted in the lowest errors for all high-level controllers. With
   time-based desired torque, root-mean-squared errors were 0.6 N.m (1.3\%
   of peak desired torque) step by step, and 0.1 N.m (0.2\%) on average.
   These results indicate that model-free, integration-free feedback
   control is suited to the uncertain dynamics of the human-robot system,
   while iterative learning is effective in the cyclic task of walking.}},

Abstract = {{Pendulum models have been studied as benchmark problems for development
   of nonlinear control schemes, as well as reduced-order models for the
   dynamics analysis of locomotion of humanoid robots. This work provides a
   generalization of the previously introduced Reaction Mass Pendulum
   (RMP), which is a multibody inverted pendulum model, to a bipedal model
   that can better model bipedal locomotion. The RMP consists of an
   extensible ``leg{''} and a ``body{''} with moving proof masses that give
   rise to a variable rotational inertia. The Reaction Mass Biped (RMB)
   introduced here has two legs, one of which takes the role of a stance
   leg and the other performs as a swing leg during bipedal locomotion. The
   bipedal walking dynamics model of the RMB is therefore hybrid, with the
   roles of stance leg and swing leg interchanged after each cycle. The
   dynamics model is developed using a variational mechanics approach,
   without using generalized coordinates for the rotational degrees of
   freedom. This dynamics model has thirteen degrees of freedom, all of
   which are considered to be actuated in the control design. A set of
   desired state trajectories that can enable bipedal walking in straight
   and curved lines are generated. A control scheme is then designed for
   asymptotically stable tracking of this set of trajectories with an
   almost global domain of attraction. Numerical simulation results confirm
   the stability of this tracking control scheme for different walking
   trajectories of the RMB.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we examine two design modifications to a tethered
   motor-driven flapping-wing system. Previously, we had demonstrated a
   simple mechanism utilizing a linear transmission for resonant operation
   and direct drive of the wing flapping angle for control. The initial
   two-wing system had a weight of 2.7 grams and a maximum lift-to-weight
   ratio of 1.4. While capable of vertical takeoff, in open-loop flight it
   demonstrated instability and pitch oscillations at the wing flapping
   frequency, leading to flight times of only a few wing strokes. Here the
   effect of vertical wing offset as well as an alternative multi-wing
   layout is investigated and experimentally tested with newly constructed
   prototypes. With only a change in vertical wing offset, stable open-loop
   flight of the two-wing flapping system is shown to be theoretically
   possible, but difficult to achieve with our current design and operating
   parameters. Both of the new two and four-wing systems, however, prove
   capable of flying to the end of the tether, with the four-wing system
   prototype eliminating disruptive wing beat oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic prostheses can improve walking performance for amputees, but
   prescription of these devices has been hindered by their high cost and
   uncertainty about the degree to which individuals will benefit. The
   typical prescription process cannot well predict how an individual will
   respond to a device they have never used because it bases decisions on
   subjective assessment of an individual's current activity level. We
   propose a new approach in which individuals `test drive' candidate
   devices using a prosthesis emulator while their walking performance is
   quantitatively assessed and results are distilled to inform
   prescription. In this system, prosthesis behavior is controlled by
   software rather than mechanical implementation, so users can quickly
   experience a broad range of devices. To test the viability of the
   approach, we developed a prototype emulator and assessment protocol,
   leveraging hardware and methods we previously developed for basic
   science experiments. We demonstrated emulations across the spectrum of
   commercially available prostheses, including traditional (e.g. SACH),
   dynamic-elastic (e.g. FlexFoot), and powered robotic (e.g. BiOM (R) T2)
   prostheses. Emulations exhibited low error with respect to reference
   data and provided subjectively convincing representations of each
   device. We demonstrated an assessment protocol that differentiated
   device classes for each individual based on quantitative performance
   metrics, providing feedback that could be used to make objective,
   personalized device prescriptions.}},

   Function-Based Quadratic Programs}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method to address the actuator saturation
   for nonlinear hybrid systems by directly incorporating user-defined
   input bounds in a controller design. In particular, we consider the
   application of bipedal walking and show that our method {[}based on a
   quadratic programming (QP) implementation of a control Lyapunov function
   (CLF)-based controller] enables a gradual performance degradation while
   still continuing to walk under increasingly stringent input bounds. We
   draw on our previous work, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of
   the CLF-based controllers for stabilizing periodic gaits for biped
   walkers. This paper presents a framework, which results in more
   effective handling of control saturations and provides a means for
   incorporating a whole family of user-defined constraints into the online
   computation of a CLF-based controller. This paper concludes with an
   experimental validation of the main results on the bipedal robot MABEL,
   demonstrating the usefulness of the QP-based CLF approach for real-time

Title = {{Linear Theory for Self-Localization: Convexity, Barycentric Coordinates,
   and Cayley Menger Determinants}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1326-1339}},
Abstract = {{Localization, finding the coordinates of an object with respect to other
   objects with known coordinates hereinafter, referred to as anchors, is a
   nonlinear problem, as it involves solving circle equations when relating
   distances to Cartesian coordinates, or, computing Cartesian coordinates
   from angles using the law of sines. This nonlinear problem has been a
   focus of significant attention over the past two centuries and the
   progress follows closely with the advances in instrumentation as well as
   applied mathematics, geometry, statistics, and signal processing. The
   Internet-of-Things (IoT), with massive deployment of wireless tagged
   things, has renewed the interest and activity in finding novel, expert,
   and accurate indoor self localization methods, where a particular
   emphasis is on distributed approaches. This paper is dedicated to
   reviewing a notable alternative to the nonlinear localization problem,
   i.e., a linear-convex method, based on Khan et al.'s work. This linear
   solution utilizes relatively unknown geometric concepts in the context
   of localization problems, i.e., the barycentric coordinates and the
   Cayley Menger determinants. Specifically, in an m-dimensional Euclidean
   space, a set of m + 1 anchors, objects with known locations, is
   sufficient (and necessary) to localize an arbitrary collection of
   objects with unknown locations hereinafter, referred to as sensors, with
   a linear-iterative algorithm. To ease the presentation, we discuss the
   solution under a structural convexity condition, namely, the sensors lie
   inside the convex hull of at least m + 1 anchors. Although rigorous
   results are included, several remarks and discussion throughout this
   paper provide the intuition behind the solution and are primarily aimed
   toward researchers and practitioners interested in learning about this
   challenging field of research. Additional figures and demos have been
   added as auxiliary material to support this aim.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1592-1604}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a variation-based method to linearize the
   nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems, whose configuration spaces
   contain the manifolds S-2 and SO(3), along dynamically feasible
   reference trajectories. The proposed variation-based linearization
   results in an implicitly time-varying linear system, representing the
   error dynamics, that is globally valid. We illustrate this method
   through three different systems: 1) a 3-D pendulum: 2) a spherical
   pendulum; and 3) a quadrotor with a suspended load, whose dynamics
   evolve on SO(3), S-2, and SE(3) x S-2, respectively. We show that for
   these systems, the resulting time-varying linear system obtained as the
   linearization about a reference trajectory is controllable for all
   possible reference trajectories. Finally, a linear quadratic
   regulator-based controller is designed to attenuate the error so as to
   locally exponentially stabilize tracking of a reference trajectory for
   the nonlinear system. Several simulations results are provided to
   validate the effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{One characteristic of non-volatile memory (NVM) is that, even though it
   supports non-volatility, its retention capability is limited. To handle
   this issue, previous studies have focused on refreshing or advanced
   error correction code (ECC). In this paper, we take a different approach
   that makes use of the limited retention capability to our advantage.
   Specifically, we employ NVM as a file cache and devise a new scheme
   called amnesic cache management (ACM). The scheme is motivated by our
   observation that most data in a cache are evicted within a short time
   period after they have been entered into the cache, implying that they
   can be written with the relaxed retention capability. This retention
   relaxation can enhance the overall cache performance in terms of latency
   and energy since the data retention capability is proportional to the
   write latency. In addition, to prevent the retention relaxation from
   degrading the hit ratio, we estimate the future reference intervals
   based on the inter-reference gap (IRG) model and manage data adaptively.
   Experimental results with real-world workloads show that our scheme can
   reduce write latency by up to 40\% (30\% on average) and save energy
   consumption by up to 49\% (37\% on average) compared with the
   conventional LRU based cache management scheme.}},

   validation in either pre-silicon or post-silicon stage is to estimate
   the parametric yield of the performances. In this paper, we propose a
   novel Bayesian model fusion method for efficient multivariate moment
   estimation of multiple correlated performance metrics by borrowing the
   prior knowledge from the early stage. The key idea is to model the
   multiple performance metrics as a jointly Gaussian distribution and
   encode the prior knowledge as a normal-Wishart distribution according to
   the theory of conjugate prior. The late-stage multivariate moments can
   be accurately estimated by Bayesian inference with very few late-stage
   samples. Several circuit examples demonstrate that the proposed method
   can achieve up to 16x cost reduction over the traditional method without
   surrendering any accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) have been
   widely used to accelerate computing in various applications. To store
   the contexts of thousands of concurrent threads on a GPU, a large static
   random-access memory (SRAM)-based register file is employed. Due to high
   leakage power of SRAM, the register file consumes 20\% to 40\% of the
   total GPU power consumption. Thus, hybrid memory system, which combines
   SRAM and the emerging non-volatile memory (NVM), has been employed for
   register file design on GPUs. Although it has shown strong potential to
   alleviate the power issue of GPUs, existing hybrid memory solutions
   might not exploit the intrinsic feature of GPU register file. By
   leveraging the warp schedule on GPU, this paper proposes a hybrid
   register architecture which consists of a NVM-based register file and
   mixed SRAM-based write buffers with a warp-aware write back strategy.
   Simulation results show that our design can eliminate 64\% of write
   accesses to NVM and reduce power of register file by 66\% on average,
   with only 4.2\% performance degradation. After we apply the power gating
   technique, the register power is further reduced to 25\% of SRAM
   counterpart on average.}},

Abstract = {{For deeply scaled digital integrated systems, the power required for
   transporting data between memory and logic can exceed the power needed
   for computation, thereby limiting the efficacy of synthesizing logic and
   compiling memory independently. Logic-in-Memory (LiM) architectures
   address this challenge by embedding logic within the memory block to
   perform basic operations on data locally for specific functions. While
   custom smart memories have been successfully constructed for various
   applications, a fully automated LiM synthesis flow enables architectural
   exploration that has heretofore not been possible. In this paper we
   present a tool and design methodology for LiM physical synthesis that
   performs co-design of algorithms and architectures to explore system
   level trade-offs. The resulting layouts and timing models can be
   incorporated within any physical synthesis tool. Silicon results shown
   in this paper demonstrate a 250x performance improvement and 310x energy
   savings for a data-intensive application example.}},

   advantages of being coordinate-free and compact, these controllers don't
   take into account constraints such as safety-critical collision
   constraints or input saturations. In this paper, we utilize the concepts
   of control Lyapunov function(CLF) and control Barrier function(CBF) to
   incorporate various constraints in a state-dependent quadratic
   programming(QP). Through relaxation, a proper trade-off has been made
   between the constraints imposed by CLF and CBF. Then qualitative
   analysis of this design method is derived in detail, and we provide
   convincing simulation results on a point mass, a spherical pendulum, and
   a 3D pendulum.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor networks use binary measurements and state estimations for
   several reasons, including communication and processing overheads. Such
   a state estimator is vulnerable to attackers that can hijack a subset of
   the sensors in an effort to change the state estimate. After exhibiting
   a simulation that demonstrates the possible effect of integrity
   cyberphysical systems, this paper extends the authors' methodology for
   designing the detectors resilient to integrity attacks, using the
   concept of invariant sets, to systems where the sensor measurements are
   not independent. In cyberphysical systems, the sensors in question
   monitor a system constrained to obey physical laws, so that physical
   quantities measured by and the noise in each sensor will be correlated
   to the sensors close to it. Further increase in the confidence of the
   estimate can be achieved by considering these correlations. This paper
   focuses on modeling the correlation between the sensors and its
   ramifications on the worst-case probability of detection.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the minimal cost constrained input-output (I/O)

   time-invariant plant, where a collection of possible inputs and outputs
   is known a priori, we aim to determine the collection of inputs, outputs
   and communication among them incurring in the minimum cost, such that
   desired control performance, measured in terms of arbitrary
   pole-placement capability of the closed-loop system, is ensured. We show
   that this problem is NP-hard in general (in the size of the state
   space). However, the subclass of problems, in which the dynamic matrix
   is irreducible, is shown to be polynomially solvable and the
   corresponding algorithm is presented. In addition, under the same
   assumption, the same algorithm can be used to solve the minimal cost
   constrained I/O selection problem, and the minimal cost control
   configuration selection problem, individually. In order to illustrate
   the main results of this paper, some simulations are also provided.}},

Abstract = {{A significant impediment to implementing micro-and nanoswitch technology
   is that the small contact areas (10(-4) to 10(2) mu m(2)) and low forces
   (nano to micronewtons) render the surfaces inherently susceptible to
   contamination, which increases their contact resistance. In this work,
   we report on the formation of carbonaceous tribopolymer (TP) in
   microswitches under controlled environmental conditions in order to
   characterize its behavior. We clean switches coated by Pt or RuO2 thin
   films using vacuum bakeouts, and test them in the same chamber in
   ultra-high purity gases including nitrogen and oxygen. We introduce
   controlled levels of benzene contaminant from 0.02 to 2500 parts per
   million to test the immunity of different material/environment
   combinations to TP buildup. We find that repetitively making and
   breaking contact and passing electrical current through it produces TP.
   TP also builds up more quickly in nitrogen rather than nitrogen: oxygen
   backgrounds both for Pt and RuO2 materials. It appears possible to
   convert TP into a more conductive form, which we associate using Raman
   spectroscopy with an increase in its graphitic content.}},

Abstract = {{MEMS switch reliability studies have identified contamination of the
   electrical contact surfaces as an important source of failure. It has
   been previously reported that the formation of electrically insulating
   organic deposits degrades switch performance by increasing contact
   resistance. Previously, we performed a high temperature bakeout under
   ultra-high vacuum (UHV) to desorb possible contaminant sources from Pt
   electrodes prior to cycling tests in a MEMS switch. In this work, an
   in-situ plasma-cleaning method of Pt is assessed for its ability to
   actively remove adsorbed contaminants. Microswitch contact resistance is
   measured before and after UHV bakeout or plasma cleaning of the

Abstract = {{Accurately estimating the rare failure events of nanoscale ICs in a
   high-dimensional variation space is extremely challenging. In this
   paper, we propose a novel Bayesian scaled sigma sampling (BSSS)
   technique to address this technical challenge. BSSS can be considered as
   an extension of the traditional scaled-sigma sampling (SSS) approach.
   The key idea is to explore the ``similarity{''} between different SSS
   models fitted at different design stages and encode it as our prior
   knowledge. Bayesian model fusion is then adopted to fit the SSS model
   with consideration of the prior knowledge. A sense amplifier example
   designed in a 45 nm CMOS process is used to demonstrate the efficacy of
   BSSS. Experimental results demonstrate that BSSS achieves superior
   accuracy over the conventional SSS and minimum-norm importance sampling
   approaches when a few hundred random variables are used to model process
   variations.}},

   trace of a monitored system (i.e., a monitor interposed between a system
   and an environment) a probability and a real number that represents the
   cost that the actions appearing on the trace incur on the monitored
   system. This allows us to calculate the probabilistic (expected) cost of
   the monitor and the monitored system, which we use to classify monitors,
   not only in the typical sense, as sound and transparent {[}ACM

   also at a more fine-grained level, as cost-optimal or cost-efficient. We
   show how a cost-optimal monitor can be built using information about
   cost and the probabilistic future behavior of the system and the

   construction of more efficient security mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a new behavioral thermal modeling method for
   fast building performance analysis, which is critical for
   energy-efficient smart building control and management. The new approach
   is based on two recurrent neutral network architecture to obtain the
   compact nonlinear thermal models for complicated building. We start with
   a more realistic building simulation program, EnergyPlus, from
   Department of Energy, to model some practical buildings such as office
   buildings and data centers. EnergyPlus can model the various time-series
   inputs to a building such as ambient temperature, heating, ventilation,
   and air-conditioning (HVAC) inputs, power consumption of electronic
   equipment, lighting and number of occupants in a room sampled in each
   hour and produce resulting temperature traces of zones (rooms). In this
   work, we apply two recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures to build
   the non-linear compact thermal model of the building: one is non-linear
   state-space RNN architecture (NLSS), which has global feedbacks, and the
   other one is Elman's RNN architecture (ELNN), which has local feedbacks
   in each layer. We give a simple formula to calculate the RNN layer
   number, layer size to configure RNN architecture to avoid overfitting
   and underfitting problems. A cross-validation based training technique
   is further applied to improve predictable accuracy of models.
   Experimental results from a case study of three buildings show that ELNN
   and NLSS can both build very accurate building thermal models for the
   2-zone and 5-zone building cases: both of them have average errors from
   around 1\% to 1.5\% for the two buildings. For the more complex 6-zone
   building case, ELNN outperforms NLSS with maximum errors 16\% against
   23\%. But both methods have 2.2\% average errors.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings consume about 40\% of the total energy use in the U.S. and,
   hence, accurately modeling, analyzing and optimizing building energy is
   considered as an extremely important task today. Towards this goal,
   uncertainty/sensitivity analysis has been proposed to identify the
   critical physical and environmental parameters contributing to building
   energy consumption. In this paper, we propose to apply sparse regression
   techniques to uncertainty/sensitivity analysis of smart buildings. We
   consider the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm as a case study
   to demonstrate its superior efficacy over other conventional approaches.
   Experimental results reveal that OMP achieves up to 18.6x runtime
   speedups over the conventional least-squares fitting method without

Abstract = {{Energy and temperature are the main constraints for modern
   high-performance multi-core systems. To save power or increase
   performance, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is widely
   applied in industry. As CMOS technology continues scaling, FinFET has
   recently become the common choice for multi-core systems. In contrast
   with planar CMOS, FinFET is observed to have lower delay under higher
   temperature in super-threshold voltage region, an effect called
   temperature effect inversion (TEI). Due to this effect, performance can
   be further improved under power constraints. This work explores
   TEI-aware performance improvement for power limited multi-core systems.
   Our experimental results show that on average 15.70\% throughput
   improvement can be achieved in steady state by a TEI-aware DVFS policy
   over a TEI-agnostic one. In further investigations, we observe multiple
   sweet spots in the operating voltage/frequency regions resulting from
   TEI effects. Based on these sweet spot operation regimes, this work
   introduces a fast algorithm which determines the maximum performance
   under power constraints. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness
   by exhibiting a speedup of an average of 45.9X in runtime while keeping
   resulting performance only 0.22\% away from existing state-of-the-art
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Despite best efforts, integrated systems are ``born{''} (manufactured)
   with a unique `personality' that stems from our inability to precisely
   fabricate their underlying circuits, and create software a priori for
   controlling the resulting uncertainty. It is possible to use
   sophisticated test methods to identify the best-performing systems but
   this would result in unacceptable yields and correspondingly high costs.
   The system personality is further shaped by its environment (e.g.,
   temperature, noise and supply voltage) and usage (i.e., the frequency
   and type of applications executed), and since both can fluctuate over
   time, so can the system's personality. Systems also ``grow old{''} and
   degrade due to various wear-out mechanisms (e.g., negative-bias
   temperature instability), and unexpectedly due to various early-life
   failure sources. These ``nature and nurture{''} influences make it
   extremely difficult to design a system that will operate optimally for
   all possible personalities. To address this challenge, we propose to
   develop statistical learning in-chip (SLIC). SLIC is a holistic approach
   to integrated system design based on continuously learning key
   personality traits on-line, for self-evolving a system to a state that
   optimizes performance hierarchically across the circuit, platform, and
   application levels. SLIC will not only optimize integrated-system
   performance but also reduce costs through yield enhancement since
   systems that would have before been deemed to have weak personalities
   (unreliable, faulty, etc.) can now be recovered through the use of SLIC.}},

Abstract = {{While many recently proposed audio declipping algorithms are highly
   effective in their ability to restore clipped speech, the algorithms'
   computational complexities inhibit their use in many practical
   situations. Real-time or nearly real-time performance is impossible
   using a typical laptop computer, with some algorithms taking as long as
   400 times the actual duration of the input to complete restoration. This
   paper introduces a novel declipping algorithm, referred to as
   Regularized Blind Amplitude Reconstruction, which is capable of
   restoring clipped audio at rates much faster than real time and at
   restoration qualities comparable to existing algorithms. The quality of
   declipping is evaluated in terms of automatic speech recognition
   performance on declipped speech, as well as the degree to which each
   declipping algorithm improves the audio's signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray tomography is increasingly being used for 4D spatio-temporal
   imaging of material samples at micron and finer scales. However, the
   temporal resolution of widely used 4D reconstruction methods is severely
   limited by the need to acquire a very large number of views for each
   reconstructed 3D volume. In this paper, we present a time interlaced
   model-based iterative reconstruction (TIMBIR) method which can
   significantly improve the temporal resolution of reconstructions. TIMBIR
   is a synergistic combination of two innovations. The first innovation,
   interlaced view sampling, is a novel approach to data acquisition which
   distributes the view angles more evenly in time. The second innovation
   is a 4D model based iterative reconstruction algorithm (MBIR) which can
   produce time resolved volumetric reconstructions of the sample from the
   interlaced views. Reconstructions of simulated data indicate that TIMBIR
   can improve the temporal resolution by an order of magnitude relative to
   existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising cell source for
   cardiac tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for heart repair
   because they can be expanded in vitro and differentiated into most
   cardiovascular cell types, including cardiomyocytes. During embryonic
   heart development, this differentiation occurs under the influence of
   internal and external stimuli that guide cells to go down the cardiac
   lineage. In order to differentiate PSCs in vitro, these or similar
   stimuli need to be provided in a controlled manner. However, because it
   is not possible to completely recapitulate the embryonic environment,
   the factors essential for cardiac differentiation of PSCs in vitro need
   to be experimentally determined and validated. Since PSCs were first
   developed, significant progress has been made in optimizing techniques
   for their differentiation toward cardiomyocytes. In this review, we will
   summarize recent advances in these techniques, with particular focus on
   monolayer-based methods that have improved the efficiency and
   scalability of cardiomyocyte differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, nanometer-scale molecular motors are used to generate force
   within cells for diverse processes from transcription and transport to
   muscle contraction. This adaptability and scalability across wide
   temporal, spatial, and force regimes have spurred the development of
   biological soft robotic systems that seek to mimic and extend these
   capabilities. This review describes how molecular motors are
   hierarchically organized into larger-scale structures in order to
   provide a basic understanding of how these systems work in nature and
   the complexity and functionality we hope to replicate in biological soft
   robotics. These span the subcellular scale to macroscale, and this
   article focuses on the integration of biological components with
   synthetic materials, coupled with bioinspired robotic design. Key
   examples include nanoscale molecular motor-powered actuators, microscale
   bacteria-controlled devices, and macroscale muscle-powered robots that
   grasp, walk, and swim. Finally, the current challenges and future
   opportunities in the field are addressed.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional approach for capacity expansion problem aims to balance
   investment costs with the returns obtained from production. These
   formulations ignore the behavior of competitive markets in which buyers
   select their providers according to their own interest. We propose a
   bilevel optimization formulation that considers the industrial producer
   and the markets as independent decision makers. The upper-level problem
   maximizes the profit of a producer whose revenue is subjected to a
   lower-level linear program (LP) that minimizes markets expenses. As an
   alternative to the single-level reformulation based on the KKT
   optimality conditions, we propose an approach based on strong duality of
   the lower-level LP. Both reformulations are shown to yield the same
   solution, but the duality-based reformulation achieves a significant
   reduction in solution time.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of cryogenic energy storage (CES), which is to store energy in
   the form of liquefied gas, has gained increased interest in recent
   years. Although CES at an industrial scale is a relatively new approach,
   the technology used for CES is well-known and essentially part of any
   cryogenic air separation unit (ASU). In this work, we assess the
   operational benefits of adding CES to an existing air separation plant.
   Three potential new opportunities are investigated: (1) increasing the
   plant's flexibility for load shifting, (2) storing purchased energy and
   selling it back to the market during higher-price periods, (3) creating
   additional revenue by providing operating reserve capacity. We develop a
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheduling model for an ASU-CES
   plant and apply a robust optimization approach to model the uncertainty
   in reserve demand. Results from an industrial case study show that the
   amount of wasted products can be considerably reduced and significant
   cost savings can be achieved by utilizing the CES.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization under uncertainty has been an active area of research for
   many years. However, its application in Process Synthesis has faced a
   number of important barriers that have prevented its effective
   application. Barriers include availability of information on the
   uncertainty of the data (ad-hoc or historical), determination of the
   nature of the uncertainties (exogenous vs. endogenous), selection of an
   appropriate strategy for hedging against uncertainty (robust
   optimization vs. stochastic programming), large computational expense
   (often orders of magnitude larger than deterministic models), and
   difficulty in the interpretation of the results by non-expert users. In
   this paper, we describe recent advances that have addressed some of

Abstract = {{As advanced simulation technologies mature, it is desirable to utilize
   their predictive power in process design and optimization. However,
   these models present unique challenges for traditional optimization
   frameworks. Simulations can be very computationally expensive and
   derivative information may be unavailable. A common approach is to
   construct reduced order models (RMs) that approximate the behavior of
   the simulation with a simple algebraic form. By substituting a RM in
   place of the simulation, one may simultaneously optimize the entire
   flowsheet with traditional, derivative-based techniques. Using trust
   region concepts from nonlinear programming, we systematically construct
   a series of local RMs to help ensure convergence of the overall problem
   with the complex simulation. We compare two methods of handling the
   constraints: a penalty method capable of handling inequality
   constraints, and a novel approach using a filter method that is capable
   of handling both inequality and equality constraints. The advantage of
   the filter method is demonstrated and this method is applied to two
   flowsheet optimization examples: the Williams-Otto process and the
   ammonia synthesis process.}},

Abstract = {{Degenerate constraints, i.e. constraints that violate the Linearly
   Independent Constraint Qualification (LICQ), are prevalent in many
   process optimization problems. These result from poor model formulations
   (typically human error) and overspecifications, zero flowrates and
   disappearing units, and recycle loops. Because degenerate constraints
   lead to singular Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems and significant
   challenges for numeric solvers, these constraints complicate the
   solution procedure for nonlinear programs (NLPs, i.e. nonlinear
   optimization problems). Although most modern NLP solvers implement
   counter-measures to detect and eliminate degeneracies, increased
   computational effort and convergence failures may still result. Instead,
   the best approach is to reformulate the original NLP model.
   Unfortunately, this is difficult for complex models with thousands of
   equations. This work describes the Degeneracy Hunter, an algorithm that
   systematically analyzes any iteration from a continuous mathematical
   program solver and determines irreducible sets of degenerate
   constraints. This tool allows the expert modeler to focus on only a
   handful of equations, instead of the thousands that make up a typical
   process optimization problem. The algorithm has been prototyped in
   MATLAB and analyzes derivative information exported from GAMS.
   Calculation of irreducible sets of degenerate equations is formulated as
   a mixed integer linear program. The algorithm has been applied to a
   non-convex, highly nonlinear Air Separation Unit (ASU) design problem
   with 15,000+ variables and constraints, which identified three sources
   of degenerate equations. Straightforward revisions of the model to
   remove these degenerate constraints resulted in a 16\% decrease in
   average CPU time and less frequent termination at infeasible points.
   Identification of these degeneracies would have been virtually
   impossible without a systematic approach.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important processes in the petrochemical industry is the
   cracking of light hydrocarbons to produce commercially more important
   products such as light olefins and aromatics, which are considered key
   components of the chemical industry. This process is carried out at high
   temperatures in a tubular reactor located in large gas-fired furnaces
   that supplies heat. The topic of this work is to apply process
   optimization to the operation of thermal cracking of ethane in order to
   maximize the production of ethylene. The cracking reactor was modeled as
   a one-dimensional tubular reactor, and the kinetic mechanism used here
   is a detailed free-radical scheme that was carefully selected from
   literature. This application is a challenging problem because of the
   presence of a free-radical mechanism that coupled with material, energy,
   and momentum balances of the reactant-product flow along the reactor
   leads to stiff differential equations that are difficult to solve. In
   this work, these differential-algebraic equations are discretized using
   orthogonal collocation on finite elements, and the collocation equations
   are used as equality constraints in the non-linear optimization problem.
   GAMS optimization-modeling platform is used to implement this
   optimization problem. A comparison between model results and
   experimental data shows that the used approach is a good alternative for
   dealing with this type of optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia is a valuable chemical produced in the industry and is wide used
   in the manufacture of fertilizers, plastics and pharmaceuticals. On the
   other hand, some important tools in chemical processes are modelling,
   simulation and optimization, and these types of studies have attracted
   considerable attention of many researchers. Several models of ammonia
   synthesis have been developed with the purpose of design and
   optimization. The typical design problem in this process requires
   obtained an optimal reactor length with maximum economic return and many
   works in literature have focused on the optimization of this reactor
   using different optimization techniques. In this work, an alternative
   approach to those presented in literature for solving this boundary
   value problem, and determine the optimal solution, is presented. The
   model of the reactor along with the kinetic form a non-linear
   differential-algebraic system. These differential-algebraic equations
   are discretized using orthogonal collocation on finite elements with
   continuous profiles approximated by Lagrange polynomials. In this
   manner, the resulting algebraic collocation equations are written as
   equality constraints in the optimization problem. Thus, the optimization
   problem is solved by implementing the IPOPT solver within the GAMS
   optimization-modeling platform. Although IPOPT solver here implemented
   is a local solver that does not guarantee the global optimum, multiple
   initial guesses were used to solve the problem and obtain an optimal
   solution of the problem. The obtained results are compared with other
   results available in literature and indicate that the used approach is a
   good alternative for dealing with this type of problems.}},

Abstract = {{In prior research, separation of particles or biological cells in
   liquids has been accomplished using a balance of ultrasonic forces and
   viscous drag forces, which depend on particle size and acoustic
   contrast. Recent work by two groups has exploited surface acoustic waves
   launched into tilted microfluidic channels for particle or cell
   separation. Here we demonstrate a similar tilted-channel approach using
   machined channels in PMMA (poly (methyl methacrylate)) and PZT (lead
   zirconate titanate) wafer excitation. Experimental obsservations confirm
   the separation of particles. Simulations have been used to understand
   the observed particle motion and to identify operating parameters for
   particle separation.}},

Abstract = {{Damage to pipes by erosion or cracking can lead to catastrophic failure.
   Of particular concern are particular pipes and other components used in
   fracking, where the pipe working pressure can be rated as high as 15000
   psi and localized erosion can result from particulate matter. We seek to
   develop a robust transducer that can be permanently mounted at critical
   locations and that will insonify the entire circumference of the pipe.
   We will show that a split inductively coupled transducer allows
   insonification of the entire circumference of the pipe from a single
   location. We illustrate the detection of a defect in a test specimen
   using this transducer.}},

   interface with theorem proving technologies that check satisfiability of

   has been to encode symbolic model problems directly as Horn clauses and
   develop dedicated solvers for Horn clauses. Our solvers are called
   Duality, HSF, SeaHorn, and mu Z and we have devoted considerable
   attention in recent papers to algorithms for solving Horn clauses. This
   paper complements these strides as we summarize main useful properties
   of Horn clauses, illustrate encodings of procedural program verification
   into Horn clauses and then highlight a number of useful simplification
   strategies at the level of Horn clauses. Solving Horn clauses amounts to
   establishing Existential positive Fixed-point Logic formulas, a
   perspective that was promoted by Blass and Gurevich.}},

Abstract = {{The design process often requires work by teams, rather than
   individuals. During these times it is likely that situations will arise
   in which members of a team have different opinions, yet a group decision
   must still be made. Unfortunately, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
   indicates that there is no method for aggregating group preferences that
   will always satisfy a small number of ``fair{''} conditions. This work
   seeks to identify methods of combining individual preferences that can
   come close to satisfying Arrow's conditions. Experiential conjoint
   analysis was used to obtain empirical utility functions for drinking mug
   designs. A number of functions for constructing group preference were
   then analysed using both empirical conjoint preferences and randomly
   generated preferences. This analysis involved checking each of Arrow's
   conditions, as well as computing the likelihood that a method will be
   susceptible to manipulation by a dishonest individual. Based on the
   results, methods that should be used to aggregate group preference in
   practice are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Although insights uncovered by design cognition are often utilized to
   develop the methods used by human designers, using such insights to
   inform computational methodologies also has the potential to improve the
   performance of design algorithms. This paper uses insights from research
   on design cognition and design teams to inform a better simulated
   annealing search algorithm. Simulated annealing has already been
   established as a model of individual problem solving. This paper
   introduces the Heterogeneous Simulated Annealing Team (HSAT) algorithm,
   a multi-agent simulated annealing algorithm. Each agent controls an
   adaptive annealing schedule, allowing the team develop heterogeneous
   search strategies. Such diversity is a natural part of engineering
   design, and boosts performance in other multi-agent algorithms. Further,
   interaction between agents in HSAT is structured to mimic interaction
   between members of a design team. Performance is compared to several
   other simulated annealing algorithms, a random search algorithm, and a
   gradient-based algorithm. Compared to other algorithms, the team-based
   HSAT algorithm returns better average results with lower variance.}},

Abstract = {{We present a system for monitoring rail infrastructure from the dynamic
   response of a train in revenue-service. Presently, rail inspection is
   performed either visually or with dedicated track vehicles. We propose
   monitoring the tracks from operational trains, using accelerometers
   inside the cabin of the train. This would offer an economical approach,
   as accelerometers are a low-cost technology, tracks would not have to be
   taken out of service for inspection, and no dedicated inspection
   vehicles or crews would be required. However, using operational trains
   presents three challenges: the speed of the train varies from run to
   run, the position of the train is not known with high accuracy, and the
   vibration signal recorded in the train's cabin is filtered by the train
   and its suspension. We propose extracting features from the signal which
   are robust to these conditions and show that our proposed features allow
   for detecting changes in the infrastructure from the train's dynamic
   response. We demonstrate our ability to detect subtle track changes both
   through simulation and using data we collected from Pittsburgh's Light
   Rail system. This type of sensing, signal processing, and data analysis
   could facilitate safer trains and more cost-efficient maintenance in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation process of many infrastructure systems, such as road
   networks, water and wastewater networks can be modeled in a
   probabilistic framework, incorporating the effect of the maintenance
   policy based on the information collected. Information helps the
   decision maker to reduce uncertainty about the components' condition and
   minimize the corresponding management cost. However information is
   expensive and resources are limited, so the approach to collect
   information has to be carefully selected: specifically, inspection
   scheduling for time-variant components is a key problem in maintenance
   optimization. While it is understood that agents should assess the value
   of available pieces of information and scheduling information collection
   based on that, this pre-posterior analysis is computationally
   intractable for most applications.
   Leveraging our recent work, in this paper we propose a framework for
   inspection scheduling in the context of Partially Observable Markov
   Decision Processes (POMDPs). Specifically, we propose a heuristic to
   approximate the value of information for inspecting components modeled
   by independent POMDPs. The proposed approach assumes that future
   inspections are allocated by a simple stochastic process, independently
   for each component and time. The computational complexity of the
   proposed approach is linear with respect to the number of components.
   We present the framework and evaluate its performance with a numerical
   and an analytical example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, by making two experiments, studies the impact of natural
   culture integration on the user experiences. The results of experiment I
   indicate that: (1) Cloud Pattern and Ink Painting are the most likely to
   activate ``sliding{''} gesture, followed by ``tapping{''} gesture; (2)
   Chinese Seals and Paper-cut tend to activate ``pinching{''} gesture,
   followed by ``sliding{''} and ``tapping{''} gestures; (3) Gu Zheng and
   Shadow Figures have generally same tendency to activate ``tapping{''},
   ``sliding{''} and ``pinching{''} gestures; (4) Calligraphy tends to
   activate ``sliding{''} gesture. The results of experiment II show that:
   (1) gesture type has very limited influence on the interaction
   experience; (2) task complexity affects the user experience
   significantly; (3) the way of integration of cultural elements has
   significant relationship with ``Feedback Clarity{''}, ``Easy-to-use{''},
   ``Satisfaction in Feedback{''}, ``Satisfaction for Culture
   Utilization{''}, ``Natural Degree of Culture Utilization{''} and
   ``Degree of Interesting{''}, and has very limited correlations with
   ``Feedback Understandability{''} and ``Memorability{''}. Except for
   ``Feedback Clarity{''}, other 5 evaluations are the best in the natural
   integration condition and the worst in no integration condition. In
   brief, the two experiments indicate that the natural integration of
   cultural elements promoted the user experience, even though it reduced
   the clarity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many software engineering curriculum contain a team-based
   project course. This is the case of Carnegie Mellon University Silicon
   Valley's masters of science in software engineering. In this context, we
   have been using Essence Reflection Meetings for five semesters with 17
   teams and approximately 70 students. During these meetings, the teams
   reflect on various project's dimensions based on a systems thinking
   framework. The positive results have been published in research papers.
   Activity and Discussions: Participants will learn about Essence
   Reflection Meetings for team-based project courses by practicing in a
   classroom environment. They will discuss challenges and solutions for
   team-based project courses, and how the proposed approach could
   potentially be leveraged in their own teaching environment.
   Organization: We will start the tutorial with a discussion revealing the
   participants positive and negative experiences with team-based projects.
   After briefly introducing the Essence's systems thinking framework and
   our research results, we will use hands-on training exercises to
   demonstrate how to use the approach. This will be followed with guided
   debriefing. Finally, we will go deeper into the Essence framework, and
   discuss our research results and their applicability in various teaching
   environments.
   Learning Objectives: By the end of the tutorial, participants will be
   familiar with a systems thinking framework that they can leverage to
   coach their students teams and monitor their progress. They will be able
   to articulate the pros and cons of applying the approach in their own
   teaching environment.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{3969-3990}},
Abstract = {{This study applies quantile regression (QR) to predict exceedance
   probabilities of various water levels, including flood stages, with
   combinations of deterministic forecasts, past forecast errors and rates
   of water level rise as independent variables. A computationally cheap
   technique to estimate forecast uncertainty is valuable, because many
   national flood forecasting services, such as the National Weather
   Service (NWS), only publish deterministic single-valued forecasts. The
   study uses data from the 82 river gauges, for which the NWS' North
   Central River Forecast Center issues forecasts daily. Archived forecasts
   for lead times of up to 6 days from 2001 to 2013 were analyzed. Besides
   the forecast itself, this study uses the rate of rise of the river stage
   in the last 24 and 48 h and the forecast error 24 and 48 h ago as
   predictors in QR configurations. When compared to just using the
   forecast as an independent variable, adding the latter four predictors
   significantly improved the forecasts, as measured by the Brier skill
   score and the continuous ranked probability score. Mainly, the
   resolution increases, as the forecast-only QR configuration already
   delivered high reliability. Combining the forecast with the other four
   predictors results in a much less favorable performance. Lastly, the
   forecast performance does not strongly depend on the size of the
   training data set but on the year, the river gauge, lead time and event
   threshold that are being forecast. We find that each event threshold
   requires a separate configuration or at least calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic ice cores have been used to study the history of black carbon
   (BC), but little is known with regards to the physical and chemical
   characteristics of these particles in the remote atmosphere.
   Characterization remains limited by ultra-trace concentrations in ice
   core samples and the lack of adequate methods to isolate the particles
   unaltered from the melt water. To investigate the physical and chemical
   characteristics of these particles, we have developed a tangential flow
   filtration (TFF) method combined with transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). Tests using ultrapure water and polystyrene latex particle
   standards resulted in excellent blanks and significant particle
   recovery. This approach has been applied to melt water from Antarctic
   ice cores as well as tropical rain from Darwin, Australia with
   successful results: TEM analysis revealed a variety of BC particle
   morphologies, insoluble coatings, and the attachment of BC to mineral
   dust particles. The TFF-based concentration of these particles has
   proven to give excellent results for TEM studies of BC particles in
   Antarctic ice cores and can be used for future studies of insoluble
   aerosols in rainwater and ice core samples.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present SeaHorn, a software verification framework.
   The key distinguishing feature of SeaHorn is its modular design that
   separates the concerns of the syntax of the programming language, its
   operational semantics, and the verification semantics. SeaHorn
   encompasses several novelties: it (a) encodes verification conditions
   using an efficient yet precise inter-procedural technique, (b) provides
   flexibility in the verification semantics to allow different levels of
   precision, (c) leverages the state-of-the-art in software model checking
   and abstract interpretation for verification, and (d) uses Horn-clauses
   as an intermediate language to represent verification conditions which
   simplifies interfacing with multiple verification tools based on
   Horn-clauses. SeaHorn provides users with a powerful verification tool
   and researchers with an extensible and customizable framework for
   experimenting with new software verification techniques. The
   effectiveness and scalability of SeaHorn are demonstrated by an
   extensive experimental evaluation using benchmarks from SV-COMP 2015 and
   real avionics code.}},

Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{E282-E288}},
Abstract = {{Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging desalination technology
   which utilizes porous electrodes to remove ions in water by
   electrosorption. Similar to electric capacitors, energy is stored and
   released during charging and discharging cycles, respectively. In this
   study, a nanoporous activated carbon coupled flow-through CDI device was
   used to evaluate energy consumption and recovery under various
   operational conditions by charging and discharging the cell at a
   constant current, respectively. Results indicated that the
   charging/discharging current, salt concentration and water flow rate
   were major factors impacting electrosorption and energy consumption, by
   changing the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) and how ion
   transport occurs between the interface and bulk solution. A
   porosity-based EDL theory was applied to explain the experimental
   observations. Between 30 and 45\% of the energy consumed during charging
   could be recovered depending on operational conditions, although
   thermodynamically more than 98\% of the total energy should be
   recoverable. Results indicated that overpotential and faradaic reactions
   induced irreversible energy are the major reasons for gaps in observed
   energy losses. Energy consumption for reducing the salinity of brackish
   water from 32.7 to 5.5 mM by our device could be as low as 0.85 kWh/m(3)
   under most optimized conditions (dependent on materials used and cell
   configuration). The energy consumption can be dramatically reduced by
   employing more electron-conductive and Faradaic-resistant electrode
   materials. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{28943-28949}},
Abstract = {{Discovering new materials with tailored chemical properties is vital for
   advancing key technologies in catalysis and energy conversion. One
   strategy is the modification of a material's crystal structure, and new
   methods allow for the synthesis and stabilization of potential materials
   in a range of crystal polymorph structures. We assess the potential
   reactivity of four metastable oxide polymorphs of MO2 (M = Ru, Rh, Pt,
   Ir) transition metal oxides. In spite of the similar local geometry and
   coordination between atoms in the metastable polymorphic and stable
   rutile structure, we find that polymorph reactivities cannot be
   explained by strain alone and offer tunable reactivity and increased
   stability. Atom-projected density of states reveals that the unique
   reactivity of polymorphs are caused by a redistribution of energy levels
   of the t(2g)-states. This structure-activity relationship is induced by
   slight distortions to the M-O bonds in polymorphic structures and is
   unattainable by strain. We predict columbite IrO2 to be more active than
   rutile IrO2 for oxygen evolution.}},

Pages = {{7877-7887}},
Abstract = {{We perform Brownian dynamics simulations to study the gelation of
   suspensions of attractive, rod-like particles. We show that in detail
   the rod-rod surface interactions can dramatically affect the dynamics of
   gelation and the structure and mechanics of the networks that form. If
   the attraction between the rods is perfectly smooth along their length,
   they will collapse into compact bundles. If the attraction is
   sufficiently corrugated or patchy, over time, a rigid space-spanning
   network will form. We study the structure and mechanical properties of
   the networks that form as a function of the fraction of the surface, f,
   that is allowed to bind. Surprisingly, the structural and mechanical
   properties are non-monotonic in f. At low f, there are not a sufficient
   number of cross-linking sites to form networks. At high f, rods bundle
   and form disconnected clusters. At intermediate f, robust networks form.
   The elastic modulus and yield stress are both non-monotonic in the
   surface coverage. The stiffest and strongest networks show an
   essentially homogeneous deformation under strain with rods re-orienting
   along the extensional axis. Weaker, more clumpy networks at high f
   re-orient relatively little with strong non-affine deformation. These
   results suggest design strategies for tailoring surface interactions
   between rods to yield rigid networks with optimal mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration and chemical composition of non-refractory fine
   particulate matter (NR-PM1) and black carbon (BC) levels were measured
   during the summer of 2012 in the suburbs of two Greek cities, Patras and
   Athens, in an effort to better understand the chemical processing of
   particles in the high photochemical activity environment of the eastern
   Mediterranean. The composition of PM1 was surprisingly similar in both
   areas, demonstrating the importance of regional sources for the
   corresponding pollution levels. The PM1 average mass concentration was
   9-14 mu g m(-3). The contribution of sulfate was around 38 \%, while
   organic aerosol (OA) contributed approximately 45\% in both cases. PM1
   nitrate levels were low (2 \%). The oxygen to carbon (O : C) atomic
   ratio was 0.50 +/- 0.08 in Patras and 0.47 +/- 0.11 in Athens. In both
   cases PM1 was acidic.
   Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the high-resolution
   organic aerosol mass spectra obtained by an Aerodyne High-Resolution
   Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). For Patras, five
   OA sources could be identified: 19\% very oxygenated OA (V-OOA), 38\%
   moderately oxygenated OA (M-OOA), 21\% biogenic oxygenated OA (b-OOA),
   7\% hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA-1) associated with traffic sources and 15\%
   hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA-2) related to other primary emissions
   (including cooking OA). For Athens, the corresponding source
   contributions were: V-OOA (35 \%), M-OOA (30 \%), HOA-1 (18 \%) and
   HOA-2 (17 \%). In both cities the major component was OOA, suggesting
   that under high photochemical conditions most of the OA in the eastern
   Mediterranean is quite aged. The contribution of the primary sources
   (HOA-1 and HOA-2) was important (22\% in Patras and 35\% in Athens) but
   not dominant.}},

Title = {{Many-objective robust decision making for managing an ecosystem with a
   deeply uncertain threshold response}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Managing ecosystems with deeply uncertain threshold responses and
   multiple decision makers poses nontrivial decision analytical
   challenges. The problem is imbued with deep uncertainties because
   decision makers do not know or cannot converge on a single probability
   density function for each key parameter, a perfect model structure, or a
   single adequate objective. The existing literature on managing
   multistate ecosystems has generally followed a normative decision-making
   approach based on expected utility maximization (MEU). This approach has
   simple and intuitive axiomatic foundations, but faces at least two
   limitations. First, a prespecified utility function is often unable to
   capture the preferences of diverse decision makers. Second, decision
   makers' preferences depart from MEU in the presence of deep uncertainty.
   Here, we introduce a framework that allows decision makers to pose
   multiple objectives, explore the trade-offs between potentially
   conflicting preferences of diverse decision makers, and to identify
   strategies that are robust to deep uncertainties. The framework,
   referred to as many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), employs
   multiobjective evolutionary search to identify trade-offs between
   strategies, re-evaluates their performance under deep uncertainty, and
   uses interactive visual analytics to support the selection of robust
   management strategies. We demonstrate MORDM on a stylized decision
   problem posed by the management of a lake in which surpassing a
   pollution threshold causes eutrophication. Our results illustrate how
   framing the lake problem in terms of MEU can fail to represent key
   trade-offs between phosphorus levels in the lake and expected economic
   benefits. Moreover, the MEU strategy deteriorates severely in
   performance for all objectives under deep uncertainties. Alternatively,
   the MORDM framework enables the discovery of strategies that balance
   multiple preferences and perform well under deep uncertainty. This
   decision analytic framework allows the decision makers to select
   strategies with a better understanding of their expected trade-offs
   (traditional uncertainty) as well as their robustness (deep
   uncertainty).}},

Title = {{Spontaneous helical structure formation in laminin nanofibers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{7993-8000}},
Abstract = {{Laminin is a cross-shaped heterotrimer composed of three polypeptides
   chains that assembles into an insoluble extracellular matrix (ECM)
   network as part of the basement membrane, serving a vital role in many
   processes such as embryonic development, differentiation, and muscle and
   nerve regeneration. Here we engineered monodisperse laminin nanofibers
   using a surface-initiated assembly technique in order to investigate how
   changes in protein composition affect formation and structure of the
   network. Specifically, we compared laminin 111 with varying degrees of
   purity and with and without entactin to determine whether these changes
   alter biophysical properties. All the laminin types were reproducibly
   patterned as 200 mm long, 20 mm wide nanofibers that were successfuly
   released during surface-initiated assembly into solution. All nanofibers
   contracted upon release, and while initial lengths were identical,
   lengths of released fibers depended on the laminin type. Uniquely, the
   laminin 111 at high purity (>95\%) and without entactin spontaneously
   formed helical nanofibers at greater than 90\%. Atomic force microscopy
   revealed that the nanofiber contraction was associated with a change in
   nanostructure from fibrillar to nodular, suggestive of refolding of
   laminin molecules into a globular-like conformation. Further, for the
   high purity laminin that formed helices, the density of the laminin at
   the edges of the nanofiber was higher than in the middle, providing a
   possible origin for the differential pre-stress driving the helix
   formation. Together, these results show that variation in the purity of
   laminin 111 and presence of entactin can have significant impact on the
   biophysical properties of the assembled protein networks. This
   highlights the fact that our understanding of protein assembly and
   function is still incomplete and that cell-free, in vitro assays can
   provide unique insights into the ECM.}},

Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2008-2017}},
Abstract = {{The chemical and morphological features of oxides, at or near a steel
   surface, greatly influence the formation of the inhibition layer,
   critical for controlling the quality of the coating during immersion
   into the Zn bath. The oxides influence the wettability and the final
   composition of the Fe-Zn alloy coating. In this study, oxidation
   behaviors of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) are studied during
   annealing in a H-2-5\%N-2 atmosphere with controlled dew-points (0 to
   -40 degrees C) and gas flow rates (5 to 100 l/min.). Compact external
   oxides, with a high SiO2, Al2O3 ratio, were found to form on the steel
   surface when the dew point was low and/or the gas-flow rates high. As
   dew points were increased and gas-flow rates decreased the surface
   oxides became less continuous and the presence of internal oxides became
   substantial. The influence of gas-flow rate cannot be attributed solely
   to the gas phase transport of oxidants to the metal surface and it is
   suggested that the equilibration state of the gas and consequent amount
   of molecular oxygen present near the surface needs to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{An active learning method for identifying drug-target interactions is
   presented which considers the interaction between multiple drugs and
   multiple targets at the same time. The goal of the proposed method is
   not simply to predict such interactions from experiments that have
   already been conducted, but to iteratively choose as few new experiments
   as possible to improve the accuracy of the predictive model. Kernelized
   Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF) is used to model the interactions.
   We demonstrate on four previously characterized drug effect data sets
   that active learning driven experimentation using KBMF can result in
   highly accurate models while performing as few as 14\% of the possible
   experiments, and more accurately than random sampling of an equivalent
   number. We also provide a method for estimating the accuracy of the
   current model based on the learning curve; and show how it can be used
   in practice to decide when to stop an active learning process.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial multiplexing cameras (SMCs) acquire a (typically static) scene
   through a series of coded projections using a spatial light modulator
   (e.g., a digital micromirror device) and a few optical sensors. This
   approach finds use in imaging applications where full-frame sensors are
   either too expensive (e.g., for short-wave infrared wavelengths) or
   unavailable. Existing SMC systems reconstruct static scenes using
   techniques from compressive sensing (CS). For videos, however, existing
   acquisition and recovery methods deliver poor quality. In this paper, we
   propose the CS multiscale video (CS-MUVI) sensing and recovery framework
   for high-quality video acquisition and recovery using SMCs. Our
   framework features novel sensing matrices that enable the efficient
   computation of a low-resolution video preview, while enabling
   high-resolution video recovery using convex optimization. To further
   improve the quality of the reconstructed videos, we extract optical-flow
   estimates from the low-resolution previews and impose them as
   constraints in the recovery procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of
   our CS-MUVI framework for a host of synthetic and real measured SMC
   video data, and we show that high-quality videos can be recovered at
   roughly 60x compression.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient particle number size distributions were measured in Paris,
   France, during summer (1-31 July 2009) and winter (15 January to 15
   February 2010) at three fixed ground sites and using two mobile
   laboratories and one airplane. The campaigns were part of the
   Megacities: Emissions, urban, regional and Global Atmospheric POLlution
   and climate effects, and Integrated tools for assessment and mitigation
   (MEGAPOLI) project. New particle formation (NPF) was observed only
   during summer on approximately 50\% of the campaign days, assisted by
   the low condensation sink (about 10.7 +/- 5.9 x 10(-3) s(-1)). NPF
   events inside the Paris plume were also observed at 600m altitude
   onboard an aircraft simultaneously with regional events identified on
   the ground. Increased particle number concentrations were measured aloft
   also outside of the Paris plume at the same altitude, and were
   attributed to NPF. The Paris plume was identified, based on increased
   particle number and black carbon concentration, up to 200 km away from
   the Paris center during summer. The number concentration of particles
   with diameters exceeding 2.5 nm measured on the surface at the Paris
   center was on average 6.9 +/- 8.7 x 10(4) and 12.1 +/- 8.6 x 10(4)
   cm(-3) during summer and winter, respectively, and was found to decrease
   exponentially with distance from Paris. However, further than 30 km from
   the city center, the particle number concentration at the surface was
   similar during both campaigns. During summer, one suburban site in the
   NE was not significantly affected by Paris emissions due to higher
   background number concentrations, while the particle number
   concentration at the second suburban site in the SW increased by a
   factor of 3 when it was downwind of Paris.}},

Abstract = {{A Security Pattern encapsulates security design expertise that addresses
   recurring information security problems in the form of a credentialed
   solution. It also presents potential problems and trade-offs in its
   application. This paper proposes a novel classification model for
   security patterns. Based on our review of more than one hundred security
   patterns, we categorize security patterns according to the type of
   vulnerability they address and also identify similar or identical
   patterns with different names. Our literature review indicates that
   there exists very little research on the categorization of security
   patterns based on vulnerabilities. Any attackers need to exploit
   existing vulnerabilities to break the security of an information system.
   To solve security problems effectively, we have to fix their root
   causes, which are vulnerabilities. The primary contribution of this
   paper is twofold: (1) to propose a novel security pattern classification
   model that helps software designers choose an appropriate security
   pattern once they know the type of a vulnerability they would like to
   remove and (2) to identify missing security patterns, which naturally
   emerge as a result of classifying security patterns according to the
   vulnerabilities they address. The identification of missing patterns
   could be useful in soliciting help to develop more patterns from the
   security community to tackle the vulnerabilities currently not handled
   by the existing patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Since it first appeared in iPhone 5S in 2013, fingerprint identification
   (ID) has rapidly gained popularity among consumers. Current
   fingerprint-enabled smartphones unanimously consists of a discrete
   sensor to perform fingerprint ID. This architecture not only incurs
   higher material and manufacturing cost, but also provides only static
   identification and limited authentication. Hence as the demand for a
   thinner, lighter, and more secure handset grows, we propose a novel
   pixel architecture that is a photosensitive device embedded in a display
   pixel and detects the reflected light from the finger touch for high
   resolution, high fidelity and dynamic biometrics. To this purpose, an
   amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) dual-gate photo TFT working in both
   fingerprint-imaging mode and display-driving mode will be developed.}},

Title = {{Feature Extraction in Densely Sensed Environments: Extensions to
   Multiple Broadcast Domains}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) includes large and dense
   deployment of interconnected smart sensing and monitoring devices. This
   vast deployment necessitates collection and processing of large volume
   of measurement data. However, collecting all the measured data from
   individual devices on such a scale may be impractical and
   time-consuming. Moreover, processing these measurements requires complex
   algorithms to extract useful information. Thus, it becomes imperative to
   devise distributed information processing mechanisms that identify
   application-specific features in a timely manner and with low overhead.
   In this paper, we present a feature extraction mechanism for dense
   networks that takes advantage of dominance-based medium access control
   (MAC) protocols to (i) efficiently obtain global extrema of the sensed
   quantities, (ii) extract local extrema, and (iii) detect the boundaries
   of events, by using simple transforms that nodes employ on their local
   data. We extend our results for a large dense network with multiple
   broadcast domains (MBD). We discuss and compare two approaches for
   addressing the challenges with MBD and we show through extensive
   evaluations that our proposed distributed MBD approach is fast and
   efficient at retrieving the most valuable measurements, independent of
   the number sensor nodes in the network.}},

   Addition to Liquid Fe}},

Pages = {{1661-1668}},
Abstract = {{The alloy/liquid Fe interaction behaviour at early stages of
   deoxidation/alloying have considerable influence on the mechanical
   properties of steel products. The interfacial reaction between FeMnSi
   and liquid Fe, as well as the inclusion formation, were experimentally
   studied at the addition early stages based on quenched FeMnSi-Fe
   diffusion couples. The microstructure and composition of the quenched
   diffusion couple were evaluated and the inclusions in the reaction zone
   were characterised. Five regions were distinguished in the quenched
   reaction zone, i.e. (1) a solidified Fe shell, (2) a alpha 1 phase
   consisting of a solid alpha 1 phase and a Fe-Mn-Si liquid melt at the
   experimental temperature, (3) eutectic alpha 1+Fe5Si3 and (4) eutectic
   Mn5Si3+MnSi phases, which are liquid at the experimental temperature and
   (5) the original FeMnSi alloy which did not melt during the interaction.
   Plenty of oxysulphide inclusions are observed in the reaction zone:
   Fe(O,S) inclusions formed in the bulk iron and an inclusion poor zone is
   observed in the inner part of the Fe shell. Large amounts of tiny
   (Mn,Si)O inclusions formed in the alpha 1 phase near the Fe/alpha 1
   interface and large (Mn,Si)(O,S) inclusions precipitated in the liquid
   phase after solidification.}},

   leads to an attenuated nuclear response to force}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{6412-6418}},
Abstract = {{Progerin is a mutant form of the nucleoskeletal protein lamin A, and its
   expression results in the rare premature aging disorder
   Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Patients with HGPS
   demonstrate several characteristic signs of aging including
   cardiovascular and skeletal dysfunction. Cells from HGPS patients show
   several nuclear abnormalities including aberrant morphology, nuclear
   stiffening and loss of epigenetic modifications including
   heterochromatin territories. However, it is unclear why these changes
   disproportionately impact mechanically-responsive tissues. Using
   micropipette aspiration, we show that nuclei in progerin-expressing
   cells are stiffer than control cells. Conversely, our particle tracking
   reveals the nuclear interior becomes more compliant in cells from HGPS
   patients or with progerin expression, as consistent with decreased
   chromatin condensation as shown previously. Additionally, we find the
   nuclear interior is less responsive to external mechanical force from
   shear or compression likely resulting from damped force propagation due
   to nucleoskeletal stiffening. Collectively our findings suggest that
   force is similarly transduced into the nuclear interior in normal cells.
   In HGPS cells a combination of a stiffened nucleoskeleton and softened
   nuclear interior leads to mechanical irregularities and dysfunction of
   mechanoresponsive tissues in HGPS patients.}},

Abstract = {{The field of materials science and engineering is on the cusp of a
   digital data revolution. After reviewing the nature of data science and
   Big Data, we discuss the features of materials data that distinguish
   them from data in other fields. We introduce the concept of

   determination of PSPs is one of the main objectives of materials data
   science. Then we review a selection of materials databases, as well as
   important aspects of materials data management, such as storage
   hardware, archiving strategies, and data access strategies. We introduce
   the emerging field of materials data analytics, which focuses on
   data-driven approaches to extract and curate materials knowledge from
   available data sets. The critical need for materials e-collaboration
   platforms is highlighted, and we conclude the article with a number of
   suggestions regarding the near-term future of the materials data science

Title = {{3D bio-etching of a complex composite-like embryonic tissue}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3293-3299}},
Abstract = {{Morphogenesis involves a complex series of cell signaling, migration and
   differentiation events that are coordinated as tissues self-assemble
   during embryonic development. Collective cell movements such as those
   that occur during morphogenesis have typically been studied in 2D with
   single layers of cultured cells adhering to rigid substrates such as
   glass or plastic. In vivo, the intricacies of the 3D microenvironment
   and complex 3D responses are pivotal in the formation of functional
   tissues. To study such processes as collective cell movements within 3D
   multilayered tissues, we developed a microfluidic technique capable of
   producing complex 3D laminar multicellular structures. We call this
   technique ``3D tissue-etching{''} because it is analogous to techniques
   used in the microelectromechanics (MEMS) field where complex 3D
   structures are built by successively removing material from a monolithic
   solid through subtractive manufacturing. We use a custom-designed
   microfluidic control system to deliver a range of tissue etching
   reagents (detergents, chelators, proteases, etc.) to specific regions of
   multilayered tissues. These tissues were previously isolated by
   microsurgical excision from embryos of the African claw-toed frog,
   Xenopus laevis. The ability to shape the 3D form of multicellular
   tissues and to control 3D stimulation will have a high impact on tissue
   engineering and regeneration applications in bioengineering and medicine
   as well as provide significant improvements in the synthesis of highly
   complex 3D integrated multicellular biosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight porous ceramic materials that can recover their shapes after
   mechanical deformation have numerous applications. However, these types
   of materials tend to be highly fragile and often crack when compressed.
   Here, we report on the fabrication and characterization of highly
   porous, freestanding composites of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of density 13-15 mg mL(-1),
   which corresponds to a volume fraction of 0.009, that were mechanically
   robust and recovered their original shape even after uniaxially
   compressing them by more than 50\%. We made these porous elastomeric
   composites using a solution based assembly process that involved first
   shaping SWCNTs into porous networks of density similar to 7 mg mL(-1)
   (volume fraction similar to 0.005) followed by coatings of SWCNT
   networks with 6-8 mg mL(-1) of h-BN (volume fraction similar to
   0.003-0.004). The h-BN coating strengthened the underlying SWCNT
   networks, likely via reinforcement of the nodes between the SWCNTs,
   resulting in an increase in Young's modulus by similar to 100\% compared
   to that of SWCNT networks alone. Surprisingly, SWCNT networks, which
   were initially highly fragile, became elastomeric after h-BN coating,
   even though porous structures solely from h-BN are very brittle. Our
   fabrication approach preserves the morphology of the underlying
   networks, allowing for fabrication of various shapes and sizes of porous
   composites of h-BN and SWCNTs. Finally, our fabrication scheme is robust
   and facile for the preparation of porous composites of diverse ceramic
   materials and SWCNTs using the appropriate ceramic-precursor.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Strategies for cell-specific targeting and delivery of carbon nanotubes
   have made significant advancements over recent years. However, control
   of sub-cellular localization, an important criterion for many biomedical
   applications, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
   experimentally demonstrate how different molecules that are used to
   non-covalently suspend hydrophobic SWCNTs in aqueous conditions also
   influence cellular processing and localization. We utilized
   complementary imaging modalities to show that SWCNTs dispersed using the
   membrane active tri-block copolymer Pluronic (R) F-127 (PF127) were
   endocytosed into cells by the millions but eventually escaped endosomes
   and altered F-actin structures. In contrast, SWCNTs dispersed with the
   protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) were endocytosed into cells at
   similarly high levels but remained in the endosomal pathway, ultimately
   co-registering with endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles. Interestingly,
   cellular exposure to SWCNTs-BSA in the presence of the endosome
   disrupter, chloroquine, led to altered F-actin structures that were
   similar to the alterations induced by cellular exposure to SWCNTs-PF127.
   These results suggest that PF127 facilitated endosome escape and that
   SWCNTs might have an energetically favorable interaction with stiff,
   filamentous structures inside the cell. Thus, our results provide a
   design principle for non-covalent surface modifications of SWCNTs that
   do not degrade the desirable, intrinsic SWCNT properties but provide
   differential trafficking to intracellular compartments for sub-cellular
   biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Since its emergence a decade ago, amorphous silicon flat panel X-ray
   detector has established itself as a ubiquitous platform for an array of
   digital radiography modalities. The fundamental building block of a flat
   panel detector is called a pixel. In all current pixel architectures,
   sensing, storage, and readout are unanimously kept separate, inevitably
   compromising resolution by increasing pixel size. To address this issue,
   we hereby propose a ``smart{''} pixel architecture where the
   aforementioned three components are combined in a single dual-gate photo
   thin-film transistor (TFT). In other words, the dual-gate photo TFT
   itself functions as a sensor, a storage capacitor, and a switch
   concurrently. Additionally, by harnessing the amplification effect of
   such a thin-film transistor, we for the first time created a
   single-transistor active pixel sensor. The proof-of-concept device had a
   W/L ratio of 250 mu m/20 mu m and was fabricated using a simple
   five-mask photolithography process, where a 130nm transparent ITO was
   used as the top photo gate, and a 200nm amorphous silicon as the
   absorbing channel layer. The preliminary results demonstrated that the
   photocurrent had been increased by four orders of magnitude due to
   light-induced threshold voltage shift in the subthreshold region. The
   device sensitivity could be simply tuned by photo gate bias to
   specifically target low-level light detection. The dependence of
   threshold voltage on light illumination indicated that a dynamic range
   of at least 80dB could be achieved. The ``smart{''} pixel technology
   holds tremendous promise for developing high-resolution and low-dose
   X-ray imaging and may potentially lower the cancer risk imposed by
   radiation, especially among paediatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{Although adolescents are at disproportionate risk for sexually
   transmitted infections, most sex education programs have shown little
   effect on sexual behavior. An interactive video intervention developed
   by our team has been identified as one of a few programs that have been
   documented to reduce sexually transmitted infections in this population.
   Building on behavioral decision research, we used a mental models
   approach to interview young women about their sexual decisions, finding,
   among other things, the strong role of perceived social norms. We based
   our intervention on these results, aiming to help young women identify
   and implement personally and socially acceptable decision strategies. A
   randomized controlled trial found that the video reduced risky sexual
   behavior and the acquisition of chlamydia infection. We recently revised
   the video to suit more diverse audiences, and upgraded it to modern
   standards of cinematography and interactivity. It is now in field trial.}},

   National Energy Technology Laboratory is to develop a suite of sensors
   and controls technologies that will ultimately increase efficiencies of
   existing fossil-fuel fired power plants and enable a new generation of

   program seeks to accomplish this mission through soliciting, managing,
   and monitoring a broad range of projects both internal and external to
   the laboratory which span sensor material and device development, energy
   harvesting and wireless telemetry methodologies, and advanced controls
   algorithms and approaches. A particular emphasis is placed upon harsh
   environment sensing for compatibility with high temperature, erosive,
   corrosive, and highly reducing or oxidizing environments associated with
   large-scale centralized power generation. An overview of the full
   sensors and controls portfolio is presented and a selected set of
   current and recent research successes and on-going projects are
   highlighted. A more detailed emphasis will be placed on an overview of
   the current research thrusts and successes of the in-house sensor

Abstract = {{Utilizing an aircraft-specific parameterization based on smog chamber
   data in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with the
   volatility basis set (VBS), we estimated contributions of
   non-traditional secondary organic aerosols (NTSOA) for aircraft
   emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO) activities at the
   Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. NTSOA, formed from the
   oxidation of semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds
   (S/IVOCs), is a heretofore unaccounted component of fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) in most air quality models. We expanded a prerelease
   version of CMAQ with VBS implemented for the Carbon Bond 2005 (CB05)
   chemical mechanism to use the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center
   2007 (SAPRC-07) chemical mechanism and added species representing
   aircraft S/IVOCs and corresponding NTSOA oxidation products. Results
   indicated that the maximum monthly average NTSOA contributions occurred
   at the airport and ranged from 2.4 ng m(-3) (34 \% from idle and 66 \%
   from non-idle aircraft activities) in January to 9.1 ng m(-3) (33 and 67
   \%) in July. This represents 1.7 \% (of 140 ng m(-3)) in January and 7.4
   \% in July (of 122 ng m(-3)) of aircraft-attributable PM2.5 compared to
   41.0-42.0 \% from elemental carbon and 42.8-58.0 \% from inorganic
   aerosols. As a percentage of PM2.5, impacts were higher downwind of the
   airport, where NTSOA averaged 4.6-17.9 \% of aircraft-attributable PM2.5
   and, considering alternative aging schemes, was as high as 24.0 \% -
   thus indicating the increased contribution of aircraft-attributable SOA
   as a component of PM2.5. However, NTSOA contributions were generally low
   compared to smog chamber results, particularly at idle, due to the
   considerably lower ambient organic aerosol concentrations in CMAQ
   compared to those in the smog chamber experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-security refers to all approaches to protect cyberspace against
   cyber-attacks. In order to identify vulnerabilities and develop
   countermeasures against cyber-attacks, we should be able to reenact both
   cyber-attacks and defenses. Simulations can be useful for the
   reenactment by overcoming its limitations including high risk and cost.
   However, it is difficult to model a variety cyber-attacks making use of
   pre-developed simulation models, because there is a lack of theoretical
   basis for modeling cyber-security simulations. In addition, because most
   simulation models are developed according to their own simulation
   purposes, it is very difficult to use them as primitives for modeling of
   new behaviors of cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a method for
   defining behavior primitives for developing flexible attack scenarios by
   combining the primitives considering flows of cyber-attacks and
   defenses. We also develop the scenario as simulation models and the
   models can be executed on the discrete event simulation system. To
   elicit a new scenario all modeler need to do is to choose primitives
   from pools and combine them considering simulation purposes and security
   issues. To extract the possible primitive behaviors, we have analyzed
   and abstracted all attack patterns of CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern
   Enumeration and Classification) database.}},

Title = {{A dual-mode rechargeable lithium-bromine/oxygen fuel cell}},

Pages = {{14165-14172}},
Abstract = {{In order to meet the versatile power requirements of autonomous
   underwater vehicles (AUV), we propose a rechargeable
   lithium-bromine/seawater fuel cell with a protected lithium metal anode
   to provide high specific energy at either low-power mode with seawater
   (oxygen) or high-power mode with bromine catholytes. The
   proof-of-concept fuel cell with a flat catalyst-free graphite electrode
   can discharge at 3 mW cm(-2) with seawater, and 9 mW cm(-2) with dilute
   bromine catholytes. The fuel cell can also be recharged with LiBr
   catholytes efficiently to recover the lithium metal anode. Scanning
   electron microscopy images reveal that both the organic electrolyte and
   the bromine electrolyte corrode the solid electrolyte plate quickly,
   leading to nanoporous pathways that can percolate through the plate,
   thus limiting the cell performance and lifetime. With improved solid
   electrolytes or membraneless flow designs, the dual-mode
   lithium-bromine/oxygen system could enable not only AUV but also
   land-based electric vehicles, by providing a critical high-power mode to
   high-energy-density (but otherwise low-power) lithium-air batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Robust pH sensors that can operate under harsh environmental conditions
   are valuable for a variety of applications, such as oil and gas
   production, geological CO2 sequestration, etc. However, despite the
   significant advance in pH measurement technology, reliable pH sensing at
   elevated pressures (up to 30,000 psi) and high temperatures (up to 350
   degrees C) remains challenging. We describe an optical pH sensor based
   on optical fiber technology. A sensing layer that is comprised of metal
   nanoparticles incorporated in a silica matrix coated on an optical fiber
   exhibits strong and reversible optical response to pH variation at 80
   degrees C and in solutions with different salt concentrations. The same
   robust response is also observed at elevated pressures up to 2,000 psi.
   The optical fiber pH sensor is made of materials with high stability at
   temperatures at least up to similar to 600 degrees C. Therefore, this
   approach provides a new potential means to enable optical pH sensing for
   extreme environment applications.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{6035-6046}},
Abstract = {{The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production during the oxidation of
   beta-caryophyllene by ozone (O-3) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) and the
   subsequent chemical aging of the products during reactions with OH were
   investigated. Experiments were conducted with ozone and with hydroxyl
   radicals at low NOx (zero added NOx) and at high NOx (hundreds of parts
   per billion). The SOA mass yield at 10 mu g m(-3) of organic aerosol was
   27\% for the ozonolysis, 20\% for the reaction with OH at low NOx, and
   38\% at high NOx under dry conditions, 20 degrees C, and ozone excess.
   Parameterizations of the fresh SOA yields have been developed. The
   average fresh SOA atomic O:C ratio varied from 0.24 to 0.34 depending on
   the oxidant and the NOx level, while the H:C ratio was close to 1.5 for
   all systems examined. An average density of 1.06 +/- 0.1 mu gm(-3) of
   the beta-caryophyllene SOA was estimated. The exposure to UV light had
   no effect on the beta-caryophyllene SOA concentration and aerosol mass
   spectrometer (AMS) measurements. The chemical aging of the
   beta-caryophyllene SOA produced was studied by exposing the fresh SOA to
   high concentrations (10(7) molecules cm(3)) of OH for several hours.
   These additional reactions increased the SOA concentration by 15-40\%
   and O:C by approximately 25 \%. A limited number of experiments
   suggested that there was a significant impact of the relative humidity
   on the chemical aging of the SOA. The evaporation rates of
   beta-caryophyllene SOA were quantified by using a thermodenuder allowing
   us to estimate the corresponding volatility distributions and effective
   vaporization enthalpies.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6337-6350}},
Abstract = {{A new aerosol dynamics model (DMANx) has been developed that simulates
   aerosol size/composition distribution and includes the condensation of
   organic vapors on nanoparticles through the implementation of the
   recently developed volatility basis set framework. Simulations were
   performed for Hyytiala (Finland) and Finokalia (Greece), two locations
   with different organic sources where detailed measurements were
   available to constrain the new model. We investigate the effect of
   condensation of organics and chemical aging reactions of secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA) precursors on ultrafine particle growth and
   particle number concentration during a typical springtime nucleation
   event in both locations. This work highlights the importance of the
   pathways of oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds and the
   production of extremely low volatility organics. At Hyytiala, organic
   condensation dominates the growth process of new particles. The
   low-volatility SOA contributes to particle growth during the early
   growth stage, but after a few hours most of the growth is due to
   semi-volatile SOA. At Finokalia, simulations show that organics have a
   complementary role in new particle growth, contributing 45\% to the
   total mass of new particles. Condensation of organics increases the
   number concentration of particles that can act as CCN (cloud
   condensation nuclei) (N-100) by 13\% at Finokalia and 25\% at Hyytiala
   during a typical spring day with nucleation. The sensitivity of our
   results to the surface tension used is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple ultrasonic guided-wave modes propagating along a pipe travel
   with different velocities which are themselves a function of frequency.
   Reflections from the features of the structure (e. g., boundaries, pipe
   welding, damage, etc.), and their complex superposition, adds to the
   complexity of guided-waves. Guided-wave based damage diagnosis of
   pipelines becomes even more challenging when environmental and
   operational conditions (EOCs) vary (e. g., temperature, flow rate, inner
   pressure, etc.). These complexities make guided-wave based damage
   diagnosis of operating pipelines a challenging task. This paper reviews
   the approaches to-date addressing these challenges, and highlights the
   preferred characteristics of a method that simplifies guided-wave
   signals for damage diagnosis purposes. A method is proposed to extract a
   sparse subset of guided-wave signals in time-domain, while retaining
   optimal damage information for detection purpose. In this paper, the
   general concept of this method is proved through an extensive set of
   experiments. Effects of temperature variation on detection performnce of
   the proposed method, and on discriminatory power of the extracted
   damage-sensitive features are investigated. The potential of the
   proposed method for real-time damage detection is illustrated, for wide
   range of temperature variation scenarios (i. e., temperature difference
   between training and test data varying between -2 degrees C and 13
   degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided-waves propagating in pipes with varying environmental
   and operational conditions (EOCs) are usually the results of complex
   superposition of multiple modes travelling in multiple paths. Among all
   of the components forming a complex guided-wave signal, the arrivals
   scattered by damage (so called scatter signal) are of importance for
   damage diagnosis purposes. This paper evaluates the potentials of
   nonlinear decomposition methods for extracting the scatter signal from a
   multi-modal signal recorded from a pipe under varying temperatures.
   Current approaches for extracting scatter signal can be categorized as
   (A) baseline subtraction methods, and (B) linear decomposition methods.
   In this paper, we first illustrate, experimentally, the challenges for
   applying these methods on multi-modal signals at varying temperatures.
   To better analyze the experimental results, the effects of temperature
   on multi-modal signals are simulated. The simulation results show that
   different wave modes may have significantly different sensitivities to
   temperature variations. This brings about challenges such as shape
   distortion and nonlinear relations between the signals recorded at
   different temperatures, which prevent the aforementioned methods to be
   extensible to wide range of temperatures. In this paper, we examine the
   potential of a nonlinear decomposition method, namely nonlinear
   principal component analysis (NLPCA), for removing the nonlinear
   relation between the components of a multi-modal guided-wave signal, and
   thus, extracting the scatter signal. Ultrasonic pitch-catch measurements
   from an aluminum pipe segment in a thermally controlled laboratory are
   used to evaluate the detection performance of the damage-sensitive
   features extracted by the proposed approach. It is observed that NLPCA
   can successfully remove nonlinear relations between the signal bases,
   hence extract scatter signal, for temperature variations up to 10
   degrees C with detection accuracies above 99\%.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of their many advantages, real-world application of
   guided-waves for structural health monitoring (SHM) of pipelines is
   still quite limited. The challenges can be discussed under three
   headings: (1) Multiple modes, (2) Multi-path reflections, and (3)
   Sensitivity to environmental and operational conditions (EOCs). These
   challenges are reviewed in the authors' previous work. This paper is
   part of a study whose objective is to overcome these challenges for
   damage diagnosis of pipes, while addressing the limitations of the
   current approaches. That is, develop methods that simplify signal while
   retaining damage information, and perform well as EOCs vary. In this
   paper, a supervised method is proposed to extract a sparse subset of the
   ultrasonic guided-wave signals that contain optimal damage information
   for detection purposes. That is, a discriminant vector is calculated so
   that the projections of undamaged and damaged pipes on this vector is
   separated. In the training stage, data is recorded from intact pipe, and
   from a pipe with an artificial structural abnormality (to simulate any
   variation from intact condition). During the monitoring stage, test
   signals are projected on the discriminant vector, and these projections
   are used as damage-sensitive features for detection purposes. Being a
   supervised method, factors such as EOC variations, and difference in the
   characteristics of the structural abnormality in training and test data,
   may affect the detection performance. This paper reports the experiments
   investigating the extent to which the differences in damage size and
   damage location, as well as temperatures, can influence the
   discriminatory power of the extracted damage-sensitive features. The
   results suggest that, for practical ranges of monitoring and damage
   sizes of interest, the proposed method has low sensitivity to such
   training factors. High detection performances are obtained for
   temperature differences up to 14.. The findings reported in this paper
   suggest that although the proposed method is a supervised approach,
   labeling of the training data does not require prior knowledge about the
   damage characteristics (e.g., size, location). Moreover, the potential
   of the proposed method for online monitoring is illustrated, for wide
   range of temperature variations and different damage scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Genipin is a naturally derived small molecule that crosslinks compounds
   containing primary amines including many natural biopolymers. A
   diffusion-reaction model to predict the rates of delivery and
   incorporation of genipin into fibrin networks is presented. Genipin
   crosslink formation within fibrin hydrogels is a multi-step process that
   requires genipin diffusion and reaction with primary amines in hydrated
   networks. The reaction rate of genipin into fibrin gels was measured via
   spectroscopy while the rate of marginal crosslink formation was measured
   by rheology. Covalent coupling between genipin and primary amines in
   fibrin gels obeys second-order kinetics in genipin concentration with an
   effective activation energy of -71.9 +/- 3.2 kJ mol(-1). Genipin
   diffusion-reaction within fibrin gels exhibits Thiele moduli between
   0.02-0.28, which suggests that the systems studied herein are
   reaction-limited. Genipin-crosslinked fibrin clots are resistant to
   fibrinolytic degradation as measured by rheology. Finally, active
   genipin can be delivered from poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) matrices to
   gels at rates that are comparable to the characteristic rate of
   incorporation in fibrin networks. Taken together, this work establishes
   a quantitative framework to engineer controlled release systems for
   genipin delivery into protein-based hydrogel networks.}},

Abstract = {{While the objective of structural design is to achieve stability with an
   appropriate level of reliability, the design of systems for structural
   health monitoring is performed to identify a configuration that enables
   acquisition of data with an appropriate level of accuracy in order to
   understand the performance of a structure or its condition state.
   However, a rational standardized approach for monitoring system design
   is not fully available. Hence, when engineers design a monitoring
   system, their approach is often heuristic with performance evaluation
   based on experience, rather than on quantitative analysis. In this
   contribution, we propose a probabilistic model for the estimation of
   monitoring system effectiveness based on information available in prior
   condition, i.e. before acquiring empirical data. The presented model is
   developed considering the analogy between structural design and
   monitoring system design. We assume that the effectiveness can be
   evaluated based on the prediction of the posterior variance or
   covariance matrix of the state parameters, which we assume to be defined
   in a continuous space. Since the empirical measurements are not
   available in prior condition, the estimation of the posterior variance
   or covariance matrix is performed considering the measurements as a
   stochastic variable. Moreover, the model takes into account the effects
   of nuisance parameters, which are stochastic parameters that affect the
   observations but cannot be estimated using monitoring data. Finally, we
   present an application of the proposed model to a real structure. The
   results show how the model enables engineers to predict whether a sensor
   configuration satisfies the required performance.}},

Abstract = {{The pulse-echo method is widely used for plate and pipe thickness
   measurement. However, the pulse echo method does not work well for
   detecting localized volumetric loss in thick-wall tubes, as created by
   erosion damage, when the morphology of volumetric loss is irregular and
   can reflect ultrasonic pulses away from the transducer, making it
   difficult to detect an echo. In this paper, we propose a novel method
   using an inductively coupled transducer to generate longitudinal waves
   propagating in a thick-wall aluminum tube for the volumetric loss
   quantification. In the experiment, longitudinal waves exhibit
   diffraction effects during the propagation which can be explained by the
   Huygens-Fresnel principle. The diffractive waves are also shown to be
   significantly delayed by the machined volumetric loss on the inside
   surface of the thick-wall aluminum tube. It is also shown that the
   inductively coupled transducers can generate and receive similar
   ultrasonic waves to those from wired transducers, and the inductively
   coupled transducers perform as well as the wired transducers in the
   volumetric loss quantification when other conditions are the same.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle-based monitoring has the potential to become an accurate and
   cost-efficient way to monitor infrastructure assets, but a number of
   challenges must be addressed for such a technique to be implemented
   widely. The majority of vehicle-based infrastructure sensing has assumed
   that the vehicle's speed profile is identical every time it passes over
   the asset of interest. Ultimately, however this technology will be most
   practical if damage detection schemes can be applied regardless of the
   speed of the vehicle. Thus methods must be designed to handle speed
   variability to make this method more practical. In this paper we
   investigate the effects of variable speed when monitoring infrastructure
   from the dynamic response of a passing vehicle, which we measure by
   placing accelerometers on the vehicle of interest. We have conducted a
   series of laboratory tests to study this phenomenon, in which a vehicle
   crosses over a scaled model bridge structure with a varying speed
   profile. We quantify the ability of several features to detect changes
   in the infrastructure, independent of the variable speed. We show that
   aligning signals to normalize for speed variability improves the
   classification results. This work brings us closer to the ultimate goal
   of using vehicle-based monitoring to ensure more efficient and more
   reliable infrastructure in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Lamb waves are powerful tools in nondestructive evaluation and
   structural health monitoring. Researchers use Lamb waves to detect and
   locate damage across large areas. To best utilize Lamb waves, they are
   analyzed through two processing steps: baseline subtraction and velocity
   calibration. Baseline subtraction removes background information from
   our data and velocity calibration tunes our algorithms. Yet, in many
   scenarios, these steps are challenging to implement. Baseline
   subtraction is challenging due to variable environmental conditions.
   Velocity calibration is challenging due to multimodal and dispersive
   velocity behavior in Lamb waves. To address both challenges, we present
   two approaches that combine environmental compensation with
   self-calibrating localization. We discuss temperature compensation
   strategies based on the scale transform and singular value
   decomposition. We then integrate these with a localization framework
   known as data-driven matched field processing. We show these combined
   approaches to be effective in a variety of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Increased natural gas production in recent years has spurred intense
   interest in methane (CH4) emissions associated with its production,
   gathering, processing, transmission, and distribution. Gathering and
   processing facilities (G\&P facilities) are unique in that the wide
   range of gas sources (shale, coal-bed, tight gas, conventional, etc.)
   results in a wide range of gas compositions, which in turn requires an
   array of technologies to prepare the gas for pipeline transmission and
   distribution. We present an overview and detailed description of the
   measurement method and analysis approach used during a 20-week field
   campaign studying CH4 emissions from the natural gas G\&P facilities
   between October 2013 and April 2014. Dual-tracer flux measurements and
   on-site observations were used to address the magnitude and origins of
   CH4 emissions from these facilities. The use of a second tracer as an
   internal standard revealed plume-specific uncertainties in the measured
   emission rates of 20-47 \%, depending upon plume classification.
   Combining downwind methane, ethane (C2H6), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon
   dioxide (CO2), and tracer gas measurements with on-site tracer gas
   release allows for quantification of facility emissions and in some
   cases a more detailed picture of source locations.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental context There is growing worldwide interest in the
   production of oil and gas from deep, shale formations following advances
   in the technical expertise to exploit these resources such as hydraulic
   fracturing (fracking). The potential widespread application of hydraulic
   fracturing has raised concerns over deleterious environmental impacts on
   fragile water resources. We discuss the environmental management
   challenges faced by the oil and gas industry, and the opportunities for
   innovation in the industry.
   Abstract The need for cheap and readily available energy and chemical
   feedstock, and the desire for energy independence have spurred worldwide
   interest in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources; in
   particular, the production of oil and gas from shale formations.
   Although these resources have been known for a long time, the technical
   expertise and market forces that enable economical development has
   coincided over the last 15 years. The amalgamation of horizontal
   drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enabled favourable economics for
   development of fossil energy from these unconventional reservoirs, but
   their potential widespread application has raised concerns over
   deleterious environmental impacts on fragile water resources. The
   environmental management challenges faced by the oil and gas industry
   arise from local water availability and infrastructure for treating and
   disposing of the high-strength wastewater that is produced. Although
   there are significant challenges, these create opportunities for
   innovation in the industry.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3834-3841}},
Abstract = {{This highlight describes emerging methods to pattern metals that are
   liquid at room temperature. The ability to pattern liquid metals is
   important for fabricating metallic components that are soft,
   stretchable, conformal, and in some cases, shape-reconfigurable.
   Applications include electrodes, antennas, micro-mirrors, plasmonic
   structures, sensors, switches, and interconnects. Gallium (Ga) and its
   liquid metal alloys are attractive alternatives to toxic mercury. This
   family of alloys spontaneously forms a surface oxide that dominates the
   rheological and wetting properties of the metal. These properties pose
   challenges using conventional fabrication methods, but present new
   opportunities for patterning innovations. For example, Ga-based liquid
   metals may be injected, imprinted, or 3D printed on either soft or hard
   substrates. The use of a liquid metal also enables rapid and facile room
   temperature processing. The patterning techniques organize into four
   categories: (i) patterning enabled by lithography, (ii) injection, (iii)
   subtractive techniques, and (iv) additive techniques. Although many of
   these approaches take advantage of the surface oxide that forms on Ga
   and its alloys, some of the approaches may also be suitable for
   patterning other soft-conductors (e.g., conductive inks, pastes,
   elastomeric composites).}},

Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{In aqueous electrolyte batteries, the salt concentration of the
   electrolyte affects the ionic conductivity, which will further affect
   the rate performance of the battery as well as the diffusion of reactive
   species that can cause self-discharge, particularly in thick electrode
   devices. To this end, we explored the implications of device performance
   using Na0.44MnO2 cathode material, NaTi2(PO4)(3), anode material in a
   NaClO4-based aqueous solutions with molarities as high as 5. Experiments
   included physical property characterizations, cyclic voltammetry, and
   constant current charging/discharging methods. Preliminary results
   indicate that, in cells with thick electrodes (similar to 1 mm), rate
   capability and electrode utilization increased significantly with higher
   molarity solutions: capacity at the 1.5 C rate increased 38\% by
   increasing the salt concentration from 1 M to 5 M. At the same time the
   oxygen-related self-discharge phenomenon was diminished when using
   higher electrolyte molarities, though there was still measurable loss in
   capacity in in the electrodes. Irreversible capacity loss was observed
   to occur even in electrolytes with the lowest oxygen content, suggesting
   that self discharge and capacity loss are not necessarily causally
   related. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics model has been
   integrated into the state-of-the-art general circulation model, GISS
   ModelE2. This paper provides a detailed description of the ModelE2-TOMAS
   model and evaluates the model against various observations including
   aerosol precursor gas concentrations, aerosol mass and number
   concentrations, and aerosol optical depths. Additionally, global budgets
   in ModelE2-TOMAS are compared with those of other global aerosol models,
   and the ModelE2-TOMAS model is compared to the default aerosol model in
   ModelE2, which is a one-moment aerosol (OMA) model (i.e. no aerosol
   microphysics). Overall, the ModelE2-TOMAS predictions are within the
   range of other global aerosol model predictions, and the model has a
   reasonable agreement (mostly within a factor of 2) with observations of
   sulfur species and other aerosol components as well as aerosol optical
   depth. However, ModelE2-TOMAS (as well as ModelE2-OMA) cannot capture
   the observed vertical distribution of sulfur dioxide over the Pacific
   Ocean, possibly due to overly strong convective transport and
   overpredicted precipitation. The ModelE2-TOMAS model simulates observed
   aerosol number concentrations and cloud condensation nuclei
   concentrations roughly within a factor of 2. Anthropogenic aerosol
   burdens in ModelE2-OMA differ from ModelE2-TOMAS by a few percent to a
   factor of 2 regionally, mainly due to differences in aerosol processes
   including deposition, cloud processing, and emission parameterizations.
   We observed larger differences for naturally emitted aerosols such as
   sea salt and mineral dust, as those emission rates are quite different
   due to different upper size cutoff assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{A Perspective is offered on the lessons learned from surface-science
   studies on enantioselective chemistry on solid surfaces performed by the
   author's groups. Our emphasis is on studies on model systems, mainly
   metal single-crystal surfaces under controlled environments, but
   extension of such research to more realistic samples relevant to
   heterogeneous catalysis is also briefly discussed. Enantioselective
   chemistry on surfaces is here divided into three guiding modalities,
   depending on the underlying mechanism. First, enantioselective chemistry
   resulting from the use of intrinsically chiral surfaces, which can be
   made from achiral solids such as metals by exposing the appropriate
   planes, is discussed. Next, the imparting of enantioselectivity to
   achiral surfaces by modifying them with adsorbates is classified in
   terms of two operating mechanisms: first, via the formation of
   supramolecular surface ensembles with chiral adsorption sites, and
   second, by relying on the effect of the local chiral environment
   intrinsically provided by the chiral modifiers through a one-to-one
   interaction between the modifier and the reactant. A discussion is then
   provided on studies with more complex samples involving metal
   nanoparticles and high-surface-area porous oxides. Finally, the present
   state of our understanding of enantioselective surface chemistry and the
   prognosis for the future are provided.}},

   superplasticizers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2691-2699}},
Abstract = {{Superplasticizers are a class of anionic polymer dispersants used to
   inhibit aggregation in hydraulic cement, lowering the yield stress of
   cement pastes to improve workability and reduce water requirements. The
   plant-derived biopolymer lignin is commonly used as a
   low-cost/low-performance plasticizer, but attempts to improve its
   effects on cement rheology through copolymerization with synthetic
   monomers have not led to significant improvements. Here we demonstrate
   that kraft lignin can form the basis for high-performance
   superplasticizers in hydraulic cement, but the molecular architecture
   must be based on a lignin core with a synthetic-polymer corona that can
   be produced via controlled radical polymerization. Using slump tests of
   ordinary Portland cement pastes, we show that polyacrylamidegrafted
   lignin prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
   polymerization can reduce the yield stress of cement paste to similar
   levels as a leading commercial polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer at
   concentrations ten-fold lower, although the lignin material produced via
   controlled radical polymerization does not appear to reduce the dynamic
   viscosity of cement paste as effectively as the polycarboxylate
   superplasticizer, despite having a similar affinity for the individual
   mineral components of ordinary Portland cement. In contrast,
   polyacrylamide copolymerized with a methacrylated kraft lignin via
   conventional free radical polymerization having a similar overall
   composition did not reduce the yield stress or the viscosity of cement
   pastes. While further work is required to elucidate the mechanism of
   this effect, these results indicate that controlling the architecture of
   polymer-grafted lignin can significantly enhance its performance as a
   superplasticizer for cement.}},

Title = {{Novel silica surface charge density mediated control of the optical
   properties of embedded optically active materials and its application
   for fiber optic pH sensing at elevated temperatures}},

Abstract = {{Silica and silica incorporated nanocomposite materials have been
   extensively studied for a wide range of applications. Here we
   demonstrate an intriguing optical effect of silica that, depending on
   the solution pH, amplifies or attenuates the optical absorption of a
   variety of embedded optically active materials with very distinct
   properties, such as plasmonic Au nanoparticles, non-plasmonic Pt
   nanoparticles, and the organic dye rhodamine B (not a pH indicator),
   coated on an optical fiber. Interestingly, the observed optical response
   to varying pH appears to follow the surface charge density of the silica
   matrix for all the three different optically active materials. To the
   best of our knowledge, this optical effect has not been previously
   reported and it appears universal in that it is likely that any
   optically active material can be incorporated into the silica matrix to
   respond to solution pH or surface charge density variations. A direct
   application of this effect is for optical pH sensing which has very
   attractive features that can enable minimally invasive, remote, real
   time and continuous distributed pH monitoring. Particularly, as
   demonstrated here, using highly stable metal nanoparticles embedded in
   an inorganic silica matrix can significantly improve the capability of
   pH sensing in extremely harsh environments which is of increasing
   importance for applications in unconventional oil and gas resource
   recovery, carbon sequestration, water quality monitoring, etc. Our
   approach opens a pathway towards possible future development of robust
   optical pH sensors for the most demanding environmental conditions. The
   newly discovered optical effect of silica also offers the potential for
   control of the optical properties of optically active materials for a
   range of other potential applications such as electrochromic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout their lives, people make decisions that affect their health,
   finances, and overall well-being. Their competence to make those
   decisions may vary across the lifespan, including adolescence and
   adulthood. To assess individuals' decision-making competence, and
   whether strategies for improving it are effective, researchers need a
   validated individual-differences measure of decision-making competence.
   This chapter covers recent developments towards assessing individual
   differences in decision-making competence across the lifespan. We
   discuss how these efforts have been based on traditional behavioral
   decision research, which defined the normative standards and
   methodological approaches for evaluating people's decisions, as well as
   on initial individual-differences studies with adolescents and older
   adults. We also highlight new research questions that can be explored
   now that validated individual-differences measures of decision-making
   competence are available. Specifically, we discuss opportunities to
   examine which skills contribute to people's ability to make sound
   decisions, to study how aspects of decision-making competence change
   with adult age, as well as to develop and evaluate communications,
   decision aids, behavioral-skills training, and other efforts to improve
   decision making.}},

Title = {{Temporal-spatial changes in ecosystem services and implications for the
   conservation of alpine rangelands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{31-43}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem services emerged as a concept to bridge ecosystem conservation
   and the sustainable use of natural resources. Given the limited funding
   and resources available for ecosystem conservation, fully understanding
   and identifying the temporal-spatial patterns of ecosystem services can
   help establish a cost-efficient ecosystem conservation strategy.
   Although studies have indicated globally important ecosystem services on
   the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), key ecosystem services, such as
   carbon storage, water provision and habitat quality, have not been
   spatial-explicitly quantified, leading to a lack of understanding of key
   spatial patterns for conservation of this unique alpine ecosystem. To
   fill this gap, these three key ecosystem services were simulated for the
   QTP rangelands by using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services
   and Trade-off model, and the hotspots of those ecosystem services were
   evaluated and identified. It was shown that alpine meadows played a key
   role compared with alpine steppe and alpine desert in providing the
   ecosystem services of water provision, carbon storage and habitat
   quality in the alpine rangelands of the QTP. In addition, it was shown
   that there had been a considerable decrease in both the potential and
   the protected hotspots of ecosystem service between 1990 and 2000,
   implying that the existing conservation system (i.e. National Nature
   Reserves) could not effectively maintain these hotspots and that there
   was a need to restore those degraded rangeland ecosystems within the
   existing conservation system. The large-scale spatial heterogeneity
   among the different ecosystem services found in this study can be used
   to inform a more comprehensive conservation strategy for the provision
   of ecosystem services as well as biodiversity in the QTP rangelands.}},

Abstract = {{As the technology node continues to scale, soft errors have become a
   major issue for reliable processor designs. In this paper, we propose a
   framework that accurately and efficiently estimates the Architectural
   Vulnerability Factor (AVF) of critical storage structures of a
   processor. The proposed approach exploits the masking effects between
   array structure (e.g., register files and Caches) and logic units (e.g.,
   Int-ALU) via the unified Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM)
   methodology, and can provide guaranteed AVFs by two accuracy-efficiency
   tradeoff solutions. The experimental results have confirmed that,
   compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed framework
   achieves accurate and efficient estimation via two instanced solutions;
   (1) first-order masking effects up to 45.96\% and on average 8.48\%
   accuracy improvement with 52.01 x speedup; (2) high-order masking
   effects average 87.28\% accuracy improvement with 43.87 x speedup. The
   two different accuracy-efficiency tradeoff of proposed MEA-PGM can be
   applied into different estimation scenarios (e.g., short time to market
   of general mobile devices and high reliable requirements in aerospace
   platforms) in flexibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   first account for time variability through multivariate functional
   registration, then decompose finger motion into a term that is shared
   among replications and a term that encodes the variation per
   replication. We discuss variants of our model, estimation algorithms,
   and we evaluate its performance in simulations and in data collected
   from a non-human primate executing a reach-to-grasp task We show that by
   taking advantage of the repeated trial structure of the experiments, our

Abstract = {{Designers must often create solutions to problems that exhibit dynamic
   characteristics. For instance, a client might modify specifications
   after design has commenced, or a competitor may introduce a new
   technology or feature. This paper presents a cognitive study that was
   conducted to explore the manner in which design teams respond to such
   situations. In the study, teams of undergraduate engineering students
   sought to solve a design task that was subject to two large, unexpected
   changes in problem formulation that were introduced during solving.
   High- and low-performing teams demonstrated very different approaches to
   solving the problem and overcoming the changes. The results indicate
   that there may exist a relationship between problem characteristics and
   fruitful solution strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dispersion curves characterize many propagation mediums. When known,
   many methods use these curves to analyze waves. Yet, in many scenarios,
   their exact values are unknown due to material and environmental
   uncertainty. This paper presents a fast implementation of sparse
   wavenumber analysis, a method for recovering dispersion curves from
   data. This approach, based on orthogonal matching pursuit, is compared
   with a prior implementation, based on basis pursuit denoising. In the
   results, orthogonal matching pursuit provides two to three orders of
   magnitude improvement in speed and a small average reduction in
   prediction capability. The analysis is demonstrated across multiple

Abstract = {{Sulfidation is a major transformation product for manufactured silver
   nanoparticles (Ag-MNPs) in the wastewater treatment process. We studied
   the dissolution, uptake, and toxicity of Ag-MNP and sulfidized Ag-MNPs
   (sAg-MNPs) to a model soil organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results
   show that reproduction was the most sensitive endpoint tested for both
   Ag-MNPs and sAg-MNPs. We also demonstrate that sulfidation not only
   decreases solubility of Ag-MNP, but also reduces the bioavailability of
   intact sAg-MNP. The relative contribution of released Ag+ compared to
   intact particles to toxicity was concentration dependent. At lower total
   Ag concentration, a greater proportion of the toxicity could be
   explained by dissolved Ag, whereas at higher total Ag concentration, the
   toxicity appeared to be dominated by particle specific effects. 2014

Abstract = {{With the increasing number of sensors in modern vehicles, using an
   intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN) is a possible solution
   for the automotive industry for addressing the potential issues that
   arise from additional wiring harness. Such a solution could help car
   manufacturers develop vehicles that have better fuel economy and
   performance, in addition to supporting new applications. However, which
   wireless technology should be used for maximizing the benefits of IVWSNs
   is still an open issue. In this article we propose to use a new wireless
   technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and outline a new
   architecture for IVWSN. Based on a comprehensive study that encompasses
   an example application, it is shown that BLE is an excellent option that
   can be used in IVWSNs for certain applications mainly due to its good
   performance and low-power, low-complexity, and low-cost attributes.}},

Abstract = {{BiVO4 surfaces of all possible orientations have been used to

   results show that the photochemical reduction of Ag+ is strongly favored
   on BiVO4 (001) surfaces (indexed in group I2/b). However, Ag+ can be
   reduced on all orientations, with the rate of reduction decreasing with
   increasing inclination from the {[}001] direction. The oxidation of Pb2+
   is strongly favored on (hk0) surfaces perpendicular to (001). Surfaces
   within 50 degrees of {[}001] have a much lower activity for the
   oxidation of Pb2+. The results also show that reduction and oxidation

Abstract = {{The field of RNA interference depends on the development of safe and

   utilized the nitrogen heteroatom to produce cationic charges. Here, we
   polymerized cationic sulfonium (meth)acrylate by activators regenerated
   by electron transfer (ARGET) atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)
   to form polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions for siRNA
   delivery. The tertiary sulfonium species was stable toward dealkylation
   in water but less stable in the polar aprotic solvent dimethyl
   sulfoxide. Block copolymers poly(ethylene oxide) with poly(meth)acrylate
   containing sulfonium moieties were prepared as an siRNA delivery
   platform. Results suggested block copolymers were biocompatible up to 50
   mu g/mL in vitro and formed polyplexes with siRNA. Additionally, block
   copolymers protected siRNAs against endonuclease digestion and
   facilitated knockdown of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
   (Gapdh) mRNA expression in murine calvarial preosteoblasts. The
   versatility, biocompatibility, and cationic nature of these tertiary

Abstract = {{Mammalian cells detect and respond to topographical cues presented in

   can be harmonized with dynamic cellular responses. Here we present a
   lithography-free fabrication technique that can reversibly present
   topographical cues using an actuation mechanism that minimizes the
   confounding effects of applied stimuli. This method utilizes
   strain-induced buckling instabilities in bilayer substrate materials
   with rigid uniform silicon oxide membranes that are thermally deposited
   on elastomeric substrates. The resulting surfaces are capable of
   reversible of substrates between three distinct states: flat substrates
   (A = 1.53 +/- 0.55 nm; Rms = 0.317 +/- 0.048 nm); parallel wavy grating
   arrays (A(parallel to) = 483.6 +/- 7.8 nm; lambda(parallel to) = 4.78
   +/- 0.16 mu m); perpendicular wavy grating arrays (A(parallel to) =
   429.3 +/- 5.8 nm; lambda(perpendicular to) = 4.95 +/- 036 mu m). The
   cytoskeleton dynamics of 3T3 fibroblasts in response to these surfaces
   was measured using optical microscopy. Fibroblasts cultured on dynamic
   substrates that are switched from flat to topographic features
   (FLAT-WAVY) exhibit a robust and rapid change in gross morphology as
   measured by a reduction in circularity from 0.30 +/- 0.13 to 0.15 +/-
   0.08 after 5 min. Conversely, dynamic substrate sequences of
   FLAT-WAVY-FLAT do not significantly alter the gross steady-state
   morphology. Taken together, substrates that present topographic
   structures reversibly can elucidate dynamic aspects of cell-topography
   interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A composite anode comprising blended NASICON-structured NaTi2(PO4)(3)

   of activated carbon mass fractions. Electrochemical analyses showed the
   efficacy and stability of this composite anode combination in a
   functional paradigm where both Na+ and Li+ cations can participate in
   the charge storage reactions. Use of this composite anode in concert
   with a lambda-MnO2 based cathode results in an energy storage device
   that is low cost, robust, and of sufficient energy density to be
   implemented in stationary applications. Data from large-format units

Abstract = {{The dilatational rheology of complex fluid-fluid interfaces is linked to
   the stability and bulk rheology of emulsions and foams. Dilatational
   rheology can be measured by pinning a bubble or droplet at the tip of a
   capillary, subjecting the interface shape to small amplitude
   oscillations, and recording the resulting pressure jump across the
   interface. The complex dilatational modulus is obtained by
   differentiating the interfacial stress with respect to the area change
   of the interface. In this paper, we perform a regular asymptotic
   expansion to analyze the interface response in pressure-controlled
   capillary pressure tensiometers to determine the dilatational modulus as
   a function of the measured radius of curvature. We show that small
   amplitude oscillatory dilation of a spherical bubble is neither stress
   nor strain rate controlled. The resulting dilatational modulus contains
   contributions from both surface tension effects as well as extra
   stresses. Depending on the specifics of the interface, each contribution
   can be a function of the dilation rate and the radius of the bubble.
   Thus, the radius of curvature can be used as a control parameter with
   which to separate surface tension and interfacial rheology effects,
   aiding in validation of interfacial constitutive models. We examine the
   limits of validity of the small amplitude assumption and provide
   guidelines for determining the operating limits of a capillary pressure
   tensiometer. Finally, we compare several existing devices, including a
   microtensiometer we developed previously that oscillates the pressure
   inside small (R similar to 10 mu m) droplets. (C) 2015 The Society of

Abstract = {{In case of an emergency in a building, first responders need to know
   current blockages in the building (e.g., blocked passageways and exits)
   and safe evacuating paths so that the occupants can be guided to the
   unblocked exits and safe paths toward those exits. To automatically
   determine blockage levels at buildings, a system that fuses data from
   multiple sensors and video camera was proposed. A prototype was
   developed and tested on an experimental model of a pilot building's
   hallway. A series of damage tests were conducted on the hallway model
   and recorded by the sensors and the video camera. Individual
   performances of sensors and video camera were evaluated, and a decision
   tree method was used to fuse sensor and video camera data for estimating
   the level of blockage in the hallway for different damage combinations
   applied on building components. The results demonstrated the technical
   feasibility of the proposed system and the findings of the decision tree
   highlight that by using less number of sensors, a cost-effective
   configuration can be achieved. The estimated blockage information can be
   used to create a topological map of the damaged building, indicating
   safe paths toward available unblocked exits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Life cycle impacts have been evaluated to compare and assess six

   wastewater for reuse in thermo-electric power plant cooling systems.
   Impacts during construction and operation of tertiary treatment
   processes using databases and characterization tools embedded in the
   process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) software, Simapro v7.3, and
   the Carnegie Mellon economic input-output LCA (EIO-LCA) 2002 model were
   estimated. Infrastructure cost estimates from life cycle cost analysis
   were used as inputs to the EIO-LCA model. Inputs to the process-based
   analysis included chemical doses added during and after tertiary
   treatment, approximate transport distance of chemicals from producer to
   treatment site, and energy generation to operate major equipment during
   treatment. Impacts considered included global warming potential (in kg
   CO2 eq.), acidification (in kg SO2 eq.), eutrophication (in kg N eq.)
   and ecotoxicity (in kg 2,4-D eq.)estimated using TRACI model
   characterization factors. The environmental impacts analysis showed that
   manufacture of chemicals for tertiary treatment and conditioning, and
   electric power generation were the main processes that contribute to
   environmental impacts. Thus, alternatives with no or less tertiary
   treatment are recommended from an environmental impact perspective for
   reuse of secondary treated wastewater in cooling systems. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{We present the design and validation of a micromachined gripper array

   gripper is constructed with polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon), a
   brittle material, and is compatible with polysilicon surface
   micromachining. Two ingressive snap- and-lock array designs are
   presented. After developing design guidelines, it is shown that the
   first gripper array is functional. However, a risk remains that the
   gripper array rather than the tensile bar that it grips in its intended
   application fails. Therefore, an improved geometry is designed and it is
   shown that it is robust with respect to failure. Scanning confocal Raman
   imaging directly confirms that the local peak tensile stresses in the
   robust gripper array are approximately 50\% of the lower bound material
   strength, and also resolves a 25\% stress variation across the array.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) of a model system,
   strontium titanate, is compared with the grain boundary plane
   distribution (GBPD) as a function of temperature. Strontium titanate has
   a pronounced surface energy anisotropy and a grain growth anomaly, with
   the grain growth rate decreasing by orders of magnitude with increasing
   temperature. The ECS was determined from the shape of small
   intragranular pores and the GBPD was determined from orientation
   measurements on surfaces, with the relative areas of grain boundary
   planes in a polycrystal correlated to the surface energy of both
   adjacent crystal planes. The grain boundary energy has been previously
   proposed to be the sum of the surface energy of the adjacent grains less
   a binding energy that is assumed to be constant. While much experimental
   evidence exists for this assumption at a fixed temperature, the
   influence of temperature is not known. While the anisotropy of the ECS
   was found to decrease with temperature, the anisotropy of the GBPD
   increased with temperature. These findings indicate that changes in the
   binding energy with temperature must be considered, as the binding
   energy links the surface energy to the grain boundary energy. The
   results are discussed with respect to the grain growth anomaly of
   strontium titanate, in which the grain growth decreases with increasing
   temperature. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cu growth phenomena during electroless deposition (ELD) on Ru substrate
   were investigated in this study. Different to the formaldehyde based Cu
   ELD bath, the use of hydrazine based Cu ELD bath facilitated the
   observation of Cu growth phenomena during ELD. The whole
   surface-catalyzed ELD occurred on Ru, and electrochemical quartz crystal
   microbalance as well as linear sweep voltammetry studies revealed that
   Cu covered Ru surface within a few seconds of ELD. Measurement of sheet
   resistance change confirmed that Cu nucleation on Ru was continuous with
   forming a film. During the period, Cu film growth was monitored by an
   atomic force microscope imaging, indicating that Cu was deposited on Ru
   preferentially, rather than on the deposited Cu at the initial stage of
   the deposition. The whole surface-catalyzed ELD achieved 55 nm
   gap-filling, and this showed the possibility of the practical adoption
   of ELD as a method for metallization in ultralarge-scale integration.

Abstract = {{Energy storage systems (ESSs) are often proposed to support the
   frequency control in microgrid systems. Due to the intermittency of the
   renewable generation and constantly changing load demand, the
   charging/discharging of various ESSs in an autonomous microgrid needs to
   be properly coordinated to ensure the supply-demand balance. Recent
   research has discovered that the charging/discharging efficiency of ESSs
   has remarkable dependence on the charging/discharging rate and
   state-of-charge of the ESS. This paper proposes a distributed
   cooperative control strategy for coordinating the ESSs to maintain the
   supply-demand balance and minimize the total power loss associated with
   charging/discharging inefficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed
   approach is validated by simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Numeracy refers to people's ability to use numbers. Low
   numeracy has been associated with difficulties in understanding
   risk-benefit information and making health decisions. Older adults tend
   to perform worse than younger adults on measures of numeracy, but some
   theories of aging suggest that older adults may lack motivation for such
   tasks. We therefore test whether age differences in numeracy performance
   are mediated by a reduced motivation to think hard about complex
   problemsas measured by need for cognition. Method. We recruited an
   age-diverse convenience sample of 306 UK adults. They completed measures
   of numeracy and need for cognition. They self-reported their educational
   attainment and other demographics. Results. Older age was related to
   lower numeracy and lower need for cognition. The negative relationship
   between age and numeracy was mediated by need for cognition. These
   findings held after we controlled for educational attainment and other
   demographic factors. Discussion. Older adults may show lower numeracy
   performance due to lack of motivation. We discuss strategies for
   improving people's motivation to complete numeracy measures and other
   numerical tasks.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the value of batteries in microgrid electricity systems using
   an improved Energy Systems Model}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{458-472}},

Abstract = {{A high-resolution mode allowing for the comparison of different energy
   storage technologies in a variety of realistic microgrid settings has
   been developed. The Energy Systems Model (ESM) is similar to the popular
   microgrid software HOMER, but improves upon the battery models used in
   that program. ESM adds several important aspects of battery modeling,
   including temperature effects, rate-based variable efficiency, and
   operational modeling of capacity fade and we demonstrate that addition
   of these factors can significantly alter optimal system design,
   levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and other factors. ESM is then
   used to compare the Aqueous Hybrid Ion (AHI) battery chemistry to lead
   acid (PbA) batteries in standalone microgrids. The model suggests that
   AHI-based diesel generator/photovoltaic (PV)/battery systems are often
   more cost-effective than PbA-based systems by an average of around 10\%,
   even though the capital cost of AHI technology is higher. The difference
   in LCOE is greatest in scenarios that have lower discount rates,
   increased PV utilization, higher temperature, and more expensive diesel
   fuel. AHI appears to be a better complement to solar PV, and scenarios
   that favor the use of solar PV (low PV prices, low discount rates, and
   high diesel prices) tend to improve the LCOE advantage of AHI. However,
   scenarios that do not require constant cycling of the batteries strongly
   favor PbA. AHI is not a drop-in replacement for PbA. To minimize LCOE,
   microgrids using AHI batteries should be designed and operated
   differently than PbA microgrids. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Given their high theoretical specific energy, lithium-oxygen batteries
   have received enormous attention as possible alternatives to current
   state-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion batteries. However, the maximum
   discharge capacity in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries is limited to
   a small fraction of its theoretical value due to the build-up of
   insulating lithium peroxide (Li2O2), the battery's primary discharge
   product. The discharge capacity can be increased if Li2O2 forms as large
   toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer. Here, we show
   that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as H2O, enhance the
   formation of Li2O2 toroids and result in significant improvements in
   capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the
   solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism
   that is responsible for the growth of Li2O2 toroids. We present a
   general formalism describing an additive's tendency to trigger the
   solution process, providing a rational design route for electrolytes
   that afford larger lithium-oxygen battery capacities.}},

Abstract = {{Considered a self-lubricating, abrasion-resistant biomaterial,
   ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has become the most
   common acetabular cup material used in artificial hip joints. Artificial
   hip joints exist primarily in the boundary and mixed regimes, which can
   lead to premature failure due to surface wear, debris generation, and
   subsequent osteolysis. The tendency of failure due to the generation of
   wear debris has turned the hip problem into a complex tribological
   challenge with a focus on abrasion-resistant surfaces. Surface texturing
   in the form of microdimples has been shown in other applications to
   provide enhanced wear resistance through the trapping of wear debris and
   through the enhancement of fluid pressures to levels that promote
   mixed-to full-film lubrication even at low speeds. The objective of this
   investigation is to explore the potential for surface texturing of
   UHMWPE sliding contacts in enhancing the lubrication regimes present in
   total hip replacements. Surface textures were created using a mechanical
   micromachining process, and experiments were conducted on a pin-on-disk
   tribometer under lubricated conditions present in the hip for textured
   and untextured samples. Results show that the surface textures were able
   to reduce friction by up to 50\% over that observed with untextured
   UHMWPE samples, with evidence that suggests a regime shift from boundary
   lubrication to mixed and full-film lubrication as the primary mechanism
   for friction reduction.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an operational optimization designed to reduce the
   operational cost of a full-scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) system
   was studied under variable operating conditions. To increase operational
   flexibility and cost savings potential, the storage tank was used as the
   buffer between freshwater production and supply. With a well-developed
   mathematical model, which included reverse osmosis (RO) process
   equations, the storage tank equations and operational cost equations,
   the optimal problem was formulated in the form of nonlinear DAOPs
   (differential algebraic optimization problems). To solve the problem
   effectively, a simultaneous approach was introduced in which the
   differential and algebraic variables were fully discretized. Then
   nonlinear solver of IPOPT was used to solve the discretized large-scale
   nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. Computational results show that the
   operational optimization has significant potential of more than 26\%
   cost saving over conventional method. Based on the successful solution,
   the impacts of variable parameters, such as feed temperature, seawater
   salinity, electricity price and freshwater demand were analyzed in
   detail. The effect of these parameters on operational cost savings and
   corresponding key performance indicators was determined, which enhances
   the understanding of the SWRO process and its optimal control. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{IEEE 1149.1, commonly known as the joint test action group (JTAG), is
   the standard for the test access port and the boundary-scan
   architecture. The JTAG is primarily utilized at the time of the
   integrated circuit (IC) manufacture but also in the field, giving access
   to internal sub-systems of the IC, or for failure analysis and
   debugging. Because the JTAG needs to be left intact and operational for
   use, it inevitably provides a ``backdoor{''} that can be exploited to
   undermine the security of the chip. Potential attackers can then use the
   JTAG to dump critical data or reverse engineer IP cores, for example.
   Since an attacker will use the JTAG differently from a legitimate user,
   it is possible to detect the difference using machine-learning
   algorithms. A JTAG protection scheme, SLIC-J, is proposed to monitor
   user behavior and detect illegitimate accesses to the JTAG.
   Specifically, JTAG access is characterized using a set of
   specifically-defined features, and then an on-chip classifier is used to
   predict whether the user is legitimate or not. To validate the
   effectiveness of the approach, both legitimate and illegitimate JTAG
   accesses are simulated using the OpenSPARC T2 benchmark. The results
   show that the detection accuracy is 99.2\%, and the escape rate is
   0.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{Analog neural networks represent a massively parallel computing paradigm
   by mimicking the human brain. Two important functions that are not
   efficiently built by CMOS technology for their practical hardware
   implementations are weighting for synapse circuits and summing for
   neuron circuits. In this paper we propose the use of tunable analog
   resistances, such as multi-gate graphene devices, to efficiently enable
   these two functions. We design and demonstrate a complete analog
   neuromorphic circuitry enabled by such devices. Simulation results based
   on Verilog-A compact models for graphene devices confirm its
   functionality. We also provide experimental demonstration of our
   proposed graphene device along with projected circuit performance based
   on scaling targets. Our proposed design is suitable not only for the
   device example shown in this paper, but also for any beyond-CMOS
   technology that exhibits similar device characteristics.}},

   estimating its bit error rate (BER) is a critical task to guarantee its
   performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to estimate
   BER by Bayesian Model Fusion. Its key idea is to borrow conventional
   extrapolated BER value as prior knowledge, and combine it with
   additional measurement data to ``calibrate{''} the BER value. This
   method can be viewed as an application of Bayesian Model Fusion (BMF)
   technique. We further propose some novel methodologies to make BMF

   decrease the number of bits needed to estimate BER value. Several

Abstract = {{As power density emerges as the main constraint for many-core systems,
   controlling power consumption under the Thermal Design Power (TDP) while
   maximizing the performance becomes increasingly critical. To dynamically
   save power, Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques have
   proved to be effective and are widely available commercially. In this
   paper, we present an On-line Distributed Reinforcement Learning (OD-RL)
   based DVFS control algorithm for many-core system performance
   improvement under power constraints. At the finer grain, a per-core
   Reinforcement Learning (RL) method is used to learn the optimal control
   policy of the Voltage/Frequency (VF) levels in a system model-free
   manner. At the coarser grain, an efficient global power budget
   reallocation algorithm is used to maximize the overall performance. The
   experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms: 1)
   OD-RL produces up to 98\% less budget overshoot, 2) up to 44.3x better
   throughput per over-the-budget energy and up to 23\% higher energy
   efficiency, and 3) two orders of magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the analysis of resilience properties related
   to electric power grids modeled as a (large) dynamical system. To this
   end, we introduce the notion of p-robustness as the capability of
   ensuring the proper functioning of the electric power grids, in the
   sense of guaranteeing generic controllability of the associated
   dynamical system, under arbitrary p transmission line failures. Then, we
   provide conditions under which the electric power grid is p-robust, and
   an algorithm that determines the minimum number of transmission lines in
   the electric power grid that is need to add in order to transform a
   non-robust (0-robust) electric power grid into a 1-robust electric power
   grid. Further, we discuss how the methodology can be extended to ensure
   p-robustness with a relatively small number of additional transmission
   lines. We present an illustrative example of the proposed analysis and
   methodology using the IEEE 39-bus system, whose dynamical model is

   recognize damage at the electrode-tissue interface. We use a simple
   switch circuit approach to estimate the relaxation time constant of the
   electrode model, which essentially models the residual voltage in
   biphasic electrical stimulation, and compare it with standard electrode
   characterization techniques. Out of 15 electrodes in a polyimide-based

   encapsulated inside a hydrogel. A flexible heater is in contact with the
   hydrogel patch. A series of off-the-shelf electronics components
   including driver of the heater, microcontroller, a wireless radios are
   assembled in a compact package, and used to control the heater and drug
   release wirelessly. Paper presents the design and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{While capturing an image under flash light, we obtain a relatively sharp
   and noise-free image but the presence of sharp shadows at silhouettes is
   unwanted and sometimes it also reduces the overall visual appeal of the
   image. In this paper, we present a shadow detection as well as removal
   algorithm to detect and remove shadows at silhouettes from images
   captured under flash light. We use a pair of flash and no flash images
   for performing shadow detection and recover the shadow areas to produce
   an enhanced flash image. This problem has not been addressed explicitly
   before in literature with major emphasis on flash image enhancement. We
   compare the accuracy of proposed shadow detection algorithm with an
   existing method in literature. It is shown that proposed method of
   shadow detection gives more accurate results and the proposed shadow
   recovery method gives subjectively better results compared to pixel-wise
   recovery method.}},

Abstract = {{Responses to climate change may be viewed as requiring primarily
   ``Resilience'' or ``Adaptation.'' We examine how those two terms affect
   lay responses to the risks of coastal flooding and sea level rise. We
   use two tasks requiring substantial participant involvement, one
   providing minimal information and one substantial information. In Study
   1, participants spent ten minutes writing an essay about a picture with
   flooding, labeled with ``Resilience'' or ``Adaptation.'' In Study 2,
   participants used an interactive aid to evaluate moving to a coastal
   community described as having a policy of Resilience or Adaptation, or
   having No Stated Policy. In Study 1, both groups judged the threat of
   flood similarly. In Study 2, Resilience was associated with increased
   concern about risks, but less willingness to take individual protective

Abstract = {{Purpose: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based P300 speller is a type of
   brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses EEG to allow a user to select
   characters without physical movement. In general, using fewer electrodes
   for such a system makes it easier to set up and less expensive. This
   study addresses the question of electrode selection for EEG-based P300
   systems. Methods: Data from 13 subjects collected with a 16-electrode
   cap was analyzed. The optimal subsets of electrodes of sizes 1-15 were
   calculated for each subject and for the group as a whole. The methods of
   exhaustive search, forward selection, and backward elimination were then
   compared to each other and to these optimal subsets. Results: The
   results show that, while none of the methods consistently picked the
   best-performing electrode subsets, all methods were able to find small
   electrode subsets that provided acceptable accuracy both for individuals
   and for the whole group. The computationally intensive exhaustive search
   method provided no statistically significant increase in performance
   over the much quicker forward and backward selection methods.
   Conclusions: The forward and backward selection methods are preferred
   for electrode selection.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for energy from renewable sources (RS) such as biomass, wind,
   and solar power is increasing as a result of concerns over environmental
   changes and global warming. This has resulted in the proliferation of
   distributed generation based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The
   appearance of Smartgrid and dynamic pricing enabled small players
   producing significantly small capacities to be able to sell their
   energy. As an energy consumer Agriculture also contributes to global
   warming. Furthermore because of increasing need for energy inputs to
   optimize production, Agriculture will continue to rely on energy to
   increase its productivity in line with increasing population and demand.
   It is therefore susceptible to being impacted by variabilities in energy
   supply and demand. Since agricultural enterprises also have potential to
   generate energy from agricultural residue, they can participate in
   Smartgrids as Smartloads and Smartgenerators. This work presents an
   integration model between SmartFarms and the Smartgrid. This way
   SmartFarms can participate actively and benefit from the energy market.
   It focuses on ways to improve the decision support systems in Smartfarms
   to enable optimal decision making. In this fashion, SmartFarms can
   support the reliable operation of Smartgrids while minimizing their
   expenditures on energy.}},

Abstract = {{The small scale power networks i.e. microgrids are trending due to their
   various advantages including seamless integration of renewable energy

   set standards or policies to categorize and/or evaluate these systems.
   Hence, microgrid testbeds are being developed around the globe to
   understand these technologies. This paper presents a generic testbed
   focused on the needs of developing countries. It has various
   technologies that can be used in three subgrids i.e. DC microgrid, AC
   microgrid and Solar Home Systems (SHS). Various operational scenarios
   are considered to evaluate the capabilities of microgrids with applied

Abstract = {{Access to reliable source of electricity remains a challenge for rural
   areas in developing and under-developed countries. To address this
   challenge, health centers in underserved communities adopted off-grid
   photo-voltaic (PV) systems. Standalone PV systems were identified to be
   relatively cost effective compared to grid extension. To reduce the cost
   of solar systems the size of batteries must be minimized. Currently,
   most of the PV powered health centers serve patients as they come. This
   first come first served model does not allow the centers to harness the
   power generated by PV systems at maximum level. With minimum sizing of
   the battery in the systems some energy is left unused when there are a
   small number of patients who need electricity dependent services. There
   are also shortages of energy when the power required by the services
   exceeds the generation capacity of the PV systems. Although PV systems
   might be considered as an adequate solution to shortage of reliable
   source of energy, its maximum exploitation requires an efficient
   management of services using it. To alleviate the logistic management
   and to maximize the number of services provided by PV powered health
   centers in underserved community, the Smart Energy Management for Health
   Centers (SEMHC) model was developed. This paper shows the design and
   implementation of SEMHC computer system. The system is comprised of a
   computer server and access terminals. The server uses the developed
   scheduling algorithm to allocate a time for each of electricity
   dependent health services based on its electric power requirement, its
   time duration and the expected PV generated power. The access terminals,
   which could be smart phones or laptop computers, are used by healthcare
   providers to input the services and get the schedule from the server.
   The data about energy consumption and services being provided by centers
   are collected over time. The collected data allows learning the energy
   consumption behaviors of health centers and provides insight on
   correlation of the delivered health services and the sizing of the
   PV-battery systems. It can also be used as reference for planning for
   new PV systems or upgrading existing one.}},

Abstract = {{We conduct a techno-economic analysis of Li-ion NMC-G prismatic pouch
   battery and pack designs for electric vehicle applications. We develop
   models of power capability and manufacturing operations to identify the
   minimum cost cell and pack designs for a variety of plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicle (PHEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) requirements.
   We find that economies of scale in battery manufacturing are reached
   quickly at a production volume of similar to 200-300 MWh annually.
   Increased volume does little to reduce unit costs, except potentially
   indirectly through factors such as experience, learning, and innovation.
   We also find that vehicle applications with larger energy requirements
   are able to utilize cheaper cells due in part to the use of thicker
   electrodes. The effect on cost can be substantial. In our base case, we
   estimate pack-level battery production costs of similar to\$545 kWh(-1)
   for a PHEV with a 10 mile (16 km) all-electric range (PHEV10) and
   similar to\$230 kWh(-1) for a BEV with a 200 mile (320 km) all-electric
   range (BEV200). This 58\% reduction, from \$545 kWh(-1) to \$230
   kWh(-1), is a larger effect than the uncertainty represented by our
   optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Electrodes thicker than about 100
   or 125 microns are not currently used in practice due to manufacturing
   and durability concerns, but relaxing this constraint could further
   lower the cost of larger capacity BEV200 packs by up to an additional
   8\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new design approach to synthesize multiple
   degrees-of-freedom (DOF) flexure-based parallel mechanism (FPM). Termed
   as an integrated design approach, it is a systematic design methodology,
   which integrates both classical mechanism synthesis and modern topology
   optimization technique, to deliver an optimized multi-DOF FPM. This
   design approach is separated into two levels. At sub-chain level, a
   novel topology optimization technique, which uses the classical linkage
   mechanisms as DNA seeds, is used to synthesize the compliant joints or
   limbs. At configuration level, the optimal compliant joints are used to
   form the parallel limbs of the multi-DOF FPM and another stage of
   optimization was conducted to determine the optimal space distribution
   between these compliant joints so as to generate a multi-DOF FPM with
   optimized stiffness characteristic. In this paper, the design of a 3-DOF
   planar motion FPM was used to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy
   of this proposed design approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Magnetic nanoparticle-based solder composites for electronic packaging
   applications}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{95-160}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys are regarded as the most promising alternative for
   traditional Pb-Sn solders used in electronic packaging applications.
   However, the higher reflow temperature requirement, possible
   intermetallic formation, and reliability issues of SAC alloys generate
   several key challenges for successful adoption of Pb-free solder for
   next generation electronic packaging needs. Localized heating in
   interconnects can alleviate thermal stresses by preventing subjection of
   entire package to the higher reflow temperatures associated with the SAC
   solders. It had been demonstrated that SAC solder-FeCo magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) composite paste can be reflowed locally with AC
   magnetic fields, enabling interconnect formation in area array packages
   while minimizing eddy current heating in the printed circuit board.
   Solder/magnetic nanocomposite pastes with varying MNP concentration were
   reflowed using AC magnetic fields. Differential scanning calorimetry
   results show a reduced undercooling of the composite pastes with the
   addition of MNPs. TEM results show that the FeCo MNPs are distributed in
   Sn matrix of the reflowed solder composites. Optical and SEM micrographs
   show a decrease in Sn dendrite regions as well as smaller and more
   homogeneous dispersed Ag3Sn with the addition of MNPs. The MNPs promote
   Sn solidification by providing more heterogeneous nucleation sites at
   relatively low undercoolings. The mechanical properties were measured by
   nanoindentation. The modulus, hardness, and creep resistance, increase
   with the MNP concentration. The enhanced mechanical properties are
   attributed to grain boundary and dispersion strengthening.
   The reflow of solder composites have been modeled based on eddy current
   power loss in the substrate and magnetic power losses in the solder
   bumps. Induction reflow of pure solder bumps (<300 mu m) in an area
   array package using 500 Oe magnetic field at 300 kHz requires excessive
   eddy current power loss in the substrate, resulting in extreme
   temperatures that lead to blistering and delamination of the substrate.
   Solder-MNP composites with modest MNP loading showed temperature
   increases sufficient to achieve solder reflow when subjected to the same
   AC magnetic fields. Thermomechanical behavior of a solder joint was also
   modeled under cyclic temperature variations. The stress and strain are
   highly localized at the interface between solder and substrate. Plastic
   work accumulated per cycle can be used for lifetime prediction.
   In this article we review lead-containing and lead-free solder systems,
   and the electronic packaging technologies pertinent to soldering
   process. Recent research on the effects of MNPs on localized heating,
   microstructure evolution, mechanical properties, and thermomechanical
   reliability are summarized. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nuclear power industry has historically been plagued with new plant
   deployment risks for engineering procurement and construction (EPC);
   project cost and schedule overruns present a risk to investors. These
   risks are anticipated to continue to hinder the growth of the nuclear
   industry, due to expected increased regulatory requirements due to the
   Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant incident in March 2011. Although
   several risk management practices have been put in place, considerable
   cost and schedule excursions have continued to occur in the construction
   of recent nuclear power plant projects. We identify the limitations with
   current risk management practices by assessing the level of completeness
   of risk identification and accuracy of risk assessments on prior steam
   generator replacement (SGR) projects. SGR projects were chosen for this
   evaluation because their scope of work is characteristic of large
   nuclear power plant EPC projects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel algorithm which uses skeleton-based polycube
   generation to construct feature-preserving T-meshes. From the skeleton
   of the input model, we first construct initial cubes in the interior. By
   projecting corners of interior cubes onto the surface and generating a
   new layer of boundary cubes, we split the entire interior domain into
   different cubic regions. With the splitting result, we perform octree
   subdivision to obtain T-spline control mesh or T-mesh. Surface features
   are classified into three groups: open curves, closed curves and
   singularity features. For features without introducing new singularities
   like open or closed curves, we preserve them by aligning to the
   parametric lines during subdivision, performing volumetric
   parameterization from frame field, or modifying the skeleton. For
   features introducing new singularities, we design templates to handle
   them. With a valid T-mesh, we calculate rational trivariate T-splines
   and extract Bezier elements for isogeometric analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tikal has long been viewed as one of the leading polities of the ancient
   Maya realm, yet how the city was able to maintain its substantial
   population in the midst of a tropical forest environment has been a
   topic of unresolved debate among researchers for decades. We present
   ecological, paleoethnobotanical, hydraulic, remote sensing, edaphic, and
   isotopic evidence that reveals how the Late Classic Maya at Tikal
   practiced intensive forms of agriculture (including irrigation, terrace
   construction, arboriculture, household gardens, and short fallow
   swidden) coupled with carefully controlled agroforestry and a complex
   system of water retention and redistribution. Empirical evidence is
   presented to demonstrate that this assiduously managed anthropogenic
   ecosystem of the Classic period Maya was a landscape optimized in a way
   that provided sustenance to a relatively large population in a
   preindustrial, low-density urban community. This landscape productivity
   optimization, however, came with a heavy cost of reduced environmental
   resiliency and a complete reliance on consistent annual rainfall. Recent
   speleothem data collected from regional caves showed that persistent
   episodes of unusually low rainfall were prevalent in the mid-9th century
   A.D., a time period that coincides strikingly with the abandonment of
   Tikal and the erection of its last dated monument in A.D. 869. The
   intensified resource management strategy used at Tikal-already operating
   at the landscape's carrying capacity-ceased to provide adequate food,
   fuel, and drinking water for the Late Classic populace in the face of
   extended periods of drought. As a result, social disorder and
   abandonment ensued.}},

Abstract = {{The local epitaxial growth of pulsed laser deposited Ca2MnO4 films on
   polycrystalline spark plasma sintered Sr2TiO4 substrates was
   investigated to determine phase formation and preferred epitaxial
   orientation relationships (ORs) for isostructural Ruddlesden-Popper (RP)
   heteroepitaxy, further developing the high-throughput synthetic approach
   called Combinatorial Substrate Epitaxy (CSE). Both grazing incidence
   X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction patterns of the
   film and substrate were indexable as single-phase RP-structured
   compounds. The optimal growth temperature (between 650 degrees C and 800
   degrees C) was found to be 750 degrees C using the maximum value of the
   average image quality of the backscattered diffraction patterns. Films
   grew in a grain-over-grain pattern such that each Ca2MnO4 grain had a
   single OR with the Sr2TiO4 grain on which it grew. Three primary ORs
   described 47 out of 49 grain pairs that covered nearly all of RP
   orientation space. The first OR, found for 20 of the 49, was the
   expected RP unit-cell over RP unit-cell OR, expressed as
   {[}100]{[}001](film)parallel to{[}100]{[} 001](sub). The other two ORs
   were essentially rotated from the first by 90 degrees, with one
   (observed for 17 of 49 pairs) being rotated about the {[}100] and the
   other (observed for 10 of 49 pairs) being rotated about the {[}110] (and
   not exactly by 90 degrees). These results indicate that only a small
   number of ORs are needed to describe isostructural RP heteroepitaxy and
   further demonstrate the potential of CSE in the design and growth of a
   wide range of complex functional oxides. VC 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{A microscale, multi-asperity frictional test platform has been designed
   that allows for wide variation of normal load, spring constant, and
   puller step frequency. Two different monolayer coatings have been
   applied to the surfaces-tridecafluorotris(dimethylamino)silane (FOTAS,
   CF3(CF2)(5)(CH2)(2) Si(N(CH3)(2))(3)) and octadecyltrichlorosilane OTS,
   CH3(CH2) 17SiCl3). Static friction aging was observed for both coatings.
   Simulating the platform using a modified rate-state model with discrete
   actuator steps results in good agreement with experiments over a wide
   control parameter subspace using system parameters extracted from
   experiments. Experimental and modeling results indicate that (1)
   contacts strengthen with rest time, exponentially approaching a maximum
   value and rejuvenating after inertial events, and ( 2) velocity
   strengthening is needed to explain the shorter than expected length of
   slips after the friction block transitions from a stick state. We
   suggest that aging occurs because tail groups in the monolayer coatings
   reconfigure readily upon initial contact with an opposing
   countersurface. The reconfiguration is limited by the constraint that
   head groups are covalently bound to the substrate. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{Exergy \& economic analysis of biogas fueled solid oxide fuel cell
   systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{272}},
Pages = {{386-397}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{We present an exergy and an economic analysis of a power plant that uses
   biogas produced from a thermophilic anaerobic digester (AD) to fuel a
   solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). We performed a 4-variable parametric
   analysis of the AD-SOFC system in order to determine the optimal design
   operation conditions, depending on the objective function of interest.
   We present results on the exergy efficiency (\%), power normalized
   capital cost (\$ kW(-1)), and the internal rate of return on investment,
   IRR, (\% yr(-1)) as a function of the current density, the stack
   pressure, the fuel utilization, and the total air stoichiometric ratio.
   To the authors' knowledge, this is the first AD-SOFC paper to include
   the cost of the AD when conducting economic optimization of the AD-SOFC
   plant. Our calculations show that adding a new AD-SOFC system to an
   existing waste water treatment (WWT) plant could yield positives values
   of IRR at today's average electricity prices and could significantly
   out-compete other options for using biogas to generate electricity.
   AD-SOFC systems could likely convert WWT plants into net generators of
   electricity rather than net consumers of electricity while generating
   economically viable rates of return on investment if the costs of SOFC
   systems are within a factor of two of the DOE/SECA cost targets.

Abstract = {{Molecular biomarkers are changes measured in biological samples that
   reflect disease states. Such markers can help clinicians identify types
   of cancer or stages of progression, and they can guide in tailoring
   specific therapies. Many efforts to identify biomarkers consider genes
   that mutate between normal and cancerous tissues or changes in protein
   or RNA expression levels. Here we define location biomarkers, proteins
   that undergo changes in subcellular location that are indicative of
   disease. To discover such biomarkers, we have developed an automated
   pipeline to compare the subcellular location of proteins between two
   sets of immunohistochemistry images. We used the pipeline to compare
   images of healthy and tumor tissue from the Human Protein Atlas, ranking
   hundreds of proteins in breast, liver, prostate, and bladder based on
   how much their location was estimated to have changed. The performance
   of the system was evaluated by determining whether proteins previously
   known to change location in tumors were ranked highly. We present a
   number of candidate location biomarkers for each tissue, and identify
   biochemical pathways that are enriched in proteins that change location.
   The analysis technology is anticipated to be useful not only for
   discovering new location biomarkers but also for enabling automated
   analysis of biomarker distributions as an aid to determining diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Demands to increase the stored energy density of electrostatic
   capacitors have spurred the development of materials with enhanced
   dielectric breakdown, improved permittivity, and reduced dielectric
   loss. Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), consisting of a blend of amorphous
   polymer and dielectric nanofillers, have been studied intensely to
   satisfy these goals; however, nanoparticle aggregates, field
   localization due to dielectric mismatch between particle and matrix, and
   the poorly understood role of interface compatibilization have
   challenged progress. To expand the understanding of the inter-relation
   between these factors and, thus, enable rational optimization of low and
   high contrast PNC dielectrics, we compare the dielectric performance of
   matrix-free hairy nanoparticle assemblies (aHNPs) to blended PNCs in the
   regime of low dielectric contrast to establish how morphology and
   interface impact energy storage and breakdown across different polymer
   matrices (polystyrene, PS, and poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and
   nanoparticle loadings (0-50\% (v/v) silica). The findings indicate that
   the route (aHNP versus blending) to well-dispersed morphology has, at
   most, a minor impact on breakdown strength trends with nanoparticle
   volume fraction; the only exception being at intermediate loadings of
   silica in PMMA (15\% (v/v)). Conversely, aHNPs show substantial
   improvements in reducing dielectric loss and maintaining
   charge/discharge efficiency. For example, low-frequency dielectric loss
   (1 Hz-1 kHz) of PS and PMMA aHNP films was essentially unchanged up to a
   silica content of 50\% (v/v), whereas traditional blends showed a
   monotonically increasing loss with silica loading. Similar benefits are
   seen via high-field polarization loop measurements where energy storage
   for similar to 15\% (v/v) silica loaded PMMA and PS aHNPs were 50\% and
   200\% greater than respective comparable PNC blends. Overall, these
   findings on low dielectric contrast PNCs clearly point to the
   performance benefits of functionalizing the nanoparticle surface with
   high-molecular-weight polymers for polymer nanostructured dielectrics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{We compute the effective dispersion and vibrational density of states
   (DOS) of two-dimensional subregions of three-dimensional
   face-centered-cubic crystals using both a direct projection-inversion
   technique and a Monte Carlo simulation based on a common underlying
   Hamiltonian. We study both a (111) and (100) plane. We show that for any
   given direction of wave vector, both (111) and (100) show an anomalous
   omega(2) similar to q regime at low q where omega(2) is the energy
   associated with the given mode and q is its wave number. The omega(2)
   similar to q scaling should be expected to give rise to an anomalous
   DOS, D-omega, at low omega: D-omega similar to omega(3) rather than the
   conventional Debye result: D-omega similar to omega(2). The DOS for
   (100) looks to be consistent with D-omega similar to omega(3), while
   (111) shows something closer to the conventional Debye result at the
   smallest frequencies. In addition to the direct projection-inversion
   calculation, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to study the effects of
   finite sampling statistics. We show that finite sampling artifacts act
   as an effective disorder and bias D-omega, giving a behavior closer to
   D-omega similar to omega(2) than D-omega similar to omega(3). These
   results should have an important impact on the interpretation of recent

Abstract = {{The federal government has the goal of decreasing commercial building
   energy consumption and pollutant emissions by incentivizing the adoption
   of commercial building energy codes. Quantitative estimates of code
   benefits at the state level that can inform the size and allocation of
   these incentives are not available. We estimate the state-level climate,
   environmental, and health benefits (i.e., social benefits) and
   reductions in energy bills (private benefits) of a more stringent code
   (ASHRAE 90.1-2010) relative to a baseline code (ASHRAE 90.1-2007). We
   find that reductions in site energy use intensity range from 93 MJ/m(2)
   of new construction per year (California) to 270 MJ/m(2) of new
   construction per year (North Dakota). Total annual benefits from more
   stringent codes total \$506 million for all states, where \$372 million
   are from reductions in energy bills, and \$134 million are from social
   benefits. These total benefits range from \$0.6 million in Wyoming to
   \$49 million in Texas. Private benefits range from \$0.38 per square
   meter in Washington State to \$1.06 per square meter in New Hampshire.
   Social benefits range from \$0.2 per square meter annually in California
   to \$2.5 per square meter in Ohio. Reductions in human/environmental
   damages and future climate damages account for nearly equal shares of
   social benefits.}},

   Nonlinear theory, optimization, and linearized scaling law}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Using principles of damped harmonic oscillation with continuous media,
   we examine electrostatic energy harvesting with a ``soft-matter{''}
   array of dielectric elastomer (DE) transducers. The array is composed of
   infinitely thin and deformable electrodes separated by layers of
   insulating elastomer. During vibration, it deforms longitudinally,
   resulting in a change in the capacitance and electrical enthalpy of the
   charged electrodes. Depending on the phase of electrostatic loading, the
   DE array can function as either an actuator that amplifies small
   vibrations or a generator that converts these external excitations into
   electrical power. Both cases are addressed with a comprehensive theory
   that accounts for the influence of viscoelasticity, dielectric
   breakdown, and electromechanical coupling induced by Maxwell stress. In
   the case of a linearized Kelvin-Voigt model of the dielectric, we obtain
   a closed-form estimate for the electrical power output and a scaling law
   for DE generator design. For the complete nonlinear model, we obtain the
   optimal electrostatic voltage input for maximum electrical power output.

Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{108-114}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we optimize a process that integrates the use of glycerol
   to produce ethanol via fermentation within the simultaneous production
   of biodiesel and bioethanol from algae. The process consists of growing
   the algae, determining the optimal fraction of oil vs. starch, followed
   by oil extraction, starch liquefaction and saccharification, to sugars,
   oil transesterification, for which we consider two transesterification
   technologies (enzymes and alkali) and the fermentation of sugars and
   glycerol. The advantage of this process is that the dehydration
   technologies are common for the products of the glucose and glycerol
   fermentation. Simultaneous optimization and heat integration is
   performed using Duran and Grossmann's model. The fermentation of
   glycerol to ethanol increases the production of bioethanol by at least
   50\%. The energy and water consumptions are competitive with other
   processes that either sell the glycerol or use it to obtain methanol.
   However, the price for the biofuels is only competitive if glycerol
   cannot be sold to the market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{470-480}},

Abstract = {{Direct valuation of air quality has as a drawback; that estimated
   willingness to pay figures cannot be apportioned to the several
   environmental goods affected by air quality, such as mortality and
   morbidity effects, visibility, outdoor recreation, among others. To
   address this issue, we implemented a survey in Santiago de Chile to
   identify component values of confounded environmental services by means
   of a choice experiment. We designed a survey where two environmental
   goods, a morbidity health endpoint and improved visibility, had to be
   jointly traded off against each other and against money in a unified
   framework.
   The health endpoint is a respiratory illness that results in an
   emergency room visit with a probability of hospitalization being
   required for appropriate treatment. Visibility is described as an
   aesthetic effect related to the number of days per year of high
   visibility.
   Modeling comprises both a logit model with covariates and a mixed-logit
   model. The results suggest that the health endpoint midpoint value is in
   a range from USD 2,800 to USD 13,000, mainly depending on the model and
   age stratum. The mid point value of an extra day of high visibility per
   year ranges from USD 281,000 to USD 379,000. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Systematic prediction of the redox reaction energetics of large sets of
   3d transition metal oxides is imperative to the selection of oxygen
   carrier candidates in applications ranging from chemical looping to
   solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode design. In particular, the
   energetic study of oxygen vacancy formation in unmixed perovskites with
   La, alkali, and alkaline A-site metal cationsas well as 3d transition
   metal B-site cationsis a crucial first step in understanding the
   energetic tunability afforded by cation doping in ABO(3) materials. An
   assessment of the relative oxygen vacancy formation energetics of LaBO3,
   SrBO3, and similar materials that serve as a guideline for predicting
   energetics in related systems is completed below using density
   functional theory (DFT). This assessment illustrates which
   simplifications can be made in the prediction of energetics trends
   without affecting trend order. The independent consideration of oxygen
   vacancy concentration, crystal structure, and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
   magnetism revealed that these factors in DFT calculations had no effect
   on trend order. However, the ferromagnetic (FM) SrBO3 trend order was
   affected between SrMnO3 and SrFeO3 as a function of defect
   concentration. Moreover, energetic trends were also formed by adding
   constant, incremental values of the Hubbard U parameter contributing to
   the 3d orbitals of perovskite B-sites. Calculation of U parameters was
   done by linear response theory or by a literature review of previous
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The role of polymeric ligands on the optical transparency of
   polymermatrix composites is analyzed by evaluating the effect of surface
   modification on the scattering cross-section of particle fillers in
   uniform particle dispersions. For the particular case of
   poly(styrene-r-acrylonitrile)-grafted silica particles embedded in
   poly(methyl methacrylate), it is shown that the tethering of polymeric
   chains with appropriate optical properties (such as to match the
   effective refractive index of the brush particle to the embedding
   matrix) facilitates the reduction of the particle scattering
   cross-section by several orders of magnitude as compared to pristine
   particle analogues. The conditions for minimizing the scattering
   cross-section of particle fillers by polymer-graft modification are
   established on the basis of effective medium as well as core-shell Mie
   theory and validated against experimental data on uniform liquid and
   solid particle dispersions. Effective medium theory is demonstrated to
   provide robust estimates of the optimum polymer-graft composition to
   minimize the scattering cross-section of particle fillers even in the
   limit of large particle dimensions (comparable to the wavelength of
   light). The application of polymer-graft modification to the design of
   large (500 nm diameter) silica particle composites with reduced
   scattering cross-section is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The strain-dependent phonon properties and thermal conductivities of a
   soft system {[}Lennard-Jones (LJ) argon] and a stiff system (silicon
   modeled using first-principles calculations) are predicted using lattice
   dynamics calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation. As is
   commonly assumed for materials under isotropic strain, the thermal
   conductivity of LJ argon decreases monotonically as the system moves
   from compression into tension. The reduction in thermal conductivity is
   attributed to decreases in both the phonon lifetimes and group
   velocities. The thermal conductivity of silicon, however, is constant in
   compression and only begins to decrease once the system is put in
   tension. The silicon lifetimes show an anomalous behavior, whereby they
   increase as the system moves from compression into tension, which is
   explained by examining the potential energy surface felt by an atom. The
   results emphasize the need to separately consider the harmonic and
   anharmonic effects of strain on material stiffness, phonon properties,
   and thermal conductivity.}},

   work in non-amputee walking}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with unilateral below-knee amputation expend more energy
   than non-amputees during walking and exhibit reduced push-off work and
   increased hip work in the affected limb. Simple dynamic models of
   walking suggest a possible solution, predicting that increasing
   prosthetic ankle push-off should decrease leading limb collision,
   thereby reducing overall energy requirements. We conducted a rigorous
   experimental test of this idea wherein ankle-foot prosthesis push-off
   work was incrementally varied in isolation from one-half to two-times
   normal levels while subjects with simulated amputation walked on a
   treadmill at 1.25 m.s(-1). Increased prosthesis push-off significantly
   reduced metabolic energy expenditure, with a 14\% reduction at maximum
   prosthesis work. In contrast to model predictions, however, collision
   losses were unchanged, while hip work during swing initiation was
   decreased. This suggests that powered ankle push-off reduces walking
   effort primarily through other mechanisms, such as assisting leg swing,
   which would be better understood using more complete neuromuscular
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of ammonia on the partitioning of two dicarboxylic acids,

   differential mobility analysis system and a thermodenuder (TD-TDMA)
   system are used to estimate the saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy

   lowered the vapor pressure of oxalic acid, by several orders of
   magnitude, with an estimated vapor pressure of 1.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(-6) Pa
   at 298 K. The vapor pressure of ammonium adipate was 2.5 +/- 0.8 x
   10(-5) Pa at 298 K, similar to that of adipic acid. These results
   suggest that the dominance of oxalate in diacid concentrations measured
   in ambient aerosol could be attributed to the salt formation with

Abstract = {{Rigidity sensing and durotaxis are thought to be important elements in
   wound healing, tissue formation, and cancer treatment. It has been
   challenging, however, to study the underlying mechanism due to
   difficulties in capturing cells during the transient response to a
   rigidity interface. We have addressed this problem by developing a model
   experimental system that confines cells to a micropatterned area with a
   rigidity border. The system consists of a rigid domain of one large
   adhesive island, adjacent to a soft domain of small adhesive islands
   grafted on a nonadhesive soft gel. This configuration allowed us to test
   rigidity sensing away from the cell body during probing and spreading.
   NIH 3T3 cells responded to the micropatterned rigidity border similarly
   to cells at a conventional rigidity border, by showing a strong
   preference for staying on the rigid side. Furthermore, cells used
   filopodia extensions to probe substrate rigidity at a distance in front
   of the leading edge and regulated their responses based on the strain of
   the intervening substrate. Soft substrates inhibited focal adhesion
   maturation and promoted cell retraction, whereas rigid substrates
   allowed stable adhesions and cell spreading. Myosin II was required for
   not only the generation of probing forces but also the retraction in
   response to soft substrates. We suggest that a myosin II-driven,
   filopodia-based probing mechanism ahead of the leading edge allows cells
   to migrate efficiently, by sensing physical characteristics before
   moving over a substrate to avoid backtracking.}},

Abstract = {{Microorganisms can cause detrimental effects in shale gas production,
   such as reservoir souring, plugging, equipment corrosion, and a decrease
   in hydrocarbon production volume and quality, thus representing a
   multi-billion-dollar problem. Prefracturing fluids, drilling mud, and
   impoundment water likely introduce deleterious microorganisms into shale
   gas reservoirs. Conditions within the reservoir generally select for
   halotolerant anaerobic microorganisms. Microbial abundance and diversity
   in flowback waters decrease shortly after hydraulic fracturing, with
   Clostridia, a class that includes spore-forming microorganisms, becoming
   dominant. The rapid microbial community successions observed suggest
   biocides are not fully effective, and more targeted treatment strategies
   are needed. At the impoundment level, microbial control strategies
   should consider biocide rotation, seasonal loading adjustments, and
   biocide pulse dosing. In shale plays where souring is common, stable
   S-34/S-32 isotope analysis to identify abiotic H2S is recommended to
   evaluate the merits of biocide application in treating reservoir
   souring. Overall, an improved understanding of the microbial ecology of
   shale gas reservoirs is needed to optimize microbial control, maximize
   well productivity, and reduce environmental and financial burdens
   associated with the ad hoc misuse and overuse of biocides.}},

Abstract = {{Geological carbon storage is likely to be part of a comprehensive
   strategy to minimize the atmospheric release of carbon dioxide (CO2),
   raising concerns that injected CO2 will leak into overlying freshwater
   aquifers. While a high concentration of CO2 is toxic to bacteria and
   causes large community changes, little is known about how exposure to
   low concentrations of CO2 may impact bacterial communities in aquifers.
   Microbial communities in aquifers provide important functionality
   through carbon and nutrient cycling in aquifer and connected aqueous
   ecosystems. The impact of in situ CO2(aq) it exposure on the microbial
   community in a freshwater aquifer was examined. CO2(aq) was introduced
   into the formation to simulate leakage from a geologic carbon storage
   unit. On the basis of the 16S rRNA genes recovered from subsurface
   samples, the population numbers were unaffected by CO2(aq) up to 1.53 g
   of CO2(aq)/L, but diversity decreased with an increased CO2(aq)

Title = {{Dynamic optimization based integrated operation strategy design for
   passive cooling ventilation and active building air conditioning}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{126-135}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As one form of passive cooling, night ventilation (NV) has been proven
   effective to improve the building energy performance. In previous
   studies, however, fixed NV operating strategies were usually
   pre-defined, ignoring the weather condition variations over the whole
   operation process, the influence of outdoor humidity on NV's efficiency,
   and NV's integrated performance with active air conditioning systems.
   Such strategies may have potentials for further improvements. This paper
   presents a systematic approach to address the dynamic optimization of
   integrated operation of NV and active building air conditioning using
   typical variable-air-volume (VAV) systems as the case. In the
   optimization scheme, the physical model is developed per differential
   algebraic equations (DAEs). The simultaneous collocation method is
   introduced to translate the dynamic optimization into a nonlinear
   program, which is then implemented in the GAMS platform and handled by
   IPOPT solver. The study results indicate that the optimized strategies
   lead to a remarkable energy saving of 23.19-49.31\% in different climate
   conditions compared to the traditional local control scheme without NV,
   and a saving of 14.97-39.70\% compared to that with pre-defined NV.

Abstract = {{Miniature devices voyaging inside the human body for diagnostic and drug
   delivery purposes is no longer a wild dream. At the very heart of such
   an endeavor lies the capability of miniature devices like synthetic
   cells and microrobots to achieve complex tasks collectively by
   exchanging information molecules. Towards this end, we model the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of the molecular transport process in complex
   extracellular spaces (ECSs) such that the signaling delay can be
   accurately predicted. More precisely, we use parameters like ECS volume
   fraction, tortuosity, and cross-section area of diffusion paths to
   capture the physicochemical features of the ECS. Based on these
   parameters, we propose a new algorithm to calculate the directional
   diffusion coefficient, which is then used in an effective diffusion
   equation to describe the molecular transport process across the region
   of interest. Our modeling results show good agreement with detailed 3D
   simulations in complex ECSs, while the classical diffusion and previous
   approaches fail to capture the heterogeneity and directionality of the
   transport process. Consequently, the proposed approach represents a
   major step towards characterizing the interaction of cooperative
   miniature devices that can achieve complex tasks via diffusion-based
   molecular communication.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication has been considered an emerging technology for
   both scientific and engineering interests, due to molecular biology and
   the need for nano-scale communication and computation systems. Molecular
   communication systems are widely analogue to electrical communication
   systems involving emitting molecules, diffused propagation of molecules,
   and reception of molecules, under stochastic characteristics of
   relatively slow propagation speed and short transmission range. To
   facilitate large-scale molecular information systems for the purpose of
   communication and computation, state-of-the-art explorations are
   generally assumed perfect alignment of timing among molecular devices
   and sub-systems. To reach synchronous condition in electronics, phase
   locked loop (PLL) is known to align timing or phase of waveforms. We
   extend PLL into molecular PLL (MPLL) consisting of basic elements such
   as molecular phase detector, molecular loop filter, and molecular
   voltage controlled oscillator. Due to stochastic nature of molecular
   diffusion, we further analyze MPLL in terms of the diffusion jitter,
   displacement, and the (particle or molecular) counting noise.
   Simulations verify the MPLL concept model, tracking performance, and
   robustness in operation.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the effect of peer influence in the diffusion of
   the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled from a large
   dataset provided by a major European Mobile carrier in one country. We
   identify tight communities of users in which peer influence may play a
   role and use instrumental variables to control for potential correlation
   between unobserved subscriber heterogeneity and friends' adoption. We
   provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to adopt increases
   with the percentage of friends who have already adopted. During a period
   of 11 months, we estimate that 14 percent of iPhone 3Gs sold by this
   carrier were due to peer influence. This result is obtained after
   controlling for social clustering, gender, previous adoption of mobile
   Internet data plans, ownership of technologically advanced handsets, and
   heterogeneity in the regions where subscribers move during the day and
   spend most of their evenings. This result remains qualitatively
   unchanged when we control for changes over time in the structure of the
   social network. We provide results from several policy experiments
   showing that, with this level of effect of peer influence, the carrier
   would have hardly benefitted from using traditional marketing strategies
   to seed the iPhone 3G to benefit from viral marketing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe a ``new natural history{''} of multiple sclerosis
   (MS), characterizing three patterns of progression in Relapsing MS (RMS)
   patients during the ``treatment era,{''} using newly developed
   definitions. By utilizing our simple model we intend to predict which
   patients are most likely to reach an EDSS of 6.0.
   Methods: We stratified MS progression into three distinct patterns:
   aggressive MS (AMS), intermediate MS (IMS) and mild MS (MMS), based on
   Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score rate of change. These
   groups were compared for progression of EDSS before and after reaching
   these definitions.
   Results: The three groups remained significantly different in terms of
   disability throughout their disease courses p <= 0.001; 98\% of the
   patients used disease modifying treatments (DMTs).AMS patients represent
   a significantly more disabling and aggressive form of MS than the IMS
   group.
   Conclusions: Transition from relatively mild MS to aggressive course may
   begin at any time in the first 15 years, despite DMTs. Our definition
   for AMS is unique and identifies a group of patients who become
   permanently disabled within two years after a variable amount of time in
   a benign phase, despite treatment with modern DMTs. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new optimization model and solution approach for
   the investment and operations planning of offshore oil and gas field
   infrastructure. As compared to the conventional models where either
   fiscal rules or uncertainty in the field parameters is considered, the
   proposed model is the first one in the literature that includes both of
   these complexities in an efficient manner. In particular, a tighter
   formulation for the production sharing agreements based on our recent
   work, and a perfect positive or negative correlation among the
   endogenous uncertain parameters (field size, oil deliverability,
   water-oil ratio and gas-oil ratio) is considered to reduce the total
   number of scenarios in the resulting multistage stochastic formulation.
   To solve the large instances of the problem, a Lagrangean decomposition
   approach allowing parallel solution of the scenario subproblems is
   implemented in the GAMS grid computing environment. Computational
   results on a variety of oilfield development planning examples are
   presented to illustrate the efficiency of the model and the proposed
   solution approach. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An ability to solve complex problems, for which a variety of solution
   paths are possible, is an important goal in engineering education. While
   feedback is critical to learning, hand grading of homework rarely
   provides effective, timely feedback on attempts to solve complex
   problems. Such feedback is also unfeasible in distance education
   contexts. A technology, based on the approach of cognitive tutors, is
   presented as a generally applicable method of providing automated
   feedback on complex problem solving, with truss problems studied in
   engineering as an example. The tutor maintains a cognitive model of
   problem solving for this class of problems, and associates various
   solution steps with distinct skills or knowledge components. One can
   determine whether students learn individual skills by measuring the
   error rate as a function of practice. Prior work has shown that for many
   skills the error rate indeed decreases with practice. New insight into
   the tutor's effectiveness, pertaining to the efficiency of student
   solution paths, is presented in this paper. While no explicit feedback
   is given regarding solution efficiency, it is found that students using
   the tutor become more efficient with practice. Furthermore, more
   efficient paths are found to be associated with making fewer errors. (C)

Abstract = {{It has recently been shown that a three-parameter Weibull function with
   a large threshold strength of approximate to 2GPa is needed to
   accurately describe the failure strength statistics of micromachined
   polycrystalline silicon samples. Here, we explore how to apply this
   function to predict strength size effects over a size range of 100. A
   two-parameter function is unsatisfactory in predicting the size effect.
   If a three-parameter Weibull fit to only the largest specimen is used,
   the prediction also does not satisfactorily agree with strength data in
   smaller specimens. The prediction is greatly improved if the two largest
   specimens, a factor of 10 different in size, are used for fitting. It is
   further demonstrated that the threshold strength depends on geometry in
   notched samples due to their large stress gradients.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a metastability immune warning flip-flop (FF) is
   proposed, which consists of an edge detector, a warning window
   generator, and a warning detector along with a traditional FF. The
   delayed data are monitored during the warning window to flag a warning
   signal before the data enter the erroneous zone. In this scheme, the
   warning window is independent of input clock frequency and hence is
   suitable for frequency scaling application. A 16-bit Kogge-stone adder
   is implemented in 65-nm technology, which uses warning FF for dynamic
   voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The warning FF-based DVFS allows
   elimination of safety margins and operates till the point of first
   warning of the adder without any erroneous results. The experiments were
   conducted with different supply voltages, phase-shifted clocks, and
   process conditions. The circuit is helpful to determine when to stop
   further reduction in supply voltage by producing the warning signal with
   predefined timing slacks in DVFS application. The test chip results
   demonstrate that the proposed circuit can track the critical path delay
   of 2.4-7.5 ns at warning voltage of 1.15-0.72 V, respectively. The
   measured results from 10 different chips show the effectiveness of the
   proposed concept across process variation.}},

Abstract = {{Pipelines are responsible for the transportation of a significant
   portion of the U.S. energy supply. Unfortunately, pipeline failures are
   common and the consequences can be catastrophic. Drawing on data from
   the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) that
   covers approximately 40,000 incidents from 1968 to 2009, this paper
   explores the trends, causes and consequences of natural gas and
   hazardous liquid pipeline accidents. The analysis indicates that
   fatalities and injuries from pipeline accidents are generally decreasing
   over time, while property damage and, in some cases, the numbers of
   incidents are increasing over time In five of the ten cases considered
   in this paper, the damage from pipeline accidents - in terms of
   injuries, fatalities and volume of product spilled - are well
   characterized by a power-law distribution, indicating that catastrophic
   pipeline accidents are more likely than would be predicted by more
   common ``thin-tailed{''} distributions. The results also indicate that
   relatively few accidents account for a large share of total property
   damage, while smaller, single-fatality and single-injury incidents
   account for a large share of total fatalities and injuries (43\% versus
   32\%, respectively). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new class of laterally vibrating resonators (LVRs)
   based on Y-cut ion-sliced lithium niobate (LN) thin films on silicon
   dioxide (SiO2). The SiO2 layer is used to engineer the temperature
   coefficient of frequency (TCF) of the LN resonator. The LN LVR is built
   on top of a SiO2 layer and released from the underlying silicon wafer by
   dry etching in Xenon difluoride (XeF2). For a given sample having an LN
   layer thickness of 420 nm and SiO2 thickness of 1600 nm, this paper
   demonstrated resonators with TCF of +17 ppm/degrees C, and +18
   ppm/degrees C for devices vibrating at 460 and 420 MHz, and,
   respectively, oriented at 10 degrees and 30 degrees to the x-axis. TCF
   of +24.1 ppm/degrees C and +27.7 ppm/degrees C were recorded for devices
   vibrating at 720 MHz, respectively, oriented at 40 degrees and 50
   degrees to the x-axis. These results correspond to a 4-5 X reduction in
   the TCF of standalone LN resonators. The positive TCF clearly indicates
   the effect of the SiO2 layer, and its value matches with what is
   predicted analytically by finite element method simulations and
   nonlinear analysis of the resonator amplitude-frequency response. This
   demonstration offers evidence that TCF engineering of LN LVRs is
   possible. Most importantly, these LN LVRs still exhibited high values of
   electromechanical coupling, k2t, around 9\% at 723.7 MHz, and Q in
   excess of 1320 in air at 419.3 MHz. By optimizing the relative values of
   the LN and SiO2 thickness, it is ultimately possible to attain devices
   with zero first order TCF.}},

Abstract = {{Climate stabilization efforts must integrate the actions of many
   socio-economic sectors to be successful in meeting climate stabilization
   goals, such as limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration
   to be less than double the pre-industrial levels. Estimates of the costs
   and benefits of stabilization policies are often informed by Integrated
   Assessment Models (IAMs) of the climate and the economy. These IAMs are
   highly non-linear with many parameters that abstract globally integrated
   characteristics of environmental and socio-economic systems. Diagnostic
   analyses of IAMs can aid in identifying the interdependencies and
   parametric controls of modeled stabilization policies. Here we report a
   comprehensive variance-based sensitivity analysis of a doubled-CO2
   stabilization policy scenario generated by the globally-aggregated
   Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE). We find that
   neglecting uncertainties considerably underestimates damage and
   mitigation costs associated with a doubled-CO2 stabilization goal. More
   than ninety percent of the states-of-the-world (SOWs) sampled in our
   analysis exceed the damages and abatement costs calculated for the
   reference case neglecting uncertainties (1.2 trillion 2005 USD, with
   worst case costs exceeding \$60 trillion). We attribute the variance in
   these costs to uncertainties in the model parameters relating to climate
   sensitivity, global participation in abatement, and the cost of lower
   emission energy sources.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is diagnosed in 70,000
   Americans annually. Chemotherapy was the standard course of treatment
   until the addition of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug, rituximab, to
   therapy regimens in 1997. Although disease prognosis has improved
   dramatically since that time, nearly 20,000 patients succumb annually to
   the disease, with an average life expectancy beyond diagnosis of only 12
   years. The advent of nanomedicine may fulfill the remaining need for
   novel therapy capable of eradicating solid tumor and disseminated B-cell
   lymphomas.
   Areas covered: This review details the current landscape of B-cell NHL
   and nanoparticles now being developed for its treatment. Specifically,
   we discuss lipid, polymer and metal nanoparticles that deliver an array
   of drugs, including toxins, chemotherapeutic agents and nucleic acids.
   Expert opinion: Because B-cell malignancies have responded quite well to
   new components in multi-drug regimens, nanomedicines that are
   mechanistically distinct from existing therapies hold significant
   promise. In our opinion, advancement of these technologies into the
   clinic will likely require significantly more effective targeting
   systems coupled with a better understanding of lymphoma biology.
   Furthermore, it is important for researchers to recognize the genetic
   and phenotypic heterogeneity of NHL and to develop therapeutic
   strategies for distinct subsets of NHL before attempting to generalize
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews signal processing research for applications in the
   future electric power grid, commonly referred to as smart grid.
   Generally, it is expected that the grid of the future would differ from
   the current system by the increased integration of distributed
   generation, distributed storage, demand response, power electronics, and
   communications and sensing technologies. The consequence is that the
   physical structure of the system becomes significantly more distributed.
   The existing centralized control structure is not suitable any more to
   operate such a highly distributed system. Hence, in this paper, we
   overview distributed approaches, all based on consensus+innovations, for
   three common energy management functions: state estimation, economic
   dispatch, and optimal power flow. We survey the pertinent literature and
   summarize our work. Simulation results illustrate tradeoffs and the
   performance of consensus+innovations for these three applications.}},

Abstract = {{A 20 GS/s 6b time-interleaved ADC is implemented in 32 nm CMOS SOI with
   an embedded time-to-digital converter to sense timing skew, and the
   randomness of process mismatch is exploited to compensate for the clock
   misalignment and dynamic offset errors of comparators that occur during
   high-speed operation. To achieve low-power consumption at high-speed
   operation with small-size transistors, a low-complexity on-chip
   calibration reduces gain, offset, and delay mismatches in background.
   With the timing skew calibration, the spurs due to clock misalignment
   are reduced by 20 dB. The proposed ADC achieves an SNDR of 30.7 dB at
   Nyquist frequency and consumes only 69.5 mW with a figure-of-merit of
   124 J/conv-step.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are heterogeneous, because they tightly
   couple computation, communication, and control along with physical
   dynamics, which are traditionally considered separately. Without a
   comprehensive modeling formalism, model-based development of CPS
   involves using a multitude of models in a variety of formalisms that
   capture various aspects of the system design, such as software design,
   networking design, physical models, and protocol design. Without a
   rigorous unifying framework, system integration and integration of the
   analysis results for various models remains ad hoc. In this paper, we
   propose a multi-view architecture framework that treats models as views
   of the underlying system structure and uses structural and semantic
   mappings to ensure consistency and enable system-level verification in a
   hierarchical and compositional manner. Throughout the paper, the
   theoretical concepts are illustrated using two examples: a quadrotor and
   an automotive intersection collision avoidance system.}},

Abstract = {{We propose new game theoretic approaches to estimate a binary random
   variable based on sensor measurements that may have been corrupted by a
   cyber-attacker. The estimation problem is formulated as a zero-sum
   partial information game in which a detector attempts to minimize the
   probability of an estimation error and an attacker attempts to maximize
   this probability. While this problem can be solved exactly by reducing
   it to the computation of the value of a matrix, this approach is
   computationally feasible only for a small number of sensors. The two key
   results of this paper provide complementary computationally efficient
   solutions to the construction of the optimal detector. The first result
   provides an explicit formula for the optimal detector but it is only
   valid when the number of sensors is roughly smaller than two over the
   probability of sensor errors. In contrast, the detector provided by the
   second result is valid for an arbitrary number of sensor. While it may
   result in a probability of estimation error that is is an element of
   above the minimum achievable, we show that this error is an element of
   is small when the number of sensors is large, which is precisely the
   case for which the first result does not apply.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop the Contoured Robust Controller Bode (CRCBode)
   plot and demonstrate its use in the design of robust controllers for
   nonlinear single-input single-output (SISO) systems. The CRCBode plot
   shows contours (level sets) of a robust performance quantity on the Bode
   magnitude and phase plots of the controller. An iterative frequency
   domain loop-shaping design approach is employed to eliminate all
   intersections of the controller frequency response with certain
   forbidden regions,' indicating that a standard SISO robust stability and
   performance criterion is satisfied. Nonlinearities are accounted for by
   avoiding the maximum forbidden regions over a structured uncertainty set
   consisting of linearizations of the system dynamics about several
   operating points. We demonstrate this technique by designing and
   experimentally verifying a flow-rate controller for a butterfly-valve
   based liquid cooling system, which is robust to valve nonlinearities and
   flow disturbances. Finally, we compare this compensator with one
   generated using an automated H synthesis algorithm and discuss the
   advantages of the CRCBode approach. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This study compares the cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs),
   energy use, water use, and potential environmental toxicity of
   conventional (Conv), glass powder (GP), and alkali-activated slag (AAS)
   concrete and mortar. The comparison is based on 1 m(3) of
   concrete/mortar with similar 28-day compressive strength, so the same
   concrete/mortar member with same dimensions may be manufactured from
   Conv, GP, or AAS materials and used for same applications. The result
   shows that compared to a 35-MPa Conv concrete, a 35-MPa GP concrete has,
   on average, 19\% lower GHGs, 17\% less energy, 14\% less water, and
   14-21\% lower environmental toxicity. A 35-MPa AAS concrete has 73\%
   lower GHGs, 43\% less energy, 25\% less water, and 22-94\% lower effects
   for all environmental toxicity categories except an 72\% higher
   ecotoxicity effect. Environmental impact reductions are also found for
   using GP as a cement replacement in concrete with lower strengths and
   replacing cement with GP or AAS in mortars with different strengths. The
   paper concludes that using alternative cementitious materials GP and AAS
   as cement replacements could significantly reduce the environmental
   impacts of cement-based products. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Strong branching is an effective branching technique that can
   significantly reduce the size of the branch-and-bound tree for solving
   mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. The focus of this
   paper is to demonstrate how to effectively use ``discarded{''}
   information from strong branching to strengthen relaxations of MINLP
   problems. Valid inequalities such as branching-based linearizations,
   various forms of disjunctive inequalities, and mixing-type inequalities
   are all discussed. The inequalities span a spectrum from those that
   require almost no extra effort to compute to those that require the
   solution of an additional linear program. In the end, we perform an
   extensive computational study to measure the impact of each of our
   proposed techniques. Computational results reveal that existing
   algorithms can be significantly improved by leveraging the information
   generated as a byproduct of strong branching in the form of valid
   inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{In the previous work, meta-attributes have been used to model the
   relationship between two groups of disparate product attributes. There,
   preference for form, function, and the relationship between the two were
   modeled for individual consumers. However, this approach is limited as
   designers are often called on to choose a design that best appeals to a
   group of consumers, not individuals. This work expands on the concept
   and makes it more generally applicable by adapting metaconjoint to model
   aggregate choice for consumer groups. The results from this work show
   that a metaconjoint approach can be used to model aggregate choice for
   form and function and can yield better results on holdout sample
   predictions than form or function alone.}},

Abstract = {{When high Al containing Fe alloys such as TRIP steels are exposed to
   atmospheres that contain N-2 during re-heating, sub-surface nitrides
   form and these can be detrimental to mechanical properties. Nitride
   precipitation can be controlled by minimizing the access of the gaseous
   atmosphere to the metal surface, which can be achieved by a rapid growth
   of a continuous and adherent surface scale. This investigation utilizes
   a Au-image furnace attached to a confocal scanning microscope to
   simulate the annealing temperature vs time while Fe-Al alloys (with Al
   contents varying from 1 to 8 wt pct) are exposed to a O-2-N-2 atm with
   10(-6) atm O-2. The heating times of 1, 10, and 100 minutes to the
   isothermal temperature of 1558 K (1285 A degrees C) were used. It was
   found that fewer sub-surface nitride precipitates formed when the
   heating time was lowered and when Al content in the samples was
   increased. In the 8 wt pct samples, no internal nitride precipitates
   were present regardless of heating time. In the 3 and 5 wt pct samples,
   internal nitride precipitates were nearly more or less absent at heating
   times less than 10 minutes. The decrease in internal precipitates was
   governed by the evolving structure of the external oxide-scale. At low
   heating rates and/or low Al contents, significant Fe-oxide patches
   formed and these appeared to allow for ingress of gaseous N-2. For the
   slow heating rates, ingress could have happened during the longer time
   spent in lower temperatures where non-protective alumina was present. As
   Al content in the alloy was increased, the external scale was Al2O3
   and/or FeAl2O4 and more continuous and consequently hindered the N-2
   from accessing the metal surface. Increasing the Al content in the alloy
   had the effect of promoting the outward diffusion of Al in the alloy and
   thereby assisting the formation of the continuous external layer of
   Al2O3 and/or FeAl2O4.}},

Abstract = {{Many recent designs of soft robots and nano-robots feature locomotion

   mechanisms have many features in common with peristaltic locomotion
   found in the animal world. The purpose of the present paper is to
   examine the energy efficiency of a locomotion mechanism that exploits
   friction. With the help of a model that captures most of the salient
   features of locomotion, we show how locomotion featuring stick-slip
   friction is more efficient than a counterpart that only features
   slipping. Our analysis also provides a framework to establish how
   optimal locomotion mechanisms can be selected.}},

Abstract = {{During metastasis, melanoma cells must be sufficiently deformable to

   the nucleus with recombinant overexpression of Delta 50 lamin A, which

   aged individuals. Melanoma cells, both WM35 and Lu1205, both show
   reduced nuclear deformability and reduced cell invasion with the
   expression of Delta 50 lamin A. These studies suggest that cellular
   aging including expression of Delta 50 lamin A and nuclear stiffening
   may reduce the potential for metastatic cancer migration. Thus, the

Abstract = {{For small-copy-number pUC-type plasmids, the inc1 and inc2 mutations,
   which deregulate replication, were previously found to increase the
   plasmid copy number 6- to 7-fold. Because plasmids can exert a growth
   burden, it was not clear if further amplification of copy number would
   occur due to inc mutations when the starting point for plasmid copy
   number was orders of magnitude higher. To investigate further the
   effects of the inc mutations and the possible limits of plasmid
   synthesis, the parent plasmid pNTC8485 was used as a starting point. It
   lacks an antibiotic resistance gene and has a copy number of similar to
   1,200 per chromosome. During early stationary-phase growth in LB broth
   at 37 degrees C, inc2 mutants of pNTC8485 exhibited a copy number of
   similar to 7,000 per chromosome. In minimal medium at late log growth,
   the copy number was found to be significantly increased, to
   approximately 15,000. In an attempt to further increase the plasmid
   titer (plasmid mass/culture volume), enzymatic hydrolysis of the
   selection agent, sucrose, at late log growth extended growth and tripled
   the total plasmid amount such that an approximately 80-fold gain in
   total plasmid was obtained compared to the value for typical pUC-type
   vectors. Finally, when grown in minimal medium, no detectable impact on
   the exponential growth rate or the fidelity of genomic or plasmid DNA
   replication was found in cells with deregulated plasmid replication. The
   use of inc mutations and the sucrose degradation method presents a
   simplified way for attaining high titers of plasmid DNA for various
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A recent field theory of elastic bodies undergoing non-smooth
   submacroscopic geometrical changes (disarrangements) provides a setting
   in which, for a given homogeneous macroscopic deformation of the body,
   there are typically a number of different states of smooth,
   submacroscopic deformation (disarrangement phases) available to the
   body. A tensorial consistency relation and the inequality that
   guarantees that accommodates determine the totality of disarrangement
   phases corresponding to , and it is natural to seek for a given those
   disarrangement phases that minimize the Helmholtz free energy (stable
   disarrangement phases). We introduce these concepts in the particular
   context of continuous bodies comprised of many small elastic bodies
   (elastic aggregates) and in the context where disarrangements do not
   contribute to the Helmholtz free energy (purely dissipative
   disarrangements). In this setting, the Helmholtz free energy response of
   the pieces of the aggregate determines the totality of disarrangement
   phases corresponding to , which necessarily includes the phase (compact
   phase) in which every piece of the aggregate undergoes the given
   macroscopic deformation . When the response function is isotropic and
   smooth, and when possesses standard semiconvexity and growth properties,
   the body also admits phases of the form (loose phases) with an arbitrary
   rotation, provided that satisfies the accommodation inequality . Loose
   phases, when available, achieve the global minimum of the free energy
   and consequently are stable and stress-free. When has the specific form
   , with , given elastic constants, we determine all of the disarrangement
   phases corresponding to . These include not only the compact and loose
   phases, but also disarrangement phases in which the stress is uniaxial
   or planar. Our main result ({''}stability implies no-tension{''}) is the
   assertion that every stable disarrangement phase for cannot support
   tensile tractions, and our treatment of elastic aggregates thus provides
   a natural setting for the emergence of no-tension materials whose
   response in compression is non-linear. Existing treatments of no-tension
   materials assume at the outset that the body cannot support tension and
   that the response in compression is linear.}},

Abstract = {{A micro-tensile test system equipped with in situ monitoring of the
   in-plane displacements of a surface and an electron backscattered
   diffraction-based serial-sectioning technique were used to study the
   deformation (up to 2.4 pct axial plastic strain in tension) of a
   polycrystalline nickel micro-specimen. The experimental data include the
   global engineering stress-engineering strain curve, the local mesoscopic
   in-plane displacement and strain fields, the three-dimensional
   microstructure of the micro-specimen reconstructed after the tensile
   test, and the kernel-average misorientation distribution. The crystal
   plasticity finite element method using elasto-viscoplastic constitutive
   formulations was used to simulate the global and local deformation
   responses of the micro-specimen. Three different boundary conditions
   (BCs) were applied in simulation in order to study the effects of the
   lateral displacement (perpendicular to the loading direction) of the top
   and bottom faces of the specimen gage section. The simulation results
   were compared to the experimental results. The comparison between
   experiment and simulation results is discussed, based upon their
   implications for understanding the deformation of micro-specimens and
   the causes associated with uncertainties embedded in both experimental
   and numerical approaches. Also, the sensitivity of BCs to near-field and
   far-field responses of the micro-specimen was systematically studied.
   Results show that the experimental methodology used in the present study
   allows for limited but meaningful comparisons to crystal plasticity
   finite element simulations of the micro-specimen under the small plastic
   deformation.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of ultra-high-speed (UHS) spindles used for micromachining}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Micromachining dynamics commonly dictate the attainable accuracy and
   throughput that can be obtained from micromachining operations. The
   dynamic behavior of miniature ultra-high-speed (UHS) spindles used in
   micromachining critically affects micromachinirig dynamics. As such,
   there is a strong need for effective techniques to characterize the
   dynamic behavior of miniature UHS spindles. This paper presents a
   systematic experimental approach to obtain the speed-dependent
   two-dimensional dynamics of miniature UHS spindles through experimental
   modal analysis. A miniature cylindrical artifact with 5 mm overhang is
   attached to (and rotating with) the spindle to enable providing the
   dynamic excitations to and measuring the resulting motions of the
   spindle. A custom-made impact excitation system is used to reproducibly
   excite the spindle dynamics up to 20 kHz while controlling the impact
   force. The resulting radial motions of the spindle are measured in two
   mutually perpendicular directions using two independent fiber-optic
   laser Doppler vibrometers (LDVs). To ensure the mutual orthogonality of
   the measurements, the two lasers are aligned precisely using an optical
   procedure. A frequency-domain filtering approach is used to remove the
   unwanted spindle motion data from the measurements, thereby isolating
   the dynamic response. The spindle dynamics is then represented in the
   form of frequency response functions (FRFs). A global curve-fitting
   technique is applied to identify natural frequencies and damping ratios.
   The developed approach is demonstrated on a miniature UHS spindle with
   aerodynamic bearings, and dynamic characteristics are analyzed at
   different spindle speeds and collet pressures. The spindle speed is
   shown to have a significant effect on dynamic response, especially at
   higher spindle speeds, while the collet pressure is observed not to have
   any significant effect on the spindle dynamics. It is concluded that the
   presented approach can be used to characterize the dynamics of miniature
   UHS spindles effectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interfacial binding and aggregation of lamin A tail domains associated

Journal = {{BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{43-48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a premature aging disorder
   associated with the expression of Delta 50 lamin A (Delta 50LA), a
   mutant form of the nuclear structural protein lamin A (LA). Delta 50LA
   is missing 50 amino acids from the tail domain and retains a C-terminal
   farnesyl group that is cleaved from the wild-type LA. Many of the
   cellular pathologies of HGPS are thought to be a consequence of
   protein-membrane association mediated by the retained farnesyl group. To
   better characterize the protein-membrane interface, we quantified
   binding of purified recombinant Delta 50LA tail domain (Delta 50LA-TD)
   to tethered bilayer membranes composed of phosphatidylserine and
   phosphocholine using surface plasmon resonance. Farnesylated Delta
   50LA-TD binds to the membrane interface only in the presence of Ca2+ or
   Mg2+ at physiological ionic strength. At extremely low ionic strength,
   both the farnesylated and non-farnesylated forms of Delta 50LA-TD bind
   to the membrane surface in amounts that exceed those expected for a
   densely packed protein monolayer. Interestingly, the wild-type LA-TD
   with no farnesylation also associates with membranes at low ionic
   strength but forms only a single layer. We suggest that electrostatic
   interactions are mediated by charge clusters with a net positive charge
   that we calculate on the surface of the LA-TDs. These studies suggest
   that the accumulation of Delta 50LA at the inner nuclear membrane
   observed in cells is due to a combination of aggregation and membrane
   association rather than simple membrane binding; electrostatics plays an
   important role in mediating this association. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present a study on atomic ordering within individual grains in
   granular L1(0)-FePt thin films using transmission electron microscopy
   techniques. The film, used as a medium for heat assisted magnetic
   recording, consists of a single layer of FePt grains separated by
   non-magnetic grain boundaries and is grown on an MgO underlayer. Using
   convergent-beam techniques, diffraction patterns of individual grains
   are obtained for a large number of crystallites. The study found that
   although the majority of grains are ordered in the perpendicular
   direction, more than 15\% of them are multi-variant, or of in-plane
   c-axis orientation, or disordered fcc. It was also found that these
   multi-variant and in-plane grains have always grown across MgO grain
   boundaries separating two or more MgO grains of the underlayer. The
   in-plane ordered portion within a multi-variant L10-FePt grain always
   lacks atomic coherence with the MgO directly underneath it, whereas, the
   perpendicularly ordered portion is always coherent with the underlying
   MgO grain. Since the existence of multi-variant and in-plane ordered
   grains are severely detrimental to high density data storage capability,
   the understanding of their formation mechanism obtained here should make
   a significant impact on the future development of hard disk drive
   technology. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the interplay between epidemic spreading and risk
   perception on multiplex networks. The basic idea is that the effective
   infection probability is affected by the perception of the risk of being
   infected, which we assume to be related to the fraction of infected
   neighbors, as introduced by Bagnoli et al. {[}Phys. Rev. E 76, 061904
   (2007)]. We rederive previous results using a self-organized method that
   automatically gives the percolation threshold in just one simulation. We
   then extend the model to multiplex networks considering that people get
   infected by physical contacts in real life but often gather information
   from an information network, which may be quite different from the
   physical ones. The similarity between the physical and the information
   networks determines the possibility of stopping the infection for a
   sufficiently high precaution level: if the networks are too different,
   there is no means of avoiding the epidemics.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are known to play an important role in cell polarity;
   however, the mechanism remains unclear. Using cells migrating
   persistently on micropatterned strips, we found that depolymerization of
   microtubules caused cells to change from persistent to oscillatory
   migration. Mathematical modeling in the context of a
   local-excitation-global-inhibition control mechanism indicated that this
   mechanism can account for microtubule-dependent oscillation, assuming
   that microtubules remove inhibitory signals from the front after a
   delayed generation. Experiments further supported model predictions that
   the period of oscillation positively correlates with cell length and
   that oscillation may be induced by inhibiting retrograde motors. We
   suggest that microtubules are required not for the generation but for
   the maintenance of cell polarity, by mediating the global distribution
   of inhibitory signals. Disassembly of microtubules induces cell
   oscillation by allowing inhibitory signals to accumulate at the front,
   which stops frontal protrusion and allows the polarity to reverse.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical scheme based on a fictitious domain
   framework for the numerical modeling of earthquake-induced ground motion
   in the presence of realistic surface topography of the Earth's crust. We
   show that by adopting a non-conforming octree-based meshing approach
   associated with a virtual representation of the surficial irregularity,
   we can obtain accurate representations of ground motion. From the
   computational point of view, our methodology proves to be also
   efficient, and more importantly, it allows us to preserve the salient
   features of multi-resolution cubic-shaped finite elements for wave
   propagation applications. We implemented the non-conforming meshing
   scheme for the treatment of realistic topographies into Hercules, the
   octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake
   Group at Carnegie Mellon University. We tested the benefits of the
   strategy by benchmarking its results against reference examples, and by
   means of numerical error estimate analyses. Our qualitative and
   quantitative comparisons showed a close agreement between our numerical
   results and the reference results, and also, that the order of
   convergence of the displacement field is preserved in the presence of
   surface topography. Moreover, this performance was obtained by using the
   same mesh refinement techniques with cubic elements as in traditional
   flat free-surface simulations. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Malaria causes nearly 1 million deaths annually. Recent emergence of
   multidrug resistance highlights the need to develop novel therapeutic
   interventions against human malaria. Given the involvement of sugar
   binding plasmodial proteins in host invasion, we set out to identify
   such proteins as targets of small glycans. Combining multi-disciplinary
   approaches, we report the discovery of a small molecule inhibitor, NIC,
   capable of inhibiting host invasion through interacting with a major
   invasion-related protein, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1). This
   interaction was validated through computational, biochemical, and
   biophysical tools. Importantly, treatment with NIC prevented host
   invasion by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax-major causative
   organisms of human malaria. MSP-1, an indispensable antigen critical for
   invasion and suitably localized in abundance on the merozoite surface
   represents an ideal target for antimalarial development. The ability to
   target merozoite invasion proteins with specific small inhibitors opens
   up a new avenue to target this important pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the use of Bayesian Networks (BNs) for left
   ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy; a treatment for end-stage
   heart failure that has been steadily growing in popularity over the past
   decade. Despite this growth, the number of LVAD implants performed
   annually remains a small fraction of the estimated population of
   patients who might benefit from this treatment. We believe that this
   demonstrates a need for an accurate stratification tool that can help
   identify LVAD candidates at the most appropriate point in the course of
   their disease. We derived BNs to predict mortality at five endpoints
   utilizing the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
   Support (INTERMACS) database: containing over 12,000 total enrolled
   patients from 153 hospital sites, collected since 2006 to the present
   day, and consisting of approximately 230 pre-implant clinical variables.
   Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to
   address the uneven proportion of patients with negative outcomes and to
   improve the performance of the models. The resulting accuracy and area
   under the ROC curve (\%) for predicted mortality were 30 day: 94.9 and
   92.5; 90 day: 84.2 and 73.9; 6 month: 78.2 and 70.6; 1 year: 73.1 and
   70.6; and 2 years: 71.4 and 70.8. To foster the translation of these
   models to clinical practice, they have been incorporated into a
   web-based application, the Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System
   (CHRiSS). As clinical experience with LVAD therapy continues to grow,
   and additional data is collected, we aim to continually update these BN
   models to improve their accuracy and maintain their relevance. Ongoing
   work also aims to extend the BN models to predict the risk of adverse
   events post-LVAD implant as additional factors for consideration in
   decision making.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional water network synthesis approach greatly simplifies
   wastewater treatment units by using fixed recoveries, creating a gap for
   their applicability to industrial processes. This work describes a
   unifying approach combining various technologies capable of removing all
   the major types of contaminants through the use of more realistic
   models. The following improvements are made over the typical
   superstructure-based water network models. First, unit-specific shortcut
   models are developed in place of the fixed contaminant removal model to
   describe contaminant mass transfer in wastewater treatment units.
   Shortcut wastewater treatment cost functions are also incorporated into
   the model. In addition, uncertainty in mass load of contaminants is
   considered to account for the range of operating conditions.
   Furthermore, the superstructure is modified to accommodate realistic
   potential structures. We present a modified Lagrangean-based
   decomposition algorithm in order to solve the resulting nonconvex
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem efficiently. Several
   examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and limitations
   of the algorithm for obtaining the global optimal solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Transport-regulated electrochemical reactions in thin-film platinum (Pt)
   electrodes for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) is theoretically
   investigated with a meso-scale modeling framework. These electrodes are
   of interest for their potential to reduce low temperature fuel cell
   costs, but the mechanisms governing their operation are not
   well-understood at this time. A primary question arising from
   experimental data is the origin of the high ion conductivity and oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) activity on ionomer-free Pt during PEFC
   operation when typical ORR potentials are well above commonly measured
   potentials of zero charge (PZC) for Pt surfaces. These ORR potentials
   should result in low proton conductivity and high activation losses.
   Herein, we address these questions with a model that considers both
   polymer electrolyte and water-covered portions of the Pt
   electrocatalysts similar to the experimental electrodes. Local
   electroneutrality is not assumed and the ion transport in water- and
   polymer electrolyte-covered regions of the Pt is modeled using the
   continuum Poisson- Nernst- Planck (PNP) equations including
   spatially-resolved domains for the compact (Stern) portions of the
   double layer. In addition, the model incorporates the water dissociation
   reaction (WDR) and both the acidic and alkaline ORR mechanisms. In
   water-covered regions, the ionic conductivity is highly dependent on the
   Pt surface charge, local pH, and transport-regulated ORR pathway. The
   model predicts the experimentally observed high ionic conductivity for
   Pt thin films in water and attributes it to high hydroxide
   concentration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{As one emerging plasmonic material, graphene can support surface
   plasmons at infrared and terahertz frequencies with unprecedented
   properties due to the strong interactions between graphene and
   low-frequency photons. Since graphene surface plasmons exist in the
   infrared and terahertz regime, they can be thermally pumped (excited) by
   the infrared evanescent waves emitted from an object. Here we show that
   thermal graphene plasmons can be efficiently excited and have
   monochromatic and tunable spectra, thus paving a way to harness thermal
   energy for graphene plasmonic devices. We further demonstrate that
   ``thermal information communication{''} via graphene surface plasmons

Abstract = {{Correlations between adsorption energies allow for the prediction of a
   large set of adsorption energies from a few quantum-chemical
   calculations, enabling quick evaluations of the catalytic activity of
   surfaces for multistep reactions. A critical question is whether these
   correlationsinitially established at low coverage on geometrically
   similar surfacesare useful at high coverage and in various geometric
   environments, which are the relevant industrial conditions of real
   catalysts. To answer this question, we use density functional theory to
   calculate almost 900 adsorption energies of several atomic adsorbates on
   late transition metal fcc (111) surfaces at a variety of coverages and
   configurations. We observe strict requirements of the geometric
   similarity between adsorption sites for the existence of correlations in
   adsorption energies. We also find that the introduction of higher
   coverages generally weakens and changes the correlations. We use our
   results to assess a simple model constructed from previously discovered
   scaling relationships and discuss their ramifications on catalyst
   discovery as well as strategies to incorporate this coverage dependence.}},

Abstract = {{A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for the
   optimal reactive scheduling of a mixed batch/continuous process, based
   on the discrete time resource task network (RTN) representation and
   extensions. The scheduling task is complicated with the mixed process
   units and network structure, as well as operation rules such as product
   changeovers. The extended RTN model introduces modifications to the
   conventional RTN models such as multiextent resource balances and, also,
   adds more features such as resource limit balances and resource slacks.
   These extensions allow for efficient modeling of the mixed plant in
   great detail. The extended RTN model is further reformulated to the
   state space form by incorporating lifted state variables that represent
   task histories. The state space RTN model facilitates reactive schedule
   design, particularly when used with the rolling horizon scheme. In the
   case study, we show the advantages of the state space RTN model in
   periodic rescheduling under process disruptions.}},

Abstract = {{The design of resilient supply chains under the risk of disruptions at
   candidate locations for distribution centers (DCs) is formulated as a
   two-stage stochastic program. The problem involves selecting DC
   locations, determining storage capacities for multiple commodities, and
   establishing the distribution strategy in scenarios that describe
   disruptions at potential DCs. The objective is to minimize the sum of
   investment cost and expected distribution cost during a finite time
   horizon. The rapid growth in the number of scenarios requires the
   development of an effective method to solve large-scale problems. The
   method includes a strengthened multicut Benders decomposition algorithm
   and the derivation of deterministic bounds based on the optimal solution
   over reduced sets of scenarios. Resilient designs for a large-scale
   example and an industrial supply chain are found with the proposed
   method. The results demonstrate the importance of including DC capacity
   in the design problem and anticipating the distribution strategy in
   adverse scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for model predictive control (MPC) with

   experiment show that good models and stable control are obtained. A
   simulation study based on models of a boiler-turbine unit shows that the
   algorithm can adapt to time-varying data. The performance is assessed
   using the area regulation (AR) test criterion currently adopted by PJM

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{149-159}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{State estimation is a crucial part of the monitoring and/or control of
   all chemical processes. Among various approaches for this problem,
   moving horizon estimation (MHE) has the advantage of directly
   incorporating nonlinear dynamic models within a well-defined
   optimization problem. Moreover, advanced step moving horizon estimation
   (asMHE) substantially reduces the on-line computational expense
   associated with MHE. Previously, MHE and asMHE have both been shown to
   perform well when measurement noise follows some known Gaussian
   distribution. In this study we extend MHE and asMHE to consider
   measurements that are contaminated with large errors. Here standard
   least squares based estimators generate biased estimates even with
   relatively few gross error measurements. We therefore apply two robust
   M-estimators, Huber's fair function and Hampel's redescending estimator,
   in order to mitigate the bias of these gross errors on our state
   estimates. This approach is demonstrated on dynamic models of a CSTR and
   a distillation column. Based on this comparison we conclude that the
   asMHE formulation with the redescending estimator can be used to get
   fast and accurate state estimates, even in the presence of many gross
   measurement errors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is one of the most promising
   techniques to extend the recording density in hard disk drives beyond 4
   Tb/in(2). This places a range of stringent operating requirements in the
   head disk interface, including heating and cooling of the media, must
   occur within the order of nanosecond in order to achieve the necessary
   data rates, generate a large thermal gradient for sharp bit edge, and
   ensure that the recorded data are thermally stable during cooling to
   ambient. Optical energy must be efficiently delivered and confined to a
   spot in the medium that is much smaller than the diffraction limit so
   that neighboring tracks are not heated. To shed light on this issue, a
   mesoscale level model based on kinetic theory called lattice Boltzmann
   method (LBM) is applied to understand the nanoscale heat transfer in the
   media layer in HAMR operations. In this paper, we examine the effects of
   main energy carriers at nansocale (electrons and phonons) via novel
   LBM-based methodology. We investigate the overall heat transfer
   contribution of the coupled heat carriers and the electron-phonon
   coupling issues in the carbon matrix and media grain interface in a
   representative FePt media layer. Since thermal gradients and grain size
   are very important for achieving high-density HAMR recording, the
   in-plane crosstrack temperature gradients of structural effects with two
   representative grain shapes (hexagonal and circular) and sizes (10 and 5
   nm) are investigated. We observed that 10 nm grains of both shapes show
   lower temperature gradients compared with the 5 nm size, due to the
   increase of carrier scattering at the grain/carbon matrix interface.
   Circular grain shape produces larger temperature gradient magnitude
   compared with hexagonal grain structure. Thus, this paper will produce
   insight in the mechanism to control the thermal management and
   temperature gradients for high-density HAMR.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines platelet adhesion on surfaces that combine coatings
   to limit protein adsorption along with ``anti-platelet{''} nitric oxide
   (NO) release. Uncoated and poly-2-methoxyethylacrylate (PMEA) coated,
   gas permeable polypropylene (PP) membranes were placed in a bioreactor
   to separate plasma and gas flows. Nitrogen with 100/500/1000 ppm of NO
   was supplied to the gas side as a proof of concept. On the plasma side,
   platelet rich plasma (PRP, 1 x 108 cell/mL) was recirculated at low
   (60)/high (300) flows (mL/min). After 8 hours, adsorbed platelets on PP
   was quantified via a lactate dehydrogenase assay. Compared to plain PP,
   the PMEA coating alone reduced adsorption by 17.4 +/- 9.2\% and 29.6 +/-
   16.6\% at low and high flow (p < 0.05), respectively. NO was more
   effective at low plasma flow. At 100 and 500 ppm of NO, adsorption fell
   by 37.9 +/- 6.1\% and 100 +/- 4.7\%, (p < 0.001), on plain PP. At high
   flow with 100, 500, and 1000 ppm of NO, adsorption reduced by 17.9 +/-
   17.8\%, 46.4 +/- 23.2\%, and 100 +/- 4.8\%, (p < 0.001), respectively.
   On PMEA-coated PP with only 100 ppm, adsorption fell by 69.7 +/- 6.8 and
   65.6\% +/- 16.9\%, (p < 0.001), at low and high flows respectively.
   Therefore, the combination of an anti-adsorptive coating with NO has
   great potential to reduce platelet adhesion and coagulation at
   biomaterial surfaces.}},

Title = {{On the effects of thermal history on the development and relaxation of

Journal = {{CRYOGENICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{86-94}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of the thermal protocol on the
   development and relaxation of thermo-mechanical stress in
   cryopreservation by means of glass formation, also known as
   vitrification. The cryopreserved medium is modeled as a homogeneous
   viscoelastic domain, constrained within either a stiff cylindrical
   container or a highly compliant bag. Annealing effects during the
   cooling phase of the cryopreservation protocol are analyzed. Results
   demonstrate that an intermediate temperature-hold period can
   significantly reduce the maximum tensile stress, thereby decreasing the
   potential for structural damage. It is also demonstrated that annealing
   at temperatures close to glass transition significantly weakens the
   dependency of thermo-mechanical stress on the cooling rate. Furthermore,
   a slower initial rewarming rate after cryogenic storage may drastically
   reduce the maximum tensile stress in the material, which supports
   previous experimental observations on the likelihood of fracture at this
   stage. This study discusses the dependency of the various stress
   components on the storage temperature. Finally, it is demonstrated that
   the stiffness of the container wall can affect the location of maximum
   stress, with implications on the development of cryopreservation
   protocols. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While scientific studies may help conflicting stakeholders come to
   agreement on a best management option or policy, often they do not. We
   review the factors affecting trust in the efficacy and objectivity of
   scientific studies in an analytical-deliberative process where conflict
   is present, and show how they may be incorporated in an extension to the
   traditional Bayesian decision model. The extended framework considers
   stakeholders who differ in their prior beliefs regarding the probability
   of possible outcomes (in particular, whether a proposed technology is
   hazardous), differ in their valuations of these outcomes, and differ in
   their assessment of the ability of a proposed study to resolve the
   uncertainty in the outcomes and their hazardsas measured by their
   perceived false positive and false negative rates for the study. The
   Bayesian model predicts stakeholder-specific preposterior probabilities
   of consensus, as well as pathways for increasing these probabilities,
   providing important insights into the value of scientific information in
   an analytic-deliberative decision process where agreement is sought. It
   also helps to identify the interactions among perceived risk and benefit
   allocations, scientific beliefs, and trust in proposed scientific
   studies when determining whether a consensus can be achieved. The
   article provides examples to illustrate the method, including an
   adaptation of a recent decision analysis for managing the health risks
   of electromagnetic fields from high voltage transmission lines.}},

Abstract = {{Public perception research in different countries has suggested that
   real and perceived periods of high temperature strengthen people's
   climate change beliefs. Such findings raise questions about the climate
   change beliefs of people in regions with moderate climates. Relatively
   little is known about whether public concerns about climate change may
   also be associated with perceived changes in other weather-related
   events, such as precipitation or flooding. We examine the relationship
   between perceived changes in weather-related events and climate change
   beliefs among U.K. residents at a time of below-average winter
   temperatures and recent flooding. National survey data (n = 1,848)
   revealed that heat waves and hot summers were perceived to have become
   less common during respondents' lifetimes, while flooding, periods of
   heavy rainfall, coastal erosions, and mild winters were perceived to
   have increased in frequency and cold winters were perceived to be
   unchanged. Although perceived changes in hot-weather-related events were
   positively associated with climate change beliefs, perceived changes in
   wet-weather-related events were found to be an even stronger predictor.
   Self-reported experience of flooding in own area and heat-wave
   discomfort also significantly contributed to climate change beliefs.
   These findings highlight the importance of salient weather-related
   events and experiences in the formation of beliefs about climate change.
   We link our findings to research in judgment and decision making, and
   propose that those wishing to engage with the public on the issue of
   climate change should not limit their focus to heat.}},

Abstract = {{Consider scheduling of real-time tasks on a multiprocessor where
   migration is forbidden. Specifically, consider the problem of
   determining a task-to-processor assignment for a given collection of
   implicit-deadline sporadic tasks upon a multiprocessor platform in which
   there are two distinct types of processors. For this problem, we propose
   a new algorithm, LPC (task assignment based on solving a Linear Program
   with Cutting planes). The algorithm offers the following guarantee: for
   a given task set and a platform, if there exists a feasible
   task-to-processor assignment, then LPC succeeds in finding such a
   feasible task-to-processor assignment as well but on a platform in which
   each processor is 1.5x faster and has three additional processors. For
   systems with a large number of processors, LPC has a better
   approximation ratio than state-of-the-art algorithms. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first work that develops a provably good
   real-time task assignment algorithm using cutting planes.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Traditional hard real-time scheduling algorithms require the use of the
   worst-case execution times to guarantee that deadlines will be met.
   Unfortunately, many algorithms with parameters derived from sensing the
   physical world suffer large variations in execution time, leading to
   pessimistic overall utilization, such as visual recognition tasks. In
   this article, we present ZS-QRAM, a scheduling approach that enables the
   use of flexible execution times and application-derived utility to tasks
   in order to maximize total system utility. In particular, we provide a
   detailed description of the algorithm, the formal proofs for its
   temporal protection, and a detailed, evaluation. Our evaluation uses the
   Utility Degradation Resilience (UDR) showing that ZS-QRAM is able to
   obtain 4x as much UDR as ZSRM, a previous overbooking approach, and
   almost 2x as much UDR as Rate-Monotonic with Period Transformation
   (RM/TP). We then evaluate a Linux kernel module implementation of our
   scheduler on an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) platform. We show that, by
   using our approach, we are able to keep the tasks that render the most
   utility by degrading lower-utility ones even in the presence of highly
   dynamic execution times.}},

Title = {{An all-ZnO microbolometer for infrared imaging}},
Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{245-249}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Microbolometers are extensively used for uncooled infrared imaging
   applications. These imaging units generally employ vanadium oxide or
   amorphous silicon as the active layer and silicon nitride as the
   absorber layer. However, using different materials for active and
   absorber layers increases the fabrication and integration complexity of
   the pixel structure. In order to reduce fabrication steps and therefore
   increase the yield and reduce the cost of the imaging arrays, a single
   layer can be employed both as the absorber and the active material. In
   this paper, we propose an all-ZnO microbolometer, where atomic layer
   deposition grown zinc oxide is employed both as the absorber and the
   active material. Optical constants of ZnO are measured and fed into
   finite-difference-time-domain simulations where absorption performances
   of microbolometers with different gap size and ZnO film thicknesses are
   extracted. Using the results of these optical simulations, thermal
   simulations are conducted using finite-element-method in order to
   extract the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) and thermal
   time constant values of several bolometer structures with different gap
   sizes, arm and film thicknesses. It is shown that the maximum
   performance of 171 mK can be achieved with a body thickness of 1.1 mu m
   and arm thickness of 50 nm, while the fastest response with a time
   constant of 0.32 ms can be achieved with a ZnO thickness of 150 nm both
   in arms and body. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical modification of macromolecular affinity chromatography ligands
   with polyethylene glycol chains or PEGylation can potentially improve
   selectivity by sterically suppressing non-specific binding interactions
   without sacrificing binding capacity. For a commercial protein A
   affinity media and with yeast extract (YE) and fetal bovine serum (FBS)
   serving as mock contaminants, we found that the ligand accounted for
   more than 90\% of the media-associated non-specific binding,
   demonstrating an opportunity for improvement. The IgG static binding
   affinity of protein A mono-PEGylated with 5.0 and 20.7 kDa poly(ethylene
   glycol) chains was found to be preserved using a biomolecular
   interaction screening platform. Similar in situ PEGylations of the
   commercial protein A media were conducted and the modified media was
   functionally characterized with IgG solutions spiked with YE and FBS.
   Ligand PEGylation reduced the mass of media-associated contaminants by a
   factor of two to three or more. Curiously, we also found an increase of
   up to 15\% in the average recovery of IgG on elution after PEGylation.
   Combined, these effects produced an order of magnitude increase in the
   IgG selectivity on average when spiked with YE and a two- to three-fold
   increase when spiked with FBS relative to the commercial media. Dynamic
   binding capacity and mass-transfer resistance measurements revealed a
   reduction in dynamic capacity attributed to a decrease in IgG effective
   pore diffusivity and possibly slower IgG association kinetics for the
   PEGylated protein A ligands. Ligand PEGylation is a viable approach to
   improving selectivity in affinity chromatography with macromolecular
   ligands. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{188-196}},

Abstract = {{Diffusive leakage of CO2 through the sealing caprock is likely to occur
   at saline sequestration sites if the permeability of the caprock is too
   high. Pressure monitoring is a widely used technique for CO2 leakage
   detection. This study aims to characterize the CO2 leakage level in an
   idealized CO2 storage site through an assessment of the integrity and
   permeability of the caprock inferred from pressure measurements in the
   injection zone. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is conducted, allowing
   the detection power of pressure measurements to be estimated. Based on
   Bayesian classification theory, the probability of each caprock
   permeability class given pressure measurements with measurement error
   can be inferred. The influence of time and location of measurements, the
   relative magnitude of the measurement error, the CO2 injection rate, and
   the assumed uncertainty in reservoir properties on the inferred caprock
   permeability class and the detection power of the pressure monitoring is
   also evaluated. Pressure monitoring alone is not sufficient to detect a
   permeable caprock for the system considered in this study, unless the
   caprock permeability is very high. A significant improvement in the
   statistical detection power is evident in the case where the uncertainty
   in reservoir properties is reduced through further site
   characterization. Complementary monitoring techniques will likely be
   needed to improve the power of pressure-based CO2 leakage detection to
   acceptable levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the dynamic nature of vehicular traffic and the road
   surroundings, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation characteristics vary
   greatly on both small and large scale. Recent measurements have shown
   that both large static objects (e. g., buildings and foliage) and mobile
   objects (surrounding vehicles) have a profound impact on V2V
   communication. At the same time, system-level vehicular ad hoc network
   (VANET) simulators by and large employ simple statistical propagation
   models, which do not account for surrounding objects explicitly. We
   designed Geometry-based Efficient propagation Model for V2V
   communication (GEMV(2)), which uses outlines of vehicles, buildings, and
   foliage to distinguish the following three types of links: line of sight
   (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS) due to vehicles, and NLOS due to static objects.
   For each link, GEMV(2) calculates the large-scale signal variations
   deterministically, whereas the small-scale signal variations are
   calculated stochastically based on the number and size of surrounding
   objects. We implement GEMV(2) in MATLAB and show that it scales well by
   using it to simulate radio propagation for city-wide networks with tens
   of thousands of vehicles on commodity hardware. We make the source code
   of GEMV(2) freely available. Finally, we validate GEMV(2) against
   extensive measurements performed in urban, suburban, highway, and
   open-space environments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The relative contributions of various defects to the measured
   resistivity in nanocrystalline Cu were investigated, including a
   quantitative account of twin-boundary scattering. It has been difficult
   to quantitatively assess the impact twin boundary scattering has on the
   classical size effect of electrical resistivity, due to limitations in
   characterizing twin boundaries in nanocrystalline Cu. In this study,
   crystal orientation maps of nanocrystalline Cu films were obtained via
   precession-assisted electron diffraction in the transmission electron
   microscope. These orientation images were used to characterize grain
   boundaries and to measure the average grain size of a microstructure,
   with and without considering twin boundaries. The results of these
   studies indicate that the contribution from grain-boundary scattering is
   the dominant factor (as compared to surface scattering) leading to
   enhanced resistivity. The resistivity data can be well-described by the
   combined Fuchs-Sondheimer surface scattering model and Mayadas-Shatzkes
   grain-boundary scattering model using Matthiessen's rule with a surface
   specularity coefficient of p = 0.48 and a grain-boundary reflection
   coefficient of R = 0.26. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the heat transfer in the fully developed flow of
   a viscoelastic fluid, a slag layer, down a vertical wall. A new
   constitutive relation for the stress tensor of this fluid is proposed,
   where the viscosity depends on the volume fraction, temperature, and
   shear rate. For the heat flux vector, we assume the Fourier's law of
   conduction with a constant thermal conductivity. The model is also
   capable of exhibiting normal stress effects. The governing equations are
   non-dimensionalized and numerically solved to study the effects of
   various dimensionless parameters on the velocity, temperature, and
   volume fraction. The effect of the exponent in the Reynolds viscosity
   model is also discussed. The different cases of shear-thinning and
   shear-thickening, cooling and heating, are compared and discussed. The
   results indicate that the viscous dissipation and radiation (at the free
   surface) cause the temperature to be higher inside the flow domain.

Abstract = {{Current external fixators for distraction osteogenesis (DO) are unable
   to correct all types of deformities in the lower limb and are difficult
   to use because of the lack of a pre-surgical planning system. We propose
   a DO system that consists of a surgical planner and a new, easy-to-setup
   unilateral fixator that not only corrects all lower limb deformity, but
   also generates the contralateral/predefined bone shape. Conventionally,
   bulky constructs with six or more joints (six degrees of freedom, 6DOF)
   are needed to correct a 3D deformity. By applying the axis-angle
   representation, we can achieve that with a compact construct with only
   two joints (2DOF). The proposed system makes use of computer-aided
   design software and computational methods to plan and simulate the
   planned procedure. Results of our stress analysis suggest that the
   stiffness of our proposed fixator is comparable to that of the Orthofix
   unilateral external fixator. We tested the surgical system on a model of
   an adult deformed tibia and the resulting bone trajectory deviates from
   the target bone trajectory by 1.8 mm, which is below our defined
   threshold error of 2 mm. We also extracted the transformation matrix
   that defines the deformity from the bone model and simulated the planned
   procedure. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The development of emerging spin-transfer torque random access memory
   (STT-RAM) is facing two major technical challenges-poor write
   reliability and high write energy, both of which are severely impacted
   by process variations and thermal fluctuations. The evaluations on
   STT-RAM design metrics and robustness often require a hybrid simulation
   flow, i.e., modeling the CMOS and magnetic devices with SPICE and
   macro-magnetic models, respectively. Very often, such a hybrid
   simulation flow involves expensive Monte Carlo simulations when the
   design and behavioral variabilities of STT-RAM are taken into account.
   In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable semi-analytical
   method-PS3-RAM, enabling efficient statistical simulations in STT-RAM
   designs. By eliminating the costly macro-magnetic and SPICE simulations,
   PS3-RAM achieves more than 100 000x runtime speedup with excellent
   agreement with the result of conventional simulation method. PS3-RAM can
   also accurately estimate the STT-RAM write error rate and write energy
   distributions at both magnetic tunneling junction switching directions
   under different temperatures, demonstrating great potential in the
   analysis of STT-RAM reliability and write energy at the early design
   stage of memory or micro-architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation texture was studied in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy for two
   microstructures produced through different phase transformation
   mechanisms (i.e. diffusional vs. displacive). Both microstructures
   revealed qualitatively similar crystallographic texture characteristics,
   having two main texture components with Euler angles of (90 degrees, 90
   degrees, 0 degrees) and (90 degrees, 30 degrees, 0 degrees). However,
   the overall a texture strength was considerably weaker in the
   martensitic structure (i.e. displacive mechanism) compared with the
   alpha+beta microstructure produced through slow cooling (i.e.
   diffusional mechanism). The intervariant boundary distribution in
   martensite mostly revealed five misorientations associated with the
   Burgers orientation relationship. The five-parameter boundary analysis
   also showed a very strong interface plane orientation texture, with
   interfaces terminated mostly on the prismatic planes \{hki0\}, when
   misorientation was ignored. The highest intervariant boundary
   populations belonged to the 63.26 degrees/{[}(10) over bar 5 5 (3) over
   bar] and 60 degrees/{[}1 1 (2) over bar 0] misorientations, with length
   fractions of 0.38 and 0.3, respectively. The former was terminated on (4
   1 3 0), and the latter was a symmetric tilt boundary, terminated on ((1)
   over bar0 11). The intervariant plane distribution in martensite was
   determined more by the constraints of the phase transformation than by
   the relative interface energies. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Tolyltriazole (TTA) has been identified as an effective copper corrosion
   inhibitor in cooling systems using treated municipal effluent as makeup
   water. Significant removal of TTA from solution has been reported in
   previous studies in the presence of free chlorine and copper metal.
   Hence, for effective dosing of TTA in the cooling systems, it is
   important to understand the depletion scenario of TTA in solution in the
   presence of free chlorine and copper metal. In this study, TTA depletion
   in solution was assessed using batch reactor experiments in the presence
   of varying concentrations of free chlorine and copper metal in synthetic
   cooling water simulating treated municipal wastewater. Increasing free
   chlorine concentration resulted in more depletion of TTA from solution
   in the presence of copper metal, which may be due to more adsorption of
   TTA on to the cuprous oxide surface formed with enhanced corrosion of
   copper metal and to the formation of insoluble copper-TTA complex with
   the released copper ions in solution. The enhancement of copper metal
   corrosion in the presence of TTA and increasing concentration of free
   chlorine were assessed using electrochemical potentiodynamic
   polarization experiments. Also, TTA adsorption on cuprous oxide surface
   was assessed in batch reactor experiments. Packing density of TTA on
   cuprous oxide surface was found to be pH dependent. More TTA was
   adsorbed onto cuprous oxide surface at higher pH values. Calculations of
   TTA free energy of adsorption showed that TTA was chemisorbed onto
   cuprous oxide.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel multi-control area framework for explicit
   modeling, managing, and accounting of simultaneous bilateral
   transactions with specified contract paths. Our framework provides a
   modular and multi-layered electrical network representation with
   zooming-in and zooming-out capabilities. The zoomed-out representation
   concerns interconnections and inter-area transactions, while the
   zoomed-in representation concerns a single area and its internal
   transactions. The framework allows explicit modeling of bilateral
   transactions with contract paths through a transformation of a meshed
   electrical network into a spanning tree. Loop flows are introduced to
   represent a deviation between the contract paths of bilateral
   transactions and physical line flows. The effects of both intra-area and
   inter-area bilateral transactions and loop flows can be graphically
   traced in the framework. Moreover, these tracing methods allocate
   bilateral transactions to line flows and loop flows, essential for
   accounting and flow control. Our tracing methods differ from the
   distribution factor based method because the distribution factor matrix
   handles nodal injections only and it cannot account for contract paths
   of bilateral transactions and the resulting loop flows. The
   multi-layered network transformations and tracing methods are
   illustrated on the IEEE 14-bus system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper defines flow control algorithms for loop flow cancellation
   based on the allocation and tracing of bilateral transactions and loop
   flows. In Part I of this paper, we have shown that the main difference
   between transportation and electrical networks is caused by the
   existence of loop flows. We have introduced a distributed framework for
   the modeling and tracing of bilateral transactions and the corresponding
   loop flows. Its zooming-out capability provides a valuable mechanism for
   representing external (inter-area) loop flows based on simplified
   topologies of individual areas. The tracing information accurately
   allocates bilateral transactions with associated contract paths to line
   flows and loop flows. Furthermore, this information can be used for
   determining the set points of control equipment so that loop flows are
   minimized. In this framework, phase angle regulators (PARs), commonly
   used for line flow control, are represented through their effects on
   loop flows. We define sufficient conditions for achieving complete loop
   flow cancellation. A new distributed algorithm for determining PAR set
   points in a coordinated way without revealing operating conditions of
   individual areas is introduced in this part. Finally, complete loop flow
   cancellation and the distributed algorithm for finding PAR set points
   are demonstrated in the Reliability Test System (RTS) 96-bus system with
   wheeling loop flows.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns a novel approach to the modeling and control design
   for transient stabilization of electric power systems using Flexible
   Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices. A nonlinear
   dynamic model of general interconnected electric power systems in the
   ordinary differential equation (ODE) form is proposed in terms of
   time-varying phasors of all dynamic components. This model captures
   previously unmodeled fast dynamics of inductors and capacitors of FACTS.
   Additionally, it allows us to observe the active power which is flowing
   through FACTS during transients. Using the derived model, an
   ectropy-based FACTS controller is proposed. The proposed controller
   regulates the active power through FACTS in order to shift the increment
   in energy created by disturbances. The energy increment is directed from
   generators into FACTS, preserving the synchronization between generators
   during disturbances. Simulation results obtained on the IEEE 14-bus
   system demonstrate the potential of this controller. The controller is
   shown to increase critical clearing time of the system in the case of a
   fault.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion MRI enabled in vivo microstructural imaging of the fiber
   tracts in the brain resulting in its application in a wide range of
   settings, including in neurological and neurosurgical disorders.
   Conventional approaches such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been
   shown to have limited applications due to the crossing fiber problem and
   the susceptibility of their quantitative indices to partial volume
   effects. To overcome these limitations, the recent focus has shifted to
   the advanced acquisition methods and their related analytical
   approaches. Advanced white matter imaging techniques provide superior
   qualitative data in terms of demonstration of multiple crossing fibers
   in their spatial orientation in a three dimensional manner in the brain.
   In this review paper, we discuss the advancements in diffusion MRI and
   introduce their roles. Using examples, we demonstrate the role of
   advanced diffusion MRI-based fiber tracking in neuroanatomical studies.
   Results from its preliminary application in the evaluation of
   intracranial space occupying lesions, including with respect to future
   directions for prognostication, are also presented. Building upon the
   previous DTI studies assessing white matter disease in Huntington's
   disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; we also discuss approaches
   which have led to encouraging preliminary results towards developing an
   imaging biomarker for these conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions depend on the interactions
   of many neurons. In recent years, there has been rapid development and
   increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of
   neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what
   scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded
   neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three
   important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses
   requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure
   and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have
   adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to
   find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons.
   We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to
   population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods
   and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental
   and computational researchers who seek to understand the role
   dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience,
   and who seek to apply these methods to their own data.}},

Abstract = {{Many attempts have been made to increase the productivity and quality of

Abstract = {{Intracellular protein delivery is a novel tool for functional analysis
   of protein inside a cell. Several protein delivery reagents with diverse
   mechanisms have been developed and are commercially available. In this
   study, we focused on the inhibitory effect of intracellular delivery of
   SMAD ubiquitination regulation factor 1 (SMURF1) on the recombinant
   human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) signaling pathway. First,
   three commercially available reagents for intracellular delivery
   (BioPORTER (R), PULSin (R), and Xfect (TM)) were tested in a murine
   preosteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1.4. The biocompatibility of these
   reagents was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)
   -5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay and
   the cellular uptake and delivery effi-ciency were determined with
   FITC-antibody and beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), respectively. BioPORTER
   (R) provided the best results and was, therefore, chosen for the second
   aspect of our study: intracellular SMURF1 delivery. SMURF1/BioPORTER (R)
   complexes were applied to cells prior to rhBMP-2 application. The
   outcome data suggest intracellular SMURF1 delivery in MC3T3-E1.4 cells
   significantly inhibited alkaline phosphatase upregulation. This outcome
   may be useful to off-targets effects of rhBMP-2. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Hybrid vehicle fuel economy and drive quality are coupled through the
   ``energy management{''} controller that regulates power flow among the
   various energy sources and sinks. This paper studies energy management
   controllers designed using shortest path stochastic dynamic programming
   (SP-SDP), a stochastic optimal control design method which can respect
   constraints on drivetrain activity while minimizing fuel consumption for
   an assumed distribution of driver power demand. The performance of
   SP-SDP controllers is evaluated through simulation on large numbers of
   real-world drive cycles and compared to a baseline industrial controller
   provided by a major auto manufacturer. On real-world driving data, the
   SP-SDP-based controllers yield 10\% better fuel economy than the
   baseline industrial controller, for the same engine and gear activity.
   The SP-SDP controllers are further evaluated for robustness to the drive
   cycle statistics used in their design. Simplified drivability metrics
   introduced in previous work are validated on large real-world data sets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the extent to which users in developing countries
   innovate, the factors that enable these innovations and whether they are
   meaningful on a global stage. To study this issue, we conducted an
   empirical investigation into the origin and types of innovations in
   financial services offered via mobile phones, a global,
   multi-billion-dollar industry in which developing economies play an
   important role. We used the complete list of mobile financial services,
   as reported by the GSM Association, and collected detailed histories of
   the development of the services and their innovation process. Our
   analysis, the first of its kind, shows that 85\% of the innovations in
   this field originated in developing countries. We also conclude that, at
   least 50\% of all mobile financial services were pioneered by users,
   approximately 45\% by producers, and the remaining were jointly
   developed by users and producers. The main factors contributing to these
   innovations to occur in developing countries are the high levels of
   need, the existence of flexible platforms, in combination with increased
   access to information and communication technology. Additionally,
   services developed by users diffused at more than double the rate of
   producer-innovations. Finally, we observe that three-quarters of the
   innovations that originated in non-OECD countries have already diffused
   to OECD countries, and that the (user) innovations are therefore
   globally meaningful. This study suggests that the traditional
   North-to-South diffusion framework fails to explain these new sources of
   innovation and may require re-examination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The field of polymer-based membrane engineering has expanded since we
   first demonstrated the reaction of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-terminated
   polymers with cells and tissues almost two decades ago. One remaining
   obstacle, especially for conjugation of polymers to cells, has been that
   exquisite control over polymer structure and functionality has not been
   used to influence the behavior of cells. Herein, we describe a
   multifunctional atom transfer radical polymerization initiator and its
   use to synthesize water-soluble polymers that are modified with
   bisphosphonate side chains and then covalently bound to the surface of
   live cells. The polymers contained between 1.7 and 3.1 bisphosphonates
   per chain and were shown to bind to hydroxyapatite crystals with
   kinetics similar to free bisphosphonate binding. We engineered the
   membranes of both HL-60 cells and mesenchymal stem cells in order to
   impart polymer-guided bone adhesion properties on the cells. Covalent
   coupling of the polymer to the non-adherent HL-60 cell line or
   mesenchymal stem cells was non-toxic by proliferation assays and
   enhanced the binding of these cells to bone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A doubly censored Tobit model is used to forecast hourly air-conditioner
   usage for individual households. The model worked well over a wide range

   forecast the electricity load for a variety of demand response
   applications including operational reserves for renewable energy
   integration. Individual models are simulated and summed to obtain
   aggregate forecasts and confidence intervals. The model allows for
   correlation between the individual shocks that occur in a region. This
   approach gives substantially more accurate results than the moving
   average method typically used for forecasting and measuring direct load
   control. Applying the model to data from three U.S. utilities produced
   mean square error values from 0.027 to 0.041 with average load values

Abstract = {{Implantable neural electrodes must drastically improve chronic recording
   stability before they can be translated into long-term human clinical
   prosthetics. Previous studies suggest that sub-cellular sized and
   mechanically compliant probes may result in improved tissue integration
   and recording longevity. However, currently these design features are
   restricted by the opposing mechanical requirements needed for minimally
   damaging insertions. We designed a non-cytotoxic, carboxymethylcellulose
   (CMC) based dissolvable delivery vehicle (shuttle) to provide the
   mechanical support for insertion of ultrasmall, ultra-compliant
   microfabricated neural probes. Stiff CMC-based shuttles rapidly soften
   immediately after being placed similar to 1 mm above an open craniotomy
   as they absorb vapors from the brain. To address this, we developed a
   sophisticated targeting, high speed insertion (similar to 80 mm/s), and
   release system to implant these shuttles. After implantation, the goal
   is for the shuttle to dissolve away leaving only the electrodes behind.
   Here we show the histology of chronically implanted shuttles of large
   (300 mu m x 125 mu m) and small (100 mu m x 125 mu m) size at discrete
   time points over 12 weeks. Early time points show the CMC shuttle
   expanded after insertion as it absorbed moisture from the brain and
   slowly dissolved. At later time points neuronal cell bodies populate
   regions within the original shuttle tract. The large CMC shuttles show
   that the CMC expansion can cause extended secondary damage. On the other
   hand, the smaller CMC shuttles show limited secondary damage, wound
   closure by 4 weeks, absence of activated microglia at 12 weeks, as well
   as evidence suggesting neural regeneration at the implant site. This
   shuttle, therefore, shows great promise facilitating the implantation of
   nontraditional ultra-small, and ultra-compliant probes. (C) 2014

Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{DNA amplification is the process of replication of a specified DNA
   sequence in vitro through time-dependent manipulation of its external
   environment. A theoretical framework for determination of the optimal
   dynamic operating conditions of DNA amplification reactions, for any
   specified amplification objective, is presented based on
   first-principles biophysical modeling and control theory. Amplification
   of DNA is formulated as a problem in control theory with optimal
   solutions that can differ considerably from strategies typically used in
   practice. Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction as an example,
   sequence-dependent biophysical models for DNA amplification are cast as
   control systems, wherein the dynamics of the reaction are controlled by
   a manipulated input variable. Using these control systems, we
   demonstrate that there exists an optimal temperature cycling strategy
   for geometric amplification of any DNA sequence and formulate optimal
   control problems that can be used to derive the optimal temperature
   profile. Strategies for the optimal synthesis of the DNA amplification
   control trajectory are proposed. Analogous methods can be used to
   formulate control problems for more advanced amplification objectives
   corresponding to the design of new types of DNA amplification reactions.

Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{257}},
Pages = {{138-153}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{The metalcutting process, which includes turning, milling, drilling, and
   other methods for shaping metals, generates large mechanical forces and
   high temperatures at the point of contact between the cutting tool and
   workpiece material. The cutting tool is damaged substantially in these
   severe service conditions and has to be replaced when the tool cannot
   produce the desired product at the specified tolerances. To improve the
   lifetime for which it functions properly, the cutting tool has to be
   protected, often by coatings that are specifically designed to prevent
   certain damage modes that occur in particular applications. In fact,
   over 90\% of all cemented carbide inserts are currently coated using
   chemical vapor deposition, CVD, physical vapor deposition, PVD, or their
   combination. This paper will present PVD coatings that are specially
   designed to protect the cutting tool and extend its functionality
   (lifetime). The paper is organized in two parts. First, it will briefly
   describe the metalcutting process, the resulting challenges to the
   cutting edge and the components of a functional tool. The second and the
   main part will present and discuss the key PVD architectures employed to
   protect the tool: monolithic, multilayer and nanostructured coatings.
   The paper will conclude with a summary and outlook on the development of
   new PVD coatings for cutting tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Robustness of controlled quantum dynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{The control of multilevel quantum systems is sensitive to implementation
   errors in the control field and uncertainties associated with system
   Hamiltonian parameters. A small variation in the control field spectrum
   or the system Hamiltonian can cause an otherwise optimal field to
   deviate from controlling desired quantum state transitions and reaching
   a particular objective. An accurate analysis of robustness is thus
   essential in understanding and achieving model-based quantum control,
   such as in the control of chemical reactions based on ab initio or
   experimental estimates of the molecular Hamiltonian. In this paper,
   theoretical foundations for quantum control robustness analysis are
   presented from both a distributional perspective-in terms of moments of
   the transition amplitude, interferences, and transition probability-and
   a worst-case perspective. Based on this theory, analytical expressions
   and a computationally efficient method for determining the robustness of
   coherently controlled quantum dynamics are derived. The robustness
   analysis reveals that there generally exists a set of control pathways
   that are more resistant to destructive interferences in the presence of
   control field and system parameter uncertainty. These robust pathways
   interfere and combine to yield a relatively accurate transition
   amplitude and high transition probability when uncertainty is present.}},

Abstract = {{Treated municipal wastewater (MWW) is recognized as a viable alternative
   cooling water source for power generation. One of the key challenges for
   the successful use of the effluent from wastewater treatment facilities
   for cooling is the potential for significant condenser fouling when this
   water is concentrated as much as 46 times in recirculating cooling
   systems. In this study, two types of treated municipal wastewaters,
   namely secondary-treated MWW with pH adjustment (MWW\_pH) and
   secondary-treated MWW subjected to nitrification and sand filtration
   (MWW\_NF), were evaluated as the sole source of makeup water for
   recirculating cooling systems in both laboratory and pilot-scale
   studies. The tests revealed that synthetic MWW\_pH had significant
   crystalline fouling potential on the condenser surfaces when the pH was
   adjusted at 7.8 and that hydroxyapatite was the main component of the
   mineral scales formed on condenser surfaces. Addition of antiscalants,
   e.g., polymaleic acid (PMA), was shown to be effective in fouling
   mitigation by inhibiting the transformation of amorphous calcium
   phosphate to hydroxyapatite. In the case of synthetic MWW\_NF,
   significant crystalline fouling was observed at pH 7.2 while bulk
   precipitation reduced the driving force for crystalline fouling when pH
   was adjusted to 7.8. Pilot-scale studies with actual MWW revealed that
   the addition of PMA alone is not sufficient to control scale buildup and
   that controlling pH at 7.8 is needed to ensure proper operation of the
   cooling tower, as predicted by laboratory studies with synthetic
   wastewater. Alternatively, nitrification and sand filtration would
   accomplish the same goal without any chemical addition. Overall, this
   study demonstrated that it is possible to manage crystalline fouling on
   hot condenser tube surfaces associated with the use of treated municipal
   wastewater just by pH control and antiscalant addition and that
   significant additional treatment of municipal wastewater prior to use in
   recirculating cooling systems may not be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial activity in produced water from hydraulic fracturing
   operations can lead to undesired environmental impacts and increase gas
   production costs. However, the metabolic profile of these microbial
   communities is not well understood. Here, for the first time, we present
   results from a shotgun metagenome of microbial communities in both
   hydraulic fracturing source water and wastewater produced by hydraulic
   fracturing. Taxonomic analyses showed an increase in
   anaerobic/facultative anaerobic classes related to Clostridia,
   Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Epsilonproteobacteria in produced
   water as compared to predominantly aerobic Alphaproteobacteria in the
   fracturing source water. The metabolic profile revealed a relative
   increase in genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, respiration,
   sporulation and dormancy, iron acquisition and metabolism, stress
   response and sulfur metabolism in the produced water samples. These
   results suggest that microbial communities in produced water have an
   increased genetic ability to handle stress, which has significant
   implications for produced water management, such as disinfection.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative research on the interactions between biomechanical load and
   cardiovascular (CV) morphogenesis by multiple investigators over the
   past 3 decades, including the application of bioengineering approaches,
   has shown that the embryonic heart adapts both structure and function in
   order to maintain cardiac output to the rapidly growing embryo. Acute
   adaptive hemodynamic mechanisms in the embryo include the redistribution
   of blood flow within the heart, dynamic adjustments in heart rate and
   developed pressure, and beat to beat variations in blood flow and
   vascular resistance. These biomechanically relevant events occur
   coincident with adaptive changes in gene expression and trigger adaptive
   mechanisms that include alterations in myocardial cell growth and death,
   regional and global changes in myocardial architecture, and alterations
   in central vascular morphogenesis and remodeling. These adaptive
   mechanisms allow the embryo to survive these biomechanical stresses
   (environmental, maternal) and to compensate for developmental errors
   (genetic). Recent work from numerous laboratories shows that a subset of
   these adaptive mechanisms is present in every developing multicellular
   organism with a ``heart{''} equivalent structure. This chapter will
   provide the reader with an overview of some of the approaches used to
   quantify embryonic CV functional maturation and performance, provide
   several illustrations of experimental interventions that explore the
   role of biomechanics in the regulation of CV morphogenesis including the
   role of computational modeling, and identify several critical areas for
   future investigation as available experimental models and methods
   expand.}},

Abstract = {{We employ an integrated systems modeling tool to assess the water
   impacts of the new source performance standards recently proposed by the
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for limiting CO2 emissions from
   coal- and gas-fired power plants. The implementation of amine-based
   carbon capture and storage (CCS) for 40\% CO2 capture to meet the
   current proposal will increase plant water use by roughly 30\% in
   supercritical pulverized coal-fired power plants. The specific amount of
   added water use varies with power plant and CCS designs. More stringent
   emission standards than the current proposal would require CO2 emission
   reductions for natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) plants via CCS, which
   would also increase plant water use. When examined over a range of
   possible future emission standards from 1100 to 300 lb CO2/MWh gross,
   new baseload NGCC plants consume roughly 60-70\% less water than
   coal-fired plants. A series of adaptation approaches to secure
   low-carbon energy production and improve the electric power industry's
   water management in the face of future policy constraints are discussed
   both quantitatively and qualitatively.}},

Abstract = {{As we move towards the miniaturization of devices to perform tasks at
   the nano and microscale, it has become increasingly important to develop
   new methods for actuation, sensing, and control. Over the past decade,
   biohybrid methods have been investigated as a promising new approach to
   overcome the challenges of scaling down robotic and other functional
   devices. These methods integrate biological cells with artificial
   components and therefore, can take advantage of the intrinsic actuation
   and sensing functionalities of biological cells. Here, the recent
   advancements in bio-hybrid actuation are reviewed, and the challenges
   associated with the design, fabrication, and control of bio-hybrid
   microsystems are discussed. As a case study, focus is put on the
   development of bacteria-driven microswimmers, which has been
   investigated as a targeted drug delivery carrier. Finally, a future
   outlook for the development of these systems is provided. The continued
   integration of biological and artificial components is envisioned to
   enable the performance of tasks at a smaller and smaller scale in the
   future, leading to the parallel and distributed operation of functional
   systems at the microscale.}},

   hand-tracing methodology, and were compared quantitatively with the
   orientation mapping results. It was found that the mean grain size from
   the two methodologies agree within experimental error. On the other
   hand, the orientation mapping methodology produced a somewhat different
   grain size distribution compared with the distribution obtained by the

Abstract = {{We introduce a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) composed of
   liquid-phase Gallium-Indium (GaIn) alloy electrodes embedded between
   layers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and examine its mechanics using
   a specialized elastic shell theory. Residual stresses in the dielectric
   and sealing layers of PDMS cause the DEA to deform into a saddle-like
   geometry (Gaussian curvature kappa < 0). Applying voltage Phi to the
   liquid metal electrodes induces electrostatic pressure (Maxwell stress)
   on the dielectric and relieves some of the residual stress. This reduces
   the longitudinal bending curvature and corresponding angle of deflection
   v nu Treating the elastomer as an incompressible, isotropic, NeoHookean
   solid, we develop a theory based on the principle of minimum potential
   energy to predict the principal curvatures as a function of Phi. Based
   on this theory, we predict a dependency of nu on Phi that is in strong
   agreement with experimental measurements performed on a GaIn-PDMS
   composite. By accurately modeling electromechanical coupling in a
   soft-matter DEA, this theory can inform improvements in design and
   fabrication. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Contact self-cleaning of gecko-inspired synthetic adhesives with
   mushroom-shaped tips has been demonstrated recently using load drag
   unload cleaning procedures similar to that of the natural animal.
   However, the underlying mechanics of contact cleaning has yet to be
   fully understood. In this work, we present a detailed experiment of
   contact self-cleaning that shows that rolling is the dominant mechanism
   of cleaning for spherical microparticle contaminants, during the
   load-drag-unload procedure. We also study the effect of dragging rate
   and normal load on the particle rolling friction. A model of spherical
   particle rolling on an elastomer fibrillar adhesive interface is
   developed and agrees well with the experimental results. This study
   takes us closer to determining design parameters for achieving
   self-cleaning fibrillar adhesives.}},

Abstract = {{Well-defined poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) were synthesized by activators

   1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   (VBBI(+)Tf2N(-)) was directly polymerized with
   tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) ligand and ppm level of copper
   catalyst. The addition of reducing agent fin(H) 2-ethylhexanoate
   (Sn-II(EH)(2)) to continuously regenerate the catalyst in the ARGET ATRP
   enabled the synthesis of PILs with a significantly lower concentration
   of catalysts than required for a normal ATRP. Pits with well-controlled
   molecular weight and relatively low dispersity (M-w/M-n < 1.3) were
   obtained. ATRP chain extension of the resulting Pits with polystyrene
   revealed that the chain-end functionality of the Pits was significantly
   improved by slow feeding of the reducing agent during the
   polymerization. Simple and effective methods were developed to remove
   the residual halide ions from the ionic liquid monomer by ion exchange
   with LiTf2N or precipitation with AgTf2N, which allowed ARGET ATRP of
   the purified ionic liquid monomer to occur with as low as 20 ppm copper
   catalyst. Additionally, ARGET ATRP was used for the preparation of Pit
   block copolymers, including AB diblock and ABA triblock with PM
   segment(s) as the middle or side blocks, using ionic liquid monomer or
   mono/difunctional PIL macroinitiators.}},

Title = {{A method for preparation and cleaning of uniformly sized arsenopyrite
   particles}},
Journal = {{GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals, such as
   arsenopyrite (FeAsS), is of critical importance in many geochemical
   systems. A comprehensive understanding of their dissolution rates
   entails careful preparation of the mineral surface. Measurements of
   dissolution rates of arsenic from arsenopyrite are dependent on the size
   and degree of oxidation of its particles, among other factors. In this
   work, a method was developed for preparation and cleaning of
   arsenopyrite particles with size range of 150-250 mu m. Four different
   cleaning methods were evaluated for effectiveness based on the removal
   of oxidized species of iron (Fe), arsenic (As) and sulfur (S) from the
   surface. The percentage oxidation of the surface was determined using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and surface stoichiometry was
   measured using scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).
   Results: Results indicate that sonicating the arsenopyrite particles and
   then cleaning them with 12N HCl followed by 50\% ethanol, and drying in
   nitrogen was the most effective method. This method was successful in
   greatly reducing the oxide species of Fe while completely removing
   oxides of As and S from the arsenopyrite surface.
   Conclusions: Although sonication and acid cleaning have been widely used
   for mineral preparation, the method described in this study can
   significantly reduce grain size heterogeneity as well as surface
   oxidation, which enables greater control in surface and dissolution
   experiments.}},

Title = {{Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from in-Use Motor Vehicle Emissions
   Using a Potential Aerosol Mass Reactor}},

Pages = {{11235-11242}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from in-use vehicle emissions
   was investigated using a potential aerosol mass (PAM) flow reactor
   deployed in a highway tunnel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Experiments
   consisted of passing exhaust-dominated tunnel air through a PAM reactor
   over integrated hydroxyl radical (OH) exposures ranging from similar to
   0.3 to 9.3 days of equivalent atmospheric oxidation. Experiments were
   performed during heavy traffic periods when the fleet was at least 80\%
   light-duty gasoline vehicles on a fuel-consumption basis. The peak SOA
   production occurred after 2-3 days of equivalent atmospheric oxidation.
   Additional OH exposure decreased the SOA production presumably due to a
   shift from functionalization to fragmentation dominated reaction
   mechanisms. Photo-oxidation also produced substantial ammonium nitrate,
   often exceeding the mass of SOA. Analysis with an SOA model highlight
   that unspeciated organics (i.e., unresolved complex mixture) are a very
   important class of precursors and that multigenerational processing of
   both gases and particles is important at longer time scales. The
   chemical evolution of the organic aerosol inside the PAM reactor appears
   to be similar to that observed in the atmosphere. The mass spectrum of
   the unoxidized primary organic aerosol closely resembles ambient
   hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA). After aging the exhaust
   equivalent to a few hours of atmospheric oxidation, the organic aerosol
   most closely resembles semivolatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA)
   and then low volatility organic aerosol (LV-OOA) at higher OH exposures.
   Scaling the data suggests that mobile sources contribute similar to 2.9
   +/- 1.6 Tg SOA yr(-1) in the United States, which is a factor of 6
   greater than all mobile source particulate matter emissions reported by
   the National Emissions Inventory. This highlights the important
   contribution of SOA formation from vehicle exhaust to ambient
   particulate matter concentrations in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Capillary forces are important in nature (granular materials, insect
   locomotion) and in technology (disk drives, adhesion). Although well
   studied in equilibrium state, the dynamics of capillary formation merit
   further investigation. Here, we show that microcantilever crack healing
   experiments are a viable experimental technique for investigating the
   influence of capillary nucleation on crack healing between rough
   surfaces. The average crack healing velocity, (v) over bar, between
   clean hydrophilic polycrystalline silicon surfaces of nanoscale
   roughness is measured. A plot of (v) over bar versus energy release
   rate, G, reveals log-linear behavior, while the slope vertical bar
   d{[}log((v) over bar)]/dG vertical bar decreases with increasing
   relative humidity. A simplified interface model that accounts for the
   nucleation time of water bridges by an activated process is developed to
   gain insight into the crack healing trends. This methodology enables us
   to gain insight into capillary bridge dynamics, with a goal of attaining
   a predictive capability for this important microelectromechanical
   systems (MEMS) reliability failure mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical framework for prediction of the dynamic evolution of
   chemical species in DNA amplification reactions, for any specified
   sequence and operating conditions, is reported. Using the polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) as an example, we developed a sequence- and
   temperature-dependent kinetic model for DNA amplification using
   first-principles biophysical modeling of DNA hybridization and
   polymerization. We compare this kinetic model with prior PCR models and
   discuss the features of our model that are essential for quantitative
   prediction of DNA amplification efficiency for arbitrary sequences and
   operating conditions. Using this model, the kinetics of PCR is analyzed.
   The ability of the model to distinguish between the dynamic evolution of
   distinct DNA sequences in DNA amplification reactions is demonstrated.
   The kinetic model is solved for a typical PCR temperature protocol to
   motivate the need for optimization of the dynamic operating conditions
   of DNA amplification reactions. It is shown that amplification
   efficiency is affected by dynamic processes that are not accurately
   represented in the simplified models of DNA amplification that form the
   basis of conventional temperature cycling protocols. Based on this
   analysis, a modified temperature protocol that improves PCR efficiency
   is suggested. Use of this sequence-dependent kinetic model in a control
   theoretic framework to determine the optimal dynamic operating
   conditions of DNA amplification reactions, for any specified

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal regulation of cell contractility coordinates cell shape
   change to construct tissue architecture and ultimately directs the
   morphology and function of the organism. Here we show that contractility
   responses to spatially and temporally controlled chemical stimuli depend
   much more strongly on intercellular mechanical connections than on
   biochemical cues in both stimulated tissues and adjacent cells. We
   investigate how the cell contractility is triggered within an embryonic
   epithelial sheet by local ligand stimulation and coordinates a
   long-range contraction response. Our custom microfluidic control system
   allows spatiotemporally controlled stimulation with extracellular ATP,
   which results in locally distinct contractility followed by mechanical
   strain pattern formation. The stimulation-response circuit exposed here
   provides a better understanding of how morphogenetic processes integrate
   responses to stimulation and how intercellular responses are transmitted
   across multiple cells. These findings may enable one to create a
   biological actuator that actively drives morphogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-hybrid devices, which integrate biological cells with synthetic
   components, have opened a new path in miniaturized systems with the
   potential to provide actuation and control for systems down to a few
   microns in size. Here, we address the challenge of remotely controlling
   bio-hybrid microswimmers propelled by multiple bacterial cells. These
   devices have been proposed as a viable method for targeted drug delivery
   but have also been shown to exhibit stochastic motion. We demonstrate a
   method of remote magnetic control that significantly reduces the
   stochasticity of the motion, enabling steering control. The demonstrated
   microswimmers consist of multiple Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens)
   bacteria attached to a 6 mu m-diameter superparamagnetic bead. We
   characterize their motion and define the parameters governing their
   controllability. We show that the microswimmers can be controlled along
   two-dimensional (2-D) trajectories using weak magnetic fields (<= 10 mT)
   and can achieve 2-D swimming speeds up to 7.3 mu m s(-1). This magnetic
   steering approach can be integrated with sensory-based steering in
   future work, enabling new control strategies for bio-hybrid
   microsystems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a multi-period mixed-integer linear
   programming model for optimal enterpriselevel planning of industrial gas
   operations. The objective is to minimize the total cost of production
   and distribution of liquid products by coordinating production decisions
   at multiple plants and distribution decisions at multiple depots.
   Production decisions include production modes and rates that determine
   power consumption. Distribution decisions involve source, destination,
   quantity, route, and time of each truck delivery. The selection of
   routes is a critical factor of the distribution cost. The main goal of
   this contribution is to assess the benefits of optimal coordination of
   production and distribution. The proposed methodology has been tested on
   small, medium, and large size examples. The results show that
   significant benefits can be obtained with higher coordination among
   plants/depots in order to fulfill a common set of shared customer
   demands. The application to real industrial size test cases is also
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The expected urbanization of the planet in the coming century coupled
   with aging infrastructure in developed regions, increasing complexity of
   man-made systems, and pressing climate change impacts have created
   opportunities for reassessing the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in cities and how they contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Modern urbanization is predicated on complex, increasingly
   coupled infrastructure systems, and energy use continues to be largely
   met from fossil fuels. Until energy infrastructures evolve away from
   carbon-based fuels, GHG emissions are critically tied to the
   urbanization process. Further complicating the challenge of decoupling
   urban growth from GHG emissions are lock-in effects and
   interdependencies. This paper synthesizes state-of-the-art thinking for
   transportation, fuels, buildings, water, electricity, and waste systems
   and finds that GHG emissions assessments tend to view these systems as
   static and isolated from social and institutional systems. Despite
   significant understanding of methods and technologies for reducing
   infrastructure-related GHG emissions, physical, institutional, and
   cultural constraints continue to work against us, pointing to knowledge
   gaps that must be addressed. This paper identifies three challenge
   themes to improve our understanding of the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in urbanization processes and position these increasingly
   complex systems for low-carbon growth. The challenges emphasize how we
   can reimagine the role of infrastructure in the future and how people,
   institutions, and ecological systems interface with infrastructure.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{78-98}},

Abstract = {{The reason for the lack of consensus on correlations between
   environmental performance and competitiveness may lie in scholars
   neglecting eco-innovation typology. To fill this gap, this study
   conducted regression analysis on 245 Chinese enterprises. The survey
   indicates the organizational eco-innovation is the most common with a
   ratio of 38.3\%, then followed by process ecoinnovation with 32.7\%,
   product eco-innovation with 163\% and endof-pipe eco-innovation with
   12.7\%. The findings demonstrate that different types of eco-innovation
   do have significant it on environmental performance and competitiveness.
   Firm size has differing impacts on environmental performance and
   competitiveness, being significantly positively associated with the
   former and not with the latter. Environmental regulation creates a
   positive effect on both firms' environmental performance and
   competitiveness, while the implementation of environmental regulation
   only significantly affects a firm's environmental performance and not
   its competitiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Complex software systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in

   Ensuring the safety of these systems is crucial, as they can have subtly

   This paper advocates the use of formal verification techniques and in
   particular theorem proving for hybrid software-intensive systems as a
   well-founded complementary approach to the classical aerospace
   verification and validation techniques, such as testing or simulation.
   As an illustration of these techniques, a novel lateral midair
   collision-avoidance maneuver is studied in an ideal setting, without
   accounting for the uncertainties of the physical reality. The challenges

   applications is then detailed, and proposals are given on how to address

   unsupervised clustering algorithm is presented and evaluated to enable
   autonomous partitioning of appliances signature space (i.e. feature
   space) for applications in electricity consumption disaggregation. The
   algorithm is based on hierarchical clustering and uses the
   characteristics of a cluster binary tree to determine the distance
   threshold for pruning the tree without a priori information. The
   algorithm determines the partition of a feature space recursively to
   account for multi-scale nature of the binary cluster tree. Evaluation of
   the algorithm was carried out using metrics for accuracy and cluster
   quality (proposed in this study) on a fully labeled data set that was
   collected and processed in a real residential setting. The algorithm
   performance in accurate partitioning of the feature space and the effect
   of different feature extraction techniques were presented and discussed.

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We examine the cost of carbon dioxide mitigation to consumers in
   restructured USA markets under two policy instruments, a carbon price
   and a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). To estimate the effect of
   policies on market clearing prices, we constructed hourly economic
   dispatch models of the generators in PJM and in ERCOT. We find that the
   cost effectiveness of policies for consumers is strongly dependent on
   the price of natural gas and on the characteristics of the generators in
   the dispatch stack. If gas prices are low (similar to\$4/MMBTU), a
   technology-agnostic, rational consumer seeking to minimize costs would
   prefer a carbon price over an RPS in both regions. Expensive gas
   (similar to\$7/MMBTU) requires a high carbon price to induce fuel
   switching and this leads to wealth transfers from consumers to low
   carbon producers. The RPS may be more cost effective for consumers
   because the added energy supply lowers market clearing prices and
   reduces CO2 emissions. We find that both policies have consequences in
   capacity markets and that the RPS can be more cost effective than a
   carbon price under certain circumstances: continued excess supply of
   capacity, retention of nuclear generators, and high natural gas prices.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent sustainability research has focused on urban systems given their
   high share of environmental impacts and potential for centralized impact
   mitigation. Recent research emphasizes descriptive statistics from
   place-based case studies to argue for policy action. This limits the
   potential for general insights and decision support. Here, we implement
   generalized linear and multiple linear regression analyses to obtain
   more robust insights on the relationship between urbanization and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the US We used consistently derived
   county-level scope 1 and scope 2 GHG inventories for our response
   variable while predictor variables included dummy-coded variables for
   county geographic type (central, outlying, and nonmetropolitan), median
   household income, population density, and climate indices (heating
   degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD)). We find that there is
   not enough statistical evidence indicating per capita scope 1 and 2
   emissions differ by geographic type, ceteris paribus. These results are
   robust for different assumed electricity emissions factors. We do find
   statistically significant differences in per capita emissions by sector
   for different county types, with transportation and residential
   emissions highest in nonmetropolitan (rural) counties, transportation
   emissions lowest in central counties, and commercial sector emissions
   highest in central counties. These results indicate the importance of
   regional land use and transportation dynamics when planning local
   emissions mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) on adhesion between Parylene-C
   (Px) and silicon is investigated through the use of peel tests and
   contact angle tests. These tests allow measurement of the adhesive
   forces and investigation of the possible mechanisms for variations in
   adhesion that can be exploited in processes that require devices to be
   peeled from their substrate to release them after they are fabricated.
   An analytical framework is used to quantify the upper limit of adhesion
   on the basis of the geometric and material properties of a device. It
   was found that the modulation of adhesion between Px and Si by treatment
   with HMDS is largely due to the increase in dispersive surface energy of
   treated Si over the range 5.3-18.1 mJ/m(2) based on measured contact
   angles of 46.3 degrees-74.9 degrees with DI water and 36.2 degrees-55.7

   equal-volume mapping from the cube to the unit ball, followed by an
   inverse generalized Lambert projection to either of the two unit
   quaternion hemispheres. The new projection provides a one-to-one mapping
   between a grid in the cube and elements of the special orthogonal group
   SO(3), i.e., 3D rotations. We provide connections to other rotation
   representation schemes, including the Rodrigues-Frank vector and the
   homochoric parameterizations, and illustrate the new mapping through

Title = {{Agility and Performance in Elastic Distributed Storage}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON STORAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Elastic storage systems can be expanded or contracted to meet current
   demand, allowing servers to be turned off or used for other tasks.
   However, the usefulness of an elastic distributed storage system is
   limited by its agility: how quickly it can increase or decrease its
   number of servers. Due to the large amount of data they must migrate
   during elastic resizing, state of the art designs usually have to make
   painful trade-offs among performance, elasticity, and agility.
   This article describes the state of the art in elastic storage and a new
   system, called SpringFS, that can quickly change its number of active
   servers, while retaining elasticity and performance goals. SpringFS uses
   a novel technique, termed bounded write offloading, that restricts the
   set of servers where writes to overloaded servers are redirected. This
   technique, combined with the read offloading and passive migration
   policies used in SpringFS, minimizes the work needed before deactivation
   or activation of servers. Analysis of real-world traces from Hadoop
   deployments at Facebook and various Cloudera customers and experiments
   with the SpringFS prototype confirm SpringFS's agility, show that it
   reduces the amount of data migrated for elastic resizing by up to two
   orders of magnitude, and show that it cuts the percentage of active
   servers required by 67-82\%, outdoing state-of-the-art designs by
   6-120\%.}},

Abstract = {{Design for manufacturability (DFM) is essential because of the
   formidable challenges encountered in nano-scale integrated circuit (IC)
   fabrication. Unfortunately, it is difficult for designers to understand
   the cost-benefit tradeoff when tuning their design through DFM to
   achieve better manufacturability. This paper attempts to assist the
   designer in meeting this challenge by providing a methodology, called
   rule assessment of defect-affected regions (RADAR), which uses
   failing-IC diagnosis results to systematically evaluate the
   effectiveness of DFM rules. RADAR is applied to the fail data from a 90
   nm Nvidia graphics processing unit to demonstrate its viability.
   Specifically, evaluation of various DFM rules revealed that
   via-enclosure rules play a more important role than the density-related
   rules. The yield impact of resolving violations is also quantified. In
   addition, comprehensive simulation experiments have shown RADAR to be
   accurate and effective for performing DFM evaluation.}},

   spectroscopy have been used to measure the complex specific heat and
   dielectric constant over a wide temperature range on heating and cooling
   for a negative dielectric anisotropy alkoxyphenylbenzoate liquid
   crystal, denoted 9OO4. The MDSC experimental parameters were varied in
   order to yield quasi-static specific heat results and the same base scan
   rate was used for the dielectric measurements. On cooling, 9OO4 exhibits
   a typical weakly first-order isotropic to nematic then a continuous
   nematic to smectic-A phase sequence followed by a monotropic smectic-C
   and smectic-B phases before crystallizing. The smectic-B conversion is
   very slow, even for our quasi-static scan parameters. On heating, the
   crystal phase super-heats and exhibits a strong first-order transition
   into an unknown smectic phase that itself converts to the smectic-A
   phase via a first-order, highly rate dependent, phase transition. The
   nematic-smectic-A transition has an unusual character given the

Abstract = {{The concurrent evaluation of the vibration eigenfrequencies in densely
   polymer-tethered particle systems ({''}particle brushes{''}) by
   Brillouin light scattering and elastodynamic theory reveals a
   distinctive change of acoustic eigenmode formation associated with
   polymer graft modification of colloidal particles. The eigenfrequencies
   of particle brushes reveal a characteristic red-shift compared to
   uniform core-shell particles that can only be rationalized by assuming
   imperfect boundary conditions and anisotropic elastic properties of the
   graft layer. The distinct characteristics of vibration modes in particle
   brush materials provide direct evidence for the implications of chain
   confinement on the nanomechanical properties of tethered chains. The
   results highlight a rich and hitherto unexplored parameter-space for
   controlling properties and interactions in particle-brush based systems
   that could spur the development of hybrid materials with novel
   functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{A rock fragmentation process is simulated during mechanical cutting of
   rock using an explicit finite element code, LS-DYNA. In the simulation,
   a cutting tool is orthogonally moved against stationary rock materials
   made of sandstone and limestone. Rock material properties have been
   incorporated using an advanced damage constitute material model.
   Simulations were performed for various rake angles at different cutting
   velocities and cutting depths. The variation of cutting forces,
   stresses, rock fragment morphology and the character of fragment
   formation have been investigated. Overall, the results indicate that the
   explicit FEM is a powerful tool for simulating rock cutting and the
   fragmentation process. More specifically, the separation of rock
   fragments from the base rock slab was accurately predicted using the
   numerical model. The cutting forces and rock fragment characteristics
   were strongly influenced by rake angle when compared to cutting tool
   velocities for a given depth of cut. This information is shown to be
   highly pertinent to better understanding cutting rates and tool wear.

Abstract = {{This paper reports on monolithically integrated multifrequency wideband
   radio frequency (RF) filters based on two-port laterally vibrating
   lithium niobate microelectromechanical (MEMS) resonators (LVRs).
   Two-port MEMS resonators based on transferred lithium niobate thin film
   are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Self-coupled RF filters
   are implemented by cascading two identical two-port resonators. Modified
   Mason's models are used to predict the resonators and filters
   performance. A good agreement is attained between theory and
   experimental results. The fabricated two-port devices with center
   frequencies at 500 and 750 MHz exhibit electromechanical coupling
   coefficients (k(t)(2)) of 8\% and 14.6\%, respectively. As a result, the
   self-coupled RF filters formed by these resonators are capable of low
   loss (4 dB) and wideband filtering. Fractional bandwidth of 2\% and
   3.9\% have been achieved-the highest reported for MEMS LVRs. This paper
   shows that RF-MEMS filters based on LVRs can achieve sufficient
   bandwidth to cover most of the existing commercial standards.

Title = {{To sort or not to sort: the impact of spike-sorting on neural decoding
   performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising technology
   for restoring motor ability to paralyzed patients. Spiking-based BCIs
   have successfully been used in clinical trials to control
   multi-degree-of-freedom robotic devices. Current implementations of
   these devices require a lengthy spike-sorting step, which is an obstacle
   to moving this technology from the lab to the clinic. A viable
   alternative is to avoid spike-sorting, treating all threshold crossings
   of the voltage waveform on an electrode as coming from one putative
   neuron. It is not known, however, how much decoding information might be
   lost by ignoring spike identity. Approach. We present a full analysis of
   the effects of spike-sorting schemes on decoding performance.
   Specifically, we compare how well two common decoders, the optimal
   linear estimator and the Kalman filter, reconstruct the arm movements of
   non-human primates performing reaching tasks, when receiving input from
   various sorting schemes. The schemes we tested included: using threshold
   crossings without spike-sorting; expert-sorting discarding the noise;
   expert-sorting, including the noise as if it were another neuron; and
   automatic spike-sorting using waveform features. We also decoded from a
   joint statistical model for the waveforms and tuning curves, which does
   not involve an explicit spike-sorting step. Main results. Discarding the
   threshold crossings that cannot be assigned to neurons degrades
   decoding: no spikes should be discarded. Decoding based on spike-sorted
   units outperforms decoding based on electrodes voltage crossings:
   spike-sorting is useful. The four waveform based spike-sorting methods
   tested here yield similar decoding efficiencies: a fast and simple
   method is competitive. Decoding using the joint waveform and tuning
   model shows promise but is not consistently superior. Significance. Our
   results indicate that simple automated spike-sorting performs as well as
   the more computationally or manually intensive methods used here. Even
   basic spike-sorting adds value to the low-threshold waveform-crossing
   methods often employed in BCI decoding.}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxides are attractive candidates for low cost, earth-abundant
   electrocatalysts. However, owing to their insulating nature, their
   widespread application has been limited. Nanostructuring allows the use
   of insulating materials by enabling tunneling as a possible charge
   transport mechanism. We demonstrate this using TiO2 as a model system
   identifying a critical thickness, based on theoretical analysis, of
   about similar to 4 nm for tunneling at a current density of similar to 1
   mA/cm(2). This is corroborated by electrochemical measurements on
   conformal thin films synthesized using atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   identifying a similar critical thickness. We generalize the theoretical
   analysis deriving a relation between the critical thickness and the
   location of valence band maximum relative to the limiting potential of
   the electrochemical surface process. The critical thickness sets the
   optimum size of the nanoparticle oxide electrocatalyst and this provides
   an important nanostructuring requirement for metal oxide electrocatalyst
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design, fabrication, characterization, and
   scaling analysis of novel buckling-based nano-electromechanical relays
   that use, for the first time, piezoelectric actuation. The generated
   stress from anchored piezoelectric films is employed to buckle a
   clamped-clamped beam to connect suspended source and drain terminals,
   while the residual stress in the beam is used to control the actuation
   voltage. This demonstration is the first of its kind to exploit residual
   stress to deliver a highly scalable switching mechanism that exhibits
   low actuation voltage (similar to 1.8 V), very fast switching (similar
   to 80 ns), and uniquely achieves an equivalent electric body bias via
   mechanical methods. Finite-element analysis and analytical simulations
   show a linear dependence of the switching voltage on the residual
   stress, while the voltage versus stress tuning slope is reduced linearly
   with scaling the piezoelectric film thickness (-16.6 mV/MPa for 10-nm
   thick aluminum nitride film). A scaling analysis shows that millivolt
   switching is possible for aggressively miniaturized relays, which
   highlights the great impact this technology could have on demonstrating
   ultralow power digital circuits and memories.}},

Abstract = {{This paper address the modeling of crude oil operations in refineries
   assuming that all properties blend linearly Guidelines are given on how
   to generate a Resource Task Network superstructure that implicitly
   handles the complex logistics, while extending the scope of a well-known
   continuous-time formulation to variable recipe tasks with multiple input
   materials. The new single time grid formulation has the advantage of
   avoiding computationally inefficient big M constraints unline previously
   proposed unit-specific and priority-slot based models. Through the
   solution of a set of test problems from the literature, we show that the
   resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programs can be solved close to global
   optimality by the commerical solver GloMIQO for the objective of gross
   margin maximization but not for operating cost minimization. We also
   show that adopting a two-step MILP-NLP algorithm where the mixed-integer
   linear relaxation is derived from multiparametric disaggregation can
   reduce the optimality gap by orders of magnitude.}},

Title = {{Distillation Blending and Cutpoint Temperature Optimization Using
   Monotonic Interpolation}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique using monotonic interpolation to blend and cut
   distillation temperatures and evaporations for petroleum fuels in an
   optimization environment' is proposed. Blending distillation
   temperatures are well-known in simulations whereby cumulative
   evaporations at specific temperatures are mixed together, these data
   points are used in piece wise cubic spline interpolations to revert back
   to the distillation temperatures. Our method replaces the splines with
   monotonic splines to eliminate the well-known oscillation effect called
   Runge's phenomenon, and to allow the distillation curve itself to be
   adjusted by optimizing its initial and final boiling points, known as
   cutpoints. By optimizing both the recipes of the blended material and
   its blending component distillation curves, very significant benefits
   can be achieved, especially given the global push toward ultralow sulfur
   fuels (ULSF), because of the increase in natural gas plays, reducing the
   demand for other oil distillates. Four examples are provided to
   highlight and demonstrate the technique, where we have good agreement
   between the predicted actual evaporation curves of the blends.}},

Title = {{MultiMo-Bat: A biologically inspired integrated jumping-gliding robot}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, development, and verification of a
   miniature integrated jumping and gliding robot, the MultiMo-Bat, which
   is inspired by the locomotion strategy of vampire bats. This 115.6 g
   robot exhibits high jumping and gliding performance, reaching heights of
   over 3 m, to overcome obstacles in the environment. The MultiMo-Bat was
   developed by a novel integrated design strategy that combines jumping
   and gliding locomotion modes and minimizes the necessary actuation and
   structural components by sharing a significant portion of the components
   required for each mode; nearly 70\% of the total robot mass is utilized
   by both modes. This results in overall low mass, low volume, and high
   cooperation between the modes which allows for the preservation of over
   80\% of the performance of the independent jumping locomotion mode when
   combined. This not only allows for two high-performance locomotion
   modes, but also for all of the necessary actuation components to be on
   board. Key considerations and components of the design are discussed in
   the context of the integrated design approach. A prototype of the system
   is constructed and experimentally tested in various configurations to
   elucidate the overall system and integration performance. Finally,
   metrics are developed to begin to quantify the level and performance of
   the integrated approach as well as allow it to be compared to other
   mechanical and biological systems. This type of jumping and gliding
   robot can be used to explore, inspect, and monitor unstructured
   environments for security and environment monitoring applications.}},
