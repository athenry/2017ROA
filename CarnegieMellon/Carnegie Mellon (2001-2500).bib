Abstract = {{Determination of make-up cooling water scaling and corrosion potentials
   for power plants is essential to prevent cooling system fouling
   challenges linked to source water quality. In this study, a statistical
   model is proposed to evaluate the probability that scaling or corrosion
   could occur. These probabilities were determined from derived
   distributions for the Langelier saturation index (LSI) and the
   aggressive index (AI), computed from a fitted joint normal distribution
   for pH, log{[}Ca2+], log({[}Ca2+]+{[}Mg2+]), and log{[}Alk]. In most
   cases only one outcome (scaling or corrosion) exhibited a probability of
   concern, though highly variable source waters could exhibit significant
   probability for both. To illustrate application of the method,
   freshwater and treated municipal wastewater samples collected from the
   western Pennsylvanian region were analyzed for alkalinity, pH, {[}Mg2+]
   and {[}Ca2+] concentrations. The LSI and AI were calculated using the
   measured characteristics of the water samples, and their observed
   distributions were compared to the derived normal distributions for
   each. This study used the uncertainty associated with water quality
   inputs to evaluate the uncertainty of scaling and corrosion potentials,
   and provides a practical approach for power plant operators to evaluate
   the uncertainty associated with scaling and corrosion indices of cooling
   waters without use of expensive software or complicated coding.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-one alkaline industrial wastes from a wide range of industrial
   processes were acquired and screened for application in an aqueous
   carbon sequestration process. The wastes were evaluated for their
   potential to leach polyvalent cations and base species. Following mixing
   with a simple sodium bicarbonate solution, chemistries of the aqueous
   and solid phases were analyzed. Experimental results indicated that the
   most reactive materials were capable of sequestering between 77\% and
   93\% of the available carbon under experimental conditions in four
   hours. These materials cement kiln dust, spray dryer absorber ash, and
   circulating dry scrubber ash - are thus good candidates for detailed,
   process-oriented studies. Chemical equilibrium modeling indicated that
   amorphous calcium carbonate is likely responsible for the observed
   sequestration. High variability and low reactive fractions render many
   other materials less attractive for further pursuit without considering
   preprocessing or activation techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for constructing a
   volumetric T-spline from B-reps inspired by constructive solid geometry
   Boolean operations. By solving a harmonic field with proper boundary
   conditions, the input surface is automatically decomposed into regions
   that are classified into two groups represented, topologically, by
   either a cube or a torus. We perform two Boolean operations (union and
   difference) with the primitives and convert them into polycubes through
   parametric mapping. With these polycubes, octree subdivision is carried
   out to obtain a volumetric T-mesh, and sharp features detected from the
   input model are also preserved. An optimization is then performed to
   improve the quality of the volumetric T-spline. The obtained T-spline
   surface is C (2) everywhere except the local region surrounding
   irregular nodes, where the surface continuity is elevated from C (0) to
   G (1). Finally, we extract trivariate B,zier elements from the
   volumetric T-spline and use them directly in isogeometric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses kinetic parameter estimation for a high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) slurry process based on fitting molecular weight
   distributions (MWDs). From the process model, we conduct an estimability
   analysis by assessing the relative sensitivity between output variables
   and kinetic parameters as well as confidence intervals. This determines
   which parameters can be estimated. Conversely, a major challenge remains
   with the solution of an ill-conditioned parameter estimation problem
   with MWD as the output variable. To overcome the convergence
   difficulties with the associated problem, we develop a novel multistep
   methodology where we first obtain MWD parameters by matching to data and
   then estimate kinetic parameters by matching to the regressed MWD
   parameters. Computational results and eigenvalue analysis show this
   multistep methodology separates an ill-conditioned problem into two
   well-conditioned subproblems. Moreover, we consider simulation-based and
   industrial HDPE case studies. These results demonstrate the
   applicability, potential, and efficiency of this solution procedure. (c)

Abstract = {{There are four key aspects for water use in hydraulic fracturing,

   availability of water. The objective is to minimize expected
   transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal cost while accounting
   for the revenue from gas production. Assuming freshwater sources, river
   withdrawal data, location of wellpads, and treatment facilities are
   given, the goal is to determine an optimal fracturing schedule in

Abstract = {{Automatic face recognition performance has been steadily improving over
   years of research, however it remains significantly affected by a number
   of factors such as illumination, pose, expression, resolution and other
   factors that can impact matching scores. The focus of this paper is the
   pose problem which remains largely overlooked in most real-world
   applications. Specifically, we focus on one-to-one matching scenarios
   where a query face image of a random pose is matched against a set of
   gallery images. We propose a method that relies on two fundamental
   components: (a) A 3D modeling step to geometrically correct the
   viewpoint of the face. For this purpose, we extend a recent technique
   for efficient synthesis of 3D face models called 3D Generic Elastic
   Model. (b) A sparse feature extraction step using subspace modeling and
   l(1)-minimization to induce pose-tolerance in coefficient space. This in
   return enables the synthesis of an equivalent frontal-looking face,
   which can be used towards recognition. We show significant performance
   improvements in verification rates compared to commercial matchers, and
   also demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method with respect to
   degrading input quality. We find that the proposed technique is able to
   match non-frontal images to other non-frontal images of varying angles.}},

Abstract = {{Explicit expressions for the minimum free energy of a linear
   viscoelastic material and Noll's definition of state are used here to
   explore spatial energy decay estimates for viscoelastic bodies, in the
   full dynamical case and in the quasi-static approximation. In the
   inertial case, Chirita et al. obtained a certain spatial decay
   inequality for a space time integral over a portion of the body and over
   a finite time interval of the total mechanical energy. This involves the
   work done on histories, which is not a function of state in general.
   Here it is shown that for free energies which are functions of state and
   obey a certain reasonable property, the spatial decay of the
   corresponding space time integral is stronger than the one involving the
   work done on the past history. It turns out that the bound obtained is
   optimal for the minimal free energy. Two cases are discussed for the
   quasi-static approximation. The first case deals with general states, so
   that general histories belonging to the equivalence class of any given
   state can be considered. The continuity of the stress functional with
   respect to the norm based on the minimal free energy is proved, and the
   energy measure based on the minimal free energy turns out to obey the
   decay inequality derived Chirita et al. for the quasi-static case. The
   second case explores a crucial point for viscoelastic materials, namely
   that the response is influenced by the rate of application of loads.
   Quite surprisingly, the analysis of this phenomenon in the context of
   Saint-Venant principles has never been carried out explicitly before,
   even in the linear case. This effect is explored by considering states,
   the related histories of which are sinusoidal. The spatial decay
   parameter is shown to be frequency-dependent, i.e. it depends on the
   rate of load application, and it is proved that of those considered, the
   most conservative estimate of the frequency-dependent decay is
   associated with the minimal free energy. A comparison is made of the
   results for sinusoidal histories at low frequencies and general
   histories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Experiential Conjoint Analysis: An Experience-Based Method for
   Eliciting, Capturing, and Modeling Consumer Preference}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, consumer preference is modeled in terms of preference for
   the aesthetic and functional features of a product. This paper
   introduces a new means to model consumer preference that accounts for
   not only for how a product looks and functions but also how it feels to
   interact with it. Traditional conjoint-based approaches to preference
   modeling require a participant to judge preference for a product based
   upon a static 2D visual representation or a feature list. While the
   aesthetic forms and functional features of a product are certainly
   important, the decision to buy or not to buy a product often depends on
   more, namely, the experience or feel of use. To address the importance
   of the product experience, we introduce the concept of experiential
   conjoint analysis, a method to mathematically capture preference for a
   product through experience-based (experiential) preference judgments.
   Experiential preference judgments are made based upon the use, or
   simulated use, of a product. For many products, creating enough physical
   prototypes to generate a preference model is cost prohibitive. In this
   work, virtual reality (VR) technologies are used to allow the
   participant an interactive virtual product experience, provided at
   little investment. The results of this work show that providing
   additional interaction-based (interactional) information about a product
   through a product experience does not affect the predictive ability of
   the resulting preference models. This work additionally demonstrates
   that the preference judgments of virtual product representations are
   more similar to preference judgments of real products than preference
   judgments of 2D product representations are. When examining similarity
   of modeled preference, experiential conjoint is found to be superior to
   visual conjoint with respect to mean absolute error (MAE), but with
   respect to correlation no significant difference between visual and
   experiential is found.}},

   of critical size calvarial bone defects in mice}},
Journal = {{BONE}},

Abstract = {{Background: A major problem in craniofacial surgery is non-healing bone
   defects. Autologous reconstruction remains the standard of care for
   these cases. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) therapy has proven its
   clinical utility, although non-targeted adverse events occur due to the
   high milligram-level doses used. Ongoing efforts explore the use of
   different growth factors, cytokines, or chemokines, as well as
   co-therapy to augment healing.
   Methods: Here we utilize inkjet-based biopatterning to load acellular
   DermaMatrix delivery matrices with nanogram-level doses of BMP-2,
   stromal cell-derived factor-1 beta (SDF-1 beta), transforming growth
   factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), or co-therapies thereof. We tested the
   hypothesis that bioprinted SDF-1 beta co-delivery enhances BMP-2 and
   TGF-beta 1-driven osteogenesis both in-vitro and in-vivo using a mouse
   calvarial critical size defect (CSD) model.
   Results: Our data showed that BMP-2 bioprinted in low-doses induced
   significant new bone formation by four weeks post-operation. TGF-beta 1
   was less effective compared to BMP-2, and SDF-1 beta therapy did not
   enhance osteogenesis above control levels. However, co-delivery of BMP-2
   + SDF-1 beta was shown to augment BMP-2-induced bone formation compared
   to BMP-2 alone. In contrast, co-delivery of TGF-beta 1 + SDF-1 beta
   decreased bone healing compared to TGF-1 beta alone. This was further
   confirmed in vitro by osteogenic differentiation studies using MC3T3-E1
   pre-osteoblasts.
   Conclusions: Our data indicates that sustained release delivery of a
   low-dose growth factor therapy using biopatterning technology can aid in
   healing CSD injuries. SDF-1 beta augments the ability for BMP-2 to drive
   healing, a result confirmed in vivo and in vitro; however, because SDF-1
   beta is detrimental to TGF-1 beta-driven osteogenesis, its effect on
   osteogenesis is not universal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Theory and experimental results for the streaming potential measured in
   the vicinity of a rotating porous disk-shaped sample are described.
   Rotation of the sample on its axis draws liquid into its face and casts
   it from the periphery. Advection within the sample engenders streaming
   current and streaming potential that are proportional to the zeta
   potential and the disk's major dimensions. When Darcy's law applies, the
   streaming potential is proportional to the square of the rotation at low
   rate but becomes invariant with rotation at high rate. The streaming
   potential is invariant with the sample's permeability at low rate and is
   proportional to the inverse square of the permeability at high rate.
   These predictions were tested by determining the zeta potential and
   permeability of the loop side of Velcro, a sample otherwise difficult to
   characterize; reasonable values of -56 mV for zeta and 8.7 x 10(-9) m(2)
   for the permeability were obtained. This approach offers the ability to
   determine both the zeta potential and the permeability of materials
   having open structures. Compressing them into a porous plug is
   unnecessary. As part of the development of the theory, a convenient
   formula for a flow-weighted volume-averaged space-charge density of the
   porous medium, -epsilon zeta/k, was obtained, where epsilon is the
   permittivity, zeta is the zeta potential, and k is the Darcy
   permeability. The formula is correct when Smoluchowski's equation and
   Darcy's law are both valid.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis, characterization, and self-assembly of a series of linear

   approximate to f(PI)) and various fractions of the middle PS block (70.8
   vol \% <= f(PS) <= 75.6 vol \%) is reported. A range of
   azide-functionalized poly(ethylene oxide-b-styrene) diblock copolymers
   were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene
   using the same batch of PEO-macroinitiator, followed by
   azide-functionalization. Monohydroxyl-terminated poly(cis-1,4-isoprene)
   was first alkyne-functionalized and then sequentially attached to
   azide-functionalized PEO-PS via copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne
   cycloaddition reaction, producing PEO-PS-PI triblock copolymers with low
   dispersity. Bulk samples of each linear triblock copolymer reveal the
   formation of a binary microdomain structure in which a PS and PI domains
   mix to form a uniform matrix for spherical PEO microdomains, and the PRO
   microdomains are arranged in a BCC lattice. Additionally, the thin film
   ordering of these triblock copolymers was investigated using a
   high-humidity solvent annealing process, both with and without low
   concentrations of a lithium salt. The morphology was analyzed by atomic
   force microscopy and GISAXS, revealing layers of spherical PEO domains
   arranged with in-plane hexagonal symmetry. The inclusion of salt
   increased both the size and periodicity of PEO domains.}},

Volume = {{1360}},

Abstract = {{The covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to
   pharmaceutical proteins, ``PEGylation{''}, often results in a population
   of conjugate species that includes differing numbers and locations of
   attached PEG chains. As some portion of this population may be
   biologically inactive, a challenging separation problem arises. An
   interesting alternative to the size-based resolution of these conjugates
   involves the use of reversed phase chromatography (RPC), treating the
   PEG moieties as hydrophobic purification tags. The use of RPC raises
   concerns about protein denaturation in the mobile and on the stationary
   phase. Here, the potential dual role of conjugated PEG chains as both
   group-specific separation tags and as steric or structural stabilizers
   in RPC was explored. In this work, RPC with C18-based media was used to
   resolve PEGylation number variants of ribonuclease A (RNase A) and
   apo-alpha-lactalbumin (apo-alpha Lac) in a neutral pH mobile phase.
   While the attachment of 20 kDa PEG molecules did not modify the
   structures of RNase A and apo-alpha Lac, as confirmed by structural
   analysis using circular dichroism, exposure to the mobile phase
   modifier, acetonitrile, and to the C18 media during separation resulted
   in perturbations to both the secondary and tertiary structures of all
   species studied. RNase A experienced small perturbations that were
   mediated to some extent by PEGylation; these results were consistent
   with activity assays which showed that PEGylated RNase A species
   retained native-like activity after RPC separation. Apo-alpha Lac, a
   more hydrophobic and less stable protein than RNase A, experienced
   extensive structural perturbations regardless of PEGylation state. The

Abstract = {{Oxide-based resistive switching devices are a leading contender for the
   next generation memories. Before use, each device has to go through a
   conditioning process called electroformation which has been suggested to
   be initiated by the accumulation of oxygen vacancies. Here, experimental
   evidence is presented which shows that both Ta2O5-x-and TiO2-x-based
   crossbar devices, exhibit characteristic electronic instability leading
   to a reversible constriction of the current flow to a narrow filament
   prior to permanent change. Thus, it is asserted, electroformation is
   initiated through purely electronic and reversible events, to be
   followed later by structural changes in the material, like oxygen
   vacancy redistribution. Furthermore, the electronic instability
   responsible for electroformation also gives rise to negative
   differential resistance (NDR) and that this characteristics appears to
   involve two distinct mechanisms: a thermal one in which Joule heating
   causes resistance to decrease as current increases and a second
   electronic mechanism that appears not to require Joule heating for NDR.
   Using a combination of thermometry and thermal modeling, a
   self-consistent temperature and filament radius as a function of power
   are found for the 5 mu m cross-bar devices. In the thermal NDR regime,
   the filament appears to be similar to 500 nm in diameter and has a peak
   temperature of similar to 300 degrees C, while in the adiabatic regime,
   the estimated filament diameter is much smaller (< 50 nm) and the
   maximum temperature inside it exceeds 800 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design an integrated process for the production of
   diesel substitutes, biodiesel and glycerol ethers, from algae with
   internal production of the intermediates ethanol and isobutene. The
   starch from the algae is converted into glucose. Part of it is fermented
   to ethanol so that we produce the alcohol needed to transesterify the
   algae oil while the rest is fermented to isobutene, which is needed in
   the production of glycerol ethers to enhance biofuels production
   capacity. We use CHEMCAD coupled with MATLAB for the rigorous simulation
   of the integrated biorefinery and evaluate the algae composition for
   such integrated facility. This is followed by energy integration using
   SYNHEAT and a detailed economic analysis. The integrated facility has
   promising production cost for liquid fuels, 0.46 \$/gal, and an
   investment costs of \$205M, almost half the production cost and only and

Abstract = {{All science has uncertainty. Unless that uncertainty is communicated
   effectively, decision makers may put too much or too little faith in it.
   The information that needs to be communicated depends on the decisions
   that people face. Are they (i) looking for a signal (e.g., whether to
   evacuate before a hurricane), (ii) choosing among fixed options (e.g.,
   which medical treatment is best), or (iii) learning to create options
   (e.g., how to regulate nanotechnology)? We examine these three classes
   of decisions in terms of how to characterize, assess, and convey the
   uncertainties relevant to each. We then offer a protocol for summarizing
   the many possible sources of uncertainty in standard terms, designed to
   impose a minimal burden on scientists, while gradually educating those
   whose decisions depend on their work. Its goals are better decisions,
   better science, and better support for science.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{430}},

Abstract = {{Capacitive deionization (CDI) removes charged ions from aqueous
   solutions through entrapment in the electric double layer (EDL) when the
   porous electrodes are polarized. In this study, three types of activated
   carbon cloth (ACC) with different pore-size distributions were used to
   study the effect of pore characteristics on electrosorption during CDI.
   Removal of seven different monovalent ions was examined for each ACC in
   batch reactors under 5 different combinations of applied potential and
   ionic strength. Results show underlying sorption mechanisms in the meso-
   and micro-pores were different. Electrosorption in the mesopores is
   influenced by partially-distorted EDL caused by EDL overlapping.
   Sorption capacity increased with increasing applied potential or ionic
   strength as overlapping effects were reduced. In contrast, EDL in the
   microporous regions could be highly distorted resulting in enhanced
   sorption capacity, which cannot be adequately described using the
   classic EDL theories. Electrosorption density (i.e., sorption capacity
   normalized by pore volume) decreased as the
   mesoporosity-to-microporosity ratio increased. These results are in
   agreement with those obtained using mathematical modeling by other
   recent CDI studies. Charge efficiency values were between 20\% and 40\%
   and appear to be substantially influenced by Faradaic reactions and ion
   desorption from the electrode surfaces. These findings suggest that
   pore-size distribution of electrode materials, especially the
   meso/microporosity ratio, should be optimized for the removal of
   targeted ions by CDI and well characterized to conduct more precise CDI
   modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Nicotinamide: Computational and Experimental Studies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Sirtuins are key regulators of many cellular functions including cell
   growth, apoptosis, metabolism, and genetic control of age-related
   diseases. Sirtuins are themselves regulated by their cofactor
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) as well as their reaction
   product nicotinamide (NAM), the physiological concentrations of which
   vary during the process of aging. Nicotinamide inhibits sirtuins through
   the so-called base exchange pathway, wherein rebinding of the reaction
   product to the enzyme accelerates the reverse reaction. We investigated
   the mechanism of nicotinamide inhibition of human SIRT3, the major
   mitochondrial sirtuin deacetylase, in vitro and in silico using
   experimental kinetic analysis and Molecular Mechanics-Poisson
   Boltzmann/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-PB(GB) SA) binding affinity
   calculations with molecular dynamics sampling. Through experimental
   kinetic studies, we demonstrate that NAM inhibition of SIRT3 involves
   apparent competition between the inhibitor and the enzyme cofactor
   NAD(+), contrary to the traditional characterization of base exchange as
   noncompetitive inhibition. We report a model for base exchange
   inhibition that relates such kinetic properties to physicochemical
   properties, including the free energies of enzyme-ligand binding, and
   estimate the latter through the first reported computational binding
   affinity calculations for SIRT3:NAD(+), SIRT3:NAM, and analogous
   complexes for Sir2. The computational results support our kinetic model,
   establishing foundations for quantitative modeling of NAD(+)/NAM
   regulation of mammalian sirtuins during aging and the computational
   design of sirtuin activators that operate through alleviation of base
   exchange inhibition.}},

   superlattice period was between 5 and 10 nm. No superlattice peaks were
   observed in the (100)-oriented isostructural rs-superlattices deposited
   at 950 degrees C, indicating that a significant degree of interdiffusion
   occurred, but the amount was orientation dependent, as (111)-oriented
   isostructural rs-layers were similar at the two temperatures.
   Non-isostructural superlattices deposited at 950 degrees C that had
   (111)-oriented rs-layers and (001) h-TaN layers also exhibited little
   interdiffusion and, importantly, had a secondary hardness maximum near a
   chemical repeat period of 15 nm, rendering it the hardest superlattice
   for these longer chemical repeat periods. These composite results
   indicate that multi-functionality could be built into polycrystalline
   coatings because the phases, chemical stabilities, and hardness
   properties of TiN/TaN superlattices can be strongly dependent on local
   orientation and chemical periodicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The wear of the AFM tips has significant implications on the accuracy
   and throughput of the tip-based nanomanufacturing processes.
   Ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips
   that exhibit significantly lower wear rates compared to silicon and
   silicon nitride tips during the AFM application carry a strong potential
   to be effectively used during tip-based nanomanufacturing. In this
   paper, we present an experimental analysis of the wear of UNCD AFM tips
   during rotating tip-based mechanical nanomanufacturing (nanomilling).
   The diamond AFM tips are used as the nanotools to mechanically remove
   material from silicon and copper surfaces. The geometry of the tips is
   directly measured through non-contact AFM at various time points of the
   process. The acquired AFM images are then processed to quantify the
   progression of the tip wear in terms of wear volume, wear area, and
   change in tip radius and in tip height. The results of the analysis
   showed that the tips undergo two-phase wear process that consists of an
   early rapid break-in phase followed by a gradual steady-state phase. The
   wear rates experienced during nanomilling of silicon are shown to be
   more than an order of magnitude higher than those of copper. The
   analysis of the repeatability of the tip wear indicates that, for
   nominally identical process conditions and tip geometries, the tips
   could exhibit considerable variation in wear rates, particularly during
   the break-in phase. Without making any attempt on optimizing the process
   conditions, a cutting length of more than 240 mm is nanomilled at a
   constant depth of 150 nm on copper surfaces, within the life of a single
   nanotool. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Unique star-like polymeric architectures composed of bottlebrush arms
   and a molecular spoked wheel (MSW) core were prepared by atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP). A hexahydroxy-functionalized MSW
   (MSW6-OH) was synthesized and converted into a six-fold ATRP initiator
   (MSW6-Br). Linear chain arms were grafted from MSW6-Br and subsequently
   functionalized with ATRP moieties to form six-arm macroinitiators.
   Grafting of side chains from the macroinitiators yielded four different
   star-shaped bottlebrushes with varying lengths of arms and side chains,
   i.e., (450-g-20)(6), (450-g-40)(6), (300-g-60)(6), and (300-g-150)(6).
   Gel permeation chromatography analysis and molecular imaging by atomic
   force microscopy confirmed the formation of well-defined macromolecules
   with narrow molecular weight distributions. Upon adsorption to an
   aqueous substrate, the bottlebrush arms underwent prompt dissociation
   from the MSW core, followed by scission of covalent bonds in the
   bottlebrush backbones. The preferential cleavage of the arms is
   attributed to strong steric repulsion between bottlebrushes at the MSW
   branching center. Star-shaped macroinitiators may undergo aggregation
   which can be prevented by sonication.}},

Abstract = {{Separation of cells is a critical process for studying cell properties,
   disease diagnostics, and therapeutics. Cell sorting by acoustic waves
   offers a means to separate cells on the basis of their size and physical
   properties in a label-free, contactless, and biocompatible manner. The
   separation sensitivity and efficiency of currently available
   acoustic-based approaches, however, are limited, thereby restricting
   their widespread application in research and health diagnostics. In this
   work, we introduce a unique configuration of tilted-angle standing
   surface acoustic waves (taSSAW), which are oriented at an optimally
   designed inclination to the flow direction in the microfluidic channel.
   We demonstrate that this design significantly improves the efficiency
   and sensitivity of acoustic separation techniques. To optimize our
   device design, we carried out systematic simulations of cell
   trajectories, matching closely with experimental results. Using
   numerically optimized design of taSSAW, we successfully separated 2- and
   10-mu m-diameter polystyrene beads with a separation efficiency of
   similar to 99\%, and separated 7.3- and 9.9-mu m-polystyrene beads with
   an efficiency of similar to 97\%. We illustrate that taSSAW is capable
   of effectively separating particles-cells of approximately the same size
   and density but different compressibility. Finally, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the present technique for biological-biomedical
   applications by sorting MCF-7 human breast cancer cells from
   nonmalignant leukocytes, while preserving the integrity of the separated
   cells. The method introduced here thus offers a unique route for
   separating circulating tumor cells, and for label-free cell separation
   with potential applications in biological research, disease diagnostics,
   and clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper brings systematic methods for scenario tree generation to the

   general, data-driven optimization-based method for generating scenario
   trees that does not require strict assumptions on the probability
   distributions of the uncertain parameters. Using as a basis the Moment
   Matching Problem (MMP), originally proposed by Hoyland and Wallace
   (2001), we propose matching marginal (Empirical) Cumulative Distribution
   Function information of the uncertain parameters in order to cope with
   potentially under-specified MMP formulations. The new method gives rise
   to a Distribution Matching Problem (DMP) that is aided by predictive
   analytics. We present two approaches for generating multi-stage scenario
   trees by considering time series modeling and forecasting. The
   aforementioned techniques are illustrated with a production planning
   problem with uncertainty in production yield and correlated product
   demands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a resurgence of interest in developing ohmic switches to
   complement transistors in order to address challenges associated with
   electrical current leakage and lowering power consumption. A critical
   limitation is the reliability of their electrical contacts, which are
   prone to wear and hydrocarbon-induced contamination. These phenomena
   progressively inhibit signal transmission, eventually leading to device
   failure. We report on progress made towards converting the contamination
   into a highly conductive material. We show that Pt-coated microswitch
   contacts operating in the presence of O-2 experience limited contaminant
   accumulation even in hydrocarbon-rich environments. We then demonstrate
   that devices that have experienced contamination can recover their
   original performance when operated in a clean N-2:O-2 environment. Auger
   and Raman spectroscopy indicate that this resistance recovery is
   associated with the structural transformation of the contaminant as
   opposed to its removal and that the transformed contaminant may shield
   the Pt coating from wear.}},

Abstract = {{The pressure drop and friction factor of gas flow across an array of
   circular silicon micro-pillars with different diameters fabricated by
   deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) process were investigated. The
   pitch-to-diameter ratio (1.5 < S-T/d < 2.3) and the height-to-diameter
   aspect ratio (0.48 < H/d < 2.28) were found to affect the friction
   factor of the pillar array significantly. A new correlation, which
   considered the coupled effect of pillar spacing and aspect ratio, was
   proposed to predict the friction factor in a Reynolds number range of
   1-100. Silicon pillars with large artificial roughness amplitudes were
   also fabricated, and the effect of the roughness was studied in the
   laminar flow region. The results demonstrated that the pressure drop and
   the friction factor were reduced significantly (more than 50\%) for the
   pillar array with a large artificial roughness, which may be used to
   improve the cooling efficiency for the regenerator structures in

Abstract = {{Problem formulations and algorithms are considered for optimization
   problems with differential-algebraic equation (DAE) models. In
   particular, we provide an overview of direct methods, based on nonlinear
   programming (NLP), and indirect, or variational, methods. We further
   classify each method and tailor it to the appropriate applications. For
   direct methods, we briefly describe current approaches including the
   sequential approach (or single shooting), multiple shooting method, and
   the simultaneous collocation (or direct transcription) approach. In
   parallel to these strategies we discuss NLP algorithms for these methods
   and discuss optimality conditions and convergence properties. In
   particular, we present the simultaneous collocation approach, where both
   the state and control variable profiles are discretized. This approach
   allows a transparent handling of inequality constraints and unstable
   systems. Here, large scale nonlinear programming strategies are
   essential and a novel barrier method, called IPOPT, is described. This
   NLP algorithm incorporates a number of features for handling large-scale
   systems and improving global convergence. The overall approach is
   Newton-based with analytic second derivatives and this leads to fast
   convergence rates. Moreover, it allows us to consider the extension of
   these optimization formulations to deal with nonlinear model predictive
   control and real-time optimization. To illustrate these topics we
   consider a case study of a low density polyethylene (LDPE) reactor. This
   large-scale optimization problem allows us to apply off-line parameter
   estimation and on-line strategies that include state estimation,
   nonlinear model predictive control and dynamic real-time optimization.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{353-363}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Discussions on the appropriate policy design and level of incentive to
   promote renewable energy adoption and meet the 20/20/20 goals have
   spurred recently in the European Union. These discussions are also
   ongoing in Portugal, namely in what concerns the level and duration of
   feed-in tariffs that should be provided to independent power producers.
   This, in turn, raises the question of whether the past feed-in tariff
   levels were well designed to achieve the goals of a larger penetration
   of renewables in the Portuguese grid. The policies to induce wind
   adoption have led to a growth in wind installed capacity and share of
   electricity generated by wind in Portugal, but questions arise on their
   cost-effectiveness and whether alternative policy designs would have led
   to the same goal. In this work, we estimate profits made by wind
   independent power producers for wind parks that were connected in
   Portugal between 1992 and 2010, and conclude that the feed-in tariffs
   have overcompensated some wind power producers. We also discuss the
   recent changes in feed-in tariff legislation published in February 2013
   and estimate the expected costs of the introduced changes. (C) 2014

Journal = {{PALEOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Accurate interpretation of origination and extinction of fossil species
   is crucial to answering a variety of questions in paleontology Fossil
   datums, the observed age of first or last occurrences, are subject to
   sampling error as a result of preservation and low abundances near range
   endpoints. This sampling error can cause local range offset, an age
   difference between the observed first or last occurrence of a species
   and its true origination or extinction. Here, we develop and test a new
   technique, the Probable Datum Method (PDM), that can be used to assess
   the extent of local range offset for nannofossil species. The PDM
   estimates the original abundance of a taxon and its probable true age of
   first or last occurrence. The PDM uses a model in which original
   abundance is related to count abundance through preservation and the
   counting process. This model is empirically parameterized, including an
   experimental determination of false positive and error rates of a
   nannofossil count. The model is simulated then inverted to estimate
   likely original abundance and true datum age from count abundance data.
   We first test the PDM in a positive control experiment with known
   parameter values. This experiment shows that the PDM is robust and
   returns known values accurately Next we apply the method to the
   origination of nannoplankton after the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary to
   test whether first occurrences were synchronous between widely spaced
   locations. The PDM results suggest that observed diachrony of K/Pg
   originations cannot be explained by the effects of local range offset;
   rather, in some cases they indicate truly diachronous first occurrences
   between localities. Although the technique was developed to analyze
   nannoplankton ranges, the statistical nature of the PDM, its
   experimentally derived parameters, and its parsimonious nature should
   make it applicable to many micropaleontological studies that interpret
   patterns of origination and extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Because people of all ages face decisions that affect their quality of
   life, decision-making competence is important across the life span.
   According to theories of rational decision making, one crucial decision
   skill involves the ability to discontinue failing commitments despite
   irrecoverable investments also referred to as ``sunk costs.{''} We find
   that older adults are better than younger adults at making decisions to
   discontinue such failing commitments especially when irrecoverable
   losses are large, as well as at coping with the associated irrecoverable
   losses. Our results are relevant to interventions that aim to promote
   better decision-making competence across the life span.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the preferential distribution of grain boundary planes in

   approach and five-parameter analysis method are used to characterize the
   grain boundary plane distributions in a hot rolled 5A06 aluminum alloy,
   and the results show that the orientations of grain boundary planes are
   textured. Grain boundary planes favor the \{111\} orientation at the
   center of the specimen, and their population is 56\% higher than that in
   a random distribution, whereas grain boundary planes favor the \{110\}
   orientation on the surface of the specimen, and their population is 69\%
   higher than that in a random distribution. Moreover, this anisotropic
   distribution of grain boundary planes occurs at all misorientation
   angles. The study suggests a new understanding of the pathway to

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a possible approach to providing differentiated
   reliability options to customers in urban and suburban distribution
   networks. To offer different reliability options based on customer's
   preferences, a utility can deploy distributed generation (DG),
   sectionalizing switches (Normally Closed Switches: NCSs) and tie
   switches (Normally Open Switches: NOSs). During power outages, DG, as
   backup generation unit, is a means of providing higher reliability to
   customers who require it. Furthermore, a utility may need to reconfigure
   the networks such that NCSs and NOSs operate in an optimal way to
   deliver power to priority customers. The problem is formulated as an
   optimization problem with the objective of minimizing utility liability
   while assuring the supply of power to priority customers. The
   optimization is performed off-line and the optimal switch combinations
   are stored in a database for use by the utility in real time. The
   information about customer preferences for uninterrupted service is
   needed to provide investment signals for NCSs, NOSs, and DG to
   utilities. The paper also demonstrates that utilities would invest in
   providing differentiated reliability options as long as the cost of
   these investments is lower than the liability cost utilities must pay
   for failing to deliver service.}},

Abstract = {{The authors apply the maximum empirical likelihood method to the problem
   of estimating the time delay of a measured digital signal when the
   signal can be seen as an instance of a stationary random process with
   additive independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. It is
   shown that, under these assumptions, an approximate log-likelihood
   function can be estimated from the measured data itself, and therefore a
   maximum likelihood estimate can be obtained without the prior knowledge
   of the formula for the signal likelihood. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds
   (CRLB) for two additive noise models (mixed-Gaussian and generalised
   normal distribution) are derived. The authors also show that the error
   produced by the maximum log-likelihood estimates (when the likelihood
   function is estimated from the measured data) better approximates the
   CRLB than other estimators for noise models other than Gaussian or
   Laplacian (special case of the generalised normal).}},

Abstract = {{The widespread interest on the hereditary behavior of biological and
   bioinspired materials motivates deeper studies on their macroscopic
   ``minimal{''} state. The resulting integral equations for the detected
   relaxation and creep power-laws, of exponent beta, are characterized by
   fractional operators. Here strains in SBVloc are considered to account
   for time-like jumps. Consistently, starting from stresses in L-loc(r), r
   epsilon {[}1,beta(-1)], beta epsilon (0,1) we reconstruct the
   corresponding strain by extending a result in {[}14 The ``minimal{''}
   state is explored by showing that different histories delivering the
   same response are such that the fractional derivative of their
   difference is zero for all times. This equation is solved through a
   one-parameter family of strains whose related stresses converge to the
   response characterizing the original problem. This provides an
   approximation formula for the state variable, namely the residual stress
   associated to the difference of the histories above. Very little is
   known about the microstructural origins of the detected power-laws.
   Recent rheological models, based on a top-plate adhering and moving on
   functionally graded microstructures, allow for showing that the
   resultant of the underlying ``microstresses{''} matches the action
   recorded at the top-plate of such models, yielding a relationship
   between the macroscopic state and the ``microstresses{''}.}},

Abstract = {{In effort to improve thermal control in minimally invasive cryosurgery,
   the concept of a miniature, wireless, implantable sensing unit has been
   developed recently. The sensing unit integrates a wireless power
   delivery mechanism, wireless communication means, and a sensing core-the
   subject matter of the current study. The current study presents a CMOS
   ultra-miniature PTAT temperature sensing core and focuses on design
   principles, fabrication of a proof-of-concept, and characterization in a
   cryogenic environment. For this purpose, a 100 mu m x 400 mu m sensing
   core prototype has been fabricated using a 130 nm CMOS process. The
   senor has shown to operate between 180 degrees C and room temperature,
   to consume power of less than 1 mu W, and to have an uncertainty range
   of 1.4 degrees C and non-linearity of 1.1\%. Results of this study
   suggest that the sensing core is ready to be integrated in the sensing
   unit, where system integration is the subject matter of a parallel
   effort. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   volume fraction. The slip boundary condition is based on the particle
   dynamics simulation results of Rosato and Kim (1994) {[}30]. The

   (CO2) could migrate from the deep saline formations to shallower
   aquifers. In the event of a significant CO2 leakage to an underground
   source of drinking water, CO2 will dissolve in the water, thereby
   increasing its acidity, which could potentially enhance the solubility
   of various aquifer constituents, including hazardous compounds,
   subsequently compromising groundwater quality due to increased
   concentration of aqueous metals. In this paper we explore the
   possibility of detecting such leakage by the use of laser-induced
   breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The experiments were conducted in calcium
   chloride solution at three pressures of 10, 50, and 120 bar. To evaluate
   the direct effect of elevated CO2 on the intensity of calcium emission
   lines (422.67 and 393.37 nm), we also performed experiments with pure
   nitrogen (N-2) gas, offering large water solubility contrast. We found
   that when performed in presence of CO2, LIBS showed only a modest
   decrease in Ca emission intensity from 10 to 120 bar compared to N-2.
   These results indicate that LIBS is a viable tool for measuring
   brine/water contents in high-pressure CO2 environment and can be applied
   for monitoring CO2 leakage and displaced brine migration.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-matrix interactions are important for the physical integration of
   cells into tissues and the function of insoluble, mechanosensitive
   signaling networks. Studying these interactions in vitro can be
   difficult because the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that adsorb to
   in vitro cell culture surfaces do not fully recapitulate the ECM-dense
   basement membranes to which cells such as cardiomyocytes and endothelial
   cells adhere to in vivo. Towards addressing this limitation, we have
   developed a surface-initiated assembly process to engineer ECM proteins
   into nanostructured, microscale sheets that can be shrink wrapped around
   single cells and small cell ensembles to provide a functional and
   instructive matrix niche. Unlike current cell encapsulation technology
   using alginate, fibrin or other hydrogels, our engineered ECM is similar
   in density and thickness to native basal lamina and can be tailored in
   structure and composition using the proteins fibronectin, laminin,
   fibrinogen, and/or collagen type IV. A range of cells including C2C12
   myoblasts, bovine corneal endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes survive
   the shrink wrapping process with high viability. Further, we demonstrate
   that, compared to non-encapsulated controls, the engineered ECM
   modulates cytoskeletal structure, stability of cell-matrix adhesions and
   cell behavior in 2D and 3D microenvironments.}},

Abstract = {{We present models for generating different classes of networks by
   adopting simple local strategies and an original model of the
   evolutionary dynamics and growth of on-line social networks. The model
   emulates people's strategies for acquiring information in social
   networks, emphasising the local subjective view of an individual and
   what kind of information the individual can acquire when arriving in a
   new social context. We assume that the strategy proceeds through two
   phases: (a) a discovery phase, in which the individual becomes aware of
   the surrounding world and (b) an elaboration phase, in which the
   individual elaborates locally the information trough a
   cognitive-inspired algorithm. Model generated networks reproduce the
   main features of both theoretical and real-world networks, such as high
   clustering coefficient, low characteristic path length, strong division
   in communities, and variability of degree distributions.}},

   appropriate shear stress and vice versa. We use non-destructive
   high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy to map local crystal
   orientations in three dimensions in a series of tensile strain states in

   are observed and it is found that deformation-induced rotations in

   that deformation twinning involves complex multigrain interactions which

Abstract = {{An implementation of the independent component analysis (ICA) technique
   for three-dimensional (3D) statistical shape analysis is presented. The
   capabilities of the ICA approach to uncover inherent shape features are
   first demonstrated through analysis of sets of artificially generated
   surfaces, and the nature of these features is compared to a more
   traditional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique. For the
   surfaces generated, the ICA approach is shown to consistently extract
   surface features that closely resembled the original basis surfaces used
   to generate the artificial dataset, while the POD approach produces
   features that clearly mix the original basis. The details of an
   implementation of the ICA approach within a statistical shape analysis
   framework are then presented. Results are shown for the ICA
   decomposition of a collection of clinically obtained human right
   ventricle endocardial surfaces (RVES) segmented from cardiac computed
   tomography imaging, and these results are again compared with an
   analogous statistical shape analysis framework utilizing POD in lieu of
   ICA. The ICA approach is shown to produce shape features for the RVES
   that capture more localized variations in the shape across the set
   compared to the POD approach, and overall, the ICA approach produces
   features that represent the RVES variation throughout the set in a
   considerably different manner than the more traditional POD approach,
   providing a potentially useful alternate to statistically analyze such a
   set of shapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Infiltration Velocity and Thickness of Flowing Slag Film on Porous
   Refractory of Slagging Gasifiers}},

Abstract = {{Two analytical formulations that describe the fluid interactions of slag
   with the porous refractory linings of gasification reactors have been
   derived. The first formulation considers the infiltration velocity of
   molten slag into the porous microstructure of the refractory material
   that possesses an inherent temperature gradient in the direction of
   infiltration. Capillary pressures are assumed to be the primary driving
   force for the infiltration. Considering that the geometry of the pores
   provides a substantially shorter length scale in the radial direction as
   compared with the penetration direction, a lubrication approximation was
   employed to simplify the equation of motion. The assumption of a fully
   developed flow in the pores is justified based on the extremely small
   Reynolds numbers of the infiltration slag flow. The second formulation
   describes the thickness of the slag film that flows down the perimeter
   of the refractory lining. The thickness of the film was approximated by
   equating the volumetric slag production rate of the gasification reactor
   to the integration of the velocity profile with respect to the lateral
   flow cross-sectional area of the film. These two models demonstrate that
   both the infiltration velocity into the refractory and the thickness of
   the film that forms at the refractory surface were sensitive to the
   viscosity of the fluid slag. The slag thickness model has been applied
   to predict film thicknesses in a generic slagging gasifier with assumed
   axial temperature distributions, using slag viscosity from the
   literature, both for the case of a constant slag volumetric flow rate
   down the gasifier wall, and for the case of a constant flyash flux
   distributed uniformly over the entire gasifier wall.}},

Title = {{Shear-induced particle size segregation in composite powder transfer
   films}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{264}},
Pages = {{133-139}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Transfer films have been engineered to act as solid lubricants between
   sliding surfaces in environments where fluids cannot exist or are not
   desired. Composite transfer films can be crafted to combine the low
   friction behavior of a powder lubricant, with another powder component
   that offers an alternative functionality, such as electrical
   conductivity or oxidation control. However, transient rises in friction
   often occur during sliding as shown by tribological testing of
   multi-component, powder lubricant transfer films both in this work and
   in the literature. In this work, the potential for an
   electrically-conductive composite film to maintain favorable
   tribological performance under shear is explored. The effects of the
   constituents' composition percentage and relative particle sizes are
   studied in thin, composite transfer films consisting of copper (Cu) and
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The transfer films are formed through a
   shearing process and tested on a pellet and slider pad-on-disk
   tribometer. An interesting dependence of friction performance on
   equating the constituents' particle sizes is observed, which may be
   explained by the phenomenon of shear-induced particle size segregation
   often witnessed in granular flows. The effect of particle size
   segregation on the coefficient of friction (mu) in composite powder
   films is discussed within a quasi-hydrodynamic framework. Conclusions
   are drawn in regards to how particle size segregation would lead to the
   observed frictional phenomena for both the results obtained in this
   study, as well as results from prior studies within the literature. (C)

Abstract = {{Integrated assessment models for climate change (IAMs) couple
   representations of economic and natural systems to identify and evaluate
   strategies for managing the effects of global climate change. In this
   study we subject three policy scenarios from the globally-aggregated
   Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy IAM to a
   comprehensive global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' variance
   decomposition. We focus on cost metrics representing diversions of
   economic resources from global world production. Our study illustrates
   how the sensitivity ranking of model parameters differs for alternative
   cost metrics, over time, and for different emission control strategies.
   This study contributes a comprehensive illustration of the negative
   consequences associated with using a priori expert elicitations to
   reduce the set of parameters analyzed in IAM uncertainty analysis. The
   results also provide a strong argument for conducting comprehensive
   model diagnostics for IAMs that explicitly account for the parameter
   interactions between the coupled natural and economic system components.

Abstract = {{We present exergy and economic analyses for two potential advanced
   coal-based power plants with CO2 capture and sequestration. Each system
   generates three products: electricity, carbon dioxide compressed to 15
   MPa, and pre-calcined feedstock for cement kilns. First, we analyzed a
   system that integrates a CaO-looping gasifier with a solid oxide fuel
   cell (SOFC), labeled here as IGFC-CCS. The SOFC is modeled based on a
   commercial pressurized SOFC system. Second, we analyzed a system that
   integrates a CaO-looping gasifier with a Brayton-Rankine combined cycle,
   labeled here as IGCC-CCS. The exergy analyses evaluated both the power
   generation/consumption and the exergy destruction in each of the major
   sub-systems within the power plant. The economic analyses evaluated the
   internal rate of return on investment (IRR), including the upfront
   construction costs and the yearly net revenue. Using recent capital cost
   estimates, we performed a parametric study of this IGFC-CCS system to
   determine the effect on the IRR on the four key SOFC parameters: current
   density, air pressure, fuel utilization, and air stoichiometric ratio.
   For this IGFC-CCS configuration, the calculated exergetic efficiency was
   60\% at the parameters values that maximized the IRR. For the IGCC-CCS
   system with same gasifier specifications, the efficiency was 46\%;
   although, this configuration often achieved a higher value of IRR than
   the IGFC-CCS configuration, depending on the assumptions made on gas
   turbine and fuel cell equipment costs. We conducted a sensitivity
   analysis to determine how the IRR was affected by assumptions, such as
   capital costs and the sale price of CO2. Most importantly, we analyzed
   the effect of the coal gasification kinetic rate and CaO capture
   degradation rate on the IRR so that experimental researchers have goal
   posts as far as required rates for this CaO-looping process. From our
   sensitivity analysis, we conclude that the addition of alkali catalysts
   to CaO-looping gasification process can increase the IRR compared with a
   CaO-looping process without the addition of alkali catalysts, such as
   KOH. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Learning, whether motor, sensory or cognitive, requires networks of
   neurons to generate new activity patterns. As some behaviours are easier
   to learn than others(1,2), we asked if some neural activity patterns are
   easier to generate than others. Here we investigate whether an existing
   network constrains the patterns that a subset of its neurons is capable
   of exhibiting, and if so, what principles define this constraint. We
   employed a closed-loop intracortical brain-computer interface learning
   paradigm in which Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) controlled a computer
   cursor by modulating neural activity patterns in the primary motor
   cortex. Using the brain-computer interface paradigm, we could specify
   and alter how neural activity mapped to cursor velocity. At the start of
   each session, we observed the characteristic activity patterns of the
   recorded neural population. The activity of a neural population can be
   represented in a high-dimensional space (termed the neural space),
   wherein each dimension corresponds to the activity of one neuron. These
   characteristic activity patterns comprise a low-dimensional subspace
   (termed the intrinsic manifold) within the neural space. The intrinsic
   manifold presumably reflects constraints imposed by the underlying
   neural circuitry. Here we show that the animals could readily learn to
   proficiently control the cursor using neural activity patterns that were
   within the intrinsic manifold. However, animals were less able to learn
   to proficiently control the cursor using activity patterns that were
   outside of the intrinsic manifold. These results suggest that the
   existing structure of a network can shape learning. On a timescale of
   hours, it seems to be difficult to learn to generate neural activity
   patterns that are not consistent with the existing network structure.
   These findings offer a network-level explanation for the observation
   that we are more readily able to learn new skills when they are related
   to the skills that we already possess(3,4).}},

Abstract = {{Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) has
   emerged as a powerful tool to synthesize polymer-tethered particles
   (here called particle brushes) that can self-assemble into hybrid
   materials with well-defined microstructure, morphology, and enhanced
   mechanical properties or optical transparency, as compared to binary
   particle/polymer nanocomposite materials. However, side reactions such
   as the thermal self-initiation (TSI) of some monomers, such as styrene,
   during the polymerization can result in the formation of varying amounts
   of homopolystyrene, in addition to particle brushes. The presence of
   homopolystyrene impurity reduces the predictability of properties and
   impedes the interpretation of structure property relations in particle
   brush materials. This contribution presents a systematic evaluation of
   the formation of TSI homopolystyrene and its implications on the
   properties of polystyrene-tethered silica based particle brush
   materials. Kinetic and molecular weight studies reveal that the fraction
   of untethered chains generated by TSI depends on reaction conditions and
   increases with the degree of polymerization of surface-tethered chains.
   The presence of homopolystyrene results not only in a decrease of the
   softening temperature but also in an increase of ductility and toughness
   of particle brush solids. Structural analysis of particle brush
   assemblies admixed with small particle tracer inclusions suggests that
   the increase in ductility is related to the preferential segregation of
   the polystyrene impurity within the corner regions of the Wigner-Seitz
   cell of the particle brush array.}},

   thermoreflectance thermal conductivity measurements}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{We derive an analytical solution to the Boltzmann transport equation
   (BTE) to relate nondiffusive thermal conductivity measurements by
   thermoreflectance techniques to the bulk thermal conductivity
   accumulation function, which quantifies cumulative contributions to
   thermal conductivity from different mean free path energy carriers
   (here, phonons). Our solution incorporates two experimentally defined
   length scales: thermal penetration depth and heating laser spot radius.
   We identify two thermal resistances based on the predicted spatial
   temperature and heat flux profiles. The first resistance is associated
   with the interaction between energy carriers and the surface of the
   solution domain. The second resistance accounts for transport of energy
   carriers through the solution domain and is affected by the
   experimentally defined length scales. Comparison of the BTE result with
   that from conventional heat diffusion theory enables a mapping of
   mean-free-path-specific contributions to the measured thermal
   conductivity based on the experimental length scales. In general, the
   measured thermal conductivity will be influenced by the smaller of the
   two length scales and the surface properties of the system. The result
   is used to compare nondiffusive thermal conductivity measurements of
   silicon with first-principles-based calculations of its thermal
   conductivity accumulation function.}},

Abstract = {{Macroscopic structures that can undergo rapid and reversible stiffness
   transitions can serve as functional polymeric materials for many
   applications in robotics and medical devices. Thermomechanical phase
   transitions can provide a suitable mechanism for transient control of
   mechanical properties. However, the characteristic time scale for
   actuation is large and dictated by the dimensions of the structure.
   Embedding vascular networks within bulk polymers can reduce the
   characteristic length scale of the material and permit rapid and
   reversible thermomechanical transitions. Here, perfusable bulk materials
   with embedded microvascular networks are reported that can undergo rapid
   and reversible stiffness transitions. Acrylate-based thermoplastic
   structures exhibit storage moduli with a dynamic range between E' = 1.02
   +/- 0.07 GPa and E' = 13.5 +/- 0.7 MPa over time scales as small as 2.4
   +/- 0.5 s using an aqueous thermal perfusate. The spatiotemporal
   evolutions of temperature profiles are accurately predicted using finite
   element simulations and compared to experimental values. Rigid-compliant
   transitions are leveraged in a demonstration in which a
   microvascularized device is used to grasp an external object without the

Abstract = {{Kraft lignin grafted with hydrophilic polymers has been prepared using
   reversible addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization
   and investigated for use as a surfactant. In this preliminary study,
   polyacrylamide and poly(acrylic acid) were grafted from a lignin RAFT
   macroinitiator at average initiator site densities estimated to be 2 per
   particle and 17 per particle. The target degrees of polymerization were
   50 and 100, but analysis of cleaved polyacrylamide was consistent with a
   higher average molecular weight, suggesting not all sites were able to
   participate in the polymerization. All materials were readily soluble in
   water, and dynamic light scattering data indicate polymer-grafted lignin
   coexisted in isolated and aggregated forms in aqueous media. The
   characteristic size was 15-20 nm at low concentrations, and aggregation
   appeared to be a stronger function of degree of polymerization than
   graft density. These species were surface active, reducing the surface
   tension to as low as 60 dyn/cm at 1 mg/mL, and a greater decrease was
   observed than for polymer-grafted silica nanoparticles, suggesting that
   the lignin core was also surface active. While these lignin surfactants
   were soluble in water, they were not soluble in hexanes. Thus, it was
   unexpected that water-in-oil emulsions formed in all surfactant
   compositions and solvent ratios tested, with average droplet sizes of
   10-20 mu m. However, although polymer-grafted lignin has structural
   features similar to nanoparticles used in Pickering emulsions, its
   interfacial behavior was qualitatively different. While at air-water
   interfaces, the hydrophilic grafts promote effective reductions in
   surface tension, we hypothesize that the low grafting density in these
   lignin surfactants favors partitioning into the hexanes side of the
   oil-water interface because collapsed conformations of the polymer
   grafts improve interfacial coverage and reduce water-hexanes
   interactions. We propose that polymer-grafted lignin surfactants can be
   considered as random patchy nanoparticles with mixed hydrophilic and

   Poly{[}1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butylimidazolium
   bis(trifluorcimethylsulfonyl)imide] (poly-VBBI+Tf2N-), and copolymers of
   polyVBBI(+)Tf(2)N(-) with fluorescein O-methacrylate were synthesized by
   conducting an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from
   initiators containing azide or thioacetate groups. The azide- and
   thiol-terminated PILs were then successfully grafted onto alkyne and
   alkene modified glass/Si wafers by thermal azide-alkyne cycloaddition
   and photoinitiated thiol-ene click reactions, respectively. The modified
   surfaces were characterized by contact angle measurements and
   ellipsometry. The fluorescent PIL functionalized surfaces showed strong
   fluorescence under UV irradiation. This procedure of tethering PILs to
   substrates also provides an easy way to change the surface
   hydrophilicity by replacing the anions in the grafted PILs. The present
   approach could be readily applied for surface modifications with other
   types of PILs or their copolymers to achieve different functionalities
   on various surfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sulfidation of copper oxide nanoparticles and properties of resulting
   copper sulfide}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{347-357}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Many nanoparticles (NPs) are transformed in the environment, and the
   properties of the transformed materials must be determined to accurately
   assess their environmental risk. Sulfidation is expected to alter the
   speciation and properties of CuO NPs significantly. Here, commercially
   available 40 nm CuO NPs were characterized and sulfidized in water by
   inorganic sulfide, and the properties of the resulting products were
   determined. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and
   transmission electron microscopy indicate that CuO (tenorite) is
   sulfidized by inorganic sulfide to several copper sulfide (CuxSy)
   species including crystalline CuS (covellite), and amorphous (CuxSy)
   species at ambient temperature. Some Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I) during
   sulfidation, coupled with sulfide oxidation to sulfate, resulting in the
   formation of small amounts of several copper sulfate hydroxide species
   as well. The extent of sulfidation depends on the sulfide to CuO molar
   concentration ratio used. At the highest S/Cu molar ratio of 2.16, 100\%
   sulfidation was not reached in 7 days, as evidenced by the persistence
   of small amounts of CuO in the NPs. Sulfidation increased the fraction
   of copper passing a 3 kDa MWCO filter representing soluble forms of Cu
   and any small CuxSy clusters compared to the pristine CuO NPs at
   environmentally relevant neutral pH. This high solubility is a result of
   oxidative dissolution of CuxSy, formation of relatively more soluble
   copper sulfate hydroxides, and the formation of small CuS nanoclusters
   that pass the 3 kDa MWCO filter. These findings suggest that sulfidation
   of CuO may increase its apparent solubility and resulting
   bioavailability and eco-toxicity attributed to toxic Cu2+.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of distributed parameter estimation in
   multiagent networks with exponential family observation statistics. A
   certainty-equivalence type distributed estimator of the
   consensus-plus-innovations form is proposed in which, at each
   observation sampling epoch, agents update their local parameter
   estimates by appropriately combining the data received from their
   neighbors and the locally sensed new information (innovation). Under
   global observability of the networked sensing model, i.e., the ability
   to distinguish between different instances of the parameter value based
   on the joint observation statistics, and mean connectivity of the
   inter-agent communication network, the proposed estimator is shown to
   yield consistent parameter estimates at each network agent. Further, it
   is shown that the distributed estimator is asymptotically efficient, in
   that, the asymptotic covariances of the agent estimates coincide with
   that of the optimal centralized estimator, i.e., the inverse of the
   centralized Fisher information rate. From a technical viewpoint, the
   proposed distributed estimator leads to non-Markovian mixed time-scale
   stochastic recursions and the analytical methods developed in this paper
   contribute to the general theory of distributed stochastic
   approximation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a set of ground-motion simulations of the 2008 M-w 5.4 Chino
   Hills earthquake using different seismic-velocity models available for
   southern California. The simulations are tailored for a maximum
   frequency of 4 Hz and a minimum shear-wave velocity of 200 m/s. We use
   the community models developed by the Southern California Earthquake
   Center, CVM-S and CVM-H. In the case of CVM-H, we use two available
   alternatives, with and without considering the geotechnical layers
   (GTL). We compare the simulation results obtained with the models
   against each other and validate the synthetics with recordings obtained
   at more than 300 stations. The comparisons are used to gain insight into
   the sensitivity of the results to differences in the models and to make
   conclusions about the strengths of each model's description of the
   crustal structure and the GTL in the region. The validation is done
   using a goodness-of-fit (GOF) criterion. We find the GOF values show a
   better match at frequencies below 1 Hz, within the basins, and below 0.5
   Hz in general. The models, however, do not converge at frequencies lower
   than 0.5 Hz, and the areas where each model leads to better results do
   not always coincide. The synthetics start to deviate significantly from
   observations at frequencies above 1 and 2 Hz, although very good
   agreement with data can still be found at individual locations, even at
   the higher frequencies. CVM-S yields the best results at frequencies up
   to 0.25 Hz. Our results reveal significant sensitivity of the ground
   motion to the differences in the structural representation of basins and
   shallow layers in the models. This indicates the models need to be cross
   referenced. We close by offering suggestions on the type of improvements
   that could be adopted in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The study of fatigue in metals, and fatigue initiation specifically,
   lends itself to analysis via an emerging set of characterization and
   modeling tools that describe polycrystals on the meso- or
   microstructural length scale. These include three-dimensional
   characterization techniques, elastic anisotropic and visco-plastic
   stress models, new approaches to the statistical description of stress
   and strain distributions, synthetic microstructure modeling, and
   improved tools for manipulating the large datasets generated. A specific
   example of analysis in both 2D and 3D of fatigue cracks in a
   nickel-based superalloy is given where all the cracks are effectively
   coincident with coherent twin boundaries. A spectral method is used to
   analyze the stress state based on a fully anisotropic elastic
   calculation. The results indicate that, although a high resolved shear
   stress is associated with the locations of the observed cracks, the
   length of the trace of the twin boundary is more strongly correlated
   with crack formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Segmenting materials' images is a laborious and time-consuming process,
   and automatic image segmentation algorithms usually contain
   imperfections and errors. Interactive segmentation is a growing topic in
   the areas of image processing and computer vision, which seeks to find a
   balance between fully automatic methods and fully-manual segmentation
   processes. By allowing minimal and simplistic interaction from the user
   in an otherwise automatic algorithm, interactive segmentation is able to
   simultaneously reduce the time taken to segment an image while achieving
   better segmentation results. Given the specialized structure of
   materials' images and level of segmentation quality required, we show an
   interactive segmentation framework for materials' images that has three
   key contributions: (1) a multi-labeling approach that can handle a large
   number of structures while still quickly and conveniently allowing
   manual addition and removal of segments in real-time, (2) multiple
   extensions to the interactive tools which increase the simplicity of the
   interaction, and (3) a web interface for using the interactive tools in
   a client/server architecture. We show a full formulation of each of
   these contributions and example results from their application.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of the nanoscale integrated circuit (IC) technology makes
   high performance analog and RF circuits increasingly susceptible to
   large-scale process variations. On-chip self-healing has been proposed
   as a promising remedy to address the variability issue. The key idea of
   on-chip self-healing is to adaptively adjust a set of on-chip tuning
   knobs (e.g., bias voltage) in order to satisfy all performance
   specifications. One major challenge with on-chip self-healing is to
   efficiently implement on-chip sensors to accurately measure various
   analog and RF performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel
   indirect performance sensing technique to facilitate
   inexpensive-yet-accurate on-chip performance measurement. Towards this
   goal, several advanced statistical algorithms (i.e., sparse regression
   and Bayesian inference) are adopted from the statistics community. A 25
   GHz differential Colpitts voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) designed
   in a 32 nm CMOS SOI process is used to validate the proposed indirect
   performance sensing and self-healing methodology. Our silicon
   measurement results demonstrate that the parametric yield of the VCO is
   significantly improved for a wafer after the proposed self-healing is
   applied.}},

Abstract = {{This study adapts the advanced step NMPC framework to Economic NMPC.
   Here, sufficient conditions for nominal stability are derived for NMPC
   controllers that incorporate economic stage costs with appropriate
   regularization. To guarantee these conditions, we derive a constructive
   strategy to calculate the regularization term directly. Moreover, we
   extend the sensitivity components in the advanced step NMPC framework to
   consider a rigorous path-following algorithm. This approach accounts for
   active set changes and allows much weaker constraint qualifications.
   Moreover, using an l(1) formulation of the NMPC problem satisfies these
   constraint qualifications and allows more reliable solution of the
   moving horizon optimization problem, even in the presence of noise.
   Finally, all of these concepts are demonstrated on a detailed case study
   with a continuously stirred tank reactor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Thermal issues have become critical roadblocks for achieving highly
   reliable three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs). The presence
   of process variations further exacerbates these problems. In this
   article, we propose techniques for the efficient evaluation and
   mitigation of the impact of leakage power variations on the temperature
   profile of 3D Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). Experimental results
   demonstrate that, due to the impact of process variations, a 4-tier 3D
   implementation can be more than 40 degrees C hotter and 23\% leakier
   than its 2D counterpart. To determine the maximum temperature of each
   fabricated 3D IC, we propose an accurate learning-based model for peak
   temperature prediction. Based on the learning model, we then propose two
   post-fabrication techniques to increase the thermal yield of 3D CMPs:
   (1) tier restacking and (2) thermally-aware die matching. Experimental
   results show that: (1) the proposed prediction model achieves more than
   98\% accuracy, and (2) the proposed thermally-aware, post-fabrication
   optimization techniques significantly improve the thermal yield from
   only 51\% to 99\% for 3D CMPs.}},

Abstract = {{Peer influence and interactions between agents in a population give rise
   to complex, nonlinear behaviors. This paper adopts the SIS
   (susceptible-infected-susceptible) framework from epidemiology to
   analytically study how network topology affects the diffusion of
   ideas/opinions/beliefs/innovations in social networks. We introduce the
   scaled SIS process, which models peer influence as neighbor-to-neighbor
   infections. We model the scaled SIS process as a continuous-time Markov
   process and derive for this process its closed form equilibrium
   distribution. The adjacency matrix that describes the underlying social
   network is explicitly reflected in this distribution. The paper shows
   that interesting population asymptotic behaviors occur for scenarios
   where the individual tendencies of each agent oppose peer influences.
   Specifically, we determine how the most probable configuration of agent
   states (i.e., the population configuration with maximum equilibrium
   distribution) depends on both model parameters and network topology. We
   show that, for certain regions of the parameter space, this and related
   issues reduce to standard graph questions like the maximum independent
   set problem.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We performed a study to determine whether flue gas bypass and solvent
   storage can increase the profitability of a power plant equipped with
   post-combustion carbon capture technology. By increasing flexibility,
   these technologies allow increased output when electric energy prices
   are high. We used the Integrated Environmental Control Model to
   characterize cost and operational parameters of a pulverized coal (PC)
   plant with both amine and ammonia carbon-capture systems, as well as a
   natural gas combined cycle plant with amine capture. We constructed
   profit-maximization operating models with both perfect and imperfect
   information about electric energy prices in a large electricity market
   in the Eastern United States. We optimized the size of the regenerator
   and solvent storage vessels to maximize profitability. Results indicate
   that the profitability benefits of flexible CCS range from 0 to 35\%.
   Most of the potential benefit is capital savings from allowing the
   regenerator to be undersized. The benefits of flexible CCS were found to
   decline with increasing CO2 prices, with steady-state units preferable
   above a CO2 emissions price of \$40/tonne. Flexible CCS was never
   optimal when the overall plant was profitable. While flexible CCS can
   boost profitability under policies that force plants with CCS to be
   built even where they are not profitable, it is less relevant under
   market-based policies that incentivize CCS through CO2 prices. (C) 2014

Title = {{Rate of H2S and CO2 attack on pozzolan-amended Class H well cement under
   geologic sequestration conditions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{299-308}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate the rates of H2S and CO2
   alteration of pozzolan-amended wellbore cement (35 vol\% pozzolan-65
   vol\% cement), so as to evaluate the potential impact of H2S and CO2
   induced degradation of existing cemented wells present at acid gas
   co-sequestration sites. In the exposure experiments, pozzolan-amended
   cement samples were mixed, cured and exposed to mixtures of H2S and CO2
   under lab-simulated geologic sequestration conditions (50 degrees C and
   15.2 MPa) for 2.5, 9,28 and 90 days. Measurement of the carbon
   alteration front was used to calculate the rate of CO2 alteration of
   pozzolan-amended cement exposed to a mixture of 79 mol\% CO2 and 21
   mol\% H2S under geologic sequestration conditions in exposure periods of
   0-90 days. Average CO2 alteration rates (rate of movement of CaCO3
   precipitation front) were 3.3 x 10(-3) mm/day and 3.2 x 10(-3) mm/day
   for cement samples exposed to a 1\% NaCl solution saturated with CO2 and
   H2S, and those in contact with a supercritical mixture of CO2 and H2S,
   respectively. Two scenarios were considered for measuring and
   quantifying alteration caused by H2S over the exposure periods of 0-90
   days: sulfur-rich zone thickness, and sulfur alteration index. The
   average rate of H2S alteration determined by sulfur-rich zone thickness
   divided by exposure duration was 4.3 x 10(-3) mm/day for cement exposed
   to 1\% NaCl solution saturated with CO2 and H2S, and the average rate of
   H2S alteration determined by sulfur alteration index divided by exposure
   duration was 8.2 x 10(-3) day(-1). Cement exposed to a supercritical
   mixture of CO2 and H2S result in H2S alteration rates determined by
   sulfur-rich zone thickness divided by exposure duration of 3.1 x 10(-3)
   mm/day, and average rates of H2S alteration determined by sulfur
   alteration index divided by exposure duration of 6.3 x 10(-3) day(-1).
   Sulfur alteration index results also show that H2S was able to penetrate
   to the core of pozzolan-amended wellbore cement after 2.5 days of
   exposure, though this was not readily apparent in the sulfur-rich zone
   thickness results. Sulfur-rich zone thickness is best used to describe
   high-level sulfur alteration in the rim of samples. The results indicate
   that (1) an aqueous environment is more favorable for H2S attack on
   pozzolan-amended cement than a supercritical CO2 and H2S environment;
   (2) for 90 days of exposure significant alteration induced by H2S and
   CO2 occurs at regions very close to the fluid/cement interface; (3) H2S
   penetrates pozzolan-amended cement more rapidly than CO2 in aqueous
   contact environments. In contrast, under supercritical liquid
   environment, H2S and CO2 have similar penetration rates in
   pozzolan-amended cement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of
   exposure environment on the integrity of pozzolan-amended Class H cement
   under geologic acid gas co-sequestration conditions. Cement was exposed
   to two potential subsurface storage environments: (1) a supercritical
   mixture of CO2/H2S and (2) a CO2/H2S saturated brine. Results show that
   cement alteration is dependent on the amount of pozzolan addition. The
   alteration rate and mechanism also differ for the two exposure
   scenarios. Cement containing 35\% pozzolan amounts by volume (hereafter
   referred to as 35 vol\% pozzolan cement) exposed to the aqueous
   environment was more vulnerable to alteration, compared with the same
   pozzolan content cement exposed to a supercritical mixture of CO2/H2S
   (21 mol\% H2S). Specifically, 35 vol\% pozzolan cement exposed to the
   aqueous environment exhibited a higher level of mineral dissolution
   (e.g., C-S-H, 3CaO center dot SiO2, 2CaO center dot SiO2, etc.) and a
   higher degree of sulfur alteration than the same pozzolan content
   samples exposed to the supercritical mixture of CO2-H2S (21 mol\% H2S).
   Different from the 35 vol\% pozzolan cement, the cement containing 65\%
   pozzolan by volume (hereafter referred to as 65 vol\% pozzolan cement)
   was more susceptible to alteration in the supercritical CO2/H2S (21
   mol\% H2S) environment, compared with the same pozzolan content cement
   exposed to the aqueous environment. Increasing the H2S mol\% in the
   supercritical phase from 21 mol\% to 40 mol\% increased the alteration
   of cement exposed to both exposure environments. The 65 vol\% pozzolan
   cement was more resistant to H2S and CO2 alteration than the 35 vol\%
   pozzolan cement if the H2S content was high (i.e., 40 mol\%), while the
   35 vol\% pozzolan cement was more resistant to H2S and CO2 alteration
   than the 65 vol\% pozzolan cement if the H2S content was relatively low
   (i.e., 21 mol\%). It was observed that while the two related exposure
   environments resulted in different degrees of cement alteration, the
   exposure environments did not result in the formation of different
   minerals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grain-boundary plane distributions (GBPDs), grain size distribution
   (GSDs), and upper tail departure from log-normal GSDs were quantified in
   dense and porous La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 samples to understand expected
   microstructures in solid oxide fuel cells. Samples were sintered at 1450
   degrees C for 4 h and then annealed between 800 degrees C and 1450
   degrees C. The GBPDs and normalized GSDs reached steady state during
   sintering and little variation occurred during annealing. The GBPDs were
   nearly isotropic, with the relative areas of \{001\} planes being
   slightly higher than random (and the relative areas of \{111\} planes
   being less than random). The porous sample had an almost identical GBPD,
   whereas the almost isotropic pore boundary plane distribution was
   essentially opposite to the GBPD. The upper tails of the experimental
   GSDs, and several theoretical distributions, were characterized using
   peaks-over-threshold analysis. Dense samples, and all normal grain
   growth models, exhibit lower frequencies of large grains in the upper
   tail than would a log-normal distribution, and the experimental
   distributions are similar to the Mullins distribution. Porous samples,
   however, have an anomalous increased frequency of large grains in the
   upper tail, as compared to all the model distributions, even though
   other metrics of the microstructure indicate the dense and porous
   systems are similar.}},

   pellets for ironmaking. This article presents a contribution to
   quantitative understanding of fundamental pellet oxidation kinetics,

   The commonly observed ``plateau{''} oxidation behavior is confirmed to
   be consistent with the effect of very large differences in magnetite
   particle sizes in the concentrate from which pellets are produced. The
   magnetite particles range in size from less than a micron to several
   tens of a microns; changing the size distribution by inert sintering of
   pellets decreases both the plateau level of oxidation and the specific
   surface area, in ways that are compatible with an assumed Rosin-Rammler
   magnetite particle size distribution. (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Abstract = {{It is suggested that oxygen enrichment in the gas atmosphere, during
   continuous heating of magnetite pellets, can cause pellets to be
   oxidized throughout their volumes, eliminating unoxidized cores. The
   peculiarities of the oxidation kinetics of magnetite concentrate imply
   that such oxygen enrichment might be particularly effective at lower
   temperatures. This suggestion was tested by developing and testing a
   mixed-control model for pellet oxidation (to allow the sizes of
   unreacted cores to be predicted), and by experimentally testing the
   effects of oxygen enrichment at relatively low temperatures ({''}early
   oxygen enrichment{''}). The results confirmed that the extents (depth)
   of oxidation and pellet strength were both improved significantly by
   applying oxygen enrichment up to 873 K (600 A degrees C), as part of a
   heating cycle up to 1073 K (800 degrees C). (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Abstract = {{Kinetic models considering mass transport in, (i) metal phase only and
   (ii) both metal and slag phases (mixed control or two-phase mass
   transfer) were developed for the reduction of SiO2 in a SiO2-Al2O3-CaO
   slag by Al in an Al-Fe melt. The models were validated with experiments
   of the reaction with Fe-Al melt and SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-MgOsat slags at 1873
   K (1600 A degrees C). The models predict that the rate of reaction is
   slower in the mixed control model because of the added resistance of
   slag phase mass transport. The mixed control becomes applicable when the
   slag contains low amounts of SiO2. In this case, when the initial Al
   content in the metal increases, the normalized rate of reaction
   decreases. The increased Al content in the metal retards the reaction
   due to the limited SiO2 provided to the reaction interface in the mixed
   control model. Sensitivity analyses were done using the models for the
   ratios of mass transfer coefficients of Si to Al, and Al2O3 to Si, along
   with slag density, which did not impose a significant effect. (C) The

Abstract = {{The thermodynamics of several aspects of the carbothermic reduction of

   In this part of the paper, results are presented for a thermogravimetric
   study of the reactions of Al2O3 with carbon, as well as those for the
   determination of the Al2O3 liquidus line and the Al2O3-Al4O4C eutectic
   in the Al2O3-Al4C3 phase diagram. The critical temperature for Al2O3 and
   C to react, producing gas at 1 atm., was in agreement with that
   predicted from thermodynamics and measured in Part I of this paper.

Abstract = {{Natural gas (NG)-related fugitive methane (CH4) emissions estimates from
   life cycle assessments (LCA) and local field measurements are highly
   uncertain. Globally distributed long-term atmospheric measurements and
   top-down modeling can help understand whether LCA and field studies are
   representative of the global industry average. Attributing sources, such
   as the NG industry, to global total top-down emissions estimates
   requires detailed and transparent global a priori bottom-up emissions
   inventories. Establishing an a priori bottom-up inventory as a tool for
   top-down modeling is the focus of this work, which extends existing
   fossil fuel (FF) inventories over the past three decades: (i) It
   includes ethane (C2H6) emissions, which is a convenient FF tracer gas
   given available global C2H6 observations. (ii) Fuel specific CH4 and
   C2H6 emissions uncertainties are quantified. (iii) NG CH4 and C2H6
   emissions are estimated for different fugitive emissions rate (FER; \%
   of dry production) scenarios as a basis for quantifying global average
   FER top-down. While our global oil and coal CH4 estimates coincide well
   with EDGAR v4.2 for most years, country-level emissions vary
   substantially, and coal emissions increase at a lower rate over the past
   decade. Global emissions grid maps are presented for use in top-down
   modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, there have been a lot of advances in the
   field of pattern analyses for biomedical signals, which have helped in
   both medical diagnoses and in furthering our understanding of the human
   body. A relatively recent area of interest is the utility of biomedical
   signals in the field of biometrics, i.e., for user identification.
   Seminal work in this domain has already been done using
   electrocardiograph (ECG) signals. In this paper, we discuss our ongoing
   work in using a relatively recent modality of biomedical signals-a
   cardio-synchronous waveform measured using a Radio-Frequency
   Impedance-Interrogation (RFII) device for the purpose of user
   identification. Compared to an ECG setup, this device is noninvasive and
   measurements can be obtained easily and quickly. Here, we discuss the
   feasibility of reducing the dimensions of these signals by projecting
   onto various subspaces while still preserving interuser discriminating
   information. We compare the classification performance using classical
   dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis
   (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), random projections, with
   more recent techniques such as K-SVD-based dictionary learning. We also
   report the reconstruction accuracies in these subspaces. Our results
   show that the dimensionality of the measured signals can be reduced by
   60 fold while maintaining high user identification rates.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible AC transmission system devices provide the opportunity to
   improve the usage of the current transmission facilities by controlling
   network flows and nodal voltages. The optimal steady-state settings of
   these devices can be determined using optimal power flow calculations.
   However, this requires knowledge of the system parameters, generation
   settings and loads. A two-stage regression-based control scheme is
   proposed to determine the optimal settings of thyristor-controlled
   series compensators (TCSCs) with the objective to optimally utilise the
   current transmission system in the presence of renewable energy
   resources. A regression function describing the relationship between a
   set of key measurements and the optimal device settings is determined in
   the offline simulation. This function is then used to calculate the
   optimal device settings by only receiving the information from a limited
   number of key measurements without solving the OPF problem in the online
   operation. Studies are carried out with TCSCs in three-test systems, the
   IEEE 14-bus system, a 28-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system. The
   simulation results with one, two and four TCSCs are presented,
   illustrating the performance of the proposed regression-based control

Abstract = {{In this paper, we employ several subspace representations (principal
   component analysis, unsupervised discriminant projection, kernel
   class-dependence feature analysis, and kernel discriminant analysis) on
   our proposed discrete transform encoded local binary patterns (DT-LBP)
   to match periocular region on a large data set such as NIST's face
   recognition grand challenge (FRGC) ver2 database. We strictly follow
   FRGC Experiment 4 protocol, which involves 1-to-1 matching of 8014
   uncontrolled probe periocular images to 16 028 controlled target
   periocular images (similar to 128 million pairwise face match
   comparisons). The performance of the periocular region is compared with
   that of full face with different illumination preprocessing schemes. The
   verification results on periocular region show that subspace
   representation on DT-LBP outperforms LBP significantly and gains a giant
   leap from traditional subspace representation on raw pixel intensity.
   Additionally, our proposed approach using only the periocular region is
   almost as good as full face with only 2.5\% reduction in verification
   rate at 0.1\% false accept rate, yet we gain tolerance to expression,
   occlusion, and capability of matching partial faces in crowds. In
   addition, we have compared the best standalone DT-LBP descriptor with
   eight other state-of-the-art descriptors for facial recognition and
   achieved the best performance. The two general frameworks are our major
   contribution: 1) a general framework that employs various generative and
   discriminative subspace modeling techniques for DT-LBP representation
   and 2) a general framework that encodes discrete transforms with local
   binary patterns for the creation of robust descriptors.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing clinical need to design novel dental materials
   that combine regenerative and antibacterial properties. In this work the
   characterization of a recently developed sol gel-derived bioactive glass
   ceramic containing silver ions (Ag-BG) is presented. The microstructural
   characteristics, ion release profile, zeta potential value and changes
   in weight loss and pH value as a function of the immersion time of Ag-BG
   in Tris buffer are evaluated. Ag-BG is also incorporated into natural
   extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel to further enhance its regenerative
   properties. Then, the micro and macro architectures of these new
   composites (ECM/Ag-BG) are characterized. In addition, the antibacterial
   properties of these new composites are tested against Escherichia coli
   and Enterococcus faecalis, a bacterium commonly implicated in the
   pathogenesis of dental pulp infections. Cell material interaction is
   also monitored in a primary culture of dental pulp cells. Our study
   highlights the benefits of the successful incorporation of Ag in the
   bioactive glass, resulting in a stable antibacterial material with
   long-lasting bactericidal activity. Furthermore, this work presents for
   the first time the fabrication of new Ag-doped composite materials, with
   inductive pulp-cell proliferation and antibacterial properties
   (ECM/Ag-BG). This advanced composite made of Ag-BG incorporated into
   natural ECM possesses improved properties that may facilitate potential

Title = {{TFOx: A versatile kinetic Monte Carlo program for simulations of island
   growth in three dimensions}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{292-302}},

Abstract = {{A three dimensional (3D) kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) code has been
   developed that simulates the general behavior of the 3D irreversible
   nucleation and growth of epitaxial islands, as motivated by experimental
   observations of oxide nuclei formation and growth during the early
   stages of copper oxidation. This package was originally a versatile two
   dimensional (2D) KMC code {[}Thin Film Oxidation (TFOx)] that considered
   a variety of elementary steps, including deposition, adsorption, surface
   diffusion, aggregation, desorption, and substrate-mediated indirect
   interactions between static adatoms. We extended TFOx to describe 3D
   island growth. This new version of TFOx is composed of a C++ console
   program and Python graphical user interface (GUI), such that
   parameterized simulation, parallel execution, and 3D growth capabilities
   are feasible. We examined the effects of the potential gradient and the
   Ehrlich-Schwobel barrier and found that the 3D island morphology is
   significantly influenced by the incorporation of these two factors. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a continuum approach to predicting the electrophoretic
   mobility of a charged dielectric colloidal particle in a concentrated
   multivalent electrolyte. Our model takes into account steric (excluded

   vol. 33, 1942, p. 384) and ion-ion electrostatic (Coulombic)
   correlations via the work of Bazant et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 106,
   2011, 046102). The latter can result in the prediction of an
   electrophoretic mobility reversal, that is, the migration velocity of a
   particle switches direction with increasing ion concentration. Our model
   predictions compare favourably with experiments that observe mobility
   reversals in multivalent electrolytes.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{103-118}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Facility operators interact with building automation systems (BASs) on a
   regular basis for various purposes such as facility maintenance,
   occupant comfort, equipment monitoring, safety and security. Evaluation
   of various BAS interfaces showed that there are challenges faced by
   facility operators that impede their efficiency and accuracy of their
   responses to reported situations. These challenges revolve mainly around
   the lack of spatial context for the monitored sensor readings and
   equipment statuses, and operators' information overloading. Various
   visualization techniques have been used in commercially available BASs,
   however, their impact on the situation awareness of facility operators
   is not clearly known. This study focuses on this need and evaluates
   various visualization techniques that best suit to the needs of facility
   operators. This study identifies visualization techniques that are
   applicable to encode sematic information in spatial context, and details
   the design and implementation of user studies that were performed with
   seventeen expert and six novice facility operators to understand the
   impact of visualization techniques on operators' accuracy and timeliness
   to reported situations in relation to building system monitoring. The
   findings suggested that visualization-based interfaces generally improve
   the accuracy and efficiency of facility operators' decisions in
   monitoring tasks as compared to interfaces designed mainly with tabular
   displays. The results can be used by practitioners in the industry, not
   only for greenhouse facility monitoring, but also for facility
   monitoring in general, and by vendors to consider for their BAS
   interfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{481-493}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We present a new non-photorealistic rendering method to
   render 3D scenes in the form of pencil-like sketches.
   Methods: This work is based on the observation that the dynamic feedback
   mechanism involving the human visual system and the motor control of the
   hand collectively generates the visual characteristics unique to
   hand-drawn sketches. At the heart of our approach is a trajectory
   planning and tracking algorithm that generate the sketch in multiple
   layers using a dynamic pen model. On each layer, a set of target strokes
   are generated from the silhouette lines, edges, and shaded regions which
   serve as the target trajectory for a closed-loop dynamic pen model. The
   pen model then produces the rendered sketch, whose characteristics can
   be adjusted with a set of trajectory and tracking parameters. This
   process continues in several layers until the tonal difference between
   the sketch and the original 3D render is minimized.
   Results: We demonstrate our approach with examples that are created by
   controlling the parameters of our sketch rendering algorithms.
   Conclusion: The examples not only show typical sketching artifacts that
   are common to human-drawn sketches but also demonstrate that it is
   capable of producing multiple sketching styles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Modern workflow systems can enable scientists to run ensemble
   simulations at unprecedented scales and levels of complexity, allowing
   them to study system sizes previously impossible to achieve. However as
   a result of these new capabilities the science teams suddenly also face
   unprecedented data volumes that they are unable to analyze with their
   existing tools and methodologies in a timely fashion. In this paper we
   describe the ongoing development work to create an integrated data
   intensive scientific workflow and analysis environment that offers
   researchers the ability to easily create and execute complex simulation
   studies and provides them with different scalable methods to analyze the
   resulting data volumes. The capabilities of the new environment are
   demonstrated on a use case that focuses on building energy modeling. As
   part of the PNNL research initiative PRIMA (Platform for Regional
   Integrated Modeling and Analysis) the team performed an initial 3-year
   study of building energy demands for the US Eastern Interconnect domain.
   They are now planning to extend to predict the demand for the complete
   century. In the 3-year study the team simulated 2000 individual building

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal particles can achieve autonomous motion by a number of
   physicochemical mechanisms. For instance, if a spherical particle acts
   as a catalyst with an asymmetric surface reactivity, a molecular solute
   concentration gradient will develop in the surrounding fluid that can
   propel the particle via self-diffusiophoresis. Theoretical analyses of
   self-diffusiophoresis have mostly been considered in quiescent fluid,
   where the solute concentration is usually assumed to evolve solely via
   diffusion. In practical applications, however, self-propelled colloidal
   particles can be expected to reside in flowing fluids. Here, we examine
   the role of ambient flow on self-diffusiophoresis by quantifying the
   dynamics of a model Janus particle in a simple shear flow. The imposed
   flow can distort the self-generated solute concentration gradient. The
   extent of this distortion is quantified by a Peclet number, Pe,
   associated with the shear flow. Utilizing matched asymptotic analysis,
   we determine the concentration gradient surrounding a Janus particle in
   shear flow at a small, but finite, Peclet number and the resulting
   particle motion. For example, when the symmetry axis of the particle is
   aligned with the imposed flow, the Janus particle experiences an O(Pe)
   cross-streamline drift and an O(Pe(3/2)) reduction in translational
   velocity along the flow direction. We then analyze the in-plane
   trajectory of the Janus particle in shear. We find that the particle
   performs elliptical orbits around its initial position in the flow,
   which decrease in size with increasing Pe.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of solvents in the chemical industry is typically based on
   performance and economic considerations. Other relevant aspects, such as
   the safety implications of a given solvent, are generally left for
   consideration after the design of the process has been completed. In
   this work, an approach for solvent selection including safety
   considerations at the design stage of the process is presented. The
   safety component is included through a consequence analysis using an
   average distance for the risk of death as the major parameter. The
   approach is applied to the design of extractive distillation systems,
   for which a preselection step for the solvent is used, followed by the
   formulation of a multiobjective optimization problem in which both
   economic and safety aspects are taken into account. The approach is
   applied for the purification of bioethanol, for which solvents that
   offer the best cost safety compromise are identified.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study of structural, morphological, hydrogen absorption
   and magnetic properties of MmNi(4.22)Co(0.48)Mn(0.15)Al(0.15) alloy as a
   promising hydrogen storage media was investigated. The X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) profiles show that the alloy maintains its crystal structure
   (hexagonal LaNi5-type) even after 30 hydrogenation/dehydrogenation (H/D)
   cycles. However, the XRD peaks are found to be slightly broadened after
   cycling. SEM images reveal that particles size of the cycled sample
   decreases, with more uniform particle size distribution compared to
   noncycled ones. The pressure-composition (PC) isotherms and kinetics
   curves of hydrogen absorption reaction were obtained at different
   working temperatures by using a homemade Sievert apparatus. The enthalpy
   and entropy of hydride formation of the alloy were evaluated.
   Furthermore, the Jander diffusion and Johnson-Mehl-Avrami models as the
   fitting models were employed to study the kinetic mechanism of hydriding
   reaction and its activation energy. The room temperature magnetic
   measurements indicate that the milling and H/D cycling change the
   magnetic properties of the as-annealed alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile sub-millimeter micro-robots have demonstrated untethered motion
   and transport of cargo in remote, confined or enclosed environments.
   However, limited by simple design and actuation, they lack
   remotely-actuated on-board mechanisms required to perform complex tasks
   such as object assembly. A flexible patterned magnetic material which
   allows internal actuation, resulting in a mobile micro-gripper which is
   driven and actuated by magnetic fields, is introduced here. By remotely
   controlling the magnetization direction of each micro-gripper arm, a
   gripping motion which can be combined with locomotion for precise
   transport, orientation, and programmable three-dimensional assembly of
   micro-parts in remote environments is demonstrated. This allows the
   creation of out-of-plane 3D structures and mechanisms made from several
   building blocks. Using multiple magnetic materials in each
   micro-gripper, the addressable actuation of gripper teams for parallel,
   distributed operation is also demonstrated. These mobile micro-grippers
   can potentially be applied to 3D assembly of heterogeneous
   meta-materials, construction of medical devices inside the human body,
   the study of biological systems in micro-fluidic channels, 3D
   micro-device prototyping or desktop micro-factories.}},

Abstract = {{Intron-containing and intronless genes have different biological

   support vector machine (SVM) classifier with Gaussian radial basis
   kernel function is performed on this feature space to classify the genes
   into intron-containing and intronless. We investigate the performance of
   the proposed method in comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms

Abstract = {{Developing rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries hinges on identifying stable
   solvents resistant to decomposition. Here, we focus on solvent stability
   against adsorption-induced H-abstraction during discharge. Using a
   detailed thermodynamic analysis, we show that a solvent's propensity to
   resist H-abstraction is determined by its acid dissociation constant,
   pK(a), in its own environment. Upon surveying hundreds of solvents for
   their pK(a) values in different media, we find linear correlations
   between the pK(a) values across various classes of solvents in any two
   given media. Utilizing these correlations, we choose DMSO as the common
   standard to compare the relative stability trends. We construct a
   stability plot based on the solvent's HOMO level and its pK(a) in DMSO,
   which reveals that most solvents obey a correlation where solvents with
   lower HOMO levels tend to have lower pK(a) values in DMSO. However, this
   is at odds with the stability requirement that demands deep HOMO levels
   and high pK(a) values. Thus, stable solvents need to be outliers to this
   observed correlation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optimal process for the simultaneous production of
   biodiesel (using methanol or bioethanol) and ethers of glycerol is
   proposed to increase the yield to diesel substitutes in current bio
   diesel production facilities. The problem is formulated as an
   optimization model including algae oil production, production of ethanol
   from starch, transesterification of the oil with bioethanol or methanol,
   etherification of glycerol with i-butene, which depends on a dynamic
   model to compute the complex chemical kinetics, and the purification of
   the ethers. Simultaneous optimization and heat integration are carried
   out and finally the water consumption of the integrated processes is
   optimized. Several comparisons are presented. First, the use of glycerol
   to produce ethers or as a byproduct. Second, the use of different
   alcohols for biodiesel synthesis in an integrated process. The
   production of glycerol ethers increases the yield of diesel substitutes
   by 20\%. Furthermore, the energy and water consumptions are competitive
   with those processes when glycerol is the byproduct. For the integration
   of glycerol ethers with current biodiesel plants, the use of methanol
   instead of ethanol is cheaper. However, the current price of i-butene
   results in high production costs. Simultaneous production of ethanol,
   biodiesel and glyerol ethers reaches the target of \$1/gal for biofuels
   production cost.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of methane emissions released by the natural gas (NG)
   industry is a critical and uncertain value for various industry and
   policy decisions, such as for determining the climate implications of
   using NG over coal. Previous studies have estimated fugitive emissions
   rates (FER) the fraction of produced NG (mainly methane and ethane)
   escaped to the atmosphere between 1 and 9\%. Most of these studies rely
   on few and outdated measurements, and some may represent only
   temporal/regional NG industry snapshots. This study estimates NG
   industry representative PER using global atmospheric methane and ethane
   measurements over three decades, and literature ranges of (i) tracer gas
   atmospheric lifetimes, (ii) non-NG source estimates, and (iii) fossil
   fuel fugitive gas hydrocarbon compositions. The modeling suggests an
   upper bound global average FER of 5\% during 2006-2011, and a most
   likely FER of 2-4\% since 2000, trending downward. These results do not
   account for highly uncertain natural hydrocarbon seepage, which could
   lower the FER. Further emissions reductions by the NG industry may be
   needed to ensure climate benefits over coal during the next few decades.}},

Abstract = {{The global-regional climate-air pollution modeling system (GRE-CAPS) was
   applied over the eastern United States to study the impact of climate
   change on the concentration and deposition of atmospheric mercury.
   Summer and winter periods (300 days for each) were simulated, and the
   present-day model predictions (2000s) were compared to the future ones
   (2050s) assuming constant emissions. Climate change affects He
   concentrations in both periods. On average, atmospheric Hg2+ levels are
   predicted to increase in the future by 3\% in summer and 5\% in winter
   respectively due to enhanced oxidation of Hg-0 under higher
   temperatures. The predicted concentration change of Hg2+ was found to
   vary significantly in space due to regional-scale changes in
   precipitation, ranging from -30\% to 30\% during summer and -20\% to
   40\% during winter. Particulate mercury, Hg(p) has a similar spatial
   response to climate change as Hg2+, while Hg levels are not predicted to
   change significantly. In both periods, the response of mercury
   deposition to climate change varies spatially with an average predicted
   increase of 6\% during summer and 4\% during winter. During summer,
   deposition increases are predicted mostly in the western parts of the
   domain while mercury deposition is predicted to decrease in the
   Northeast and also in many areas in the Midwest and Southeast. During
   winter mercury deposition is predicted to change from 30\% to 50\%
   mainly due to the changes in rainfall and the corresponding changes in
   wet deposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Inherent advantages of optical-based sensing devices motivate a need for
   materials with useful optical responses that can be utilized as thin
   film functional sensor layers. Transparent conducting metal oxides with
   large electrical conductivities as typified by Al-doped ZnO (AZO)
   display attractive properties for high temperature optical gas sensing
   through strong optical transduction of responses conventionally
   monitored through changes in measured electrical resistivity. An
   enhanced optical sensing response in the near-infrared and
   ultraviolet/visible wavelength ranges is demonstrated experimentally and
   linked with characteristic modifications to the dielectric constant due
   to a relatively high concentration of free charge carriers. The impact
   of light scattering on the magnitude and wavelength dependence of the
   sensing response is also discussed highlighting the potential for tuning
   the optical sensing response by controlling the surface roughness of a
   continuous film or the average particle size of a nanoparticle-based
   film. The physics underpinning the optical sensing response for AZO
   films on planar substrates yields significant insight into the measured
   sensing response for optical fiber-based evanescent wave absorption
   spectroscopy sensors employing an AZO sensing layer. The physics of
   optical gas sensing discussed here provides a pathway towards
   development of sensing materials for extreme temperature optical gas
   sensing applications. As one example, preliminary results are presented
   for a Nb-doped TiO2 film with sufficient stability and relatively large
   sensing responses at sensing temperatures greater than 500 degrees C.

Abstract = {{Human travel impacts the spread of infectious diseases across spatial
   and temporal scales, with broad implications for the biological and
   social sciences. Individual data on travel patterns have been difficult
   to obtain, particularly in low-income countries. Travel survey data
   provide detailed demographic information, but sample sizes are often
   small and travel histories are hard to validate. Mobile phone records
   can provide vast quantities of spatio-temporal travel data but vary in
   spatial resolution and explicitly do not include individual information
   in order to protect the privacy of subscribers. Here we compare and
   contrast both sources of data over the same time period in a rural area
   of Kenya. Although both data sets are able to quantify broad travel
   patterns and distinguish regional differences in travel, each provides
   different insights that can be combined to form a more detailed picture
   of travel in low-income settings to understand the spread of infectious
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, stability and electronic properties of C15-AB(2) (A =
   Ti, Zr; B = Cr) isomeric intermetallic compounds were systematically
   investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and plane-wave
   pseudo-potential (PW-PP) method. The macroscopic properties including
   the lattice constant, bulk modulus and stability for these compounds
   were studied before and after hydrogenation. For parent compounds, the
   enthalpy of formation was evaluated with regard to their bulk modules
   and electronic structures. After hydrogenation of compounds at different
   interstitial tetrahedral sites (A(2)B(2), A(1)B(3), B-4), a volume
   expansion was found for hydrides. The stability properties of hydrides
   characterized the A(2)B(2) sites as the site preference of hydrogen
   atoms for both compounds. The Miedema's ``reverse stability{''} rule is
   also satisfied in these compounds as lower the enthalpy of formation for
   the host compound, the more stable the hydride. Analysis of microscopic
   properties (electronic structures) after hydrogenation at more stable
   interstitial site (A(2)B(2)) shows that the H atoms interact stronger
   with the weaker (or non) hydride forming element B (Cr) than the hydride
   forming element A (Ti/Zr). A correlation was also found between the
   stability of the hydrides and their electronic structure: the deeper the
   hydrogen band, the less stable the hydride.}},

   caused by both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We were able to
   identify the key features of the electronic structure that explains the

Abstract = {{This contribution addresses the multi-period synthesis of an optimally
   integrated regional biomass and bioenergy supply network through a
   mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) approach. The production
   processes from different sources of biomass include first, second, and

   Fischer Tropsch diesel, and green gasoline. The aim is to maximize the
   sustainably viable utilization of resources by accounting for the
   competition between fuels and food production. An MILP model for
   efficient bioenergy network optimization based on four layers is
   extended to include several features, such as seasonality and
   availability of resources, enabling recycles of products and total site
   heat integration in order to address real-world applications with a
   systematic decisionmaking approach. The multi-period optimization of a
   heat-integrated biorefinery's supply network is performed through
   maximization of the economic performance. Economically efficient
   solutions are obtained with optimal selection of raw materials,

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the optimization of the tactical planning for the
   Fast Moving Consumer Goods industry using an MILP model. To prevent
   unnecessary waste and missed sales, shelf-life restrictions are
   introduced using three methods. The direct method tracks the age of
   products directly. While it provides optimal solutions, it is
   computationally inefficient. The indirect method forces products to
   leave inventory before the end of their shelf-life. It obtains solutions
   within a few percent of optimality. Moreover, compared to the direct
   method, the computational time was on average reduced by a factor 32.
   The hybrid method models the shelf-life directly in the first and
   indirectly in the second storage stage. It obtains near optimal
   solutions and, on average, reduces the required computational time by a
   factor 5 compared to the direct method. Cases containing up to 25, 100,
   and 1000 SKUs were optimized using the direct, hybrid and indirect
   method respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a heterogeneous parallel structure, two types of algorithms, Quesada
   Grossmann's (QG) algorithm and Tabu search (TS), are used to solve mixed
   integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) simultaneously. Communication is
   well designed between two threads running the two algorithms
   individually by exchanging three kinds of information during iterations.
   First, the best feasible solution in TS can become a valid upper bound
   for QG. Second, new linearization which can further tighten the lower
   bound of QG can be generated at the node provided by the TS. Third,
   additional integer variables can be fixed in QG, thus reducing the
   search space of TS. Numerical results show that good performance can be
   achieved by using the proposed method. Further analysis reveals that the
   heterogeneous method has the potential for superlinear speedup, which
   may surpass that of the traditional homogeneous parallel method for
   solving MINLPs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a self-assembling soft modular matter, called
   SoftCubes, where soft-bodied modules are disassembled into a flexible
   string by an external tension and self-assemble into the preprogrammed
   three-dimensional (3D) shape. The developed soft modular matter has
   three main design features. Firstly, entire modules of the 3D shape are
   serially connected. Such a structure allows all the modules to be
   disassembled by external tension. Secondly, the outer body of the
   modules and the connecting parts are made of soft stretchable elastomer.
   Due to the soft body of the modules, after disassembling, the serially
   connected modules become a highly flexible and soft string, and have an
   extreme shape adaptation capability. Also, if the external tension is
   removed, the preprogrammed 3D shape is recovered by the elastic
   restoring force of soft-bodied modules. Finally, embedded small
   permanent magnets induce magnetic self-assembling forces and maintain a
   mechanical robustness of the 3D shape of module assembly. Due to the
   magnetic self-assembly, the soft modules are precisely aligned with
   neighboring modules in a lattice structure. The paper also presents an
   algorithm to generate the serial connection path of modules for creating
   a given 3D shape. Various physical interactions between self-assembling
   module prototypes are visualized in two-dimensional motion tracking
   experiments. Finally, the shape reconfiguration ability of soft modular
   matter is demonstrated. SoftCubes is a new class of programmable modular
   matter where shape memory ability is embedded in the structure, and
   shows a physical implementation of various 3D shapes with a high
   resolution and a high scalability.}},

Abstract = {{Escalating manufacturing cost and complexity is challenging the premise
   of affordable scaling. With lithography accounting for a large fraction
   of wafer costs, researchers are actively exploring several
   cost-effective alternative lithographic techniques, such as directed
   self-assembly, self-aligned multiple patterning, etc. However, most of
   the alternative lithographic techniques are restrictive, and it is
   important to understand the impact of such pattering restrictions on
   system-on-chip (SoC) design. To this end, we artificially restricted all
   layers in a 14 nm process to be pure gratings and observed that the pure
   gratings approach results in an inefficient SoC design with several
   process integration concerns. To come up with a technology definition
   that is mindful of designer requirements, it is essential to undertake a
   holistic design technology co-optimization (DTCO) considering several
   SoC design elements, such as standard cell logic, static random access
   memory bitcells, analog blocks, and physical synthesis. Our DTCO on the
   IBM 14 nm process with additional 10- and 7-nm node-like pattern
   restrictions leads us to converge on a set of critical pattern
   constructs that are required for an efficient and affordable SoC design.

   analyze communication delay in a highway scenario with bidirectional
   traffic, considering both connected and disconnected RSUs, and validate
   our model via simulations and experimental measurements with 802.11p
   equipment. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our results show that
   significant benefits of RSUs in terms of connectivity and message
   dissemination can only be achieved when the deployed RSUs are
   interconnected. Conversely, deploying a large number of disconnected
   RSUs will lead to little or no benefit in message dissemination delay.}},

Title = {{Comparing the magnitude of simulated residential rebound effects from
   electric end-use efficiency across the US}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Many US states rely on energy efficiency goals as a strategy to reduce
   CO(2)e emissions and air pollution, to minimize investments in new power
   plants, and to create jobs. For those energy efficiency interventions
   that are cost-effective, i.e., saving money and reducing energy,
   consumers may increase their use of energy services, or re-spend cost
   savings on other carbon- and energy-intensive goods and services. In
   this paper, we simulate the magnitude of these `rebound effects' in each
   of the 50 states in terms of CO(2)e emissions, focusing on residential
   electric end-uses under plausible assumptions. We find that a 10\%
   reduction in annual electricity use by a household results in an
   emissions' reduction penalty ranging from 0.1 ton CO(2)e in California
   to 0.3 ton CO(2)e in Alabama (from potential emissions reductions of 0.3
   ton CO(2)e and 1.6 ton CO(2)e, respectively, in the no rebound case).
   Rebound effects, percentage-wise, range from 6\% in West Virginia (which
   has a high-carbon electricity and low electricity prices), to as high as
   40\% in California (which has low-carbon electricity and high
   electricity prices). The magnitude of rebound effects percentage-wise
   depends on the carbon intensity of the grid: in states with low
   emissions factors and higher electricity prices, such as California, the
   rebound effects are much larger percentage-wise than in states like
   Pennsylvania. Conversely, the states with larger per cent rebound
   effects are the ones where the implications in terms of absolute
   emissions changes are the smallest.}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{A new cryomacroscope prototype-a visualization device for the in situ
   analysis of cryopreserved biological samples-is presented in the current
   study. In order to visualize samples larger than the field of view of
   the optical setup, a scanning mechanism is integrated into the system,
   which represents a key improvement over previous cryomacroscope
   prototypes. Another key feature of the new design is in its
   compatibility with available top-loading controlled-rate cooling
   chambers, which eliminates the need for a dedicated cooling mechanism.
   The objective for the current development is to create means to generate
   a single digital movie of an experimental investigation, with all
   relevant data overlaid. The visualization capabilities of the scanning
   cryomacroscope are demonstrated in the current study on the
   cryoprotective agent dimethyl sulfoxide and the cryoprotective cocktail
   DP6. Demonstrated effects include glass formation, various regimes of
   crystallization, thermal contraction, and fracture formation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A fundamental understanding of the tribology aspects of machining
   processes is essential for increasing the dimensional accuracy and
   surface integrity of finished products. To this end, the present
   investigation simulates an orthogonal metal cutting using an explicit
   finite element code, LS-DYNA. In the simulations, a rigid cutting tool
   of variable rake angle was moved at different velocities against an
   aluminum workpiece. A damage material model was utilized for the
   workpiece to capture the chip separation behavior and the simultaneous
   breakage of the chip into multiple fragments. The friction factor at the
   cutting tool-workpiece interface was varied through a contact model to
   predict cutting forces and dynamic chip formation. Overall, the results
   showed that the explicit finite element is a powerful tool for
   simulating metal cutting and discontinuous chip formation. The
   separation of the chip from the workpiece was accurately predicted.
   Numerical results found that rake angle and friction factor have a
   significantly influence on the discontinuous chip formation process,
   chip morphology, chip size, and cutting forces when compared to the
   cutting velocity during metal cutting. The model was validated against
   the experimental and numerical results obtained in the literature, and a
   good agreement with the current numerical results was found.}},

Title = {{An optimization-based undeflated PLS (OUPLS) method to handlemissing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Advances in sensory systems have led to many industrial applications
   with large amounts of highly correlated data, particularly in chemical
   and pharmaceutical processes. With these correlated data sets, it
   becomes important to consider advanced modeling approaches built to deal
   with correlated inputs in order to understand the underlying sources of
   variability and how this variability will affect the final quality of
   the product.
   Additional to the correlated nature of the data sets, it is also common
   to find missing elements and noise in these data matrices. Latent
   variable regression methods such as partial least squares or projection
   to latent structures (PLS) have gained much attention in industry for
   their ability to handle ill-conditioned matrices with missing elements.
   This feature of the PLS method is accomplished through the nonlinear
   iterative PLS (NIPALS) algorithm, with a simple modification to consider
   the missing data. Moreover, in expectation maximization PLS (EM-PLS),
   imputed values are provided for missing data elements as initial
   estimates, conventional PLS is then applied to update these elements,
   and the process iterates to convergence.
   This study is the extension of previous work for principal component
   analysis (PCA), where we introduced nonlinear programming (NLP) as a
   means to estimate the parameters of the PCA model. Here, we focus on the
   parameters of a PLS model.
   As an alternative tomodified NIPALS and EM-PLS, this paper presents an
   efficient NLP-based technique to find model parameters for PLS, where
   the desired properties of the parameters can be explicitly posed as
   constraints in the optimization problem of the proposed algorithm. We
   also present a number of simulation studies, where we compare
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with competing algorithms.

Title = {{Influence of Magnetic Fields on Magneto-Aerotaxis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The response of cells to changes in their physico-chemical
   micro-environment is essential to their survival. For example, bacterial
   magnetotaxis uses the Earth's magnetic field together with chemical
   sensing to help microorganisms move towards favoured habitats. The
   studies of such complex responses are lacking a method that permits the
   simultaneous mapping of the chemical environment and the response of the
   organisms, and the ability to generate a controlled physiological
   magnetic field. We have thus developed a multi-modal microscopy platform
   that fulfils these requirements. Using simultaneous fluorescence and
   high-speed imaging in conjunction with diffusion and aerotactic models,
   we characterized the magneto-aerotaxis of Magnetospirillum gryph is
   waldense. We assessed the influence of the magnetic field (orientation;
   strength) on the formation and the dynamic of a micro-aerotactic band
   (size, dynamic, position). As previously described by models of
   magnetotaxis, the application of a magnetic field pointing towards the
   anoxic zone of an oxygen gradient results in an enhanced aerotaxis even
   down to Earth's magnetic field strength. We found that neither a
   ten-fold increase of the field strength nor a tilt of 45 degrees
   resulted in a significant change of the aerotactic efficiency. However,
   when the field strength is zeroed or when the field angle is tilted to
   90 degrees, the magneto-aerotaxis efficiency is drastically reduced. The
   classical model of magneto-aerotaxis assumes a response proportional to
   the cosine of the angle difference between the directions of the oxygen
   gradient and that of the magnetic field. Our experimental evidence
   however shows that this behaviour is more complex than assumed in this
   model, thus opening up new avenues for research.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with appropriate adhesive properties are suitable for the
   fabrication of bionic adhesive pads. In this study, a novel
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material enhanced with two types of
   crosslinkers, carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets, was fabricated. The
   Contact Angle (CA) and cross-sectional morphology of the new material
   were investigated and observed using a CA meter and Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM), respectively. CA measurements indicate that the
   surface energy of the novel material is twice that of the common PDMS
   material. SEM observations show that carbon nanotubes and graphene
   sheets are well dispersed in the polymer, a feature that improves the
   mechanical properties of the new material. The adhesive performance of
   this novel composite was tested on an in-house fabricated friction
   machine. Results show that at a preload of only 50 mN, the adhesion of
   the novel PDMS material is up to similar to 3.7 times that of common
   PDMS. The maximum macroscale shear strength and normal adhesion reach 4
   N.cm(-2) and 1 N.cm(-2), respectively. The adhesive capability of the
   material is maintained even after hundreds of times of repeated use.
   This novel material exhibits excellent adhesion, sufficiently high
   elastic modulus and high repeatability at low preloads.}},

Abstract = {{Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)-based protein engineering of
   chymotrypsin with a cationic polymer was used to tune the substrate
   specificity and inhibitor binding. Poly(quaternary ammonium) was grown
   from the surface of the enzyme using ATRP after covalent attachment of a
   protein reactive, water-soluble ATRP-initiator. This ``grafting from{''}
   conjugation approach generated a high density of cationic ammonium ions
   around the biocatalytic core. Modification increased the surface area of
   the protein over 40-fold, and the density of modification on the protein
   surface was approximately one chain per 4 nm(2). After modification,
   bioactivity was increased at low pH relative to the activity of the
   native enzyme. In addition, the affinity of the enzyme for a peptide
   substrate was increased over a wide pH range. The massively cationic
   chymotrypsin, which included up to 2000 additional positive charges per
   molecule of enzyme, was also more stable at extremes of temperature and
   pH. Most interestingly, we were able to rationally control the binding
   of two oppositely charged polypeptide protease inhibitors, aprotinin and
   the Bowman-Birk trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor from Glycine max, to the
   cationic derivative of chymotrypsin. This study expands upon our efforts
   to use polymer-based protein engineering to predictably engineer enzyme
   properties without the need for molecular biology.}},

Abstract = {{Motor cortex plays a substantial role in driving movement, yet the
   details underlying this control remain unresolved. We analyzed the
   extent to which movement-related information could be extracted from
   single-trial motor cortical activity recorded while monkeys performed
   center-out reaching. Using information theoretic techniques, we found
   that single units carry relatively little speed-related information
   compared with direction-related information. This result is not
   mitigated at the population level: simultaneously recorded population
   activity predicted speed with significantly lower accuracy relative to
   direction predictions. Furthermore, a unit-dropping analysis revealed
   that speed accuracy would likely remain lower than direction accuracy,
   even given larger populations. These results suggest that the
   instantaneous details of single-trial movement speed are difficult to
   extract using commonly assumed coding schemes. This apparent paucity of
   speed information takes particular importance in the context of
   brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which rely on extracting kinematic
   information from motor cortex. Previous studies have highlighted
   subjects' difficulties in holding a BMI cursor stable at targets. These
   studies, along with our finding of relatively little speed information
   in motor cortex, inspired a speed-dampening Kalman filter (SDKF) that
   automatically slows the cursor upon detecting changes in decoded
   movement direction. Effectively, SDKF enhances speed control by using
   prevalent directional signals, rather than requiring speed to be
   directly decoded from neural activity. SDKF improved success rates by a
   factor of 1.7 relative to a standard Kalman filter in a closed-loop BMI
   task requiring stable stops at targets. BMI systems enabling stable
   stops will be more effective and user-friendly when translated into
   clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Postspike effects (PSEs) in averages of spike-triggered EMG snippets
   provide physiological evidence of connectivity between CMN cells and
   spinal motoneurons innervating skeletal muscles. They are typically
   detected by visual inspection of spike-triggered averages (SpTAs) or by
   multiple-fragment/single-snippet analyses {[}MFA (Poliakov AV, Schieber
   MH. J Neurosci Methods 79: 143-150, 1998) and SSA (Perel S, Schwartz AB,
   Ventura V. Neural Comput 26: 40-56, 2014)]; the latter are automatic
   tests that yield P values. However, MFA/SSA are only effective to detect
   PSEs that occur at about 6-16 ms posttrigger. Our first contribution is
   the scan test, an automatic test that has the same utility as SpTA,
   i.e., it can detect a wide range of PSEs at any latency, but it also
   yields a P value. Our second contribution is a thorough investigation of
   the statistical properties of PSE detection tests. We show that when the
   PSE is weak or the sample size is small, visual inspections of SpTAs
   have low power, because it is difficult to distinguish PSEs from
   background EMG variations. We also show that the scan test has better
   power and that its rate of spurious detections matches the chosen
   significance level alpha. This is especially important for investigators
   because, when a PSE is detected, this guarantees that the probability of
   a spurious PSE is less than alpha. Finally, we illustrate the
   operational characteristics of the PSE detection tests on 2,059 datasets
   from 5 experiments. The scan test is particularly useful to identify
   candidate PSEs, which can then be subject to further evaluation by SpTA
   inspection, and when PSEs are small and visual detection is ambiguous.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz (THz) technologies are promising for diverse areas such as
   medicine, bioengineering, astronomy, environmental monitoring, and
   communications. However, despite decades of worldwide efforts, the THz
   region of the electromagnetic spectrum still continues to be elusive for
   solid state technology. Here, we report on the development of a
   powerless, compact, broadband, flexible, large-area, and
   polarization-sensitive carbon nanotube THz detector that works at room
   temperature. The detector is sensitive throughout the entire range of
   the THz technology gap, with responsivities as high as similar to 2.5
   V/W and polarization ratios as high as similar to 5:1. Complete
   thermoelectric and opto-thermal characterization together unambiguously
   reveal the photothermoelectric origin of the THz photosignal, triggered
   by plasmonic absorption and collective antenna effects, and suggest that
   judicious design of thermal management and quantum engineering of
   Seebeck coefficients will lead to further enhancement of device
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The lithium ion battery is viewed as one of the most important energy
   storage devices for sustainable transport of power, and it is now
   attracting tremendous attention. In the present work, dense Sn films
   were pulse electrodeposited on a Cu substrate and then post-treated at
   200 degrees C under different conditions, including electroplating a Cu
   coating film and heat treatment in different atmospheres. Surface
   morphology and composition of the films were characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive
   spectroscopy. These films were then assembled as anodes for Li ion
   batteries with their electrochemical properties investigated. The
   Sn-based anode with a Cu coating post-heated in argon for 12 h forms a
   surface with Cu6Sn5/Sn as the primary phase. It showed the largest first
   cycle charge/discharge capacity and highest irreversible capacity loss
   (IRC). The Sn-based anode sintered in air for 48 h was surface modified
   by SnO and showed the smallest IRC. Change in charge/discharge
   capacities as well as IRC at different cycles was also analyzed with the
   architecture of multi-layered anodes. Defects in the Cu6Sn5/Sn surface
   phase lead to an increase in both the first cycle capacity and IRC of
   the anode, while the existence of SnO is beneficial to the decrease in
   the first cycle IRC of the anode. This work provides a fundamental
   understanding for the influence of the surface morphology, composition,
   and microstructure of Sn-based anodes on their electrochemical
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors propose a mechanically flexible direct
   conversion x-ray detector as a potential solution for portable and
   conformal digital x-ray imaging. It consists of a micropillar structured
   layer of 100-mu m-thick amorphous selenium (a-Se) on a flexible thin
   film transistor (TFT) backplane with a pixel size of 70 mu m as a
   substrate. The flexible substrate is made of an optically transparent
   polyimide with a heat resistance of more than 200 degrees C. It is
   bonded on a glass carrier for rigid substrate handling during the
   amorphous silicon (a-Si) TFT process. Separating the flexible substrate
   from the glass carrier is partly facilitated by a debonding layer
   sandwiched between them. A two-dimensional electrical simulation
   analysis revealed a possible charge generation and collection mechanism
   within the micropillared a-Se layer. An x-ray image captured by the
   curved flexible detector indicated that a pillarlike a-Se conversion
   layer can be used to perform x-ray imaging. This is, to the best of our
   knowledge, the first demonstration of a flexible digital x-ray direct
   conversion detector. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of modeling biomass yields on the basis of deterministic
   point values aggregated over space and time obscures important risks
   associated with large-scale biofuel use, particularly risks related to
   drought-induced yield reductions that may become increasingly frequent
   under a changing climate. Using switchgrass as a case study, this work
   quantifies the variability in expected yields over time and space
   through switchgrass growth modeling under historical and simulated
   future weather. The predicted switchgrass yields across the United
   States range from about 12 to 19 Mg/ha, and the 80\% confidence
   intervals range from 20 to 60\% of the mean. Average yields are
   predicted to decrease with increased temperatures and weather
   variability induced by climate change. Feedstock yield variability needs
   to be a central part of modeling to ensure that policy makers
   acknowledge risks to energy supplies and develop strategies or
   contingency plans that mitigate those risks.}},

Abstract = {{Moment estimation is an important problem during circuit validation, in
   both presilicon and postsilicon stages. From the estimated moments, the
   probability of failure and parametric yield can be estimated at each
   circuit configuration and corner, and these metrics are used for design
   optimization and making product qualification decisions. The problem is
   especially difficult if only a very small sample size is allowed for
   measurement or simulation, as is the case for complex
   analog/mixed-signal circuits. In this paper, we propose an efficient
   moment estimation method, called multiple-population moment estimation
   (MPME), that significantly improves estimation accuracy under small
   sample size. The key idea is to leverage the data collected under
   different corners/configurations to improve the accuracy of moment
   estimation at each individual corner/configuration. Mathematically, we
   employ the hierarchical Bayesian framework to exploit the underlying
   correlation in the data. We apply the proposed method to several
   datasets including postsilicon measurements of a commercial high-speed
   I/O link, and demonstrate an average error reduction of up to 2x, which
   can be equivalently translated to significant reduction of validation
   time and cost.}},

Abstract = {{Given the appropriate control strategies and market rules, distributed
   energy resources (DER) organized into microgrids have the potential to
   be active participants in regional energy and ancillary services
   markets. This paper integrates a price-based control mechanism into the
   conventional frequency droop control mechanism to present an integrated
   droop-based control framework that could facilitate greater DER
   penetration in the power system and electricity markets. The proposed
   control framework makes use of the concept of ``price droop,{''} and
   introduces the idea of a ``system frequency elasticity{''}. These two
   concepts combine the power system control concept of frequency droop and
   the economic concept of own price elasticity. The framework consists of
   a centralized agent-based learning process and a decentralized
   operational response. The applicability of the proposed control
   mechanism is demonstrated through a series of case studies. Results
   highlight the need to consider the dynamics of the existing system in
   the design of new technical and market strategies to allow for the

Abstract = {{Increased levels of variable renewable generation lead to increased
   variations in power flows. If the required transmission capacity is
   provided by a grid with no or little controllability as in today's power
   system, the consequence is a significant under-utilization of the

   flow control is used to improve the utilization of the existing
   transmission capabilities and adjust the grid to the varying needs of
   generation and demand. In lieu of the traditional N-1 security
   formulation, a risk based approach is employed. The resulting risk
   constrained economic dispatch is solved efficiently by decomposing it
   into a two stage process by using newly defined locational security
   impact factors (LSIF). In addition, these LSIFs provide information on
   the most effective, location-dependent measures to reduce system risk.
   Simulations provide insights into the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)
   approach to optimally dispatch energy storage and dispatchable
   generation in the electric energy system under uncertainties introduced
   by variable energy sources as well as demand. The objective is to
   minimize the expectation of the sum of the production and ramping costs
   for generators while satisfying all the system constraints. The
   uncertainties are represented by scenarios, resulting in a large-scale
   and computationally demanding optimization problem. We use the
   optimality condition decomposition (OCD) to decompose the SMPC problem
   into subproblems which can be solved in parallel thereby reducing the
   computation time. Both a scenario-based decomposition and a
   temporal-based decomposition are formulated and numerically evaluated in
   terms of speed and convergence using a modified IEEE 39-bus test system.
   Simulation results indicate that the scenario-based decomposition scheme
   achieves a better trade-off between convergence speed and subproblem
   size for the considered optimal dispatch problem.}},

Abstract = {{We report a thermoresponsive chemical modification strategy of
   hyaluronic acid (HA) for coating onto a broad range of biomaterials
   without relying on chemical functionalization of the surface.
   Poly(di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PMEO(2)MA), a
   polymer with a lower critical solution temperature of 26 degrees C in
   water, was grafted onto HA to allow facile formation of biopolymer
   coatings. While the mechanism for film formation appears to involve a
   complex combination of homogeneous nucleation followed by heterogeneous
   film growth, we demonstrate that it resulted in hydrophilic coatings
   that significantly reduce protein adsorption despite the high fraction
   of hydrophobic (PMEO(2)MA). Structural characterization was performed
   using atomic force microscopy (AFM), which showed the formation of a
   dense, continuous coating based on 200 nm domains that were stable in
   protein solutions for at least 15 days. The coatings had a water contact
   angle of 16, suggesting the formation of hydrophilic but not fully
   wetting films. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
   (QCM-D) as well as biolayer interferometry (BLI) techniques were used to
   measure adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), fibrinogen (Fbg), and
   human immunoglobulin (IgG), with results indicating that
   HA-PMEO(2)MA-coated surfaces effectively inhibited adsorption of all
   three serum proteins. These results are consistent with previous studies
   demonstrating that this degree of hydrophilicity is sufficient to
   generate an effectively nonfouling surface and suggest that segregation
   during the solubility transition resulted in a surface that presented
   the hydrophilic HA component of the hybrid biopolymer. We conclude that
   PMEO(2)MA-grafted HA is a versatile platform for the passivation of
   hydrophobic biomaterial surfaces without need for substrate
   functionalization.}},

Title = {{A Unified Nomenclature and Amino Acid Numbering for Human PTEN}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{332}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The tumor suppressor PTEN is a major brake for cell transformation,
   mainly due to its phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
   {[}PI(3,4,5)P-3] phosphatase activity that directly counteracts the
   oncogenicity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PTEN mutations are
   frequent in tumors and in the germ line of patients with tumor
   predisposition or with neurological or cognitive disorders, which makes
   the PTEN gene and protein a major focus of interest in current
   biomedical research. After almost two decades of intense investigation
   on the 403-residue-long PTEN protein, a previously uncharacterized form
   of PTEN has been discovered that contains 173 amino-terminal extra amino
   acids, as a result of an alternate translation initiation site. To
   facilitate research in the field and to avoid ambiguities in the naming
   and identification of PTEN amino acids from publications and databases,
   we propose here a unifying nomenclature and amino acid numbering for
   this longer form of PTEN.}},

Abstract = {{Follicular lesions of the thyroid remain significant diagnostic
   challenges in surgical pathology and cytology. The diagnosis often
   requires considerable resources and ancillary tests including
   immunohistochemistry, molecular studies, and expert consultation. Visual
   analyses of nuclear morphological features, generally speaking, have not
   been helpful in distinguishing this group of lesions. Here we describe a
   method for distinguishing between follicular lesions of the thyroid
   based on nuclear morphology. The method utilizes an optimal
   transport-based linear embedding for segmented nuclei, together with an
   adaptation of existing classification methods. We show the method
   outputs assignments (classification results) which are near perfectly
   correlated with the clinical diagnosis of several lesion types' lesions
   utilizing a database of 94 patients in total. Experimental comparisons
   also show the new method can significantly outperform standard numerical
   feature-type methods in terms of agreement with the clinical diagnosis
   gold standard. In addition, the new method could potentially be used to
   derive insights into biologically meaningful nuclear morphology
   differences in these lesions. Our methods could be incorporated into a
   tool for pathologists to aid in distinguishing between follicular
   lesions of the thyroid. In addition, these results could potentially
   provide nuclear morphological correlates of biological behavior and
   reduce health care costs by decreasing histotechnician and pathologist
   time and obviating the need for ancillary testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To achieve different end-use properties of polymers, an industrial plant
   must produce several grades of the product through the same process
   under different operating conditions. As molecular weight distribution
   (MWD) is a crucial quality index of polymers, grade transition based on
   MWD is of great importance. Dynamic optimization of the grade transition
   process using MWD is a challenging task because of its large-scale
   nature. After analyzing the relationships among state variables during
   polymerization, a novel method is proposed to conduct the optimal grade
   transition using dynamic optimization with a small-scale moment model,
   combined with a steady-state calculation of the MWD. By avoiding
   expensive computation in dealing with dynamic MWD optimization, this
   technique greatly reduces the computational complexity of the process
   optimization. The theoretical equivalence of this simplification is also
   proved. Finally, an industrial high-density polyethylene slurry process
   is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
   strategy. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Abstract = {{We address nonconvex mixed-integer bilinear problems where the main
   challenge is the computation of a tight upper bound for the objective
   function to be maximized. This can be obtained by using the recently
   developed concept of multiparametric disaggregation following the
   solution of a mixed-integer linear relaxation of the bilinear problem.
   Besides showing that it can provide tighter bounds than a commercial
   global optimization solver within a given computational time, we propose
   to also take advantage of the relaxed formulation for contracting the
   variables domain and further reduce the optimality gap. Through the
   solution of a real-life case study from a hydroelectric power system, we
   show that this can be an efficient approach depending on the problem
   size. The relaxed formulation from multiparametric formulation is
   provided for a generic numeric representation system featuring a base
   between 2 (binary) and 10 (decimal).}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the global optimization of general nonconvex
   nonlinear and mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with
   underlying polynomial substructures. We incorporate linear cutting
   planes inspired by reformulation-linearization techniques to produce
   tight subproblem formulations that exploit these underlying structures.
   These cutting plane strategies simultaneously convexify linear and
   nonlinear terms from multiple constraints and are highly effective at
   tightening standard linear programming relaxations generated by
   sequential factorable programming techniques. Because the number of
   available cutting planes increases exponentially with the number of
   variables, we implement cut filtering and selection strategies to
   prevent an exponential increase in relaxation size. We introduce
   algorithms for polynomial substructure detection, cutting plane
   identification, cut filtering, and cut selection and embed the proposed
   implementation in BARON at every node in the branch-and-bound tree. A
   computational study including randomly generated problems of varying
   size and complexity demonstrates that the exploitation of underlying
   polynomial substructures significantly reduces computational time,
   branch-and-bound tree size, and required memory.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel type of vehicle launched deployable bridge
   for military or relief operations. Most existing vehicle launched
   deployable bridges (also known as assault bridges or mobile bridges)
   take the form of a simply supported beam and require mechanically
   complex deployment sequences. This bridge has, first, an innovative
   deployment sequence based on a single actuator and a tied arch form;
   second, a stackable cross-section to reduce the package size during
   transport; and third, vertical suspenders which allow for ``smart{''}
   redistribution of load as the bridge deflects. Analysis of the bridge is
   presented along with experimental results from a three-meter long scale
   physical model. Load cells and fiber optic strain sensors are used to
   monitor the physical model, and the results are shown in relation to a
   statics analysis. Our results suggest this novel design would have lower
   forces and moments than existing deployable bridges, making it lighter
   and potentially advancing the current state of the art. (C) 2014

   Application to the design of a power plant}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{With advances in the synthesis and design of chemical processes there is
   an increasing need for more complex mathematical models with which to
   screen the alternatives that constitute accurate and reliable process
   models. Despite the wide availability of sophisticated tools for
   simulation, optimization and synthesis of chemical processes, the user
   is frequently interested in using the `best available model'. However,
   in practice, these models are usually little more than a black box with
   a rigid input output structure. In this paper we propose to tackle all
   these models using generalized disjunctive programming to capture the
   numerical characteristics of each model (in equation form, modular,
   noisy, etc.) and to deal with each of them according to their individual
   characteristics. The result is a hybrid modular equation based approach
   that allows synthesizing complex processes using different models in a
   robust and reliable way. The capabilities of the proposed approach are
   discussed with a case study: the design of a utility system power plant
   that has been decomposed into its constitutive elements, each treated
   differently numerically. And finally, numerical results and conclusions
   are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{4938-4945}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to describe the five-parameter grain
   boundary character distribution (GBCD) of polycrystalline silicon and
   compare it to distributions measured in metals and ceramics. The GBCD
   was determined from the stereological analysis of electron backscatter
   diffraction maps. The distribution of grain boundary disorientations is
   non-random and has peaks at 36A degrees, 39A degrees, 45A degrees, 51A
   degrees, and 60A degrees. The axis-angle distribution reveals that most
   of the grain boundaries have misorientations around the {[}111],
   {[}110], and {[}100] axes. The most common grain boundary type (30 \%
   number fraction) has a 60A degrees misorientation around {[}111] and of
   these boundaries, the majority are twist boundaries. For other common
   boundaries, symmetric tilt configurations are preferred. The grain
   boundary character distribution of Si is distinct from those previously
   observed for metals and ceramics. The measured grain boundary
   populations are inversely correlated to calculated grain boundary
   energies available in the literature.}},

Journal = {{MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{5-8}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{The impact of electron scattering at grain boundaries in polycrystalline
   tungsten (W) thin films is studied with a unique approach. Two nominally
   300 nm-thick films, a (1 1 0)-oriented epitaxial and a (1 1 0)-textured
   polycrystalline W film, were prepared in identical fabrication
   conditions except for the substrates, i.e., Al2O3 substrate for the
   epitaxial film and thermally oxidized Si substrate for the
   polycrystalline film. The significantly larger dimension of the film
   thickness than the electron mean free path in W allows the contribution
   of surface scattering to be negligible, and the additional resistivity
   for the polycrystalline W film relative to the epitaxial film is
   attributed to grain boundary scattering. The Mayadas-Shatzkes (MS) grain
   boundary scattering model is employed for quantitative analyses, with
   the grain boundary reflection coefficient determined to be 0.42 +/- 0.02
   and 0.40 +/- 0.02 at 293 K and 4.2 K, respectively, using the measured
   lateral grain size of 119 +/- 7 nm. Based on the grain boundary
   reflection coefficient determined in this study and the surface
   scattering coefficient (p = 0.11) of the Fuchs Sondheimer model given
   elsewhere, the resistivity of W lines having line-widths less than 10 nm
   is predicted to be lower than that of Cu lines. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The scaling of piezoelectric nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) is
   challenged by the synthesis of ultrathin and high quality piezoelectric
   films on very thin electrodes. We report the synthesis and
   characterization of the thinnest piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN)
   films (10nm) ever deposited on ultrathin platinum layers (2-5 nm) using
   reactive sputtering. X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy, and fast Fourier transform analyses confirmed the
   proper crystal orientation, fine columnar texture, and the continuous
   lattice structure within individual grains in the deposited AlN
   nanometer thick films. The average extracted d(31) piezoelectric
   coefficient for the synthesized films is -1.73 pC/N, which is comparable
   to the reported values for micron thick and highly c-axis oriented AlN
   films. The 10nm AlN films were employed to demonstrate two different
   types of optimized piezoelectric nanoactuators. The unimorph actuators
   exhibit vertical displacements as large as 1.1 mu m at 0.7V for 25 mu m
   long and 30 nm thick beams. These results have a great potential to
   realize miniaturized NEMS relays with extremely low voltage, high

Abstract = {{Miniature components and devices are increasingly seen in a myriad of
   applications. In general, the dynamic behavior of miniature devices is
   critical to their functionality and performance. However, modal testing
   of miniature structures poses many challenges. This paper presents a
   design and evaluation of an impact excitation system (IES) for
   repeatable, high-bandwidth, controlled-force modal testing of miniature
   structures. Furthermore, a dynamic model of the system is derived and
   experimentally validated to enable the identification of the system
   parameters that yield single-hit impacts with desired bandwidth and
   force magnitude. The system includes a small instrumented impact tip
   attached to a custom designed flexure-based body, an automated
   electromagnetic release mechanism, and various precision positioners.
   The excitation bandwidth and the impact force magnitude can be
   controlled by selecting the system parameters. The dynamic model of the
   system includes the structural dynamics of the flexure-based body, the
   electromagnetic force and the associated eddy-current damping, and the
   impact event. A validation study showed an excellent match between the
   model simulations and experiments in terms of impact force and
   bandwidth. The model is then used to create process maps that relate the
   system parameters to the number of hits (single vs. multiple), the
   impact force magnitudes and the excitation bandwidths. These process
   maps can be used to select system parameters or predict system response
   for a given set of parameters. A set of experiments is conducted to
   compare the performances of the IES and a (manual) miniature impact
   hammer. It is concluded that the IES significantly improves
   repeatability in terms of the impact bandwidth, location, and force
   magnitude, while providing a high excitation-bandwidth and excellent
   coherence values. The application of the IES is demonstrated through
   modal testing of a miniature contact-probe system. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{STRIDE II: A Water Strider-inspired Miniature Robot with Circular
   Footpads}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Water strider insects have attracted the attention of many researchers
   due to their power-efficient and agile water surface locomotion. This
   study proposes a new water strider insect-inspired robot, called STRIDE
   II, which uses new circular footpads for high lift, stability and
   payload capability, and a new elliptical leg rotation mechanism for more
   efficient water surface propulsion. Using the advantage of scaling
   effects on surface tension versus buoyancy, similar to water strider
   insects, this robot uses the repulsive surface tension force on its
   footpads as the dominant lift principle instead of creating buoyancy by
   using very skinny (1 mm diameter) circular footpads coated with a
   superhydrophobic material. The robot and the insect propel quickly and
   power efficiently on the water surface by the sculling motion of their
   two side-legs, which never break the water surface completely. This
   paper proposes models for the lift, drag and propulsion forces and the
   energy efficiency of the proposed legged robot, and experiments are
   conducted to verify these models. After optimizing the robot design
   using the lift models, a maximum lift capacity of 55 grams is achieved
   using 12 footpads with a 4.2 cm outer diameter, while the robot itself
   weighs 21.75 grams. For this robot, a propulsion efficiency of 22.3\%
   was measured. The maximum forward and turning speeds of the robot were
   measured as 71.5 mm/sec and 0.21 rad/sec, respectively. These water
   strider robots could be used in water surface monitoring, cleaning and
   analysis in lakes, dams, rivers and the sea.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive study of structural, morphological, magnetic and
   hydrogen absorption properties of LaNi5-H system was investigated. The
   X-ray diffraction patterns show that as-synthesized LaNi5 alloy is
   single phase with CaCu5-type structure while some weak peaks of
   elemental nickel also appeared after several
   hydrogenation/dehydrogenation (H/D) cycling. The presence of pure Ni was
   also followed using the room temperature magnetic measurements. After
   H/D cycling, the particle size decreases and particle size distribution
   was found nearly uniform compared to noncycled alloy. The
   pressure-composition isotherms (PCIs) of the hydrogen absorption
   reaction were determined in the temperature range 20-80 degrees C using
   a homemade Sievert's type experimental apparatus, and then the enthalpy
   and entropy of hydride formation were calculated. The hydriding kinetic
   mechanism of LaNi5 was evaluated using the different fitting models:
   Jander diffusion model (JDM), Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) and Chou models.
   All employed models confirm an increase in the hydriding reaction rate
   with temperature. However, the calculated results using JMA model show a
   better agreement with the experimental data and hence we believe that
   diffusion along with nucleation and growth is the rate-controlling step
   for the hydriding reaction. The values of activation energy for
   hydriding reaction were also obtained by JD and JMA models.}},

Abstract = {{Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is used to characterize
   misfit dislocations in heteroepitaxial layers of GaP grown on Si(100)
   substrates. Electron channeling patterns serve as a guide to tilt and

   diffraction conditions. This leads to the selective contrast of misfit
   dislocations depending on imaging conditions, confirmed by dynamical
   simulations, similar to using standard invisibility criteria in
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The onset and evolution of
   misfit dislocations in GaP films with varying thicknesses (30 to 250 nm)
   are studied. This application simultaneously reveals interesting
   information about misfit dislocations in GaP/Si layers and demonstrates
   a specific measurement for which ECCI is preferable versus traditional
   plan-view TEM. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   in the lowest exchange coupling energy at any given temperature, while

Abstract = {{Nanoscale platinum materials are essential components in many
   technologies, including catalytic converters and fuel cells. Combining
   Pt with other metals can enhance its performance and/or decrease the
   cost of the technology, and a wide range of strategies have been
   developed to capitalize on these advantages. However, wet chemical
   synthesis of Pt-containing nanoparticles (NPs) is challenging due to the
   diverse metal segregation and metal-metal redox processes possible under
   closely related experimental conditions. Here, we elucidate the
   relationship between Pt(IV) speciation and the formation of well-known
   NP motifs, including frame-like and core-shell morphologies, in Au-Pt
   systems. We leverage insights gained from these studies to induce a
   controlled transition from redox- to surface chemistry-mediated growth
   pathways, resulting in the formation of Pt NPs in epitaxial contact and
   linear alignment along a gold nanoprism substrate. Mechanistic
   investigations using a combination of electron microscopy and Pt-195 NMR
   spectroscopy identify Pt(IV) speciation as a crucial parameter for
   understanding and controlling the formation of Pt-containing NPs.
   Combined, these findings point toward fully bottom-up methods for
   deposition and organization of NPs on colloidal plasmonic substrates.}},

   discussed, which can be significantin cases with an unclear setup, such

Abstract = {{Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a technology that provides a
   near-term solution to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the
   atmosphere and reduce our impact on the climate system. Assessments of
   carbon sequestration resources that have been made for North America
   using existing methodologies likely underestimate uncertainty and
   variability in the reservoir parameters. This paper describes a
   geostatistical model developed to estimate the CO2 storage resource in
   sedimentary formations. The proposed stochastic model accounts for the
   spatial distribution of reservoir properties and is implemented in a
   case study of the Oriskany Formation of the Appalachian sedimentary
   basin. Results indicate that the CO2 storage resource for the
   Pennsylvania part of the Oriskany Formation has substantial spatial
   variation due to heterogeneity of formation properties and basin geology
   leading to significant uncertainty in the storage assessment. The
   Oriskany Formation sequestration resource estimate in Pennsylvania
   calculated with the effective efficiency factor, E = 5\%, ranges from
   0.15 to 1.01 gigatonnes (Gt) with a mean value of 0.52 Gt of CO2 (E =
   5\%). The methodology is generalizable to other sedimentary formations
   in which site-specific trend analyses and statistical models are
   developed to estimate the CO2 sequestration storage capacity and its
   uncertainty. More precise CO2 storage resource estimates will provide
   better recommendations for government and industry leaders and inform
   their decisions on which greenhouse gas mitigation measures are best fit
   for their regions.}},

Title = {{Long-Term Results of Optimized Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer:
   Average 10-Year Follow-Up in 70 Patients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MENS HEALTH}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Background: Following the lead of lumpectomy for breast cancer, focal
   therapy for prostate cancer was introduced in order to limit morbidity
   while providing good cancer control. Focal therapy is now an established
   trend in prostate cancer management, but long-term data have not been
   available. This report presents results on 70 patients treated with
   focal cryoablation, followed for an average of 10 years. Methods:
   Between May 7, 1996, and December 28, 2005, seventy patients were
   treated with focal cryoablation. All patients were pre-staged using an
   additional prostate biopsyeither transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy or
   transperineal three-dimensional prostate mapping biopsy (3D-PMB). All
   patients were treated with focal cryoablation of the known tumor(s).
   Biochemical disease-free status was determined by the Phoenix criteria.
   Results: Disease-specific survival was 66/66 (100\%). Overall
   biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) was 62/70 (89\%). BDFS results
   stratified according to the D'Amico criteria were: 8/9 (89\%) high risk;
   28/32 (88\%) medium risk; and 26/29 (90\%) low risk. There was no
   statistically significant difference between the risk levels. Of those
   patients staged by TRUS biopsy, 8 of 24 patients had a documented local
   recurrence (33\%). Of those staged by (3D-PMB), 2 of 46 (4\%) patients
   had a local recurrence. Nine out of ten retreated local recurrences
   (90\%) remain BDF. Continence after the first treatment was 100\% (no
   pads). Potency after the first treatment was 94\%, including
   retreatments it was 74\%. Conclusions: The long-term cancer control
   results of focal cryoablation appear superior in medium- and high-risk
   patients to radical whole gland treatments. Focal therapy is associated
   with extremely low morbidity. If confirmed and applied widely, focal
   cryoablation could result in a substantial decrease in prostate cancer
   related mortality while offering a better post treatment quality of
   life.}},

Abstract = {{In September 2013, leading experts in inter-vehicle communication from
   all over the world met at the renowned Dagstuhl Castle for a seminar
   discussing the question ``Inter-Vehicular Communication - Quo Vadis?{''}
   The objective was to identify the current state of the art and, more
   important, the open challenges in R\&D from both a scientific and an
   industrial point of view. After more than a decade of research on
   vehicular networks, the experts very seriously asked whether additional
   research in this field is necessary and, if so, which will be the most
   intriguing and innovative research directions. It turned out that the
   overall perspective has changed in the last few years, mainly as a
   result of the ongoing field operational tests in the United States and
   Europe. In this article, we report the key outcomes and results from the
   discussions, pointing to new research directions and new challenges that
   need to be met for a second generation of vehicular networking
   applications and protocols. In particular, we present the reports and
   findings from the four working groups on scientific foundations of
   vehicular networking, field operational tests, IVC applications, and
   heterogeneous vehicular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Signals and datasets that arise in physical and engineering
   applications, as well as social, genetics, biomolecular, and many other
   domains, are becoming increasingly larger and more complex. In contrast
   to traditional time and image signals, data in these domains are
   supported by arbitrary graphs. Signal processing on graphs extends
   concepts and techniques from traditional signal processing to data
   indexed by generic graphs. This paper studies the concepts of low and
   high frequencies on graphs, and low-, high- and band-pass graph signals
   and graph filters. In traditional signal processing, these concepts are
   easily defined because of a natural frequency ordering that has a
   physical interpretation. For signals residing on graphs, in general,
   there is no obvious frequency ordering. We propose a definition of total
   variation for graph signals that naturally leads to a frequency ordering
   on graphs and defines low-, high-, and band-pass graph signals and
   filters. We study the design of graph filters with specified frequency
   response, and illustrate our approach with applications to sensor

   tissue engineering applications}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Natural biopolymers such as alginate have become important materials for
   a variety of biotechnology applications including drug delivery, cell
   encapsulation and tissue engineering. This expanding use has spurred the
   development of new approaches to engineer these materials at the
   nano-and microscales to better control cell interactions. Here we
   describe a method to fabricate freestanding alginate-based microfibers
   and microstructures with tunable geometries down to approximately 3 mu
   m. To do this, a polydimethylsiloxane stamp is used to micromold
   alginate or alginate-fibrin blends onto a sacrificial layer of
   thermally-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm). A warm calcium
   chloride solution is then used to crosslink the alginate and, upon
   cooling below the lower critical solution temperature (similar to 32
   degrees C), the PIPAAm layer dissolves and releases the alginate or
   alginate-fibrin as freestanding microfibers and microstructures.
   Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that C2C12 myoblasts seeded
   onto the alginate-fibrin microfibers polarize along the fiber length
   forming interconnected cell strands. Thus, we have developed the ability
   to engineer alginate-based microstructured materials that can
   selectively bind cells and direct cellular assembly.}},

Abstract = {{A series of rapid and inexpensive methods to produce elastically soft
   sensors and circuits in minutes using a CO2 laser (10.6 m wavelength)
   are introduced. These soft-matter electronics are composed of
   laser-patterned films of conductive poly(dimethylsiloxane) (cPDMS) and
   liquid-phase gallium-indium (GaIn) alloy embedded in a thin sheet of
   soft silicone elastomer. Direct laser patterning eliminates the need for
   photolithography, replica molding, and customized inkjet or microcontact
   (CP) printing, and allows conductive traces of cPDMS and liquid GaIn to
   be rapidly integrated into a single soft-matter circuit. The versatility
   of this fabrication method is demonstrated by the production of a
   variety of electrically functional soft-matter sensors and circuit
   elements that contain features with >150 m planar dimensions. It is
   postulate that in the case of GaIn alloy patterning occurs when the
   recoil force of the escaping vapor exceeds the liquid's surface tension.
   This mechanism exploits the unique moldability of liquid GaIn alloy,
   which forms a surface oxide of Ga2O3 that allows the patterned film to
   maintain its shape.}},

Abstract = {{The design, fabrication, and characterization of the first piezoelectric

   geometry. Two different actuation methods based on optimized four-layer
   unimorph actuators are used to synthesize normally closed relays with
   high mechanical restoring forces. The first experimental demonstration
   of few millivolts switching (10 mV) using the realized relays is also
   presented. The relays exhibit a very low energy dissipation per

Abstract = {{Emerging technologies promise potential benefits at a potential cost.
   Developers of educational communications aim to improve people's
   understanding and to facilitate public debate. However, even relatively
   uninformed recipients may have initial feelings that are difficult to
   change. We report that people's initial affective impressions about
   carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a low-carbon coal-based
   electricity-generation technology with which most people are unfamiliar,
   influences how they interpret previously validated education materials.
   As a result, even individuals who had originally self-identified as
   uninformed persisted in their initial feelings after reading the
   educational communication-though perseverance of feelings about CCS was
   stronger among recipients who had originally self-identified as
   relatively informed (Study 1). Moreover, uninformed recipients whose
   initial feelings were experimentally manipulated by relatively
   uninformative pro-CCS or anti-CCS arguments persisted in their
   manipulated feelings after reading the educational communication, due to
   evaluating the educational communication in line with their manipulated
   impressions (Study 2). Hence, our results suggest that educational
   communications will have more impact if they are disseminated before
   people form strong feelings about the topic under consideration,
   especially if these are based on little to no factual understanding.}},

Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Micro aerial vehicles, particularly quadrotors, have been used in a wide
   range of applications. However, the literature on aerial manipulation
   and grasping is limited and the work is based on quasi-static models. In
   this paper, we draw inspiration from agile, fast-moving birds such as
   raptors, that are able to capture moving prey on the ground or in water,
   and develop similar capabilities for quadrotors. We address dynamic
   grasping, an approach to prehensile grasping in which the dynamics of
   the robot and its gripper are significant and must be explicitly modeled
   and controlled for successful execution. Dynamic grasping is relevant
   for fast pick-and-place operations, transportation and delivery of
   objects, and placing or retrieving sensors. We show how this capability
   can be realized (a) using a motion capture system and (b) without
   external sensors relying only on onboard sensors. In both cases we
   describe the dynamic model, and trajectory planning and control
   algorithms. In particular, we present a methodology for flying and
   grasping a cylindrical object using feedback from a monocular camera and
   an inertial measurement unit onboard the aerial robot. This is
   accomplished by mapping the dynamics of the quadrotor to a level virtual
   image plane, which in turn enables dynamically-feasible trajectory
   planning for image features in the image space, and a vision-based
   controller with guaranteed convergence properties. We also present
   experimental results obtained with a quadrotor equipped with an
   articulated gripper to illustrate both approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Large bone defects may be treated with autologous or allogeneic bone
   preparations. Each treatment has advantages and disadvantages;
   therefore, a clinically viable option for treating large (e. g., gap)
   bone defects may be a combination of the two. In the present study, bone
   repair was determined with combinations of autografts, allografts, and
   synthetic bone grafts using an established rabbit femoral defect model.
   Bilateral unicortical femoral defects were surgically prepared and
   treated with combinatorial bone grafts according to one of seven
   treatment groups. Recipient sites were retrieved at six weeks.
   Cellular/tissue responses and new bone formation were assessed by
   histology and histomorphometry. Histological analysis images indicated
   neither evidence of inflammatory, immune responses, tissue necrosis, nor
   osteolysis. Data suggested co-integration of implanted agents with host
   and newly formed bone. Finally, the histomorphometric data suggested
   that the tricalcium phosphate-based synthetic bone graft substitute
   allowed new bone formation that was similar to the allograft (i.e.,
   demineralized bone matrix, DBM).}},

Title = {{Application of High-Definition Fiber Tractography in the Management of

   Quantitative Approach}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGERY}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: High-definition fiber tractography (HDFT), an advanced white
   matter (WM) imaging technique, was evaluated in the management of
   supratentorial cavernous malformations.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of cavernous malformations to
   the relevant perilesional WM tracts with HDFT and to characterize
   associated changes first qualitatively and then quantitatively with our
   novel imaging measure, quantitative anisotropy (QA).
   METHODS: Imaging analysis was carried out by researchers blinded to the
   clinical details. Contralateral WM tracts were used for comparison. Mean
   QA values were obtained for whole WM tracts. Qualitatively affected
   superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate fibers and corticospinal tracts
   were further analyzed with the use of mean QA values for the
   perilesional segments.
   RESULTS: Of 10 patients, HDFT assisted with the decision-making process
   and the offer of surgical resection in 2 patients, lesion approach and
   removal in 7 patients, and conservative management in 1 patient. Of 17
   analyzed WM tracts, HDFT demonstrated partial disruption in 2 tracts,
   complete disruption in 2 tracts, a combination of displacement and
   partial disruption in 1 tract, displacement only in 7 tracts, and no
   change in 5 tracts. Qualitative changes correlated with clinical
   symptoms. Mean QA values for the whole WM tracts were similar, with the
   exception of 1 case demonstrating complete disruption of 2 WM tracts.
   QA-based perilesional segment analysis was consistent with qualitative
   data in 5 assessed WM tracts.
   CONCLUSION: HDFT illustrated the precise spatial relationship of
   cavernous malformations to multiple WM tracts in a 3-dimensional
   fashion, optimizing surgical planning, and demonstrated associated
   disruption and/or displacement, with both occurring perilesionally.
   These changes were supported by our quantitative marker, which needs
   further validation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: As an alternative to current methods of local nerve block,
   we studied the feasibility of producing ankle block in the rat with IV
   injection of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) associated with ropivacaine
   and application of a magnet, at the ankle.
   METHODS: The anesthetic effect of magnet-directed ropivacaine-associated
   MNPs (MNP/Ropiv) was tested in the rat using paw withdrawal latencies
   from thermal stimuli applied to the hindpaw. The MNP/Ropiv complexes
   consisted of 0.7\% w/v ropivacaine and 0.8\% w/v MNPs containing 12\%
   w/w magnetite (Fe3O4). The effect of IV injection of MNP/Ropiv with 15,
   30, and 60-minute magnet application to the right ankle was compared
   with the effect without magnet application on the left hindpaw, to
   conventional ankle block with 0.1\% or 0.2\% ropivacaine, and to IV
   injection of MNPs alone with 30-minute magnet application to the right
   ankle. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of the MNP/Ropiv complexes were
   determined.
   RESULTS: IV injection of MNP/Ropiv with magnet application at the ankle
   significantly increased paw withdrawal latencies from thermal stimuli
   compared with pretreatment baselines in the same paw (P < 0.0001) and
   compared with the contralateral paw without magnet application (P <
   0.0001). IV injection of MNPs alone had no significant effect on paw
   withdrawal latency. Absolute ropivacaine concentrations in ankle tissue,
   and ankle tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios were higher in the
   MNP/Ropiv group with 30-minute magnet application compared with
   MNP/Ropiv group without magnet application (mean +/- SEM, 150 10 ng/g vs
   105 +/- 15 ng/g, respectively, and 6.1 +/- 0.8 vs 4.2 +/- 0.7,
   respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: The current study establishes proof of principle that it is
   possible to Produce ankle block in the rat by IV injection of MNP/Ropiv
   complexes and magnet application at the ankle. The results indicate that
   further study of this approach is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces endothelial cell
   proliferation, migration, and a host of cellular responses that are
   necessary for angiogenesis. The effects of VEGF on gene expression in
   endothelial cells have been well characterized, and many of the chemical
   pathways have been elucidated. Similarly, VEGF is known to impact
   cytoskeletal structure and cellular motility. Here, we show that VEGF
   influences cytoskeletal-nuclear interaction by imaging human umbilical
   vein endothelial cells treated with VEGF. We visualize increased actin
   fibers present at the nucleus in VEGF treated cells. We also quantify
   increased fluctuations at the nuclear envelope with VEGF-treatment. This
   manifests itself as both a gross nuclear fluctuations, quantifiable as
   changes in nuclear area, and fine fluctuations, which can be visualized
   over several hours. Further, we observe an increase in intranuclear
   velocity of chromatin-bound probes. Our findings suggest enhanced
   mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and nucleus under VEGF
   treatment, which may have implications in the mechanobiology of altered
   gene expression during angiogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Observables of a quantum system, described by self-adjoint operators in
   a von Neumann algebra or affiliated with it in the unbounded case, form
   a conditionally complete lattice when equipped with the spectral order.
   Using this order-theoretic structure, we develop a new perspective on
   quantum observables.
   In this first paper (of two), we show that self-adjoint operators
   affiliated with a von Neumann algebra N can equivalently be described as
   certain real-valued functions on the projection lattice P(N) of the
   algebra, which we call q-observable functions. Bounded self-adjoint
   operators correspond to q-observable functions with compact image on
   non-zero projections. These functions, originally defined in a similar
   form by de Groote (Observables II: quantum observables, 2005), are most
   naturally seen as adjoints (in the categorical sense) of spectral
   families. We show how they relate to the daseinisation mapping from the
   topos approach to quantum theory (Doring and Isham, New Structures for
   Physics, Springer, Heidelberg, 2011). Moreover, the q-observable
   functions form a conditionally complete lattice which is shown to be
   order-isomorphic to the lattice of self-adjoint operators with respect
   to the spectral order.
   In a subsequent paper (Doring and Dewitt, 2012, preprint), we will give
   an interpretation of q-observable functions in terms of quantum
   probability theory, and using results from the topos approach to quantum
   theory, we will provide a joint sample space for all quantum
   observables.}},

   semi-supervised learning on graphs with application to the indirect

   applications faces two main challenges: reliable features can be hard to
   extract and few labeled signals are available for training. We propose a
   novel classification framework to address these problems: we use a
   multiresolution framework to deal with nonstationarities in the signals
   and extract features in each localized time-frequency region and
   semi-supervised learning to train on both labeled and unlabeled signals.
   We further propose an adaptive graph filter for semi-supervised
   classification that allows for classifying unlabeled as well as unseen
   signals and for correcting mislabeled signals. We validate the proposed
   framework on indirect bridge structural health monitoring and show that
   it performs significantly better than previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A new continuous-time model for long-term scheduling of a gas engine
   power plant with parallel units is presented. Gas engines are shut down
   according to a regular maintenance plan that limits the number of hours
   spent online. To minimize salary expenditure with skilled labor, a
   single maintenance team is considered which is unavailable during
   certain periods of time. Other challenging constraints involve constant
   minimum and variable maximum power demands. The objective is to maximize
   the revenue from electricity sales assuming seasonal variations in
   electricity pricing by reducing idle times and shutdowns in high-tariff
   periods. By first developing a generalized disjunctive programming model
   and then applying both big-M and hull reformulation techniques, we
   reduce the burden of finding the appropriate set of mixed-integer linear
   constraints. Through the solution of a real-life problem, we show that
   the proposed formulations are very efficient computationally, while

Abstract = {{The long-term planning of the shale gas supply chain is a relevant
   problem that has not been addressed before in the literature. This
   article presents a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to
   optimally determine the number of wells to drill at every location, the
   size of gas processing plants, the section and length of pipelines for
   gathering raw gas and delivering processed gas and by-products, the
   power of gas compressors, and the amount of freshwater required from
   reservoirs for drilling and hydraulic fracturing so as to maximize the
   net present value of the project. Because the proposed model is a
   large-scale nonconvex MINLP, we develop a decomposition approach based
   on successively refining a piecewise linear approximation of the
   objective function. Results on realistic instances show the importance
   of heavier hydrocarbons to the economics of the project, as well as the
   optimal usage of the infrastructure by properly planning the drilling

Abstract = {{A central problem in modeling, namely that of learning an algebraic
   model from data obtained from simulations or experiments is addressed. A
   methodology that uses a small number of simulations or experiments to
   learn models that are as accurate and as simple as possible is proposed.
   The approach begins by building a low-complexity surrogate model. The
   model is built using a best subset technique that leverages an integer
   programming formulation to allow for the efficient consideration of a
   large number of possible functional components in the model. The model
   is then improved systematically through the use of derivative-free
   optimization solvers to adaptively sample new simulation or experimental
   points. Automated learning of algebraic models for optimization (ALAMO),
   the computational implementation of the proposed methodology, along with
   examples and extensive computational comparisons between ALAMO and a
   variety of machine learning techniques, including Latin hypercube
   sampling, simple least-squares regression, and the lasso is described.

Abstract = {{The forced magnetostriction of polycrystalline samples of Er1-xGdxMn6Sn6
   (0 <= x <= 1) intermetallics with hexagonal HfFe6Ge6-type structure is
   investigated in the temperature range of 77-480 K. Gd substitution has a
   significant effect On interatomic distances and especially On
   inter-sublattice R-Mn couplings. The replacement of Er by Gd results in
   increasing the ordering temperature followed by reinforcement of the
   R-Mn coupling, as well as decreasing the magnetostriction values owing
   to the S-state character of Gd3+ ions. The results show that the
   contribution or Er sublattice to anisotropic magnetoelastic effects is
   positive, while that of Gd and Mn is negative. All the examined samples
   exhibit considerable magnetovolume anomalies at the ordering temperature
   (T-C=338, 381, 412 and 434 K for the samples with x=0, 0.2, 0.6 and 1.0,
   respectively). While the unsubstitutecl sample exhibits metamagnetic
   transitions, Gd-contained compounds do not show this behavior, owing to
   the strong Gd-Mn coupling. The experimental results obtained are
   discussed in the framework of the two-magnetic sublattice by bearing in
   mind the lattice parameter dependence of the interlayer Mn-Mn exchange
   interaction in these layered compounds. From the temperature dependence
   of magnetostriction values and considering the magnetostriction equation
   for a hexagonal structure, we attempt to determine the signs of some of
   the magnetostriction constants for these compounds and the influence of
   Gd substitution on them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway enables control of
   pathologies caused by the dysregulation of proteins. Several biological
   molecules are active in RNAi including short interfering ribonucleic
   acid (siRNA). The effective utilization of siRNA as a therapeutic agent
   has been marked with distinct challenges, namely in intracellular
   delivery and achieving a sufficient dosage to affect protein expression.
   A delivery strategy we have developed to improve safety and efficacy of
   siRNA includes complexing siRNA with nanostructured polymers delivery
   systems (NSPs). These NSPs are synthesized via atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) and combine several important advances in polymer
   architecture for siRNA delivery. This includes shielding the cationic
   charge of the NSP with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell to promote
   cell viability in MC3T3-E1.4 pre-osteoblasts, and minimize the
   inflammatory response in a C57BL/6 mouse model. In our gene knockdown
   experiments targeting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase Gapdh

Abstract = {{The elicitation of scientific and technical judgments from experts, in
   the form of subjective probability distributions, can be a valuable
   addition to other forms of evidence in support of public policy decision
   making. This paper explores when it is sensible to perform such
   elicitation and how that can best be done. A number of key issues are
   discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who
   have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive
   judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty
   language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the
   choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of
   elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider
   systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments;
   the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of
   expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine
   judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view
   expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting
   serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation
   should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be
   undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain
   insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.}},

   oxide addition worked best for strongly adsorbed metals such as Cu, not
   so well for more weakly adsorbed metals such as Cd and Zn. The more AMD
   iron oxide amendment added, the less the mobility of the cationic target
   metals. Addition of AMD iron oxide for metal sequestration was more
   effective for the contaminated soils with low organic content.}},

Title = {{Efficient discovery of responses of proteins to compounds using active
   learning}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Drug discovery and development has been aided by high
   throughput screening methods that detect compound effects on a single
   target. However, when using focused initial screening, undesirable
   secondary effects are often detected late in the development process
   after significant investment has been made. An alternative approach
   would be to screen against undesired effects early in the process, but
   the number of possible secondary targets makes this prohibitively
   expensive.
   Results: This paper describes methods for making this global approach
   practical by constructing predictive models for many target responses to
   many compounds and using them to guide experimentation. We demonstrate
   for the first time that by jointly modeling targets and compounds using
   descriptive features and using active machine learning methods, accurate
   models can be built by doing only a small fraction of possible
   experiments. The methods were evaluated by computational experiments
   using a dataset of 177 assays and 20,000 compounds constructed from the
   PubChem database.
   Conclusions: An average of nearly 60\% of all hits in the dataset were
   found after exploring only 3\% of the experimental space which suggests
   that active learning can be used to enable more complete
   characterization of compound effects than otherwise affordable. The
   methods described are also likely to find widespread application outside
   drug discovery, such as for characterizing the effects of a large number
   of compounds or inhibitory RNAs on a large number of cell or tissue
   phenotypes.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional interfacial grain boundary network in a fully
   austenitic high-manganese steel was studied as a function of all five
   macroscopic crystallographic parameters (i.e. lattice misorientation and
   grain boundary plane normal) using electron backscattering diffraction
   mapping in conjunction with focused ion beam serial sectioning. The
   relative grain boundary area and energy distributions were strongly
   influenced by both the grain boundary plane orientation and the lattice
   misorientation. Grain boundaries terminated by (1 1 1) plane
   orientations revealed relatively higher populations and lower energies
   compared with other boundaries. The most frequently observed grain
   boundaries were \{1 1 1\} symmetric twist boundaries with the Sigma 3
   misorientation, which also had the lowest energy. On average, the
   relative areas of different grain boundary types were inversely
   correlated to their energies. A comparison between the current result
   and previously reported observations (e.g. high-purity Ni) revealed that
   polycrystals with the same atomic structure (e.g. facecentered cubic)
   have very similar grain boundary character and energy distributions. (C)

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations have been used to study the
   adsorption of glycine, alanine, norvaline, valine, proline, cysteine,
   and serine on Pd(111). Most amino acids except cysteine adsorb onto the
   surface in a tridentate fashion through a nitrogen atom and both oxygen
   atoms. For cysteine, an additional bond is formed with the surface due
   to the strong affinity of the sulfur atom, resulting in a significantly
   larger adsorption energy. The adsorption patterns of amino acids we
   examined are supported by the shifts in vibrational frequencies
   associated with NHH and COO. The adsorption strength of amino acids
   depends on how much the molecules deform during the adsorption process.
   Understanding the adsorption of amino acids on Pd(111) provides
   fundamental information for future consideration of the interactions
   between their derivatives or more complicated biomolecules and metal
   surfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, significant effort has been put into mimicking the
   ability of the gecko lizard to strongly and reversibly cling to
   surfaces, by using synthetic structures. Among these structures,
   mushroom-like elastomer fiber arrays have demonstrated promising
   performance on smooth surfaces matching the adhesive strengths obtained
   with the natural gecko foot-pads. It is possible to improve the already
   impressive adhesive performance of mushroom-like fibers provided that
   the underlying adhesion mechanism is understood. Here, the adhesion
   mechanism of bio-inspired mushroom-like fibers is investigated by
   implementing the Dugdale-Barenblatt cohesive zone model into finite
   elements simulations. It is found that the magnitude of pull-off stress
   depends on the edge angle theta and the ratio of the tip radius to the
   stalk radius beta of the mushroom-like fiber. Pull-off stress is also
   found to depend on a dimensionless parameter chi, the ratio of the fiber
   radius to a length-scale related to the dominance of adhesive stress. As
   an estimate, the optimal parameters are found to be beta = 1.1 and theta
   = 45 degrees. Further, the location of crack initiation is found to
   depend on chi for given beta and theta. An analytical model for pull-off
   stress, which depends on the location of crack initiation as well as on
   theta and beta, is proposed and found to agree with the simulation
   results. Results obtained in this work provide a geometrical guideline
   for designing robust bio-inspired dry fibrillar adhesives.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the coexistence of unipolar and bipolar resistive
   switching in NiO thin film fabricated by reactive sputtering. It was
   shown that the required voltages for switching operations in the bipolar
   switching mode are smaller than the voltages in the unipolar mode, while
   the ON/OFF resistance levels are similar for the two modes. The NiO
   resistive switching device also exhibited transitions between the two
   switching modes, with the subsequent I-V characteristics unaffected by
   the switching history, which clearly indicates that the two switching
   mechanisms are directly related. The switching versatility in NiO is
   expected to facilitate improved device performance, for example, by
   increasing the margin of programming voltages. Based on the
   investigation of device characteristics, we discuss the switching
   processes for the two switching modes and their relationship. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modeling and experimental framework to
   characterize the chemotaxis of Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens)
   relying on two-dimensional and three-dimensional tracking of individual
   bacteria. Previous studies mainly characterized bacterial chemotaxis
   based on population density analysis. Instead, this study focuses on
   single-cell tracking and measuring the chemotactic drift velocity V-C
   from the biased tumble rate of individual bacteria on exposure to a
   concentration gradient of L-aspartate. The chemotactic response of S.
   marcescens is quantified over a range of concentration gradients (10(-3)
   to 5 mM/mm) and average concentrations (0.5 x 10(-3) to 2.5 mM). Through
   the analysis of a large number of bacterial swimming trajectories, the
   tumble rate is found to have a significant bias with respect to the
   swimming direction. We also verify the relative gradient sensing
   mechanism in the chemotaxis of S. marcescens by measuring the change of
   V-C with the average concentration and the gradient. The applied full
   pathway model with fitted parameters matches the experimental data.
   Finally, we show that our measurements based on individual bacteria lead
   to the determination of the motility coefficient mu (7.25 x 10(-6)
   cm(2)/s) of a population. The experimental characterization and
   simulation results for the chemotaxis of this bacterial species
   contribute towards using S. marcescens in chemically controlled
   biohybrid systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of the spectral-Tchebychev (ST)
   technique for solution of three-dimensional dynamics of unconstrained
   pretwisted beams with general cross-section (including both straight and
   curved cross-sections). In general, the dynamic response of pretwisted
   beams presents three-dimensional (3D) motions, including coupled
   bending-bending-torsional-axial motions. As such, accurately solving
   pretwisted beam dynamics requires a 3D solution approach. In this work,
   the integral boundary value problem based on the 3D linear elasticity
   equations is solved numerically using the 3D-ST approach. To simplify
   evaluation of the volume integrals, the boundaries are simplified by
   applying two coordinate transformations to render the pretwisted beam
   with curved cross-section into an equivalent straight beam with
   rectangular cross-section. Three sample pretwisted beam problems with
   rectangular, curved, and airfoil cross-sections at different twist rates
   are solved using the presented approach. In each case, the convergence
   of the solution is analyzed, and non-dimensional natural frequencies and
   mode shapes are compared to those from a finite-element (FE) solution.
   Furthermore, cross-sectional stress and displacements are obtained from
   the 3D-ST solution. Lastly, the non-dimensional natural frequencies from
   the 3D-ST and a 1D/2D solutions are compared. It is concluded that the
   3D-ST solution can capture the three-dimensional dynamic behavior of
   pretwisted beam as accurately as an FE solution, but for a fraction of
   the computational cost. Furthermore, it is shown that 1D/2D solution can
   lead to significant errors at high twist rates, and thus, the 3D-ST
   solution should be preferred. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A theoretical approach to the prediction of the sequence and
   temperature-dependent rate constants for oligonucleotide hybridization
   reactions has been developed based on the theory of relaxation kinetics.
   One-sided and two-sided melting reaction mechanisms for oligonucleotide
   hybridization reactions have been considered, analyzed, modified, and
   compared to select a physically consistent as well as robust model for
   prediction of the relaxation times of DNA hybridization reactions that
   agrees with the experimental evidence. The temperature-and
   sequence-dependent parameters of the proposed model have been estimated
   using available experimental data. The relaxation time model that we
   developed has been combined with the nearest neighbor model of
   hybridization thermodynamics to estimate the temperature-and
   sequence-dependent rate constants of an oligonucleotide hybridization
   reaction. The model-predicted rate constants are compared to
   experimentally determined rate constants for the same oligonucleotide
   hybridization reactions. Finally, we consider a few important
   applications of kinetically controlled DNA hybridization reactions. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses reactor modeling and recipe optimization of
   semibatch ring-opening polymerization processes for making block
   copolymers. Two rigorous reactor models are developed on the basis of
   the population balance and method of moments, respectively. The complete
   polymerization process model also includes vapor-liquid equilibrium
   equations from applying Flory-Huggins theory. The accuracies of both
   reactor models are validated against historical plant data by adjusting
   model parameters such as kinetic rate constants. The recipe optimization
   problem is formulated to design the optimal reactor operating policy to
   minimize polymerization time and incorporate additional process
   constraints in accordance with final product properties and process
   safety requirements. The resulting dynamic optimization problem is
   translated to a nonlinear program by using the simultaneous collocation
   method, and further solved by the interior point method. In the case
   study example, both reactor models show satisfactory matches between
   their predictions and the historical plant data. The recipe optimization
   with both models demonstrates significant process improvement and
   reductions in batch operating time. Moreover, the moment model shows
   superiority over the population balance model in terms of computational
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the optimization of the production of hydrogen
   and/or liquid fuels from glycerol. We propose a limited superstructure
   embedding a number of alternative technologies. Glycerol is first
   reformed using either aqueous phase reforming, steam reforming, or
   autoreforming. The gas obtained is cleaned, and its H-2 to CO ratio is
   adjusted (bypass, PSA, and/or water gas shift). Next, the removal of CO2
   is performed by means of PSA, and the syngas is fed to the
   Fischer-Tropsch reactor. The products obtained are separated while the
   heavy fraction is hydrocracked. The optimization of the system is
   formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that is
   solved first for the optimal production of hydrogen alone and next for
   the simultaneous production of liquid fuels and hydrogen. The production
   of hydrogen is competitive with that obtained from switchgrass as long
   as the glycerol price is below \$0.05/lb (\$0.110/kg) using aqueous
   phase reforming. For the liquid fuels to be attractive, the glycerol
   price must be below \$0.025/lb (\$0.055/kg) using autoreforming. The
   option of integrating this facility with a biodiesel one is promising
   from an economical point of view.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of arsine by copper palladium alloys was studied using a
   high-throughput composition spread alloy film (CSAF) sample library. A
   CuxPd1-x, CSAF coupon that spanned the complete alloy composition space
   (x = 0-1) was prepared by an evaporative deposition technique. The
   coupon was exposed to AsH3 in a N-2 background at 288 degrees C in a
   small flow reactor. Arsenic uptake was characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and
   micro X-ray diffraction (mu-XRD). Pd- and Cu-rich alloy compositions
   exhibited large surface concentrations of As after exposure to AsH3. In
   the Cu-rich alloy, composition and structure measurements suggest the
   formation of a Cu3As phase. Arsenic uptake at Pd-rich alloy compositions
   is consistent with Pd2As or Pd8As3 phases; structural results suggest
   Pd2As with a hexagonal structure. In contrast, over a wide range of
   intermediate compositions (x(Cu) approximate to 0.20-0.75), little As
   uptake was observed. These results contribute to a basis for rational
   design of sorbents for the capture of arsenic from fluid streams, and to
   an understanding of the stability of palladium copper alloy membranes
   employed for hydrogen separation from coal-derived syngas. This work
   illustrates the application of high-throughput approaches based on CSAF
   sample libraries that can be applied to a wide variety of materials
   development and optimization challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Buff/Wipe (B/W) process is commonly used in disk drive manufacturing to
   remove the particles and asperities on the lubricated disk surface. In
   this paper, we investigated how B/W process impacts the physicochemical
   properties of perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) nano-films through the study of
   surface energy and bonded ratio. Two-liquid geometric method was used to
   analyze the surface energy of nonfunctional PFPE, i.e., Z03, and
   functional PFPE, i.e., Zdol, lubricated media before and after B/W
   process. It was found that the dispersive surface energy of Z03 films
   greatly decreased after B/W, which was more significant in the
   submonolayer regime. In addition, the bonded ratio slightly increased.
   However, B/W effect on the surface energy and bonded ratio was not
   detected for Zdol films. It is hypothesized that nonfunctional PFPE
   behaves liquid-like on the carbon overcoat due to the weak interaction
   between lubricant and overcoat. External mechanical stress as applied
   with B/W can change the conformation and increase the surface coverage
   for nonfunctional PFPE. On the other hand, functional PFPEs behave
   solid-like due to the strong attraction between lubricant and overcoat;
   therefore, it is difficult to change the conformation by external stress
   from B/W process. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) device was fabricated
   using L1(0)ordered FePt electrodes, which were deposited on MgO(8
   nm)/CrRu(10 nm)/TiN(4 nm) under-layers. It was found that the
   MgO/CrRu/TiN under-layer helps lower the required FePt deposition
   temperature to below 400 degrees C, and provides a well-ordered bottom
   L1(0) FePt electrode with root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness close
   to 0.4 nm. Magnetoresistance (MR) ratio and resistance-area (RA) were
   measured at room temperature by the current-in-plane tunneling (CIPT)
   method from a lithographically unpatterned PMTJ sample and 138\% and 6.4
   k Omega mu m(2) were obtained, respectively. A PMTJ test pattern, with a
   junction size of 80 X 40 mu m(2), was also fabricated and showed a MR

   decreases with annealing temperature and saturates at high annealing
   temperatures suggesting a nanostructure related anisotropy mechanism in
   which the amorphous phase exhibits a higher H-K than the crystalline
   phase. A high saturation induction nanocrystalline phase and high H-K

Abstract = {{A thorough understanding of the temperature profiles introduced by the
   heat assisted magnetic recording is required to maintain the hotspot at
   the desired location on the disk with minimal heat damage to other
   components. Here, we implement a transient mesoscale modeling
   methodology termed lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for phonons (which are
   primary carriers of energy) in the thermal modeling of the head disk
   interface (HDI) components, namely, carbon overcoat (COC). The LBM can
   provide more accurate results compared to conventional Fourier
   methodology by capturing the nanoscale phenomena due to ballistic heat
   transfer. We examine the in-plane and out-of-plane heat transfer in the
   COC via analyzing the temperature profiles with a continuously focused
   and pulsed laser beam on a moving disk. Larger in-plane hotspot widening
   is observed in continuously focused laser beam compared to a pulsed
   laser. A pulsed laser surface develops steeper temperature gradients
   compared to continuous hotspot. Furthermore, out-of-plane heat transfer
   from the COC to the media is enhanced with a continuous laser beam then
   a pulsed laser, while the temperature takes around 140 fs to reach the
   bottom surface of the COC. Our study can lead to a realistic thermal
   model describing novel HDI material design criteria for the next
   generation of hard disk drives with ultra high recording densities. (C)

Abstract = {{We develop a non-convex non-linear programming problem that determines
   the minimum run time to resolve different lengths of DNA using a
   gel-free micelle end-labeled free solution electrophoresis separation
   method. Our optimization framework allows for an efficient determination
   of the utility of different DNA separation platforms and enables the
   identification of the optimal operating conditions for these DNA
   separation devices. The non-linear programming problem requires a model
   for signal spacing and signal width, which is known for many DNA
   separation methods. As a case study, we show how our approach is used to
   determine the optimal run conditions for micelle end-labeled
   free-solution electrophoresis and examine the trade-offs between a
   single capillary system and a parallel capillary system. Parallel
   capillaries are shown to only be beneficial for DNA lengths above 230
   bases using a polydisperse micelle end-label otherwise single
   capillaries produce faster separations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{94}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{The exceptionally adhesive foot of the gecko remains clean in dirty
   environments by shedding contaminants with each step. Synthetic
   gecko-inspired adhesives have achieved similar attachment strengths to
   the gecko on smooth surfaces, but the process of contact self-cleaning
   has yet to be effectively demonstrated. Here, we present the first
   gecko-inspired adhesive that has matched both the attachment strength
   and the contact self-cleaning performance of the gecko's foot on a
   smooth surface. Contact self-cleaning experiments were performed with
   three different sizes of mushroom-shaped elastomer microfibres and five
   different sizes of spherical silica contaminants. Using a
   load-drag-unload dry contact cleaning process similar to the loads
   acting on the gecko foot during locomotion, our fully contaminated
   synthetic gecko adhesives could recover lost adhesion at a rate
   comparable to that of the gecko. We observed that the relative size of
   contaminants to the characteristic size of the microfibres in the
   synthetic adhesive strongly determined how and to what degree the
   adhesive recovered from contamination. Our approximate model and
   experimental results show that the dominant mechanism of contact
   self-cleaning is particle rolling during the drag process. Embedding of
   particles between adjacent fibres was observed for particles with
   diameter smaller than the fibre tips, and further studied as a temporary
   cleaning mechanism. By incorporating contact self-cleaning capabilities,
   real-world applications of synthetic gecko adhesives, such as reusable
   tapes, clothing closures and medical adhesives, would become feasible.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the global optimization of general non-convex
   nonlinear and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems with
   underlying bilinear substructures. We combine
   reformulation-linearization techniques and advanced convex envelope
   construction techniques to produce tight subproblem formulations for
   these underlying structures. When incorporated as linear cutting planes,
   these relaxation strengthening strategies are highly effective at
   tightening standard linear programming relaxations generated by
   factorable programming techniques. Because the size of these augmented
   linear relaxations increases exponentially with the number of variables,
   we employ cut filtering and selection strategies to ensure that the
   tightened subproblems are solved efficiently. We introduce algorithms
   for bilinear substructure detection, cutting plane identification, cut
   filtering, and cut selection and embed the proposed implementation in
   Branch-and-Reduce Optimization Navigator at every node in the
   branch-and-bound tree. A computational study including problem instances
   from standard literature test libraries is included to assess the
   performance of the proposed implementation. Results show that underlying
   bilinear substructures are identified in 30\% of the problems in
   GLOBALLib and MINLPLib and that the exploitation of these structures
   significantly reduces computational time, branch-and-bound tree size,
   and required memory.}},

Abstract = {{In this reported work, scanning probe microscopy is used to perform
   localised oxidation of Ti as a bottom-up nanofabrication method. The
   effects of normal force setpoint and oxidation voltage on oxide
   nanofeatures during atomic force microscopy (AFM) mode and scanning
   tunnelling microscopy (STM) mode oxidation are investigated. The normal
   force between the probe and sample and electrochemical current in the
   anodic oxidation process are measured using a custom control system, and
   the effects of these variables on the size and resistivity of oxidised
   nanopatterns are investigated. It is shown that a direct relation exists
   between oxidation voltage and written oxide resistivity as well as
   written feature width in the STM mode oxidation. In AFM mode oxidation,
   the normal force setpoint is shown to have a positive correlation with
   feature size, but an inverse relation with oxide resistivity. By
   leveraging the presented system's ability to operate in both AFM and STM
   mode, the dynamics and feature fabrication dependencies are shown to be
   a continuum of writing voltage and normal force. This reported work
   suggests that STM and AFM mode oxidation can be thought of as similar
   processes but working at different operating points in terms of normal
   force and tip-surface spacing.}},

Abstract = {{The 20,000 ephemeral ponds, the playas of the southern high plains of
   the United States, were thought to have experienced a prolonged drought
   ending approximately 5000 years ago, during which amphibians and other
   aquatic residents would have died out. A few permanent ponds are
   conjectured to be the source of repopulation of the entire region since
   then. We develop a series of mathematical models based on the tiger
   salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, on rainfall data, and on field data, to
   test this hypothesis. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, the
   region could have been repopulated through migration within this time

Abstract = {{This work addresses the large-scale crude oil scheduling problem of
   China's SINOPEC Maoming refinery that imports various types of crude oil
   from two terminals via bidirectional long-distance pipelines. We use a
   hierarchical decomposition approach to construct a two-stage model of
   the refinery operations. In the upper-level model, storage and charging
   tanks are aggregated to determine the inflows and outflows between the
   two terminals and the refinery plant. The lower-level submodels solve
   the detailed loading and unloading operations at storage and charging
   tanks inside the terminals and the refinery plant. To further improve
   the computational efficiency, we develop a rule-based tank-selection
   strategy to obtain a feasible schedule. Although state-of-the-art
   commercial solvers cannot obtain feasible solutions of the relaxed
   monolithic mixed-integer linear programming model within a reasonable
   time, our decomposition heuristic can generate schedules that are more
   flexible than manually generated schedules. It also provides the
   refinery with annual estimated cost savings of \$30 million.}},

Abstract = {{The validity of the Mayo-Lewis (ML) terminal model for copolymer
   composition in nitroxide mediated copolymerization is systematically

   from ML behavior occur under various parameter combinations before the

   deviations are usually below 5 pp, and absent at conversions higher than
   3\%, but after 10\% in some cases. High reactivity ratios lead to larger
   deviations; low reactivity ratios (faster cross-propagation) produce
   near ML behavior. An additional continuous radical source leads to
   faster attainment of the QEC and reduces the deviations from ML
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is a core technology for enabling
   safety and non-safety applications in next generation intelligent
   transportation systems. Due to relatively low heights of the antennas,
   V2V communication is often influenced by topographic features, man-made
   structures, and other vehicles located between the communicating
   vehicles. On highways, it was shown experimentally that vehicles can
   obstruct the line of sight (LOS) communication up to 50 percent of the
   time; furthermore, a single obstructing vehicle can reduce the power at
   the receiver by more than 20 dB. Based on both experimental measurements
   and simulations performed using a validated channel model, we show that
   the elevated position of antennas on tall vehicles improves
   communication performance. Tall vehicles can significantly increase the
   effective communication range, with an improvement of up to 50 percent
   in certain scenarios. Using these findings, we propose a new V2V
   relaying scheme called tall vehicle relaying (TVR) that takes advantage
   of better channel characteristics provided by tall vehicles. TVR
   distinguishes between tall and short vehicles and, where appropriate,
   chooses tall vehicles as next hop relays. We investigate TVR's
   system-level performance through a combination of link-level experiments
   and system-level simulations and show that it outperforms existing
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil fuel extraction activities generate wastewaters that are often
   high in total dissolved solids (TDS) and specific constituents that can
   affect drinking water, if these wastewaters enter surface waters.
   Control of TDS in source waters is difficult without identification of
   the potential sources of high TDS wastewater associated with fossil fuel
   activities. Characteristics of natural waters, oil and gas-produced
   waters, and coal-related wastewaters were analyzed to extract
   information about constituent concentrations and anion ratios.
   Statistical analysis of the anion ratios indicates that the SO4/Cl ratio
   is higher in coal-related wastewaters than in oil and gas-produced
   waters, suggesting that wastewaters can be distinguished based on this
   ratio. An approach that compared the SO4/Cl ratio with bromide
   concentration for the wastewaters can serve to separate oil and
   gas-produced waters from brine treatment plant discharges, and from the
   various coal-related wastewaters. This method was applied to surface
   water quality data collected from two tributaries in Southwestern
   Pennsylvania from September 2009 to September 2012. Results show that
   this constituent and ratio method, combined with mixing curve
   calculations, can be used to identify water quality changes in these two
   tributaries. Similar mixing models, when applied to regionally relevant
   high TDS wastewater data, may be used in other areas experiencing water
   quality changes resulting from fossil fuel extraction activities. (C)

Abstract = {{The emergence of flexible and stretchable electronic components expands
   the range of applications of electronic devices. Flexible devices are
   ideally suited for electronic biointerfaces because of mechanically
   permissive structures that conform to curvilinear structures found in
   native tissue. Most electronic materials used in these applications
   exhibit elastic moduli on the order of 0.1-1 MPa. However, many
   electronically excitable tissues exhibit elasticities in the range of
   1-10 kPa, several orders of magnitude smaller than existing components
   used in flexible devices. This work describes the use of biologically
   derived heparins as scaffold materials for fabricating networks with
   hybrid electronic/ionic conductivity and ultracompliant mechanical
   properties. Photo-cross-linkable heparin methacrylate hydrogels serve as
   templates to control the microstructure and doping of in situ
   polymerized polyaniline structures. Macroscopic heparin-doped
   polyaniline hydrogel dual networks exhibit impedances as low as Z = 4.17
   Omega at 1 kHz and storage moduli of G' = 900 +/- 100 Pa. The
   conductivity of heparin/polyaniline networks depends on the oxidation
   state and microstructure of secondary polyaniline networks. Furthermore,
   heparin/polyaniline networks support the attachment, proliferation, and
   differentiation of mu rifle myoblasts without any surface treatments.
   Taken together, these results suggest that heparin/polyaniline hydrogel
   networks exhibit suitable physical properties as an electronically
   active biointerface material that can match the mechanical properties of
   soft tissues composed of excitable cells.}},

Abstract = {{An indirect approach is explored for structural health bridge monitoring
   allowing for wide, yet cost-effective, bridge stock coverage. The
   detection capability of the approach is tested in a laboratory setting
   for three different reversible proxy types of damage scenarios: changes
   in the support conditions (rotational restraint), additional damping,
   and an added mass at the midspan. A set of frequency features is used in
   conjunction with a support vector machine classifier on data measured
   from a passing vehicle at the wheel and suspension levels, and directly
   from the bridge structure for comparison. For each type of damage, four
   levels of severity were explored. The results show that for each damage
   type, the classification accuracy based on data measured from the
   passing vehicle is, on average, as good as or better than the
   classification accuracy based on data measured from the bridge.
   Classification accuracy showed a steady trend for low (1-1.75 m/s) and
   high vehicle speeds (2-2.75 m/s), with a decrease of about 7\% for the
   latter. These results show promise towards a highly mobile structural
   health bridge monitoring system for wide and cost-effective bridge stock
   coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering living systems on chips is an emerging direction with a goal
   to mimic physiologically accurate biological functions that can be

Abstract = {{Tailpipe emissions from sixty-four unique light-duty gasoline vehicles
   (LDGVs) spanning model years 1987-2012, two medium-duty diesel vehicles
   and three heavy-duty diesel vehicles with varying levels of
   aftertreatment were characterized at the California Air Resources Board
   Haagen-Smit and Heavy-Duty Engine Testing Laboratories. Each vehicle was
   tested on a chassis dynamometer using a constant volume sampler,
   commercial fuels and standard duty cycles. Measurements included
   regulated pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons
   (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Off-line
   analyses were performed to speciate gas- and particle-phase emissions.
   The data were used to investigate trends in emissions with vehicle age
   and to quantify the effects of different aftertreatment technologies on
   diesel vehicle emissions (e.g., with and without a diesel particulate
   filter). On average, newer LDGVs that met the most recent emissions
   standards had substantially lower emissions of regulated gaseous
   pollutants (CO, THC and NOx) than older vehicles. For example, THC
   emissions from the median LDGV that met the LEV2 standard was roughly a
   factor of 10 lower than the median pre-LEV vehicle; there were also
   substantial reductions in NOx (factor of similar to 100) and CO (factor
   of similar to 10) emissions}},

Abstract = {{We study distributed optimization problems when N nodes minimize the sum
   of their individual costs subject to a common vector variable. The costs
   are convex, have Lipschitz continuous gradient (with constant L), and
   bounded gradient. We propose two fast distributed gradient algorithms
   based on the centralized Nesterov gradient algorithm and establish their
   convergence rates in terms of the per-node communications /C and the
   per-node gradient evaluations k. Our first method, Distributed Nesterov
   Gradient, achieves rates O (log K/K) and O (log k/k). Our second method,
   Distributed Nesterov gradient with Consensus iterations, assumes at all
   nodes knowledge of L and.t(W) - the second largest singular value of the
   N x N doubly stochastic weight matrix W. It achieves rates O
   (1/k(2-epsilon)) and O (1/k(2)) (epsilon > 0 arbitrarily small).
   Further, we give for both methods explicit dependence of the convergence
   constants on N and W. Simulation examples illustrate our findings.}},

Abstract = {{A refrigeration system composed of silicon MEMS cooling elements is
   designed based on the electrocaloric (EC) effect in a P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)
   terpolymer, poly(vinylidene
   fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) 59.2/33.6/7.2 mol\%.
   Each cooling element includes two diaphragm actuators fabricated in the
   plane of a silicon wafer, which drive a heat transfer fluid back and
   forth across terpolymer layers that are placed between them. In the EC
   effect, reversible temperature and entropy changes related to
   polarization changes appear in a material under the application and
   removal of an electric field. Finite element simulations are performed
   to explore the system performance. The effect of the applied electric
   field is studied, and the time lag between the electric field and the
   diaphragm motion is found to significantly affect the cooling power. A
   parametric study of the operating, frequency, externally-applied
   temperature span, and the electric field amplitude are conducted. The
   results indicate that when the system is operated at a temperature span
   of 15 K, a cooling power density of 3 W/cm(2) and a percent of Carnot
   COP of 31\% are achieved for one element. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{SYSTEMS \& CONTROL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{65-70}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the problem of infinite-horizon sensor
   scheduling for estimation in linear Gaussian systems. Due to possible
   channel capacity, energy budget or topological constraints, it is
   assumed that at each time step only a subset of the available sensors
   can be selected to send their observations to the fusion center, where
   the state of the system is estimated by means of a Kalman filter.
   Several important properties of the infinite-horizon schedules will be
   presented in this paper. In particular, we prove that the
   infinite-horizon average estimation error and the boundedness of a
   schedule are independent of the initial covariance matrix. We further
   provide a constructive proof that any feasible schedule with finite
   average estimation error can be arbitrarily approximated by a bounded
   periodic schedule. We later generalized our result to lossy networks.
   These theoretical results provide valuable insights and guidelines for
   the design of computationally efficient sensor scheduling policies. (C)

   Midwest}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{123-131}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Replacing current generation with wind energy would help reduce the
   emissions associated with fossil fuel electricity generation. However,
   integrating wind into the electricity grid is not without cost. Wind
   power output is highly variable and average capacity factors from wind
   farms are often much lower than conventional generators. Further, the
   best wind resources with highest capacity factors are often located far
   away from load centers and accessing them therefore requires
   transmission investments. Energy storage capacity could be an
   alternative to some of the required transmission investment, thereby
   reducing capital costs for accessing remote wind farms. This work
   focuses on the trade-offs between energy storage and transmission. In a
   case study of a 200 MW wind farm in North Dakota to deliver power to
   Illinois, we estimate the size of transmission and energy storage
   capacity that yields the lowest average cost of generating and
   delivering electricity (\$/MW h) from this farm. We find that
   transmission costs must be at least \$600/MW-km and energy storage must
   cost at most \$100/kW h in order for this application of energy storage
   to be economical. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},

Abstract = {{Despite frequent blackouts and brownouts, extension of the central grid
   remains the Indian government's preferred strategy for the country's
   rural electrification policy. This study reports an assessment that
   compares grid extension with distributed generation (DG) alternatives,
   based on the subsidies they will necessitate, and costs of service
   interruptions that are appropriate in the rural Indian context. Using
   cross-sectional household expenditure data and region fixed-effects
   models, average household demand is estimated. The price elasticity of
   demand is found to be in the range of -0.3 to -0.4. Interruption costs
   are estimated based on the loss of consumer surplus due to reduced
   consumption of electric lighting energy that results from intermittent
   power supply. Different grid reliability scenarios are simulated.
   Despite the inclusion of interruption costs, standalone DG does not
   appear to be competitive with grid extension at distances of less than
   17 km. However, backing up unreliable grid service with local DG plants
   is attractive when reliability is very poor, even in previously
   electrified villages. Introduction of energy efficient lighting changes
   these economics, and the threshold for acceptable grid unreliability
   significantly reduces. A variety of polices to promote accelerated
   deployment and the wider adoption of improved end-use efficiency,
   warrant serious consideration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a major human
   congenital heart defect that results in single ventricle physiology and
   high mortality. Clinical data indicate that intracardiac blood flow
   patterns during cardiac morphogenesis are a significant etiology. We
   used the left atrial ligation (LAL) model in the chick embryo to test
   the hypothesis that LAL immediately alters intracardiac flow streams and
   the biomechanical environment, preceding morphologic and structural
   defects observed in HLHS. Results: Using fluorescent dye injections, we
   found that intracardiac flow patterns from the right common cardinal
   vein, right vitelline vein, and left vitelline vein were altered
   immediately following LAL. Furthermore, we quantified a significant
   ventral shift of the right common cardinal and right vitelline vein flow
   streams. We developed an in silico model of LAL, which revealed that
   wall shear stress was reduced at the left atrioventricular canal and
   left side of the common ventricle. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate
   that intracardiac flow patterns change immediately following LAL,
   supporting the role of hemodynamics in the progression of HLHS. Sites of
   reduced WSS revealed by computational modeling are commonly affected in
   HLHS, suggesting that changes in the biomechanical environment may lead
   to abnormal growth and remodeling of left heart structures.

   methods are not successful on histopathology images, which prompted us
   to investigate segmentation of a broader class of images, namely those
   without clear edges between the regions to be segmented. We model these
   images as occlusions of random images, which we call textures, and show
   that local histograms are a useful tool for segmenting them. Based on
   our theoretical results, we describe a flexible segmentation framework
   that draws on existing work on nonnegative matrix factorization and

Abstract = {{The average interface area aspect ratios of carbide grains in WC-Co
   composites are measured from basal-to-prismatic area ratios determined
   by the five parameter analysis (FPA method. Grain boundary plane
   distributions regardless of misorientations indicate that the (0001)
   basal and (10 (1) over bar0) prismatic planes are the most common habit
   planes, and the interface area aspect ratio is determined by the ratio
   of the (0001) plane area to the (10 (1) over bar0) plane area.
   Additionally, the measured aspect ratios are found to vary with the
   densification mechanisms of the WC-Co composites. The work offers a new

Abstract = {{This work evaluates the detection sensitivity of deep subsurface
   pressure monitoring within an uncertain carbon dioxide sequestration
   system by linking the output of an analytical reduced-order model and
   first-order uncertainty analysis. A baseline (non-leaky) modeling run
   was compared against 10 different leakage scenarios, where the cap rock
   permeability was increased by factors of 2-100 (cap rock permeability
   from 10(-3) to 10(-1) millidarcy). The uncertainty variance outputs were
   used to develop percentile estimates and detection sensitivity for
   pressure throughout the deep subsurface as a function of space (lateral
   distance from the injection wells and vertical orientation within the
   reservoir) and time (years since injection), or P(x, z, t). Conditional
   probabilities were computed for combinations of x, z, and t, which were
   then used to generate power curves for detecting leakage scenarios. The
   results suggest that measurements of the absolute change in pressure
   within the target injection aquifer would not be able to distinguish
   small leakage rates (i.e., less than 50 x baseline) from baseline
   conditions, and that only large leakage rates (i.e., > 100 x baseline)
   would be discriminated with sufficient statistical power (> 99 \%).
   Combining measurements, for example by taking the ratio of formation
   pressure in Aquifer 2/Aquifer 1, provides better statistical power for
   distinguishing smaller leakage rates at earlier times in the injection
   program. Detection sensitivity for pressure is a function of space and
   time. Therefore, design of an adequate monitoring network for subsurface
   pressure should account for this space-time variability to ensure that
   the monitoring system performs to the necessary design criteria, e.g.,
   specific false-negative and false-positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{Seat style designers transform their ideas into 3-D forms using

   Here, we propose a sketch-based 3-D modeling system that enables
   designers to rapidly and intuitively create a seat shape by applying a
   2-D sketch to a normalized seat reference model and then evaluating the
   newly designed model. For this purpose, we describe three modeling
   techniques that support interactive shape editing: curve manipulation
   using pen strokes, vertex point manipulation, and tangent vector
   manipulation. In addition, we propose three methods for the design and
   functional evaluation of an automotive seat, checking for interference
   between a seat skin and its frame, checking for foldability among seat
   components with regard to their positioning, and checking for coupling
   between a seat model and a digital human body.}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterials capable of neutralizing specific cytokines could form the
   basis for treating a broad range of conditions characterized by intense,
   local inflammation. Severe burns, spanning partial- to full-thickness of
   the dermis, can result in complications due to acute inflammation that
   contributes to burn progression, and early mediation may be a key factor
   in rescuing thermally injured tissue from secondary necrosis to improve
   healing outcomes. In this work, we examined the effects on burn
   progression and influence on the inflammatory microenvironment of
   topical application of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha)
   alone, mixed with hyaluronic acid (HA) or conjugated to HA. We found
   that non-conjugated anti-TNF-alpha decreased macrophage infiltration to
   a greater extent than that conjugated to HA; however, there was little
   effect on the degree of progression or IL-1 beta levels. A simple
   transport model is proposed to analyze the results, which predicts
   qualitative and quantitative differences between untreated burn sites
   and those treated with the conjugates. Our results indicate that
   conjugation of anti-TNF-alpha to high molecular weight HA provides
   sustained, local modulation of the post-injury inflammatory responses
   compared to direct administration of non-conjugated antibodies. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{To cope with computational challenges on dynamic optimization problems
   with discontinuous control profiles, a methodology combining the
   adaptive pseudospectral method with the structure detection procedure is
   presented. First, the adaptive pseudospectral method, which divides time
   intervals based on an estimation of approximation error, is utilized to
   obtain potential sequence and type of arcs composed of discontinuous
   control profiles. Second, the derived information is exploited by the
   structure detection procedure to reformulate the original nonsmooth
   problem as a multistage problem (MSP), where adjacent arcs with the same
   input type are merged into one to remove unnecessary LGR points for the
   final approximation. Additionally, a stop criterion by monitoring
   variations of the Hamiltonian function at discrete points is proposed to
   estimate whether the computed solution satisfies the necessary
   conditions of optimality in the sense of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle.
   The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through its
   application to the Williams-Otto semibatch reactor. Finally, elucidated
   relationships between three important tuning parameters (i.e., the
   accuracy tolerance epsilon, the minimum and maximum number of allowable
   LGR points in each subinterval N-min and N-max) and the performance can
   guide further applications of the proposed methodology to large-scale

Abstract = {{We report the design of a bottle-brush polymer whose architecture
   closely mimics the lubricating protein lubricin. Interaction forces,
   assessed using a Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA), between two mica
   surfaces fully covered by the polymer demonstrate that the polymer
   adopts a loop conformation giving rise to a weak and long-range
   repulsive interaction force between the surfaces. Under high
   compression, stronger repulsive forces appear due to the strong
   compression of the grafted pendant chains of the polymer. When submitted
   to shear, the system shows extremely low frictional forces dependent on
   the salinity of the medium. Friction coefficients measured for this
   system were as low as similar to 10(-3). Interestingly, the confined
   lubricating fluid obeys all three Amontons' laws. We explain this
   peculiar observation by the strong shear thinning of the confined fluid
   and the osmotic repulsive forces that dominate the overall (dynamic and
   equilibrium) surface interactions.}},

Title = {{Use of diffusion spectrum imaging in preliminary longitudinal evaluation
   of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: development of an imaging biomarker}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown white matter
   pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), predominantly in the
   motor pathways. Further these studies have shown that DTI can be used
   longitudinally to track pathology over time, making white matter
   pathology a candidate as an outcome measure in future trials. DTI has
   demonstrated application in group studies, however its derived indices,
   for example fractional anisotropy, are susceptible to partial volume
   effects, making its role questionable in examining individual
   progression. We hypothesize that changes in the white matter are present
   in ALS beyond the motor tracts, and that the affected pathways and
   associated pattern of disease progression can be tracked longitudinally
   using automated diffusion connectometry analysis. Connectometry analysis
   is based on diffusion spectrum imaging and overcomes the limitations of
   a conventional tractography approach and DTI. The identified affected
   white matter tracts can then be assessed in a targeted fashion using
   High definition fiber tractography (a novel white matter MR imaging
   technique). Changes in quantitative and qualitative markers over time
   could then be correlated with clinical progression. We illustrate these
   principles toward developing an imaging biomarker for demonstrating
   individual progression, by presenting results for five ALS patients,
   including with longitudinal data in two. Preliminary analysis
   demonstrated a number of changes bilaterally and asymmetrically in
   motoric and extramotoric white matter pathways. Further the limbic
   system was also affected possibly explaining the cognitive symptoms in
   ALS. In the two longitudinal subjects, the white matter changes were
   less extensive at baseline, although there was evidence of disease
   progression in a frontal pattern with a relatively spared postcentral
   gyrus, consistent with the known pathology in ALS.}},

   Quantitative Predictions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Understanding stem cell (SC) population dynamics is essential for
   developing models that can be used in basic science and medicine, to aid
   in predicting cells fate. These models can be used as tools e. g. in
   studying patho-physiological events at the cellular and tissue level,
   predicting (mal) functions along the developmental course, and
   personalized regenerative medicine. Using time-lapsed imaging and
   statistical tools, we show that the dynamics of SC populations involve a
   heterogeneous structure consisting of multiple sub-population behaviors.
   Using non-Gaussian statistical approaches, we identify the co-existence
   of fast and slow dividing subpopulations, and quiescent cells, in stem
   cells from three species. The mathematical analysis also shows that,
   instead of developing independently, SCs exhibit a time-dependent
   fractal behavior as they interact with each other through molecular and
   tactile signals. These findings suggest that more sophisticated models
   of SC dynamics should view SC populations as a collective and avoid the
   simplifying homogeneity assumption by accounting for the presence of
   more than one dividing sub-population, and their multi-fractal
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{One crucial challenge in developing rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries is to
   identify a stable solvent that is resistant to decomposition in the
   electrochemical environment of Li2O2. We attempt to identify descriptors
   that could be used to test for solvent stability. We build on the recent
   quantitative experimental results on oxygen consumption and release
   during discharge and charge respectively. We limit our focus to
   understanding trends in oxidative stability of solvents and based on a
   systematic treatment of the electrochemical environment of Li2O2, we
   propose that, to a first approximation, the highest occupied molecular
   orbital. (HOMO) level could be a good descriptor. We demonstrate that
   this descriptor correlates well with the experimentally measured degree
   of rechargeability. We utilize this descriptor to screen a large number
   of solvents and identify several solvents that could enhance the
   rechargeability of nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. We provide a
   comprehensive compilation of available computational and experimental
   data of several key solvent parameters that we believe will be the
   genesis for an `electrolyte genome'.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{234-249}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Suppressing the effects of liquid loading is a key issue for efficient
   utilization of mid and late-life wells in shale-gas systems. This state
   of the wells can be prevented by performing short shut-ins when the gas
   rate falls below the minimum rate needed to avoid liquid loading. In
   this paper, we present a Lagrangian relaxation scheme for shut-in
   scheduling of distributed shale multi-well systems. The scheme optimizes
   shut-in times and a reference rate for each multi-well pad, such that
   the total produced rate tracks a given short-term gas demand for the
   field. By using simple, frequency-tuned well proxy models, we obtain a
   compact mixed-integer formulation which by Lagrangian relaxation renders
   a decomposable structure. A set of computational tests demonstrates the
   merits of the proposed scheme. This study indicates that the method is
   capable of solving large field-wide scheduling problems by producing
   good solutions in reasonable computation times. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Equilibrium climate sensitivity measures the long-term response of
   surface temperature to changes in atmospheric CO2. The range of climate
   sensitivities in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth
   Assessment Report is unchanged from that published almost 30years
   earlier in the Charney Report. We conduct perfect model experiments
   using an energy balance model to study the rate at which uncertainties
   might be reduced by observation of global temperature and ocean heat
   uptake. We find that a climate sensitivity of 1.5 degrees C can be
   statistically distinguished from 3 degrees C by 2030, 3 degrees C from
   4.5 degrees C by 2040, and 4.5 degrees C from 6 degrees C by 2065.
   Learning rates are slowest in the scenarios of greatest concern (high
   sensitivities), due to a longer ocean response time, which may have
   bearing on wait-and-see versus precautionary mitigation policies.
   Learning rates are optimistic in presuming the availability of whole
   ocean heat data but pessimistic by using simple aggregated metrics and
   model physics.}},

Abstract = {{Iron complexes of tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands are important members
   of the suite of oxidation catalysts known as TAML activators. TAML
   activators are known to be fast homogeneous water oxidation (WO)
   catalysts, producing oxygen in the presence of chemical oxidants, e.g.,
   ceric ammonium nitrate. These homogeneous systems exhibited low turnover
   numbers (TONs). Here we demonstrate immobilization on glassy carbon and
   carbon paper in an ink composed of the prototype TAML activator, carbon
   black, and Nafion and the subsequent use of this composition in
   heterogeneous electrocatalytic WO. The immobilized TAML system is shown
   to readily produce O-2 with much higher TONs than the homogeneous
   predecessors.}},

Abstract = {{Systematically varying properties and reactivities have led to focused
   research of the environmental forensic capabilities of rare earth
   elements (REE). Increasing anthropogenic inputs to natural systems may
   permanently alter the natural signatures of PEE, motivating
   characterization of natural REE variability. We compiled and analyzed
   reported dissolved REE concentration data over a wide range of natural
   water types (ground-, ocean, river, and lake water) and groundwater
   chemistries (e.g., fresh, brine, and acidic) with the goal of
   quantifying the extent of natural REE variability, especially for
   groundwater systems. Quantitative challenges presented by censored data
   were addressed with nonparametric distributions and regressions.
   Reported measurements of REE in natural waters range over nearly 10
   orders of magnitude, though the majority of measurements are within 2-4
   orders of magnitude, and are highly correlated with one another. Few
   global correlations exist among dissolved abundance and bulk solution
   properties in groundwater, indicating the complex nature of source-sink
   terms and the need for care when comparing results between studies. This
   collection, homogenization, and analysis of a disparate literature
   facilitates interstudy comparison and provides insight into the wide
   range of variables that influence REE geochemistry.}},

Title = {{Co-precipitation of Radium with Barium and Strontium Sulfate and Its
   Impact on the Fate of Radium during Treatment of Produced Water from
   Unconventional Gas Extraction}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Radium occurs in flowback and produced waters from hydraulic fracturing
   for unconventional gas extraction along with high concentrations of
   barium and strontium and elevated salinity. Radium is often removed from
   this wastewater by co-precipitation with barium or other alkaline earth
   metals. The distribution equation for Ra in the precipitate is derived
   from the equilibrium of the lattice replacement reaction (inclusion)
   between the Ra2+ ion and the carrier ions (e.g., Ba2+ and Sr2+) in
   aqueous and solid phases and is often applied to describe the fate of
   radium in these systems. Although the theoretical distribution
   coefficient for Ra-SrSO4 (K-d = 237) is much larger than that for
   Ra-BaSO4 (K-d = 1.54), previous studies have focused on Ra-BaSO4
   equilibrium. This study evaluates the equilibria and kinetics of
   co-precipitation reactions in Ra-Ba-SO4 and Ra-Sr-SO4 binary systems and
   the Ra-Ba-Sr-SO4 ternary system under varying ionic strength (IS)
   conditions that are representative of brines generated during
   unconventional gas extraction. Results show that radium removal
   generally follows the theoretical distribution law in binary systems and
   is enhanced in the Ra-Ba-SO4 system and restrained in the Ra-Sr-SO4
   system by high IS. However, the experimental distribution coefficient
   (K-d') varies widely and cannot be accurately described by the
   distribution equation, which depends on IS, kinetics of carrier
   precipitation and does not account for radium removal by adsorption.
   Radium removal in the ternary system is controlled by the
   co-precipitation of Ra-Ba-SO4, which is attributed to the rapid BaSO4
   nucleation rate and closer ionic radii of Ra2+ with Ba2+ than with Sr2+.
   Carrier (i.e., barite) recycling during water treatment was shown to be
   effective in enhancing radium removal even after co-precipitation was
   completed. Calculations based on experimental results show that Ra
   levels in the precipitate generated in centralized waste treatment
   facilities far exceed regulatory limits for disposal in municipal
   sanitary landfills and require careful monitoring of allowed source term
   loading (ASTL) for technically enhanced naturally occurring materials
   (TENORM) in these landfills. Several alternatives for sustainable
   management of TENORM are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of 20 nm diameter silica nanoparticles grafted with a high
   density brush of the weak polymeric base poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl
   methacrylate) (SiO2-g-PDMAEMA) to the silica/aqueous interface was
   investigated using ellipsometry and streaming potential measurements. We
   measured SiO2-g-PDMAEMA adsorption to negatively charged silica surfaces
   in 1-100 mM sodium chloride solutions in the pH range 5-10 to
   investigate the role of electrostatics in the adsorption mechanism. In
   this system pH and ionic strength determine not only the charge density
   of the silica adsorption substrate but also the degree of ionization and
   swelling of the PDMAEMA brushes on the nanoparticles, resulting in
   nonmonotonic dependences of the extent of adsorption on pH and ionic
   strength. SiO2-g-PDMAEMA displays significantly different adsorption
   behavior from the linear PDMAEMA analogue, most notably in terms of a
   strongly hysteretic adsorption response to altered pH and a greater
   tendency to adsorb under weak surface attraction conditions that prevail
   at high pH.}},

Abstract = {{We predict the properties of the propagating and nonpropagating
   vibrational modes in amorphous silica (a-SiO2) and amorphous silicon
   (a-Si) and, from them, thermal conductivity accumulation functions. The
   calculations are performed using molecular dynamics simulations, lattice

   propagating modes contribute negligibly to thermal conductivity (6\%),
   in agreement with the thermal conductivity accumulation measured by
   Regner et al. {[}Nat. Commun. 4, 1640 ( 2013)]. For a-Si, propagating
   modes with mean-free paths up to 1 mu m contribute 40\% of the total
   thermal conductivity. The predicted contribution to thermal conductivity
   from nonpropagating modes and the total thermal conductivity for a-Si
   are in agreement with the measurements of Regner et al. The accumulation

Title = {{Robustness in clustering-based weighted inter-connected networks}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{We study the robustness of symmetrically coupled and clustering-based
   weighted heterogeneous inter-connected networks with respect to
   load-failure-induced cascades. This is done under the assumption that
   the flow dynamics are governed by global redistribution of loads based
   on weighted betweenness centrality. Our results indicate that no
   weighting bias should be assigned to inter-links when calculating
   shortest path between node pairs under the clustering-based weighting
   scheme; i.e., inter-links shall be treated no differently than
   intra-links. In contrast with local load redistribution cases, we show
   that increasing connectivity is preferred for the robustness against
   global load redistribution-based cascading failures in clustering-based
   weighted inter-connected networks. Furthermore, comparisons among
   weighting schemes reveal that, both the clustering-based and
   degree-based schemes outperform the random one in the sense of requiring
   lower initial and total investments required to ensure robustness. We
   also find that clustering-based scheme outperforms degree-based one in
   terms of requiring lower initial investments. Except in a limited range
   where weighting is heavily suppressed, clustering-based scheme is shown
   to outperform degree-based one in terms of total investments. Finally,
   when there exists a hard investment budget constraint, clustering-based
   weighting scheme would be a better choice against a two-nodes-induced
   failure than the degree-based weighting, and the clustering-based scheme
   is more stable than degree-based scheme against one-or-two-nodes-induced
   failure. We expect our findings to be significantly useful in designing
   real-world weighted inter-connected networks that are robust against
   load-failure-induced cascades.}},

Title = {{Mapping Topographic Structure in White Matter Pathways with Level Set
   Trees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Fiber tractography on diffusion imaging data offers rich potential for
   describing white matter pathways in the human brain, but characterizing
   the spatial organization in these large and complex data sets remains a
   challenge. We show that level set trees-which provide a concise
   representation of the hierarchical mode structure of probability density
   functions-offer a statistically-principled framework for visualizing and
   analyzing topography in fiber streamlines. Using diffusion spectrum
   imaging data collected on neurologically healthy controls (N = 30), we
   mapped white matter pathways from the cortex into the striatum using a
   deterministic tractography algorithm that estimates fiber bundles as
   dimensionless streamlines. Level set trees were used for interactive
   exploration of patterns in the endpoint distributions of the mapped
   fiber pathways and an efficient segmentation of the pathways that had
   empirical accuracy comparable to standard nonparametric clustering
   techniques. We show that level set trees can also be generalized to
   model pseudo-density functions in order to analyze a broader array of
   data types, including entire fiber streamlines. Finally, resampling
   methods show the reliability of the level set tree as a descriptive
   measure of topographic structure, illustrating its potential as a
   statistical descriptor in brain imaging analysis. These results
   highlight the broad applicability of level set trees for visualizing and
   analyzing high-dimensional data like fiber tractography output.}},

Title = {{Myristoylation Restricts Orientation of the GRASP Domain on Membranes
   and Promotes Membrane Tethering{*}}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{289}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{9683-9691}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: An unknown mechanism promotes trans interactions by the
   GRASP homotypic membrane tethers rather than unproductive cis
   interactions. Results: Neutron reflection shows that the myristoylated
   GRASP domain has a fixed, upright orientation on the membrane
   incompatible with cis interactions. Conclusion: Myristoylation restricts
   the orientation of the protein on the membrane to favor interactions in
   trans. Significance: Orientation of membrane proteins is functionally
   significant and may be regulated by myristoylation.
   The mammalian Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP) proteins are
   Golgi-localized homotypic membrane tethers that organize Golgi stacks
   into a long, contiguous ribbon-like structure. It is unknown how GRASPs
   undergo trans pairing given that cis interactions between the proteins
   in the plane of the membrane are intrinsically favored. To test the
   hypothesis that myristoylation of the self-interacting GRASP domain
   restricts its orientation on the membrane to favor trans pairing, we
   established an in vitro assay that recapitulates GRASP-dependent
   membrane tethering and used neutron reflection under similar conditions
   to determine the orientation of the GRASP domain. In vivo, the membrane
   association of GRASP proteins is conferred by the simultaneous insertion
   of an N-terminal myristic acid and binding to a Golgi-associated binding
   partner. In our assay, the latter contact was replaced using a
   C-terminal hexa-His moiety, which bound to Ni2+-conjugated lipids
   incorporated into a substrate-supported bilayer lipid membrane.
   Nonmyristoylated protein lacked a fixed orientation on the membrane and
   inefficiently tethered liposomes. In contrast, myristoylated GRASP
   promoted tethering and exhibited a unique membrane complex. Thus,
   myristoylation restricts the membrane orientation of the GRASP domain
   favoring interactions in trans for membrane tethering.}},

Abstract = {{We present an extension of the logic outer-approximation algorithm for
   dealing with disjunctive discrete-continuous optimal control problems
   whose dynamic behavior is modeled in terms of differential-algebraic
   equations. Although the proposed algorithm can be applied to a wide
   variety of discrete-continuous optimal control problems, we are mainly
   interested in problems where disjunctions are also present. Disjunctions
   are included to take into account only certain parts of the underlying
   model which become relevant under some processing conditions. By doing
   so the numerical robustness of the optimization algorithm improves since
   those parts of the model that are not active are discarded leading to a
   reduced size problem and avoiding potential model singularities. We test
   the proposed algorithm using three examples of different complex dynamic
   behavior. In all the case studies the number of iterations and the
   computational effort required to obtain the optimal solutions is modest
   and the solutions are relatively easy to find.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we address the dynamic simulation and optimization of
   chemical processing systems modeled in terms of fractional order
   differential equations. While fractional derivatives were first proposed
   by Liouville in 1832 {[}Samko et al. Fractional Integrals and
   Derivatives Theory and Applications; Gordon and Breach: New York, 1993;
   Oldham and Spanier. The fractional Calculus; Academic Press: New York,
   1974], fractional differential equation (FDE) models have been only
   recently been explored. These have been proposed for a wide range of
   applications that include systems with nonlocal diffusion phenomena and
   geometries with fractal dimensions. FDE models have been shown to have
   advantages over traditional integer order models, as they often avoid
   scale dependent model parameters. For medium or large scale applications
   of FDEs normally no analytical solutions are available, and therefore,
   approximated numerical solutions ought to be sought. Moreover, little
   work has been done to solve fractional order differential equations
   numerically; most of the existing numerical methods are intended for
   small scale systems. In this work, we propose a new numerical method,
   based on Gaussian quadrature on finite elements, to address larger-scale
   FDEs and extend them to dynamic optimization. To gain a better
   appreciation about the performance of the new algorithm, we compare its
   response to recently proposed predictor-corrector methods. We also
   develop a proposed method to deal with dynamic optimization fractional
   order systems, an open research problem that has not received wide
   consideration. We test the performance of the algorithms by deploying
   three systems embedded with different fractional derivative behavior,
   from a simple linear dynamic system to a dynamic multiple steady-states
   bioreactor with various levels of imperfect mixing. The results indicate
   better numerical properties of the fractional order Gauss quadrature
   algorithm both for the dynamic simulation and optimal control issues.}},

   Surface-initiated Assembly}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{86}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix (ECM) in tissues is synthesized and assembled
   by cells to form a 3D fibrillar, protein network with tightly regulated
   fiber diameter, composition and organization. In addition to providing
   structural support, the physical and chemical properties of the ECM play
   an important role in multiple cellular processes including adhesion,
   differentiation, and apoptosis. In vivo, the ECM is assembled by
   exposing cryptic self-assembly (fibrillogenesis) sites within proteins.
   This process varies for different proteins, but fibronectin (FN)
   fibrillogenesis is well-characterized and serves as a model system for
   cell-mediated ECM assembly. Specifically, cells use integrin receptors
   on the cell membrane to bind FN dimers and actomyosin-generated
   contractile forces to unfold and expose binding sites for assembly into
   insoluble fibers. This receptor-mediated process enables cells to
   assemble and organize the ECM from the cellular to tissue scales. Here,
   we present a method termed surface-initiated assembly (SIA), which
   recapitulates cell-mediated matrix assembly using protein-surface
   interactions to unfold ECM proteins and assemble them into insoluble
   fibers. First, ECM proteins are adsorbed onto a hydrophobic
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface where they partially denature
   (unfold) and expose cryptic binding domains. The unfolded proteins are
   then transferred in well-defined micro- and nanopatterns through
   microcontact printing onto a thermally responsive
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) surface. Thermally-triggered
   dissolution of the PIPAAm leads to final assembly and release of
   insoluble ECM protein nanofibers and nanostructures with well-defined
   geometries. Complex architectures are possible by engineering defined
   patterns on the PDMS stamps used for microcontact printing. In addition
   to FN, the SIA process can be used with laminin, fibrinogen and
   collagens type I and IV to create multi-component ECM nanostructures.
   Thus, SIA can be used to engineer ECM protein-based materials with
   precise control over the protein composition, fiber geometry and
   scaffold architecture in order to recapitulate the structure and
   composition of the ECM in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes mellitus (DM) is gradually becoming an epidemic, affecting
   almost every single country. This has placed a tremendous amount of
   burden on governments and healthcare officials. In this paper, we
   propose a new noninvasive method to detect DM based on facial block
   color features with a sparse representation classifier (SRC). A
   noninvasive capture device with image correction is initially used to
   capture a facial image consisting of four facial blocks strategically
   placed around the face. Six centroids from a facial color gamut are
   applied to calculate the facial color features of each block. This means
   that a given facial block can be represented by its facial color
   features. For SRC, two subdictionaries, a Healthy facial color features
   subdictionary and DM facial color features subdictionary, are employed
   in the SRC process. Experimental results are shown for a dataset
   consisting of 142 Healthy and 284 DM samples. Using a combination of the
   facial blocks, the SRC can distinguish Healthy and DM classes with an
   average accuracy of 97.54\%.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of dual
   administration of recombinant human platelet derived growth factor-BB
   (rhPDGF-BB) and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2)
   on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal
   stem cells (hMSCs). Either rhPDGF-BB or rhBMP-2 or a combination of the
   two factors was administered into hMSCs. Proliferation and osteogenic
   differentiation were determined by measuring DNA concentration, alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization (von Kossa staining) at
   days 7, 14 and 21. The data revealed that the administration of
   rhPDGF-BB (days 1-7) followed by rhBMP-2 (days 7-21) resulted in a
   significant increase of ALP activity and extracellular mineral
   deposition of hMSCs as compared to that of either factor alone or
   concurrent administration of the two factors. In addition, rhPDGF-BB
   treatment at days 1-7 significantly increased proliferation of hMSCs
   without decreasing osteogenic differentiation. The results underscored
   the importance of a coordinated, temporal sequence of rhPDGF-BB and
   rhBMP-2 administration to modulate hMSC osteogenic differentiation. The
   study was a compelling advancement towards producing a therapy
   exploiting temporal, dual administration of physiological doses of
   rhPDGF-BB and rhBMP-2.}},

   a model of light interaction with human skin, we define the change of

   space, and successfully use the derived signal for computing the pulse
   heart rate. Various experiments with different cameras, different

   demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
   Examples computed with normal illumination show the algorithm is
   comparable with pulse oximeter devices both in accuracy and sensitivity.

   we present an analytical model for quantifying slip transfer across twin

   mechanistic models investigate how single or piled-up screw and
   non-screw dislocations interact with twin boundaries, by establishing
   connections with the size dependence of the activation volume. The
   models correctly predict the trends from a variety of independent prior
   experimental observations of the dependence of flow stress on twin
   lamella size in nanotwinned copper. They also rationalize a number of
   observations made from previous molecular dynamics simulations of the
   deformation of nanotwinned metals. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Real-time pricing of electricity is theoretically more economically
   efficient than flat rate pricing. However, a switch from flat-rates to
   real-time rates means that many consumers will lose the cross-subsidy
   they are receiving under the flat rate, and may see an increase in their
   bills even if they have elastic demand. We use hourly load data from
   1260 Commonwealth Edison residential customers on a standard flat rate
   electricity tariff from 2007 and 2008. We calculate which customers
   would have been better off and which customers would not Under real time
   pricing with both elastic and inelastic demand and look at the general
   characteristics of these customers. We find that if customers do not
   respond to prices under RTP, then only 35\% of customers save money,
   while the remainder loses. The greatest potential for savings is from
   reduction in capacity costs.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing CO2 emissions from the electricity sector will likely require
   policies that encourage the widespread deployment of a diverse mix of
   low-carbon electricity generation technologies. Public discourse informs
   such policies. To make informed decisions and to productively engage in
   public discourse, citizens need to understand the trade-offs between
   electricity technologies proposed for widespread deployment. Building on
   previous paper-and-pencil studies, we developed a computer tool that
   aimed to help nonexperts make informed decisions about the challenges
   faced in achieving a low-carbon energy future. We report on an initial
   usability study of this interactive computer tool. After providing
   participants with comparative and balanced information about 10
   electricity technologies, we asked them to design a low-carbon
   electricity portfolio. Participants used the interactive computer tool,
   which constrained portfolio designs to be realistic and yield low CO2
   emissions. As they changed their portfolios, the tool updated
   information about projected CO2 emissions, electricity costs, and
   specific environmental impacts. As in the previous paper-and-pencil
   studies, most participants designed diverse portfolios that included
   energy efficiency, nuclear, coal with carbon capture and sequestration,
   natural gas, and wind. Our results suggest that participants understood
   the tool and used it consistently. The tool may be downloaded from

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of exponentially stabilizing periodic
   orbits in a special class of hybrid models-systems with impulse
   effects-through controlLyapunov functions. The periodic orbit is assumed
   to lie in a C-1 submanifold Z that is contained in the zero set of an
   output function and is invariant under both the continuous and discrete
   dynamics; the associated restriction dynamics are termed the hybrid zero
   dynamics. The orbit is furthermore assumed to be exponentially stable
   within the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of
   such periodic orbits with respect to the full-order dynamics of the
   system with impulse effects have relied on input-output linearization of
   the dynamics transverse to the zero dynamics manifold. The principal
   result of this paper demonstrates that a variant of control Lyapunov
   functions that enforce rapid exponential convergence to the zero
   dynamics surface, Z can be used to achieve exponential stability of the
   periodic orbit in the full-order dynamics, thereby significantly
   extending the class of stabilizing controllers. The main result is
   illustrated on a hybrid model of a bipedal walking robot through
   simulations and is utilized to experimentally achieve bipedal locomotion
   via control Lyapunov functions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Intracortical brain-computer interface (BCI) decoders are
   typically retrained daily to maintain stable performance.
   Self-recalibrating decoders aim to remove the burden this may present in
   the clinic by training themselves autonomously during normal use but
   have only been developed for continuous control. Here we address the
   problem for discrete decoding (classifiers). Approach. We recorded
   threshold crossings from 96-electrode arrays implanted in the motor
   cortex of two rhesus macaques performing center-out reaches in 7
   directions over 41 and 36 separate days spanning 48 and 58 days in total
   for offline analysis. Main results. We show that for the purposes of
   developing a self-recalibrating classifier, tuning parameters can be
   considered as fixed within days and that parameters on the same
   electrode move up and down together between days. Further, drift is
   constrained across time, which is reflected in the performance of a
   standard classifier which does not progressively worsen if it is not
   retrained daily, though overall performance is reduced by more than 10\%
   compared to a daily retrained classifier. Two novel self-recalibrating
   classifiers produce a similar to 15\% increase in classification
   accuracy over that achieved by the non-retrained classifier to nearly
   recover the performance of the daily retrained classifier. Significance.
   We believe that the development of classifiers that require no daily
   retraining will accelerate the clinical translation of BCI systems.
   Future work should test these results in a closed-loop setting.}},

   generate a driving force of the capsule robot. We invented a magnetic
   mechanical mechanism to transfer the rotational motion of the frontal
   part into the linear motion of the middle part. Using this original
   mechanism, the linearly moving part at the middle of the capsule robot
   generates a supportive driving force. The improved mobility is evaluated
   in experiments. The developed capsule robot employing multiple
   locomotion mechanisms moves 44\% faster than the spiral motion-based
   capsule robot. The developed magnetic mechanical mechanism and the
   mobile robotic platform could be used for pipe inspection robots or

Abstract = {{Microkinetic models, combined with experimentally measured reaction
   rates and orders, play a key role in elucidating detailed reaction
   mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis and have typically been solved as

   a new approach to fitting those models to experimental data. For the
   specific example treated here, by reformulating a typical microkinetic
   model for a continuous stirred tank reactor to a system of nonlinear
   equations, we achieved a 1000-fold increase in solution speed. The
   reduced computational cost allows a more systematic search of the
   parameter space, leading to better fits to the available experimental
   data. We applied this approach to the problem of methanol synthesis by
   CO/CO2 hydrogenation over a supported-Cu catalyst, an important
   catalytic reaction with a large industrial interest and potential for

Abstract = {{In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by an
   order of magnitude, a portfolio of mitigation strategies is needed.
   Currently, many utilities pursue energy efficiency programs. We study a
   case where utilities could choose whether to allocate their energy
   efficiency budget to either end-use efficiency or vehicle
   electrification as a means to reduce CO2 emissions. We build a decision
   space that displays the conditions under which utilities should pursue
   either strategy. To build such decision space, assumptions are needed on
   how consumers respond to electric vehicle incentives, and what would be
   the baseline vehicle selected by consumers if no incentives were in
   place. Since these two aspects are highly uncertain, we treat them
   parametrically: if consumers are replacing a conventional vehicle with a
   PHEV, utility incentive programs to induce PHEV adoption appear to be
   cost-effective for a wide range of efficiency program costs and grid
   emissions factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel octree-based dual contouring (DC) algorithm
   for adaptive triangular or tetrahedral mesh generation with guaranteed
   angle range. First, an adaptive octree is constructed based on the input
   geometry. Then the octree grid points are adjusted such that we can
   maintain a minimum distance from the grid points to the input boundary.
   Finally, an improved DC method is applied to generate triangular and
   tetrahedral meshes. It is proved that we can guarantee the obtained
   triangle mesh has an angle range of (19.47A degrees, 141.06A degrees)
   for any closed smooth curve, and the tetrahedral mesh has a dihedral
   angle range of (12.04A degrees, 129.25A degrees) for any closed smooth
   surface. In practice, since the straight line/planar cutting plane
   assumption inside each octree leaf is not always satisfied, there is a
   small perturbation for the lower and upper bounds of the proved angle
   range.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified mathematical model has been developed to evaluate the
   effect of CO2 stripping on pH of recirculating cooling water in power
   plant cooling systems. Experimental data from three pilot-scale cooling
   towers using treated municipal wastewater as makeup water were used to
   determine the CO2 mass transfer coefficients in the gas phase k(g) and
   aqueous phase k(w). The optimum values of the gas film mass transfer
   coefficient and water film mass transfer coefficient were determined by
   regression to be k(g)=8.4 x 10(-6) m/s and k(w)=8.4 x 10(-8)m/s,
   respectively. The results also indicate that the model is capable of
   predicting the pH of the cooling loop as a function of makeup water
   alkalinity and cooling loop alkalinity (in case of salt formation) as
   well as the operating parameters of the cooling system. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Most technologically relevant ferroelectrics typically lose
   piezoelectricity above the Curie temperature. This limits their use to
   relatively low temperatures. In this Letter, exploiting a combination of
   flexoelectricity and simple functional grading, we propose a strategy
   for high-temperature electromechanical coupling in a standard thin film
   configuration. We use continuum modeling to quantitatively demonstrate
   the possibility of achieving apparent piezoelectric materials with large
   and temperature-stable electromechanical coupling across a wide
   temperature range that extends significantly above the Curie
   temperature. With Barium and Strontium Titanate, as example materials, a
   significant electromechanical coupling that is potentially
   temperature-stable up to 900 degrees C is possible. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reports that U.S. water
   withdrawals have been steady since 1980, but the population and economy
   have grown since then. This implies that other factors have contributed
   to offsetting decreases in water withdrawals. Using water withdrawal
   data from USGS and economic data from Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
   direct and total water withdrawals were estimated for 134 industrial
   summary sectors in the 1997 U.S. economic input output (EIO) table and
   136 industrial sectors in the 2002 EIO table. Using structural
   decomposition analysis (SDA), the change in water withdrawals for the
   economy from 1997 to 2002 was allocated to changes in population, GDP
   per capita, water use intensity, production structure, and consumption
   patterns. The changes in population, GDP per capita, and water use
   intensity led to increased water withdrawals, while the changes in
   production structure and consumption patterns decreased water
   withdrawals from 1997 to 2002. Consumption patterns change was the
   largest net contributor to the change in water withdrawals. The model
   was used to predict aggregate changes in total water withdrawals from
   2002 to 2010 due to known changes in population and GDP per cap ita; a
   more complete model assessment must await release of updated data on
   USGS water withdrawals and EIO data.}},

Abstract = {{The onset of localized current conduction during electroforming of

   voltage method. The temperature rise at electroforming onset is found to
   vary from 25 to 300 degrees C as the pulse amplitude and the width are
   varied between 3-8 V and 10 ns-100 ms, respectively. The effective
   activation energy of the forming event is strongly electric field
   dependent and decreases from 0.7 eV at 3 V to almost zero at 8 V. The

Title = {{Studies of nanocomposites of carbon nanotubes and a negative dielectric

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{It has been widely recognized that the combination of carbon nanotube
   (CNT) and liquid crystals (LCs) not only provides a useful way to align
   CNTs, but also dramatically enhances the order in the LC phases, which
   is especially useful in liquid crystal display (LCD) technology. As the
   measure of this phase behavior, the complex specific heat is presented
   over a wide temperature range for a negative dielectric anisotropy
   alkoxyphenylbenzoate liquid crystal (9OO4) and CNT composites as a
   function of CNT concentration. The calorimetric scans were performed
   under near-equilibrium conditions between 25 and 95 degrees C, first
   cooling and then followed by heating for CNT weight percent ranging from
   phi(omega) = 0 to 0.2. All 9OO4/CNT mesophases have transition
   temperatures similar to 1 K higher and a crystallization temperature 4 K
   higher than that of the pure 9OO4. The crystal phase superheats until a
   strongly first-order specific heat feature is observed, 0.5 K higher
   than in the pure 9OO4. The transition enthalpy for the nanocomposite
   mesophases is 10\% lower than that observed in the pure 9OO4. The
   strongly first-order crystallization and melting transition enthalpies
   are essentially constant over this range of fw. Complementary
   electroclinic measurement on a 0.05 wt. \% sample, cooling towards the
   smectic-C phase from the smectic-A, indicates that the SmA-SmC
   transition remains mean-field-like in the presence of the CNTs. Given
   the homogeneous and random distribution of CNTs in these nanocomposites,
   we interpret these results as arising from the LCCNT surface interaction
   pinning the orientational order uniformly along the CNT, without pinning
   the position of the 9OO4 molecule, leading to a net ordering effect for
   all phases. These effects of incorporating CNTs into LCs are likely due
   to ``anisotropic orientational{''} coupling between CNT and LC, the
   change in the elastic properties of composites and thermal anisotropic
   properties of the CNTs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{The impact of electron scattering at surfaces and grain boundaries in
   nanometric polycrystalline tungsten (W) films was studied. A series of
   polycrystalline W films ranging in thickness from 10 to 310 nm and
   lateral grain size from 74 to 133 nm were prepared on thermally oxidized
   Si. The Fuchs-Sondheimer surface-scattering model and Mayadas-Shatzkes
   grain-boundary scattering model were employed for quantitative analyses.
   Predictions from the theoretical models were found to deviate
   systematically from the experimental data. Possible reasons for the
   failure of the theoretical models to describe the experimental data are
   explored. Finally, a discussion of the crucial features lacking from
   existing models is presented, along with possible avenues for improving
   the models to result in better agreement with experimental data. (C)

Abstract = {{Transition metal dioxides (BO2) exhibit a number of polymorphic
   structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different
   polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error
   experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative
   stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase,
   brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO2
   dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in
   a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals
   within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the
   different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on
   predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior
   observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and
   then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the
   context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For
   example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO2 and
   RuO2 are similar to those of TiO2 and SnO2, the latter two of which have
   been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{62-79}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new decomposition algorithm for solving
   large-scale multistage stochastic programs (MSSPs) with endogenous
   uncertainties. Instead of dualizing all the initial non-anticipativity
   constraints (NACs) and removing all the conditional NACs to decompose
   the problem into scenario subproblems, the basic idea relies on keeping
   a subset of NACs as explicit constraints in the scenario group
   subproblems while dualizing or relaxing the rest of the NACs. It is
   proved that the algorithm provides a dual bound that is at least as
   tight as the standard approach. Numerical results for process network
   examples and oilfield development planning problem are presented to
   illustrate that the proposed decomposition approach yields significant
   improvement in the dual bound at the root node and reduction in the
   total computational expense for closing the gap. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an MILP model to address the optimization of
   the tactical planning for the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)
   industry. This model is demonstrated for a case containing 10
   Stock-Keeping Units (SKUs), but is intractable for realistically sized
   problems. Therefore, we propose a decomposition based on single-SKU
   submodels. To account for the interaction between SKUs, slack variables
   are introduced into the capacity constraints. In an iterative procedure
   the cost of violating the capacity is slowly increased, and eventually a
   feasible solution is obtained. Even for the relatively small 10-SKU
   case, the required CPU time could be reduced from 1144 s to 175 s using
   the algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm was used to optimize cases of up
   to 1000 SKUs, whereas the full model is intractable for cases of 25 or
   more SKUs. The solutions obtained with the algorithm are typically
   within a few percent of the global optimum. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An optimization model is proposed to redesign the supply chain of spare
   part delivery under demand uncertainty from strategic and tactical
   perspectives in a planning horizon consisting of multiple periods. Long
   term decisions involve new installations, expansions and elimination of
   warehouses and factories handling multiple products. It is also
   considered which warehouses should be used as repair work-shops in order
   to store, repair and deliver used units to customers. Tactical planning
   includes deciding inventory levels (safety stock and expected inventory)
   for each type of spare part in distribution centers and customer plants,
   as well as the connection links between the supply chain nodes. Capacity
   constraints are also taken into account when planning inventory levels.
   At the tactical level it is determined how demand of failing units is
   satisfied, and whether to use new or used parts. The uncertain demand is
   addressed by defining the optimal amount of safety stock that guarantees
   certain service level at a customer plant. In addition, the risk-pooling
   effect is taken into account when defining inventory levels in
   distribution centers and customer zones. Due to the nonlinear nature of
   the original formulation, a piece-wise linearization approach is applied
   to obtain a tight lower bound of the optimal solution. The formulation
   can be adapted to several industry-critical units and the supply chain
   of electric motors is provided here as an example. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In Part I (Rodriguez, Vecchietti, Harjunkoski, \& Grossmann, 2013), we
   proposed an optimization model to redesign the supply chain of spare
   parts industry under demand uncertainty from strategic and tactical
   perspectives in a planning horizon consisting of multiple time periods.
   To address large scale industrial problems, a Lagrangean scheme is
   proposed to decompose the MINLP of Part I according to the warehouses.
   The subproblems are first approximated by an adaptive piece-wise
   linearization scheme that provides lower bounds, and the MILP is further
   relaxed to an LP to improve solution efficiency while providing a valid
   lower bound. An initialization scheme is designed to obtain good initial
   Lagrange multipliers, which are scaled to accelerate the convergence. To
   obtain feasible solutions, an adaptive linearization scheme is also
   introduced. The results from an illustrative problem and two real
   worldindustrial problems show that the method can obtain optimal or near
   optimal solutions in modest computational times. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Modern microscopic imaging devices are able to extract more information
   regarding the subcellular organization of different molecules and
   proteins than can be obtained by visual inspection. Predetermined
   numerical features (descriptors) often used to quantify cells extracted
   from these images have long been shown useful for discriminating cell
   populations (e. g., normal vs. diseased). Direct visual or biological
   interpretation of results obtained, however, is often not a trivial
   task. We describe an approach for detecting and visualizing phenotypic
   differences between classes of cells based on the theory of optimal mass
   transport. The method is completely automated, does not require the use
   of predefined numerical features, and at the same time allows for easily
   interpretable visualizations of the most significant differences. Using
   this method, we demonstrate that the distribution pattern of peripheral
   chromatin in the nuclei of cells extracted from liver and thyroid
   specimens is associated with malignancy. We also show the method can
   correctly recover biologically interpretable and statistically
   significant differences in translocation imaging assays in a completely
   automated fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring wet deposition of organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) is
   crucial for the complete understanding of the global circulation,
   lifetime, and radiative forcing of these aerosols. There is currently no
   accepted standard analytical method for measuring OC and BC
   concentration in precipitation. Different analytical methods have been
   employed for this purpose, but their feasibility has yet to be assessed.
   This manuscript evaluates the use of thermal-optical analysis (TOA),
   single-particle soot photometry (SP2), and ultraviolet-visible (UV/VIS)
   spectrophotometry for measuring BC in precipitation. In addition, total
   organic carbon (TOC) analysis was evaluated for the measurement of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in precipitation. Potential interferences
   and sources of bias were assessed for each method. Precipitation samples
   and reference materials containing carbon particles generated from wood
   combustion and a natural gas diffusion flame were used in this study.
   The UV/VIS spectrophotometer, despite showing linearity with BC
   concentration, had inadequate sensitivity (18g/L) to measure the low
   concentrations expected in precipitation. The SP2 analysis was adequate
   to measure refractory BC in precipitation in terms of precision and
   detection limit; however, systematic loss was estimated to be 34\% (+/-
   3\%). Sample filtration followed by TOA was inefficient for measuring
   particulate carbon in rainwater, as the quartz fiber filter captured
   less than 38\% of the BC mass. Filtration was improved by adding salts
   and acids into the water samples, and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate,
   (NH4)H2PO4, was determined to be the best additive by increasing the
   collection efficiency of quartz fiber filters up to 95\% (+/- 5\%). The
   TOC analyzer proved to be precise in the expected concentration range
   (200-5000g-C/L) for measuring DOC and total carbon (TC), including
   particulate OC and 94\% (+/- 2\%) of the refractory BC in solution.

Abstract = {{The potential for widespread use of domestically available energy
   resources, in conjunction with climate change concerns, suggest that
   biomass may be an essential component of U.S. energy systems in the near
   future. Cellulosic biomass in particular is anticipated to be used in
   increasing quantities because of policy efforts, such as federal
   renewable fuel standards and state renewable portfolio standards.
   Unfortunately, these independently designed biomass policies do not
   account for the fact that cellulosic biomass can equally be used for
   different, competing energy demands. An integrated assessment of
   multiple feedstocks, energy demands, and system costs is critical for
   making optimal decisions about a unified biomass energy strategy. This
   study develops a spatially explicit, best-use framework to optimally
   allocate cellulosic biomass feedstocks to energy demands in
   transportation, electricity, and residential heating sectors, while
   minimizing total system costs and tracking greenhouse gas emissions.
   Comparing biomass usage across three climate policy scenarios suggests
   that biomass used for space heating is a low cost emissions reduction
   option, while biomass for liquid fuel or for electricity becomes
   attractive only as emissions reduction targets or carbon prices
   increase. Regardless of the policy approach, study results make a strong
   case for national and regional coordination in policy design and
   compliance pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Sharing research data is necessary for collaboration within a research
   network and is required by funding agencies, such as the National
   Science Foundation (NSF), that enforce the scientific method and ethics

   infrastructure for supporting construction research data management are
   currently underdeveloped; emphasizing the need for developing effective
   and efficient means for managing and sharing research data. A review of
   existing data management models reveals that there is currently no
   effective universal system for sharing the data obtained from
   construction research endeavours. This paper presents electronic product
   and process management systems (EPPMS) as a construction research data
   management and sharing approach. The developed EPPMS is a web-based
   system that utilizes workflows that can automate the collection,
   authorization, and dissemination of construction research data. A
   comparative analysis of the developed system to the existing web-based
   cloud and web-based share point systems indicates that an EPPMS offers a
   more fitting solution for construction research data management.}},

Abstract = {{The reheating of high aluminum content transformation-induced plasticity
   (TRIP) and light-weight steels in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere has been
   shown to cause development of subsurface aluminum nitride precipitates
   in addition to internal and external oxides. It is important to
   understand how these nitrides and oxides form and their consequences for
   the quality of steel products. This study looks at model iron-aluminum
   (up to 8wt.\% aluminum) alloys and uses confocal laser scanning
   microscopy, XRD, SEM-EDS, and TEM to study the effect of various
   conditions on the growth and development of these precipitates in a
   subsurface oxygen-depleted region. It was found that nitrides formed
   when bulk aluminum content was below 8wt.\% when oxygen was sufficiently
   depleted due to the internal oxidation. In the samples containing 1wt.\%
   aluminum, the depth of the internal oxide and nitride zones were in
   agreement with the model proposed by Meijering. Increasing aluminum
   content to 3 and 5wt.\% had the effects of modifying the surface-oxide
   scale composition and increasing its continuity, which gradually
   decreased the internal precipitation zones with increasing aluminum
   content. In samples containing 8wt.\% aluminum, a thick continuous oxide
   sale formed and completely prevented nitrogen and oxygen penetration
   into the bulk of the sample, thus preventing the formation of any
   internal precipitates.}},

Abstract = {{Stringent quality requirements for integrated, heterogeneous systems
   have led designers and test engineers to mandate large sets of tests to
   be applied to these systems, which, in turn, have resulted in increased
   test cost. However, many of these tests are unnecessary (i. e.,
   redundant), since their outcomes can be reliably predicted using results
   from other applied tests. A methodology for identifying the redundant
   tests of an integrated, heterogeneous system that has only binary
   pass-fail test data is described. This methodology uses decision trees,
   Boolean minimization, and satisfiability as core components. Feasibility
   is empirically demonstrated using test data from two commercially
   fabricated systems, namely, a high-speed serializer/deserializer (HSS)
   and a phase-locked loop (PLL). Our analysis of test data from >38,000
   HSS and >22,000 PLL circuits show that 14 out of 40 HSS tests and 11 out

Abstract = {{To solve the grand challenges in contemporary chip design, such as
   process-to-core mapping, energy reduction, and maintenance of
   programmer/hardware abstraction, we advocate for self-optimizing
   (emergent) networks-on-chip (NoC). In these networks, topology and
   information flow adapt dynamically to maximize the network throughput or
   minimize the network latency via distributed application of microrules.
   In this paper, we introduce the concept of emergent small-world NoCs and
   discuss novel design decisions, e.g., Skip-links, that improve
   performance and reduce energy consumption of multicore systems. More
   precisely, we demonstrate that our proposed solution is able to adapt to
   a wide range of traffic patterns and provide reductions in data hop
   count of up to 20 percent while maintaining energy and area costs. We
   show how emergent networks can be useful for on-chip
   processor-to-processor communications, and also demonstrate how SoC and
   off-chip I/O traffic may be optimized for latency and critical load.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Oil shale is an unconventional petroleum source that can be
   produced domestically in the USA. Oil shale resources are primarily
   located in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, within the Colorado River Basin.
   In this paper, we analyze the life cycle consumptive water use for oil
   shale production and its impacts on water resources of the Colorado
   River Basin.
   Methods The study is focused on life cycle consumptive water use for oil
   shale development. Consumptive water use is defined as ``water that is
   evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products, or otherwise removed
   from the immediate water environment.{''} The analysis includes direct
   consumptive water requirements to extract, process, and refine shale
   oil, as well as indirect consumptive water use for generating the
   electricity associated with the extraction and processing. From the
   results, strategies for water supply certainty are discussed, and
   strategies for implementation are suggested. In addition, refining the
   shale oil outside of the oil shale region (removing the need for local
   water), using dry cooling systems for electricity generation, and
   building desalination plants in California (to replace water) are
   evaluated.
   Results and discussion Life cycle consumptive water use for oil shale is
   significant and could impact water availability for consumers in the
   lower Colorado River Basin. At a level of oil production of 2 million
   barrels per day, the life cycle consumptive water use would be
   significant: between 140 and 305 billion gallons (0.4 and 0.9 million
   acre-ft.) of water per year if surface mining and retorting is done, or
   between 150 and 340 billion gallons (0.5 and 1 million acre-ft.) of
   water per year if the Shell in situ process is used. Strategies could be
   implemented to provide water supply certainty including refining the
   shale oil outside of the region (removing some need for local water),
   using dry cooling systems for electricity generation, and building
   desalination plants in California (to replace water).
   Conclusions Water supply in the Colorado River Basin could be a primary
   constraint to the development of oil shale. At a level of oil production
   of 2 million barrels per day, the life cycle consumptive water use would
   be significant. Energy companies or governments may want to invest in
   water management and supply strategies that would eliminate the
   uncertainty associated with the water availability in the Colorado River
   Basin for oil shale development.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic prostheses have the potential to significantly improve mobility
   for people with lower-limb amputation. Humans exhibit complex responses
   to mechanical interactions with these devices, however, and
   computational models are not yet able to predict such responses
   meaningfully. Experiments therefore play a critical role in development,
   but have been limited by the use of product-like prototypes, each
   requiring years of development and specialized for a narrow range of
   functions. Here we describe a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis system that
   enables rapid exploration of a wide range of dynamical behaviors in
   experiments with human subjects. This emulator comprises powerful
   off-board motor and control hardware, a flexible Bowden cable tether,
   and a lightweight instrumented prosthesis, resulting in a combination of
   low mass worn by the human (0.96 kg) and high mechatronic performance
   compared to prior platforms. Benchtop tests demonstrated closed-loop
   torque bandwidth of 17Hz, peak torque of 175 Nm, and peak power of 1.0
   kW. Tests with an anthropomorphic pendulum ``leg{''} demonstrated low
   interference from the tether, less than 1 Nm about the hip. This
   combination of low worn mass, high bandwidth, high torque, and
   unrestricted movement makes the platform exceptionally versatile. To
   demonstrate suitability for human experiments, we performed preliminary
   tests in which a subject with unilateral transtibial amputation walked
   on a treadmill at 1.25 ms(-1) while the prosthesis behaved in various
   ways. These tests revealed low torque tracking error (RMS error of 2.8
   Nm) and the capacity to systematically vary work production or
   absorption across a broad range (from -5 to 21 J per step). These
   results support the use of robotic emulators during early stage
   assessment of proposed device functionalities and for scientific study
   of fundamental aspects of human-robot interaction. The design of simple,
   alternate end-effectors would enable studies at other joints or with
   additional degrees of freedom.}},

Abstract = {{The pathology of the human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and its
   relationship to the later complication of intraluminal thrombus (ILT)
   formation remains unclear. The hemodynamics in the diseased abdominal
   aorta are hypothesized to be a key contributor to the formation and
   growth of ILT. The objective of this investigation is to establish a
   reliable 3D flow visualization method with corresponding validation
   tests with high confidence in order to provide insight into the basic
   hemodynamic features for a better understanding of hemodynamics in AAA
   pathology and seek potential treatment for AAA diseases. A stereoscopic
   particle image velocity (PIV) experiment was conducted using transparent
   patient-specific experimental AAA models (with and without ILT) at three
   axial planes. Results show that before ILT formation, a 3D vortex was
   generated in the AAA phantom. This geometry-related vortex was not
   observed after the formation of ILT, indicating its possible role in the
   subsequent appearance of ILT in this patient. It may indicate that a
   longer residence time of recirculated blood flow in the aortic lumen due
   to this vortex caused sufficient shear-induced platelet activation to
   develop ILT and maintain uniform flow conditions. Additionally, two
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling codes (Fluent and an
   in-house cardiovascular CFD code) were compared with the
   two-dimensional, three-component velocity stereoscopic PIV data. Results
   showed that correlation coefficients of the out-of-plane velocity data
   between PIV and both CFD methods are greater than 0.85, demonstrating
   good quantitative agreement. The stereoscopic PIV study can be utilized
   as test case templates for ongoing efforts in cardiovascular CFD solver
   development. Likewise, it is envisaged that the patient-specific data
   may provide a benchmark for further studying hemodynamics of actual AAA,
   ILT, and their convolution effects under physiological conditions for
   clinical applications.}},

   CT-pSBAm-block-pNIPAm conjugate showed temperature dependent changes in
   substrate affinity and productivity when assayed from 0 to 40 degrees C.
   In addition, these conjugates showed higher stability to harsh
   conditions, including temperature, low pH, and protease degradation.
   Indeed, the PBPE-modified enzyme was active for over 8 h in the presence
   of a stomach protease at pH 1.0. Using PBPE, we created a dual zone
   shell surrounding each molecule of enzyme. The thickness of each zone of
   the shell was engineered to be separately responsive to temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In this brief, a new technique to measure the on-chip rise/fall delay of
   an individual gate is presented. In the proposed technique, the
   rise/fall gate delay is measured using the duty cycle of a
   reconfigurable ring oscillator (RRO). A set of linear equations is
   formed with the different configuration settings of the RRO, relating
   the rise/fall delay of all the gates in the path of the RRO to the
   positive/negative duty cycle of the undivided RRO. The high-frequency
   undivided RRO signal is needed for this type of measurement as it
   preserves the rise/fall delay of an individual gate. However, it is
   difficult to bring the high-frequency undivided RRO signal outside the
   chip due to the frequency limitation of the output pad. The
   high-frequency RRO signal is subsampled by a clock that is generated
   from an on-chip phase-locked loop to make it low frequency. The rise and
   fall delays of an individual gate can be calculated from the difference
   of the duty cycle of the subsampled RRO signal at two different
   configurations of the RRO. The proposed concept is validated in a test
   chip that is fabricated in an industrial 65-nm technology node.}},

Abstract = {{Any node in a wireless sensor network is a resource constrained device
   in terms of memory, bandwidth, and energy, which leads to a large number
   of packet drops, low throughput, and significant waste of energy due to
   retransmission. This paper presents a new approach for predicting
   congestion using a probabilistic method and controlling congestion using
   new rate control methods. The probabilistic approach used for prediction
   of the occurrence of congestion in a node is developed using data
   traffic and buffer occupancy. The rate control method uses a back-off
   selection scheme and also rate allocation schemes, namely rate
   regulation (RRG) and split protocol (SP), to improve throughput and
   reduce packet drop. A back-off interval selection scheme is introduced
   in combination with rate reduction (RR) and RRG. The back-off interval
   selection scheme considers channel state and collision-free transmission
   to prevent congestion. Simulations were conducted and the results were
   compared with those of decentralized predictive congestion control
   (DPCC) and adaptive duty-cycle based congestion control (ADCC). The
   results showed that the proposed method reduces congestion and improves
   performance.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we offer a set of algorithms that convert a voxellated
   image to a conformal surface mesh that is targeted for polycrystalline
   materials containing grains with a wide range of sizes and complex
   shapes. More specifically, we propose a simple but effective algorithm
   for approximating the grain boundary networks that are implicit in
   three-dimensional digital images of polycrystals. The algorithm segments
   a three-dimensional digital image of a polycrystalline microstructure
   and then smoothes an interpolated conformal surface mesh of the grain
   boundary network while maintaining certain characteristic features of
   the microstructure. It is found that the proposed algorithm successfully
   approximates the grain boundary network based only on the digital,
   voxellated images of the polycrystal. Simulated microstructures are used
   to verify that the resulting mesh qualitatively and quantitatively
   approximates the true structure, in terms of the displacement of the
   nodes, the grain volume change and the dihedral angle distribution along
   triple junctions after smoothing. The effect of the use of the cubic
   grid for mapping digital microstructures on the grain boundary
   approximation is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the problem of scheduling a task set tau of implicit-deadline
   sporadic tasks to meet all deadlines on a t-type heterogeneous
   multiprocessor platform where tasks may access multiple shared
   resources. The multiprocessor platform has m (k) processors of type-k,
   where ka\{1,2,aEuro broken vertical bar,t\}. The execution time of a
   task depends on the type of processor on which it executes. The set of
   shared resources is denoted by R. For each task tau (i) , there is a
   resource set R (i) aS dagger R such that for each job of tau (i) ,
   during one phase of its execution, the job requests to hold the resource
   set R (i) exclusively with the interpretation that (i) the job makes a
   single request to hold all the resources in the resource set R (i) and
   (ii) at all times, when a job of tau (i) holds R (i) , no other job
   holds any resource in R (i) . Each job of task tau (i) may request the
   resource set R (i) at most once during its execution. A job is allowed
   to migrate when it requests a resource set and when it releases the
   resource set but a job is not allowed to migrate at other times. Our
   goal is to design a scheduling algorithm for this problem and prove its
   performance.
   We propose an algorithm, LP-EE-vpr, which offers the guarantee that if
   an implicit-deadline sporadic task set is schedulable on a t-type
   heterogeneous multiprocessor platform by an optimal scheduling algorithm
   that allows a job to migrate only when it requests or releases a
   resource set, then our algorithm also meets the deadlines with the same
   restriction on job migration, if given processors times as fast. (Here
   and |P| are computed based on the resource sets that tasks request.) For
   the special case that each task requests at most one resource, the bound
   of LP-EE-vpr collapses to . To the best of our knowledge, LP-EE-vpr is
   the first algorithm with proven performance guarantee for real-time
   scheduling of sporadic tasks with resource sharing on t-type
   heterogeneous multiprocessors.}},

   enhancement to the classical discrete stochastic dynamic programming

   decision variables via linear programming at each state. Simple
   stochastic process models are built from real data and used to simulate
   the implementation of the proposed method. The proposed method is shown

   considers the effects of volume fraction (hematocrit) and influence of
   shear rate upon viscosity. The other component, plasma, is assumed to
   behave as a linear viscous fluid. A CFD solver based on OpenFOAM (R) was
   developed and employed to simulate a specific problem, namely blood flow
   in a two dimensional micro-channel, is studied. Finally to better
   understand this two-component flow system and the effects of the
   different parameters, the equations are made dimensionless and a
   parametric study is performed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology and code for 3-D radiation of nongray gases mixtures
   containing gray anisotropically scattering particles is developed.
   Radiative transfer equation (RTE) is solved by finite volume method
   (FVM) coupled with Smith's weighted sum of gray gases model (WSGGM) with
   5 gray gases, but any other gas radiative properties model can be
   incorporated. Evaluation of scattering phase function (SPF) and analysis
   of anisotropically scattering particles were performed by Mie Theory
   (MT). Missing benchmark, another new 3-D model and code, which solve
   same problems, based on a combination of Zone Method (ZM) and Monte
   Carlo method (MC) is developed. In this method the same WSGGM and MT, as
   in previous methodology, is incorporated. Physical and mathematical
   concepts of both models are presented. To author's best knowledge these
   methodologies were not developed before. Series of predictions for the
   mixtures of real gases as carbon dioxide, water vapor and nitrogen
   containing various types of particles for non-uniform temperature field
   were performed by both methods in order to be compared. Agreement
   between the predictions of these two different numerical methods is very
   good. Model developed is sufficiently accurate and convenient for
   engineering calculations as well as for incorporation in computational
   fluid dynamics codes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle is a scalable actuator system used throughout nature
   from the millimeter to meter length scales and over a wide range of
   frequencies and force regimes. This adaptability has spurred interest in
   using engineered skeletal muscle to power soft robotics devices and in
   biotechnology and medical applications. However, the challenges to doing
   this are similar to those facing the tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine fields; specifically, how do we translate our understanding of
   myogenesis in vivo to the engineering of muscle constructs in vitro to
   achieve functional integration with devices. To do this researchers are
   developing a number of ways to engineer the cellular microenvironment to
   guide skeletal muscle tissue formation. This includes understanding the
   role of substrate stiffness and the mechanical environment, engineering
   the spatial organization of biochemical and physical cues to guide
   muscle alignment, and developing bioreactors for mechanical and
   electrical conditioning. Examples of engineered skeletal muscle that can
   potentially be used in soft robotics include 2D cantilever-based
   skeletal muscle actuators and 3D skeletal muscle tissues engineered
   using scaffolds or directed self-organization. Integration into devices
   has led to basic muscle-powered devices such as grippers and pumps as
   well as more sophisticated muscle-powered soft robots that walk and
   swim. Looking forward, current, and future challenges include
   identifying the best source of muscle precursor cells to expand and
   differentiate into myotubes, replacing cardiomyocytes with skeletal
   muscle tissue as the bio-actuator of choice for soft robots, and
   vascularization and innervation to enable control and nourishment of
   larger muscle tissue constructs. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Multiview face recognition has become an active research area in the
   last few years. In this paper, we present an approach for video-based
   face recognition in camera networks. Our goal is to handle pose
   variations by exploiting the redundancy in the multiview video data.
   However, unlike traditional approaches that explicitly estimate the pose
   of the face, we propose a novel feature for robust face recognition in
   the presence of diffuse lighting and pose variations. The proposed
   feature is developed using the spherical harmonic representation of the
   face texture-mapped onto a sphere; the texture map itself is generated
   by back-projecting the multiview video data. Video plays an important
   role in this scenario. First, it provides an automatic and efficient way
   for feature extraction. Second, the data redundancy renders the
   recognition algorithm more robust. We measure the similarity between
   feature sets from different videos using the reproducing kernel Hilbert
   space. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional
   algorithms on a multiview video database.}},

Abstract = {{As I mentioned in my editorial, soft robotics is a highly collaborative
   field that relies on successful innovation in very diverse fields. Even
   the construction of a simple modest device might involve research
   spanning materials science, control theory, sensing, energy storage,
   flexible electronics, and a host of breakthroughs in more than one of
   these fields. Most researchers I know are fully engaged in the
   advancements within their own field and often lack the opportunity to
   discuss their projects and their project needs with experts in other
   disciplines. It is also a challenge for researchers with different
   backgrounds to communicate effectively and to be aware of new
   developments in distantly related technologies. A goal of Soft Robotics
   is to bridge such communication gaps and to share these collaborative
   discussions with you.
   To those ends, I have asked each of the following experts to comment on
   the state of their particular field: Randy H. Ewoldt, Design of
   Rheologically Complex Materials; Hod Lipson, Evolutionary Robotics;
   Mirko Kovac, Biomimetic Robots; Mohsen Shahinpoor, Soft Actuators;

   material whose plasma frequency can be tuned into the infrared range by
   modifying the dopant concentration. Thus, doped Si can serve as a
   ``tunable metal{''} which can be used to design tunable metamaterials to
   control near field thermal radiation. In this paper, we study near field
   radiative heat transfer for two doped Si based metamaterials: Si

Abstract = {{The effect of filler addition on the grain coarsening characteristics of
   block copolymer materials is analyzed for the particular case of a
   lamellar poly(styrene-b-isoprene)-type block copolymer and polystyrene
   as well as polystyrene-grafted nanoparticle fillers. Filler addition is
   shown to reduce the rate of grain growth and to induce grain size
   distributions that deviate from the log-normal type that is
   characteristic for pristine block copolymer systems. The retardation of
   grain growth is shown to be associated with the segregation of filler
   additives into high energy grain boundary defects-a process that bears
   similarities to the segregation of impurity atoms within grain boundary
   structures in ceramics or metals. The analysis of grain boundary energy,
   grain size distribution, and grain coarsening kinetics suggests two
   major mechanisms for the interference of filler additives with grain
   coarsening: First, the segregation of fillers into boundary regions
   lowers the relative grain boundary energy and hence the driving pressure
   for grain growth. Second, the formation of particle aggregates along
   grain boundaries gives rise to a ``pinning pressure{''} that counteracts
   grain growth and that limits the ultimate grain size during thermal
   annealing. This is in contrast to pristine block copolymer systems in
   which continuous grain growth is observed during thermal annealing. The
   results highlight the fundamental differences between structure
   evolution in pristine and mixed block copolymer systems and suggest that
   thermal annealing (in the absence of structure-guiding fields) is an
   inefficient path to facilitate the controlled growth of large grains in
   athermal block copolymer blend materials.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites based on synthetic polymers grafted from kraft lignin
   with average particle size of 5 nm were synthesized using atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP). Lignin macroinitiators were prepared, and
   polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) were polymerized with target
   degree of polymerization of 450 resulting in materials having lignin
   mass fractions of 4.5\%, 8.3\%, and 22.1\% for the poly(methyl
   methacrylate) samples and 3.2\%, 7.1\%, and 19.6\% for the polystyrene
   samples. Tensile testing showed a decreased modulus but enhanced
   toughness of all nanocomposites compared to homopolymers, and the
   poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted samples had nearly twice the ultimate
   elongation as the polystyrene grafts at high graft density. Both types
   of grafted nanocomposites had toughness values that were greater than
   10-times that of the corresponding kraft-lignin/polymer blend system,
   indicating the potential of ATRP as the basis for the `one component'
   composite approach towards more sustainable polymeric materials.
   Dynamical mechanical analysis was used to measure softening
   temperatures, and both the polystyrene-grafted and poly(methyl
   methacrylate)-grafted nanocomposites had a peak in the loss modulus that
   was higher than the corresponding homopolymer, consistent with strong
   polymer lignin interactions. Lignin grafted with thermoplastic polymers
   could be an important material based on an inexpensive, renewable
   feedstock that offers unique mechanical properties compared with many
   other nanocomposites based on inorganic nanoparticles. Our results
   indicate that ATRP is well suited for preparing lignin-based
   thermoplastics and could be the basis for hybrid materials that make
   effective use of this important renewable resource. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Controlling Magnetotactic Bacteria through an Integrated Nanofabricated
   Metallic Island and Optical Microscope Approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Herein, we demonstrate the control of magnetotactic bacteria through the
   application of magnetic field gradients with real-time visualization. We
   accomplish this control by integrating a pair of macroscale Helmholtz
   coils and lithographically fabricated nanoscale islands composed of
   permalloy (Ni80Fe20). This system enabled us to guide and steer
   amphitrichous Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 to specific
   location via magnetic islands. The geometries of the islands allowed us
   to have control over the specific magnetic field gradients on the
   bacteria. We estimate that magnetotactic bacteria located less than 1 mu
   m from the edge of a diamond shaped island experience a maximum force of
   approximately 34 pN, which engages the bacteria without trapping them.
   Our system could be useful for a variety of applications including
   magnetic fabrication, self-assembly, and probing the sensing apparatus
   of magnetotactic bacteria.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{259}},
Pages = {{396-411}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Software architectures capture early design decisions about a system in
   order to fulfill relevant quality attributes. When moving to detailed
   design levels, the same architecture can accept many different
   object-oriented implementations. A common problem here is the mismatches
   between the quality-attribute levels prescribed by the architecture and
   those realized by its object-oriented materialization. A significant
   step towards reducing those mismatches is the provision of tool support
   for assisting developers in the materialization of software
   architectures. Prerequisites to develop materialization tools are the
   organization of a body of design knowledge and the definition of
   quality-driven reasoning procedures. Since materialization activities
   are mainly driven by past developers' experiences, we propose a
   Case-based Reasoning (CBR) approach that, through the codification of
   design experiences, permits to establish links between software
   architecture structures and object-oriented counterparts. This approach
   is supported by an Eclipse-based tool, called SAME (Software
   Architecture Materialization Environment), which is a reuse-oriented
   assistant to the developer. SAME is able to recall and adapt successful
   architecture materializations for particular quality attributes, in
   order to help the developer to derive an appropriate object-oriented
   design for his/her architecture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents in-situ spatiotemporal measurements of the
   electrolyte phase potential within an electric double layer capacitor
   (EDLC) negative electrode as envisaged for use in an aqueous hybrid
   battery for grid-scale energy storage. The ultra-thick electrodes used
   in these batteries to reduce nonfunctional material costs require
   sufficiently fast through-plane mass and charge transport to attain
   suitable charging and discharging rates. To better evaluate the
   through-plane transport, we have developed an electrode scaffold (ES)
   for making in situ electrolyte potential distribution measurements at
   discrete known distances across the thickness of an uninterrupted EDLC
   negative electrode. Using finite difference methods, we calculate local
   current, volumetric charging current and charge storage distributions
   from the spatiotemporal electrolyte potential measurements. These
   potential distributions provide insight into complex phenomena that
   cannot be directly observed using other existing methods. Herein, we use
   the distributions to identify areas of the electrode that are
   underutilized, assess the effects of various parameters on the
   cumulative charge storage distribution, and evaluate an effectiveness
   factor for charge storage in EDLC electrodes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{The Double Absorbing Boundary method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{259}},
Pages = {{220-241}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{A new approach is devised for solving wave problems in unbounded
   domains. It has common features to each of two types of existing
   techniques: local high-order Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC) and
   Perfectly Matched Layers (PML). However, it is different from both and
   enjoys relative advantages with respect to both. The new method, called
   the Double Absorbing Boundary (DAB) method, is based on truncating the
   unbounded domain to produce a finite computational domain Omega, and on
   applying a local high-order ABC on two parallel artificial boundaries,
   which are a small distance apart, and thus form a thin non-reflecting
   layer. Auxiliary variables are defined on the two boundaries and inside
   the layer bounded by them, and participate in the numerical scheme. The
   DAB method is first introduced in general terms, using the 2D scalar
   time-dependent wave equation as a model. Then it is applied to the 1D
   Klein-Gordon equation, using finite difference discretization in space
   and time, and to the 2D wave equation in a wave guide, using finite
   element discretization in space and dissipative time stepping. The
   computational aspects of the method are discussed, and numerical
   experiments demonstrate its performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

   divided wall columns with a single wall. The model is based on the use
   of two superstructure levels. In the upper level a superstructure that
   includes all the basic sequences of separation tasks is postulated. The
   lower level is an extended tree that explicitly includes different
   thermal states and compositions of the feed to a given separation task.
   In that way, it is possible to a priori optimize all the possible
   separation tasks involved in the superstructure. A set of logical
   relationships relates the feasible sequences with the optimized tasks in
   the extended tree resulting in a MILP to select the optimal sequence.
   The performance of the model in terms of robustness and computational
   time is illustrated with several examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this work, we apply a decomposition technique to address the
   multiperiod heat exchanger network synthesis. Each period corresponds to
   changes in operating conditions, i.e. inlet temperatures and heat
   capacity flowrates. The problem size grows quickly with the number of
   streams and the number of periods resulting in a large scale problem to
   solve. In order to reduce the problem to a manageable size, we propose a
   specialized heuristic algorithm that relies on the concept of Lagrangean
   decomposition. We present an iterative scheme where feasible solutions
   are postulated from the Lagrangean decomposition subproblems, and the
   Lagrangean multipliers are updated through a subgradient method.
   Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach and the
   solutions are compared with the full space solutions with no
   decomposition. In general, slightly better solutions are found but in
   the terms of computational effort, its use is only justified as the
   problem size is increased. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study estimates the life cycle water consumption and wastewater
   generation impacts of a Marcellus shale gas well from its construction
   to end of life. Direct water consumption at the well site was assessed
   by analysis of data from approximately 500 individual well completion
   reports collected in 2010 by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation
   and Natural Resources. Indirect water consumption for supply chain
   production at each life cycle stage of the well was estimated using the
   economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) method. Life cycle
   direct and indirect water quality pollution impacts were assessed and
   compared using the tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and
   other environmental impacts (TRACI). Wastewater treatment cost was
   proposed as an additional indicator for water quality pollution impacts
   from shale gas well wastewater. Four water management scenarios for
   Marcellus shale well wastewater were assessed: current conditions in
   Pennsylvania; complete discharge; direct reuse and desalination; and
   complete desalination. The results show that under the current
   conditions, an average Marcellus shale gas well consumes 20 000 m(3)
   (with a range from 6700 to 33 000 m(3)) of freshwater per well over its
   life cycle excluding final gas utilization, with 65\% direct water
   consumption at the well site and 35\% indirect water consumption across
   the supply chain production. If all flowback and produced water is
   released into the environment without treatment, direct wastewater from
   a Marcellus shale gas well is estimated to have 300-3000 kg N-eq
   eutrophication potential, 900-23 000 kg 2,4D-eq freshwater ecotoxicity
   potential, 0-370 kg benzene-eq carcinogenic potential, and 2800-71 000
   MT toluene-eq noncarcinogenic potential. The potential toxicity of the
   chemicals in the wastewater from the well site exceeds those associated
   with supply chain production, except for carcinogenic effects. If all
   the Marcellus shale well wastewater is treated to surface discharge
   standards by desalination, \$59 000-270 000 per well would be required.
   The life cycle study results indicate that when gas end use is not
   considered hydraulic fracturing is the largest contributor to the life
   cycle water impacts of a Marcellus shale gas well.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional wireless position-location systems, operating using
   propagating waves, suffer reduced performance in non-line-of-sight
   (NLoS) applications. Traditional systems that use quasistatic fields
   have instead been limited to short ranges, progressive direction-finding
   applications, require RF fingerprinting, or do not provide complete
   immunity to dielectric obstacles (use of electric fields). These
   limitations impose severe restrictions in applications such as tracking
   an American football during game play, where position and orientation
   tracking may be required over long ranges, and when the line-of-sight
   (LoS) is blocked by groups of people. A technique using
   magneto-quasistatic fields and complex image theory was recently shown
   to circumvent these problems, and to enable accurate long-range
   one-dimensional and two-dimensional measurements. In this work, we
   present three-dimensional position and orientation measurements using
   the magneto- quasistatic system and complex image theory over an area of
   27.43 m x 27.43 m. Inverting the theoretical expression for the voltage
   measured at the terminals of the receiving loops to determine three-
   dimensional position and orientation resulted in mean and median
   geometric position errors of 0.77 m and 0.71 m, respectively;
   inclination orientation mean and median errors of 9.67 degrees and 8.24
   degrees, respectively; and azimuthal orientation mean and median errors
   of 2.84 degrees and 2.25 degrees, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil fuels comprise 93\% of Malaysia's electricity generation and
   account for 36\% of the country's 2010 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.
   The government has targeted the installation of 330 MW of biomass
   electricity generation capacity by 2015 to avoid 1.3 Mt of CO2 emissions
   annually and offset some emissions due to increased coal use. One
   biomass option is to co-fire with coal, which can result in reduced GHG
   emissions, coal use, and costs of electricity. A linear optimization
   cost model was developed using seven types of biomass residues for
   Peninsular Malaysia. Results suggest that about 12 Mt/year of residues
   are available annually, of which oil-palm residues contribute 77\%, and
   rice and logging residues comprise 17\%. While minimizing the cost of
   biomass and biomass residue transport, co-firing at four existing coal
   plants in Peninsular Malaysia could meet the 330 MW biomass electricity
   target and reduce costs by about \$24 million per year compared to coal
   use alone and reduces GHG emissions by 1.9 Mt of CO2. Maximizing
   emissions reduction for biomass co-firing results in 17 Mt of CO2
   reductions at a cost of \$ 23/t of CO2 reduced.}},

Title = {{Impact of Tertiary Treatment Processes on the Effectiveness of
   Chloramination for Biological Growth Control in Recirculating Cooling
   Systems Using Treated Municipal Wastewater}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Adequate biocide addition is the key to control biological
   growth-related problems in recirculating cooling systems of
   thermoelectric power plants. The use of monochloramine (MCA) as the
   primary biocide is as effective as the use of free-chlorine in cooling
   systems using secondary-treated municipal wastewater (MWW) as the sole
   makeup water source. However, severe scaling caused by the secondary
   effluent necessitates incorporation of an additional treatment of
   secondary effluent (i.e.,tertiary treatment) prior to use as makeup
   water for recirculating cooling systems. In the research reported in
   this paper, the effectiveness of MCA as a cooling-system biocide was
   evaluated for three types of tertiary-treated MWW, as follows:
   (1)acidification, (2)nitrification and sand filtration, and
   (3)nitrification, sand filtration, and granular activated-carbon
   adsorption. The impact of these tertiary treatment processes on
   chloramination was studied in both laboratory and pilot-scale
   experiments. For the third type of MWW treatment, reducing the total
   organic carbon (TOC) content in MWW exerted a 37\% decrease in
   biological growth potential but less than a 5\% decrease in biological
   growth rate. A MCA residual of 2-3mg/L was required to achieve
   biological-growth control objectives with respect to planktonic and
   sessile heterotrophic bacteria in cooling systems regardless of the
   tertiary treatment employed. Legionella analyses indicated that
   chloramination was effective in controlling proliferation of these
   species for all tertiary-treated wastewaters. Overall, preformed MCA was
   effective as a primary biocide in all tertiary-treated MWW evaluated in
   the research reported in this paper. Nitrification followed by sand
   filtration was the optimal tertiary treatment among the three
   investigated MWW because the biological-control objectives could be
   achieved with lower doses. The use of granular activated-carbon
   adsorption revealed no additional benefit compared to nitrification and
   sand filtration.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications leading to diabetic
   retinopathy (DR) are soon to become one of the 21st century's major
   health problems. This represents a huge financial burden to healthcare
   officials and governments. To combat this approaching epidemic, this
   paper proposes a noninvasive method to detect DM and nonproliferative
   diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), the initial stage of DR based on three
   groups of features extracted from tongue images. They include color,
   texture, and geometry. A noninvasive capture device with image
   correction first captures the tongue images. A tongue color gamut is
   established with 12 colors representing the tongue color features. The
   texture values of eight blocks strategically located on the tongue
   surface, with the additional mean of all eight blocks are used to
   characterize the nine tongue texture features. Finally, 13 features
   extracted from tongue images based on measurements, distances, areas,
   and their ratios represent the geometry features. Applying a combination
   of the 34 features, the proposed method can separate Healthy/DM tongues
   as well as NPDR/DM-sans NPDR (DM samples without NPDR) tongues using
   features from each of the three groups with average accuracies of
   80.52\% and 80.33\%, respectively. This is on a database consisting of
   130 Healthy and 296 DM samples, where 29 of those in DM are NPDR.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{93-103}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we propose the optimization of a flowsheet for the
   production of i-butene from switchgrass. A superstructure embedding a
   number of alternatives is proposed. Two technologies are considered for
   switchgrass pretreatment, dilute acid and ammonia fiber explosion (APEX)
   so that the structure of the grass is broken down. Surface response
   models are used to predict the yield. Next, enzymatic hydrolysis follows
   any of the pretreatments to obtain fermentable sugars, mainly xylose and
   glucose. i-Butene is obtained by fermentation of the sugars. Next it is
   separated mainly from CO2 for which PSA or membrane separation are
   considered. However, xylose cannot be easily converted, and thus we also
   evaluate the possibility of using it to produce ethanol. The problem is
   formulated as an MINLP with simultaneous optimization and heat
   integration. Finally, an economic evaluation is performed. The most
   promising process involves the use of dilute acid pretreatment and
   membrane purification of the i-butene. However, the decision related to
   the production of i-butene alone or the simultaneous production of
   i-butene and ethanol depends on the prices for ethanol and for
   switchgrass. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle loads play an important role in fatigue deterioration and
   overload collapses of bridges. In this paper, a novel de-correlated
   tail-based extreme value (EV) distribution model of vehicle load is
   proposed. The monitored data show that occurrences of vehicle loads are
   correlated. Additionally, it is more reasonable to employ the tail
   region of a distribution when estimating extreme loads. Moreover, a
   Bayesian form of this new model is constructed, and an extension of this
   model, the Confidence Index (Cl), is defined and may be promising for
   applications. The monitored vehicle weight on the Nanjing 3rd Yangtze
   River Bridge is used to demonstrate that the proposed tail-based
   de-correlated EV model predicts the extreme load more accurately than
   traditional methods and that the Bayesian approach can further increase
   the precision of this estimate. Finally, the calculated CI of the
   complete prediction process offers a comprehensive guideline for the
   estimate precision. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Restoration of optimal ellipsoid left ventricular geometry: lessons

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Several issues that are inherent in the surgical techniques of surgical
   ventricular restoration (SVR) need specialized devices or techniques to
   overcome them, which may not always result in optimal outcomes. We used
   a non-invasive novel in silico modelling technique to study left
   ventricular (LV) morphology and function before and after SVR. The
   cardiac magnetic resonance imaging derived actual pre- and postoperative
   endocardial morphology and function was compared with the in silico
   analysis of the same.
   Cardiac magnetic resonance steady state free precession (SSFP) cine
   images were employed to segment endocardial surface contours over the
   cardiac cycle. Using the principle of Hausdorff distance to examine
   phase-to-phase regional endocardial displacement, dyskinetic/akinetic
   areas were identified at the instant of peak basal contraction velocity.
   Using a three-dimensional (3D) surface clipping tool, the maximally
   scarred, dyskinetic or akinetic LV antero-apical areas were virtually
   resected and a new apex was created. A virtual rectangular patch was
   created upon the clipped surface LV model by 3D Delaunay triangulation.
   Presurgical endocardial mechanical function quantified from cine cardiac
   magnetic resonance, using a technique of spherical harmonics (SPHARM)
   surface parameterization, was applied onto the virtually clipped and
   patched LV surface model. Finally, the in silico model of post-SVR LV
   shape was analysed for quantification of regional left ventricular
   volumes (RLVVs) and function. This was tested in 2 patients with
   post-myocardial infarction antero-apical LV aneuryms. Left ventricular
   mechanical dysynchrony was evaluated by RLVV analysis of pre-SVR, in
   silico post-SVR and actual post-SVR LV endocardial surface data.
   Following exclusion of the scarred areas, the virtual resected LV model
   demonstrated significantly lesser areas of akinesia. The decreases in
   regional LV volumes in the in silico modelling were significant and
   comparable with the actual decreases following SVR. Both the regional
   end diastolic volume (EDV) and end systolic volume (ESV) at the apex
   decreased significantly corresponding to greater reductions in apical
   volumes by the technique of rectangular patch plasty (apical EDV 2.1607
   +/- 0.20577 to 0.4774 +/- 0.1775 ml, P = 0.007; apical ESV 1.9708 +/-
   0.36451 to 0.442 +/- 0.047 ml, P = 0.013).
   This pilot study was done using novel in silico techniques for virtual
   surgical modelling, which helped in accurate estimation and planning of
   optimal LV restoration by SVR.}},

Abstract = {{Hematologic disorders arising from infectious diseases, hereditary
   factors and environmental influences can lead to, and can be influenced
   by, significant changes in the shape, mechanical and physical properties
   of red blood cells (RBCs), and the biorheology of blood flow. Hence,
   modeling of hematologic disorders should take into account the
   multiphase nature of blood flow, especially in arterioles and
   capillaries. We present here an overview of a general computational
   framework based on dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) which has broad
   applicability in cell biophysics with implications for diagnostics,
   therapeutics and drug efficacy assessments for a wide variety of human
   diseases. This computational approach, validated by independent
   experimental results, is capable of modeling the biorheology of whole
   blood and its individual components during blood flow so as to
   investigate cell mechanistic processes in health and disease. DPD is a
   Lagrangian method that can be derived from systematic coarse-graining of
   molecular dynamics but can scale efficiently up to arterioles and can
   also be used to model RBCs down to the spectrin level. We start from
   experimental measurements of a single RBC to extract the relevant
   biophysical parameters, using single-cell measurements involving such
   methods as optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy and micropipette
   aspiration, and cell-population experiments involving microfluidic
   devices. We then use these validated RBC models to predict the
   biorheological behavior of whole blood in healthy or pathological
   states, and compare the simulations with experimental results involving
   apparent viscosity and other relevant parameters. While the approach
   discussed here is sufficiently general to address a broad spectrum of
   hematologic disorders including certain types of cancer, this paper
   specifically deals with results obtained using this computational
   framework for blood flow in malaria and sickle cell anemia.}},

   practical value. We present algorithms for JBSS and describe an
   implemented system based on these algorithms. We achieve up to 600\% of
   the throughput of TDMA with a mean of 234\% in our experiments. The
   decomposition approach leads to a working distributed protocol producing
   optimal solutions in an amount of time that is at worst linear in the
   size of the input. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
   actually implemented wireless scheduling system based on dual
   decomposition. We identify and briefly address some of the challenges
   that arise in taking such a system from theory to reality.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed optimization in random networks where N nodes
   cooperatively minimize the sum Sigma(N)(i=1) fi(x) of their individual
   convex costs. Existing literature proposes distributed gradient-like
   methods that are computationally cheap and resilient to link failures,
   but have slow convergence rates. In this paper, we propose accelerated
   distributed gradient methods that 1) are resilient to link failures; 2)
   computationally cheap; and 3) improve convergence rates over other
   gradient methods. We model the network by a sequence of independent,
   identically distributed random matrices \{W(k)\} drawn from the set of
   symmetric, stochastic matrices with positive diagonals. The network is
   connected on average and the cost functions are convex, differentiable,
   with Lipschitz continuous and bounded gradients. We design two
   distributed Nesterov-like gradient methods that modify the D-NG and D-NC
   methods that we proposed for static networks. We prove their convergence
   rates in terms of the expected optimality gap at the cost function. Let
   k and K be the number of per-node gradient evaluations and per-node
   communications, respectively. Then the modified D-NG achieves rates
   O(log k/k) and O(log K/K), and, and the modified D-NC rates O(1/k(2))
   and O(1/K2-xi), where xi > 0 is arbitrarily small. For comparison, the
   standard distributed gradient method cannot do better than
   Omega(1/k(2/3)) and Omega(1/K-2/3), on the same class of cost functions
   (even for static networks). Simulation examples illustrate our
   analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Memory reservations are used to provide real-time tasks with guaranteed
   memory access to a specified amount of physical memory. However,
   previous work on memory reservation primarily focused on private pages,
   and did not pay attention to shared pages, which are widely used in
   current operating systems. With previous schemes, a real-time task may
   experience unexpected timing delays from other tasks through shared
   pages that are shared by another process, even though the task has
   enough free pages in its own reservation. In this paper, we first
   describe the problems that arise when real-time tasks share pages. We
   then propose a shared-page management framework which enhances the
   temporal isolation provided by memory reservations in resource kernels
   that use the resource reservation approach. Our proposed solution
   consists of two schemes, Shared-Page Conservation (SPC) and Shared-Page
   Eviction Lock (SPEL), each of which prevents timing penalties caused by
   the seemingly arbitrary eviction of shared pages. The framework can
   manage shared data for inter-process communication and shared libraries,
   as well as pages shared by the kernel's copy-on-write technique and file
   caches. We have implemented and evaluated our schemes on the Linux/RK
   platform, but it can also be applied to other operating systems with
   paged virtual memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effects of providing broadband to schools on

   for unobserved time-varying effects, we show that high levels of
   broadband use in schools were detrimental for grades on the ninth-grade
   national exams in Portugal. For the average broadband use in schools,
   grades reduced 0.78 of a standard deviation from 2005 to 2009. We also
   show that broadband has a negative impact on exam scores regardless of
   gender, subject, or school quality and that the way schools allow
   students to use the Internet affects their performance. In particular,
   students in schools that block access to websites such as YouTube

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and experimentally validates a method for driving
   flapping wings at large wing strokes and high frequencies with a DC
   motor, based on direct, elastic transmission. The DC motor undergoes
   reciprocating, rather than rotary, motion avoiding the use of nonlinear
   transmissions such as slider-crank mechanisms. This is key to compact,
   easy to fabricate, power efficient, and controllable flapping
   mechanisms. First, an appropriate motor based on maximum power transfer
   arguments is selected. Then, a flapping mechanism is prototyped and its
   experimental performance is compared with simulations, which take into
   account the full dynamics of the system. Despite inherent nonlinearities
   due to the aerodynamic damping, the linearity of the direct, elastic
   transmission allows one to fully exploit resonance. This benefit is best
   captured by the dynamic efficiency, close to 90\% at larger wing strokes
   in both experimental data and simulations. We finally show a compact
   flapping mechanism implementation with independent flapping motion
   control for the two wings, which could be used for future autonomous
   micro-aerial vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{A transmission-electron-microscope-based orientation mapping technique
   that makes use of beam precession to achieve near-kinematical conditions
   was used to map the phase and crystal orientations in nanolamellar Cu/Nb
   composites with average layer thicknesses of 86, 30 and 18 nm. Maps of
   high quality and reliability were obtained by comparing the recorded
   diffraction patterns with pre-calculated templates. Particular care was
   taken in optimizing the dewarping parameters and in calibrating the
   frames of reference. Layers with thicknesses as low as 4 nm were
   successfully mapped. Heterophase interface plane and character
   distributions (HIPD and HICD, respectively) of Cu and Nb phases from the
   samples were determined from the orientation maps. In addition, local
   orientation relation stereograms of the Cu/Nb interfaces were
   calculated, and these revealed the detailed layer-to-layer texture
   information. The results are in agreement with previously reported
   neutron-diffraction-based and precession-electron-diffraction-based
   measurements on an accumulated roll bonding (ARB)-fabricated Cu/Nb

   The characteristic length of the robot body is less than 1 mm.
   Experimental characterization of swimming of the robot shows that
   swimming speed can be linearly improved solely by increasing the number
   of attached flagella, suggesting a new way for speed enhancement besides
   flagellum geometry optimization. In addition, a numerical model modified
   from the single, straight flexible flagellum case is further established
   to study propulsive force generation by nonstraight, flexible flagellum.
   A robot with multiple, sinusoidal flagella design is fabricated to
   demonstrate the capability of the proposed two- step photolithography-
   based microfabrication method to handle more complex flagella designs,
   which may enhance swimming performance.}},

Abstract = {{A medium-carbon low-alloy steel was prepared with initial structures of
   either martensite or bainite. For both initial structures, warm
   caliber-rolling was conducted at 773 K (500 degrees C) to obtain
   ultrafine elongated grain (UFEG) structures with strong < 110 >//rolling
   direction (RD) fiber deformation textures. The UFEG structures consisted
   of spheroidal cementite particles distributed uniformly in a ferrite
   matrix of a transverse grain size of about 331 and 311 nm in samples
   with initial martensite and bainite structures, respectively. For both
   initial structures, the UFEG materials had similar tensile properties,
   upper shelf energy (145 J), and ductile-to-brittle transition
   temperatures 98 K (500 degrees C). Obtaining the martensitic structure
   requires more rapid cooling than is needed to obtain the bainitic
   structure and this more rapid cooling promote cracking. As the UFEG
   structures obtained from initial martensitic and bainitic structures
   have almost identical properties, but obtaining the bainitic structure
   does not require a rapid cooling which promotes cracking suggests the
   use of a bainitic structure in obtaining UFEG structures should be
   examined further. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{The evolution of dislocation densities and of dislocation
   microstructures during cyclic loading of AISI 316L is systematically
   evaluated. In addition, internal stresses are also measured for every
   cycle and comprehensively analyzed. These observations are made in order
   to establish relationships between the evolution of dislocation
   condition and internal stresses, and ultimately to obtain a thorough
   insight into the complex cyclic response of AISI 316L. Moreover, the
   dependencies of established relationships on the variation of
   temperature and strain amplitude are investigated. The back stresses
   (long-range stresses associated with the presence of collective
   dislocations over different length scales) are mainly responsible for
   the cyclic deformation response at high strain amplitudes where
   dislocations tend to move more quickly in a wavy manner. In contrast,
   the effective stress, coupling with short-range dislocation
   interactions, plays an insignificant role on the material cyclic
   response for wavy slip conditions, but increasingly becomes more
   important for planar slip conditions. The additionally strong
   short-range interactions between dislocations and point defects
   (initially with solute atoms and later in life with corduroy structure)
   at 573 K (300 degrees C) cause dislocations to move in more planar ways,
   resulting in a significant increase in effective stress, leading to
   their influential role on the material cyclic response. (C) The

Abstract = {{Leakage of injected carbon dioxide (CO2) or resident fluids, such as
   brine, is a major concern associated with the injection of large volumes
   of CO2 into deep saline formations. Migration of brine could contaminate
   drinking water resources by increasing their salinity or endanger
   vegetation and animal life as well as human health. The main objective
   of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium chloride (NaCl)
   concentration on the detection of calcium and potassium in brine samples
   using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The ultimate goals
   were to determine the suitability of the LIBS technique for in situ
   measurements of metal ion concentrations in NaCl-rich solution and to
   develop a chemical sensor that can provide the early detection of brine
   intrusion into formations used for domestic or agricultural water
   production. Several brine samples of NaCl-CaCl2 and NaCl-KCl were
   prepared at NaCl concentrations between 0.0 and 3.0 M. The effect of
   NaCl concentration on the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for calcium (422.67 nm) and potassium
   (769.49 nm) emission lines was evaluated. Results show that, for a delay
   time of 300 ns and a gate width of 3 mu s, the presence of and changes
   in NaCl concentration significantly affect the SBR and SNR for both
   emission lines. An increase in NaCl concentration from 0.0 to 3.0 M
   produced an increase in the SNR, whereas the SBR dropped continuously.
   The detection limits obtained for both elements were in the milligrams
   per liter range, suggesting that a NaCl-rich solution does not severely
   limit the ability of LIBS to detect trace amount of metal ions.}},

Abstract = {{The dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on Pt(111) is known to be
   coverage dependent. Simple Redhead analysis of temperature programmed
   desorption (TPD) experiments that assumes a coverage independent
   desorption barrier can lead to errors in estimated properties such as
   desorption barriers and adsorption energies. A simple correction is to
   assume a linear coverage dependence of the desorption barrier, but there
   is usually no formal justification given for that functional form. More
   advanced TPD analysis methods that are suitable for determining coverage
   dependent adsorption parameters are limited by their need for large
   amounts of high quality, low noise data. We present a method to estimate
   the functional form of the coverage dependent desorption barrier from
   density functional theory calculations for use in analysis of TPD
   spectra. Density functional theory was employed to calculate the
   coverage dependence of the adsorption energy. Simulated TPD spectra were
   then produced by empirically scaling the DFT based adsorption energies
   utilizing the Bronstead-Evans-Polyani relationship between adsorption
   energies and desorption barriers. The resulting simulated spectra show
   better agreement with the experimental spectra than spectra predicted
   using barriers that are either coverage-independent or simply linearly
   dependent on coverage. The empirically derived scaling of the desorption
   barriers for Pt(111) is shown to be useful in predicting the low
   coverage desorption barriers for oxygen desorption from other metal
   surfaces, which showed reasonable agreement with the reported
   experimental values for those other metals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical procedure for the reachability analysis
   of systems with nonlinear, semi-explicit, index-1 differential-algebraic
   equations. The procedure computes reachable sets for uncertain initial
   states and inputs in an overapproximative way, i.e. it is guaranteed
   that all possible trajectories of the system are enclosed. Thus, the
   result can be used for formal verification of system properties that can
   be specified in the state space as unsafe or goal regions. Due to the
   representation of reachable sets by zonotopes and the use of highly
   scalable operations on them, the presented approach scales favorably
   with the number of state variables. This makes it possible to solve
   problems of industry-relevant size, as demonstrated by a transient
   stability analysis of the IEEE 14-bus benchmark problem for power

Abstract = {{Grain-boundary character distributions (GBCDs) were determined for spark
   plasma sintered Y- and La-doped aluminas prepared at temperatures
   between 1450 degrees C and 1600 degrees C. La doping leads to grain
   boundaries that adopt (0001) orientations 3.7 times more frequently than
   expected in a random distribution, whereas the Y-doped microstructures
   are more equiaxed. At 1500 degrees C, some of the boundaries in the
   Y-doped samples transform to a higher mobility complexion; in this
   microstructure, the \{01 (1) over bar2\} grain-boundary plane is 1.3
   times more likely to occur than expected in a random distribution. After
   the fast-growing grains impinge, the dominant plane becomes \{11 (2)
   over bar0\} and these boundaries have areas that are 1.2 times more
   likely to occur than expected in a random distribution. The
   grain-boundary planes in the Y- and La-codoped samples preferred (0001)
   and \{01 (1) over bar2>\} orientations, combining the characteristics of
   the singly doped samples. Grain boundaries with a 60 degrees
   misorientation about {[}0001] were up to six times more common than
   random in the Y-doped samples. The preference for (0001) oriented
   grain-boundary planes in the La-doped sample persisted at all specific

Abstract = {{Representing design decisions for complex software systems, tracing them
   to code, and enforcing them throughout the lifecycle are pressing
   concerns for software architects and developers. To be of practical use,
   specification and modeling languages for software design need to combine
   rigor with abstraction and simplicity, and be supported by automated
   design verification tools that require minimal human intervention. This
   paper examines closely the use of the visual language of Codecharts for
   representing design decisions and demonstrate the process of verifying
   the conformance of a program to the chart. We explicate the abstract
   semantics of segments of the Java package java.awt as a finite
   structures, specify the Composite design pattern as a Codechart and
   unpack it as a set of formulas, and prove that the structure
   representing the program satisfies the formulas. We also describe a set
   of tools for modeling design patterns with Codecharts and for verifying
   the conformance of native (plain) Java programs to the charts. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{BeO was investigated as the interface passivation layer (IPL) between a
   high-k dielectric and a III-V compound semiconductor substrate in
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. One of the critical issues
   facing the fabrication of next generation MOS devices is the
   minimization of damage to the III-V semiconductor substrate during the
   etching of the thin IPL. In this study, atomic layer etching (ALET) was
   investigated for etching of BeO as the IPL on a GaAs substrate to
   control the etch depth precisely and to minimize the damage to the III-V
   semiconductor substrate. By using ALET to etch BeO, which uses BCl3 as
   the adsorption gas for the formation of chloride compounds (Be-Cl and
   BCl-O) and Ar as the desorption gas for the removal of the chloride
   compounds, a self-limited, one-monolayer etch rate of about 0.75
   angstrom/cycle was achieved with no increase of surface roughness and
   without change of surface composition. Moreover, under the BeO ALET
   conditions, which are able to precisely stop etching over the GaAs
   substrate after removing BeO, the exposed GaAs substrate showed surface
   composition and surface roughness similar to those of the as-received
   GaAs substrate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic site-specific comparisons of the densities of threading
   dislocations (TDs) and associated V-defects in six-period InxGa1-xN/GaN
   multi-quantum wells (MQWs) with In mole fractions of x=0.1 and 0.2 have
   been conducted using several electron microscopy techniques including
   electron channeling contrast imaging. The MQWs were grown on GaN
   epitaxial films deposited on either (0001) GaN substrates or on
   (0001)AlN/6H-SiC heterostructures. The densities of TDs and V-defects in
   the surfaces of the homoepitaxial GaN films and the In0.1Ga0.9N/GaN MQWs
   were both 5.5 x 10(6) cm(-2). By contrast, the V-defect densities in the
   In0.2Ga0.N-8/GaN MQWs exceeded by two and three times the densities of
   TDs measured in the surfaces of the underlying GaN films grown on GaN
   and AlN/SiC substrates, respectively. Similar observations of V-defects
   not associated with threading dislocations have been previously reported
   to occur in InGaN MQWs grown on GaN template films on sapphire
   substrates and having either an initially high In mole fraction or grown
   at the end of a series of MQWs with an increasing In mole fraction. From
   a synthesis of the results of this previous work using GaN/sapphire
   substrates with the present results for bulk GaN substrates, it is
   hypothesized that increases in stress generated by the larger mismatches
   in lattice parameters between the GaN film and the In0.2Ga0.8N/GaN MQWs
   and the additional stresses generated between the GaN barriers and the
   wells within these MQWs generated new TDs within the MQWs, which then
   acted as nucleation centers for new V-defects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Immunodeficient mouse-human chimeras provide a powerful approach to
   study host-specific pathogens, such as Plasmodium falciparum that causes
   human malaria. Supplementation of immunodeficient mice with human RBCs
   supports infection by human Plasmodium parasites, but these mice lack
   the human immune system. By combining human RBC supplementation and
   humanized mice that are optimized for human immune cell reconstitution,
   we have developed RBC-supplemented, immune cell-optimized humanized
   (RICH) mice that support multiple cycles of P. falciparum infection.
   Depletion of human natural killer (NK) cells, but not macrophages, in
   RICH mice results in a significant increase in parasitemia. Further
   studies in vitro show that NK cells preferentially interact with
   infected RBCs (iRBCs), resulting in the activation of NK cells and the
   elimination of iRBCs in a contact-dependent manner. We show that the
   adhesion molecule lymphocyte-associated antigen 1 is required for NK
   cell interaction with and elimination of iRBCs. Development of RICH mice
   and validation of P. falciparum infection should facilitate the
   dissection of human immune responses to malaria parasite infection and
   the evaluation of therapeutics and vaccines.}},

   Stress in the Great Arteries of Wildtype Prenatal Mouse}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Abnormal fluid mechanical environment in the pre-natal
   cardiovascular system is hypothesized to play a significant role in
   causing structural heart malformations. It is thus important to improve
   our understanding of the prenatal cardiovascular fluid mechanical
   environment at multiple developmental time-points and vascular
   morphologies. We present such a study on fetal great arteries on the
   wildtype mouse from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) to near-term (E18.5).
   Methods: Ultrasound bio-microscopy (UBM) was used to measure blood
   velocity of the great arteries. Subsequently, specimens were
   cryo-embedded and sectioned using episcopic fluorescent image capture
   (EFIC) to obtain high-resolution 2D serial image stacks, which were used
   for 3D reconstructions and quantitative measurement of great artery and
   aortic arch dimensions. EFIC and UBM data were input into
   subject-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for modeling
   hemodynamics.
   Results: In normal mouse fetuses between E14.5-18.5, ultrasound imaging
   showed gradual but statistically significant increase in blood velocity
   in the aorta, pulmonary trunk (with the ductus arteriosus), and
   descending aorta. Measurement by EFIC imaging displayed a similar
   increase in cross sectional area of these vessels. However, CFD modeling
   showed great artery average wall shear stress and wall shear rate remain
   relatively constant with age and with vessel size, indicating that
   hemodynamic shear had a relative constancy over gestational period
   considered here.
   Conclusion: Our EFIC-UBM-CFD method allowed reasonably detailed
   characterization of fetal mouse vascular geometry and fluid mechanics.
   Our results suggest that a homeostatic mechanism for restoring vascular
   wall shear magnitudes may exist during normal embryonic development. We
   speculate that this mechanism regulates the growth of the great vessels.}},

Title = {{Simulation of Dilated Heart Failure with Continuous Flow Circulatory
   Support}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Lumped parameter models have been employed for decades to simulate
   important hemodynamic couplings between a left ventricular assist device
   (LVAD) and the native circulation. However, these studies seldom
   consider the pathological descending limb of the Frank-Starling response
   of the overloaded ventricle. This study introduces a dilated heart
   failure model featuring a unimodal end systolic pressure-volume
   relationship (ESPVR) to address this critical shortcoming. The resulting
   hemodynamic response to mechanical circulatory support are illustrated
   through numerical simulations of a rotodynamic, continuous flow
   ventricular assist device (cfVAD) coupled to systemic and pulmonary
   circulations with baroreflex control. The model further incorporated
   septal interaction to capture the influence of left ventricular (LV)
   unloading on right ventricular function. Four heart failure conditions
   were simulated (LV and bi-ventricular failure with/without pulmonary
   hypertension) in addition to normal baseline. Several metrics of LV
   function, including cardiac output and stroke work, exhibited a unimodal
   response whereby initial unloading improved function, and further
   unloading depleted preload reserve thereby reducing ventricular output.
   The concept of extremal loading was introduced to reflect the loading

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the effects of variable thermal conductivity on
   the flow and heat transfer in a slag-type non-linear fluid down a
   vertical wall. The constitutive relation for the heat flux vector is
   assumed to be the Fourier's law of conduction with a variable thermal
   conductivity which includes the second order effects of the volume
   fraction. We numerically solve the non-dimensional form of the governing
   equations to study the effects of various dimensionless numbers on the
   velocity, temperature and volume fraction. The results indicate that the
   thermal conductivity plays a major role in the temperature distribution.
   Also, for certain values of the dimensionless numbers, minor differences
   are observed in the velocity and volume fraction distribution compared
   with the case of constant thermal conductivity. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{The distribution of intervariant crystallographic planes in a lath
   martensite using five macroscopic parameters}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{86-98}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Electron backscatter diffraction analysis was employed to compute the
   closest orientation relationship and the distribution of intervariant
   boundary character in a lath martensitic microstructure. The
   misorientations were close to the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation
   relationship. The intervariant crystallographic plane distribution
   exhibited a relatively high anisotropy with a tendency for the lath
   interfaces to terminate on (110) planes. This results from the
   crystallographic constraints associated with the shear transformation
   rather than a low energy interface configuration. The lath martensite
   habit plane was determined to be mostly (110) or near (110). The
   relative populations of boundaries with {[}111] and {[}110]
   misorientations were greater than other high index misorientations,
   mostly characterized as (110) symmetric tilt and (110) twist boundary
   types, respectively. Analysis with homology metrics of the connectivity
   in the lath martensitic microstructure revealed the connectivity
   dominated by population of misorientation angle and boundary plane type.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{450}},
Pages = {{299-307}},

Abstract = {{Pd, Pd90Ag10, Pd91Au9, Pd78Ag9Au13 and Pd75Ag16Au9 alloy membranes were
   prepared on vacuum-assisted ZrO2-modified porous stainless steel
   supports by sequential electroless deposition. The membranes were
   evaluated for permeability in pure H-2 and in an H2S/H-2 mixture. The
   membranes displayed a range of permeabilities in pure H-2: Pd90Ag10 >
   Pd78Ag9Au13 > Pd similar to Pd75Ag16Au9 > Pd91Au9. On exposure to 100
   ppm H2S/H-2 at 673 K for 24 h, all membranes lost a significant fraction
   of their H-2 permeabilities: Pd (lost the largest fraction, 85\%) >
   Pd90Ag10 > Pd75Ag16Au9 > Pd78Ag9Au13 > Pd91Au9 (60\%). When H2S was
   removed, the membranes recovered the lost permeability to different
   extents. The Pd91Au9 and Pd78Ag9Au13 membranes displayed the highest
   fractional recovery of initial H-2 permeability (similar to 80\%). But,
   with its higher initial pure H-2 permeability, Pd78Ag9Au13 had the
   highest absolute H-2 permeability after recovery. The microstructure,
   morphology and bulk composition of H2S-exposed samples were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). XRD revealed the
   presence of a bulk Pd4S phase on both Pd and Pd90Ag10 to, the membranes
   that recovered the least H-2 relative flux after their exposure to H2S.
   In contrast, bulk sulfides did not form on Pd91Au9 or on PdAgAu ternary
   alloys. In agreement with the XRD results, EDS did not detect sulfur in
   the bulk of Pd91Au9 or in either of the ternary alloy samples. Our
   results show that the addition of Au to the high permeability PdAg
   binary membrane results in a PdAgAu ternary membrane that minimizes the
   permanent H-2 flux loss associated with H2S exposure by preventing the
   formation of thick stable sulfides. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   divinylbenzene using water droplets in conventional or Pickering HIPEs
   as the templates. These porous materials were further modified by
   quaternization and ion exchange to introduce quaternary ammonium
   hydroxide groups. The resulting polyHIPEs were utilized as sorbents for
   reversible CO2 capture from air using the humidity swing. The effect of
   pore structure on the CO2 adsorption and desorption processes was
   studied. The polyHIPEs containing large pores and interconnected porous
   structures showed improved swing sizes and faster adsorption/desorption

Abstract = {{Efficient nonlinear programming (NLP) algorithms and modeling platforms
   have led to powerful process optimization strategies. Nevertheless,
   these algorithms are challenged by recent evolution and deployment of
   multi-scale models (such as molecular dynamics and complex fluid flow)
   that apply over broad time and length scales. Integrated optimization of
   these models requires accurate and efficient reduced models (RMs). This
   study develops a rigorous multi-scale optimization framework that
   substitutes RMs for complex original detailed models (ODMs) and
   guarantees convergence to the original optimization problem. Based on
   trust region concepts this framework leads to three related NLP
   algorithms for RM-based optimization. The first follows the classical
   gradient-based trust-region method, the second avoids gradient
   calculations from the ODM, and the third avoids frequent recourse to ODM
   evaluations, using the concept of e-exact RMs. We illustrate these
   algorithms with small examples and discuss RM-based optimization case
   studies that demonstrate their performance and effectiveness. (C), 2013

Abstract = {{Chemical transformations of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and zinc oxide
   nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) during wastewater treatment and sludge treatment
   must be characterized to accurately assess the risks that these
   nanomaterials pose from land application of biosolids. Here, X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and supporting characterization methods
   are used to determine the chemical speciation of Ag and Zn in sludge
   from a pilot wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that had received PVP
   coated 50 nm Ag NPs and 30 nm ZnO NPs, dissolved metal ions, or no added
   metal. The effects of composting and lime and heat treatment on metal
   speciation in the resulting biosolids were also examined. All added Ag
   was converted to Ag2S, regardless of the form of Ag added (NP vs ionic).
   Zn was transformed to three Zn-containing species, ZnS, Zn-3(PO4)(2),
   and Zn associated Fe oxy/hydroxides, also regardless of the form of Zn
   added. Zn speciation was the same in the unamended control sludge. Ag2S
   persisted in all sludge treatments. Zn-3(PO4)(2) persisted in sludge and
   biosolids, but the ratio of ZnS and Zn associated with Fe oxy/hydroxide
   depended on the redox state and water content of the biosolids. Limited
   differences in Zn and Ag speciation among NP-dosed, ion-dosed, and
   control biosolids indicate that these nanoparticles are transformed to
   similar chemical forms as bulk metals already entering the WWTP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method of detecting and tracking the
   boundaries of drivable regions in road without road-markings. As
   unmarked roads connect residential places to public roads, the
   capability of autonomously driving on such a roadway is important to
   truly realize self-driving cars in daily driving scenarios. To detect
   the left and right boundaries of drivable regions, our method first
   examines the image region at the front of ego-vehicle and then uses the
   appearance information of that region to identify the boundary of the
   drivable region from input images. Due to variation in the image
   acquisition condition, the image features necessary for boundary
   detection may not be present. When this happens, a boundary detection
   algorithm working frame-by-frame basis would fail to successfully detect
   the boundaries. To effectively handle these cases, our method tracks,
   using a Bayes filter, the detected boundaries over frames. Experiments
   using real-world videos show promising results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method is presented that automatically recognizes
   kinematic mechanisms from textbook images using an evolutionary
   algorithm to complement computer vision techniques for object detection.
   Specifically, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used
   to optimize the number and position of mechanical joints in an image and
   corresponding joint connections (i.e. rigid bodies) such that Pareto
   front solutions maximize image consistency and mechanical feasibility. A
   well-known object detector is used as an example method for locating
   joints, and local image features between pairwise detected joints are
   used to predict likely connections. The performance of the algorithm
   using these specific vision techniques is compared to a parameterized
   detection scheme in order to decouple the efficacy of the object
   detector from the evolutionary algorithm. Experiments were performed to
   validate this approach on selected images from a custom dataset, and the
   results demonstrate reasonable success in both accuracy and speed.}},

Abstract = {{Government laws and regulations increasingly place requirements on
   software systems. Ideally, experts trained in law will analyze and
   interpret legal texts to inform the software requirements process.
   However, in small companies and development teams with short launch
   cycles, individuals with little or no legal training will be responsible
   for compliance. Two specific challenges commonly faced by non-experts
   are deciding if their system is covered by a law, and then deciding
   whether two legal requirements are similar or different. In this study,
   we assess the ability of laypersons, technical professionals, and legal
   experts to judge the similarity between legal coverage conditions and
   requirements. In so doing, we discovered that legal experts achieved
   higher rates of consensus more frequently than technical professionals
   or laypersons and that all groups had slightly greater agreement when
   judging coverage conditions than requirements, measured by Fleiss' K.
   When comparing judgments between groups using a consensus-based Cohen's
   Kappa, we found that technical professionals and legal experts exhibited
   consistently greater agreement than that found between laypersons and
   legal experts, and that each group tended towards different
   justifications, such as laypersons and technical professionals tendency
   towards categorizing different coverage conditions or requirements as
   equivalent if they believed them to possess the same underlying intent.}},

Abstract = {{Larger onshore wind farms are often installed in phases, with discrete
   smaller sub-farms being installed and becoming operational in succession
   until the farm as a whole is completed. An extended pattern search (BPS)
   algorithm that selects both local turbine position and geometry is
   presented that enables the installation of a complete farm in discrete
   stages, exploring optimality of both incremental sub-farm solutions and
   the completed project as a whole. The objective evaluation is the
   maximization of profit over the life of the farm, and the EPS uses
   modeling of cost based on an extensive cost analysis by the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The EPS uses established wake
   modeling to calculate the power development of the farm, and allows for
   the consideration of multiple or overlapping wakes.
   A limiting factor is used to determine the size of wind farm stages:
   optimization stages based on the number of turbines currently available
   for development (representative of limitations in initial capital, which
   is commonly encountered in wind farm stage development). Two wind test
   cases are considered: a unidirectional test case with constant wind
   speed and a single wind direction, and a multidirectional test case,
   with three wind speeds and a defined probability of occurrence for each.
   The test case shown in the current work is employed on a 4000 km by 4000
   km solution space. In addition, two different methods are performed: the
   first uses the optimal layout of a complete farm and then systematically
   ``removes{''} turbines to create smaller sub-farms; the second uses a
   weighted multiobjective optimization over sequential, adjacent land that
   concurrently optimizes each sub-farm and the complete farm. The
   exploration of these resulting layouts indicates the value of full-farm
   optimization (in addition to optimization of the individual stages) and
   gives insight into how to approach optimality in sub-farm stages. The
   behavior exhibited in these tests cases suggests a heuristic that can be
   employed by wind farm developers to ensure that multi-stage wind farms
   perform at their peak throughout their completion.}},

Abstract = {{Designing complex systems often requires consideration of many
   components interacting across vast scales of space and time, thus
   producing highly challenging design spaces to search. In particular,
   nano-based technologies may require considerations of how nanoscale
   (10(-9)) embodiments affect macroscale (similar to 10(0)) systems and
   typically have multiple layers of emergent behavior. It is frequently
   cited that counter-intuitive properties of emergence complicates design
   tasks; however, we investigate whether some multiscale emergent systems
   have organizational levels that may inform more effective design methods
   and searches.
   Investigations are conducted by extending an agent-based simulation that
   predicts the emergent interactions of myosin motors interacting with a
   motile actin filament. Both the behaviors of individual motors and an
   ensemble of motors are stochastic, therefore analytical methods are
   often unable to form accurate design evaluations and computationally
   intensive simulations are required for investigation. Our modification
   of the simulation enables the prediction of the duration of time that
   motors will carry an actin filament before system dissociation (termed
   its processive life-time), which is a vital performance metric for
   future nanotechnology designs such as molecular sorters.
   Virtual experiments were conducted that determines how perturbations of
   synthetic myosin design configurations, and the number of myosins
   present, affects emergent ensemble performance with respect to
   run-length and energy usage. It is found that all systems have nearly
   identical average processive life-times for a given input energy
   regardless of how much energy individual myosins utilize. Such a finding
   reduces the total information that a designer must consider, since it is
   a fundamental relationship that holds regardless of lower level
   component configurations. Such relationships may occur in complex
   systems in additional domains, and knowledge of these emergent
   relationships could greatly facilitate the efficiencies of design
   methods and automated searches for future technologies.}},

Abstract = {{When design decisions are informed by consumer choice models,
   uncertainty in the choice model and its share predictions creates
   uncertainty for the designer. We take a first step in investigating the
   variation in and accuracy of market share predictions by characterizing
   fit and forecast accuracy of multinomial logit, mixed logit, and nested
   logit models over a variety of utility function specifications for the
   US light duty new vehicle market. Using revealed preference data for
   years 2004-2006, we estimate a multinomial logit model for each
   combination of a chosen set of utility function covariates found in the
   literature. We then use each of the models to predict vehicle shares for
   the 2007 market and examine several metrics to measure fit and
   predictive accuracy. We find that the best models selected using any of
   the proposed metrics outperform random guessing yet retain substantial
   error in fit and prediction for individual vehicle models. For example,
   with no information (random guessing) 30\% of share predictions are
   within 0.2\% absolute share error in a market with an average share of
   0.4\%, whereas for the best models 70\% are within 0.2\% (for the 2007
   vehicle market this translates to an error of 33,000 units sold). Share
   predictions are sensitive to the presence of utility covariates but less
   sensitive to the form. Models that perform well on one metric tend to
   perform well on the other metrics as well. In particular, models
   selected for best fit have comparable forecast error to those with the
   best forecasts, and residual error in model fit is a major source of
   forecast error.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate consumer preference interactions in visual choice-based
   conjoint analysis, where the conjoint attributes are parameters that
   define shapes shown to the respondent as images. Interaction effects are
   present when preference for the level of one attribute is dependent on
   the level of another attribute. When interaction effects are negligible,
   a main-effects fractional factorial experimental design can be used to
   reduce data requirements and survey cost. This is particularly important
   when the presence of many parameters or levels makes full factorial
   designs intractable. However, if interaction effects are relevant, a
   main-effects design creates biased estimates and potentially misleading
   conclusions. Most conjoint studies assume interaction effects are
   negligible; however, interactions may play a larger role for shape
   parameters than for other types of attributes. We conduct preliminary
   tests on this assumption in three visual conjoint studies. The results
   suggest that interactions can be either negligible or dominant in visual
   conjoint, depending on both consumer preferences and shape
   parameterization. When interactions are anticipated, it is possible in
   some cases to re-parameterize the shape such that interactions in the
   new space are negligible. Generally, we suggest that randomized designs
   are better than fractional factorial designs at avoiding bias due to the
   presence of interactions and/or the organization of profiles into choice
   sets.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical methods used for studying design thinking have included verbal
   protocols, case studies, and controlled experiments. Studies have looked
   at the role of design methods, strategies, tools, environment,
   experience, and group dynamics. Early empirical studies were casual and
   exploratory with loosely defined objectives and informal analysis
   methods. Current studies have become more formal, factor controlled,
   aiming at hypothesis testing, using statistical DOE and analysis methods
   such as ANOVA. Popular pursuits include comparison of experts and
   novices, identifying and overcoming fixation, role of analogies,
   effectiveness of ideation methods, and other various tools. A variety of
   data may be collected, related to both the process and the outcome
   (designs).There are still no standards for designing, collecting and
   analyzing data, partly due to the lack of cognitive models and theories
   of design thinking. Data analysis is tedious and the rate of discoveries
   has been slow. Future studies may need to develop computer based data
   collection and automated analyses, which may facilitate collection of
   massive amounts of data with the potential of rapid advancement of the
   rate of discoveries and development of cognitive models of design
   thinking.}},

Abstract = {{Our prior work presented a method for computationally structuring patent
   databases as a basis for an automated design-by-analogy tool. In order
   to examine the validity and sensibility of the prior work as the basis
   for a design tool, its output is compared in detail to expert designers'
   mental models of the domain being structured, i.e., a set of 45 patents
   and their inter-relationships. The comparison sought first to gauge the
   intuitiveness and sensibility of the computational method of structuring
   to human minds, and further to ascertain whether any differences between
   the method's and the experts' structures indicate potentially novel or
   surprising ways of approaching the space of patents, or indicate that
   the output was nonsensical, invalid or needing modification in order to
   be useable. The results indicate that, when compared to expert thinking,
   the computationally generated structure is sensible in its clustering of
   patents and in its organization of these clusters into a structure or
   space. The results also suggest that the computationally-generated
   structure represents a version of the patent space upon which experts
   can find common ground and consensus making it likely to be intuitive
   and accessible to a broad cohort of designers. Thus, the prior work
   which presented a computational method for structuring design databases
   has been found to offer a resource-efficient way of usefully
   representing the space that is sensible to expert designers, while still
   preserving an element of surprise and unexpectedness, making it
   promising as the basis for a computational design-by-analogy inspiration
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and tailoring the visual elements of a developing product
   to evoke a desired emotional response and aesthetic perception is a key
   challenge in industrial design. To date, computational approaches to
   assist this process have either relied on stiff geometric
   representations, or focused on superficial features that exclude often
   elusive shape characteristics. In this work, we aim to study the
   relationship between product form and consumer emotions through a visual
   deconstruction and abstraction of existing final products. In
   particular, we attempt to answer three questions: (1) Do observers'
   aesthetic judgments rely on the product as a whole, including fine
   geometric details, superficial surface features, and brand-revealing
   icons, or are large, prominent shape characteristics sufficient to make
   this determination? (2) Is it possible to isolate shape features that
   give rise to specific emotional responses? (3) Is there a relationship
   between consumers' ability to recognize a brand and the emotional
   attributes they associate with that brand. At the heart of our
   investigation is a shape analysis method that produces a spectrum of
   abstractions for a given 3D computer model. This produces a hierarchical
   simplification of an end product, whereby consumer response to geometric
   elements can be statistically studied across different products, as well
   as across the different abstractions of one particular product. The
   results of our study show that emotional responses evoked by coarse
   product ``impressions{''} are strongly correlated with those evoked by
   final production models. This, in turn, highlights the importance of
   early aesthetic assessment and exploration before committing to detail
   design efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, consumer preference is modeled in terms of preference for
   the aesthetic and functional features of a product. This paper
   introduces a new means to model consumer preference that allows for the
   experience of and interaction with a product to account for not only for
   how a product looks and functions, but also how it feels to use it.
   Traditional conjoint-based approaches to preference modeling require a
   user to judge preference for a product based upon a 2D product
   representation or a feature list. While the aesthetic forms and
   functional features of a product are certainty important, the decision
   to buy or not to buy a product often depends on more, namely the
   experience or feel of use. We introduce the concept of experiential
   conjoint analysis, a method to mathematically capture preference for a
   product through experience-based preference judgments. Experience-based
   preference judgments are made based upon the use, or simulated use, of a
   product. For many products, creating enough physical prototypes to
   generate a preference model is cost prohibitive. In this work, virtual
   reality technologies are used to allow the subjects an interactive,
   immersive, and realistic product experience, provided at little
   investment. The results of this work show not only that preference
   judgments of the interaction of a 3D virtual product representation can
   be used to generate accurate preference models, but that
   non-experiential judgments of the same product's 2D forms lead to the
   generation of different preference models. Further, the virtual reality
   experience is found to provide an advantage in the form of confidence,
   information, and/or realism. Such experiential-based preference models
   provide previously unavailable design insight with which to inform the
   design generation process.}},

   parametric resonant bifurcation selpoint. The parametric resonance
   features a sharp ``turn-on{''} in oscillation amplitude at the
   bifurcation, enhancing sensitivity to resonance frequency change. A
   bi-state controller is constructed to servo at this sharp jump point. It
   has two states of operation: one state is within the instability tongue
   where the oscillation amplitude builds up exponentially; another state
   resides outside of the tongue where the oscillation turns off The rapid
   turn on and off of the parametric resonance keeps the resonant amplitude
   small and circumvents the slow build-up time. Both the simulated and

Abstract = {{Over the past four years the authors have developed an online version of
   the Delta Design game, a board game which was developed by Bucciarelli
   (1) to teach students design collaboration skills. In the online
   version, players move tiles on a shared virtual board and communicate
   only through text chat. In addition, the objective functions are
   computed automatically each time a tile is moved, so the focus of the
   game changes from rapid number-crunching to negotiation. Since every
   state of the board, along with micro-level team performance and chat
   data, are captured, the resulting corpus from 38 four-player team games
   provides a rich resource to explore different aspects of collaborative
   team practices.
   This paper gives an overview of the online implementation of Delta
   Design and discusses the findings from user studies including several
   undergraduate capstone design classes. Observations of the board-moving
   tactics show that teams planning a strategy before starting the game or
   players sharing details about their role's constraints with other team
   members do not have much effect on the game's outcome. Finally, this
   paper demonstrates that the complex rules of the Delta Design game make
   it a suitable candidate for analyzing collaboration strategies in
   team-based design projects.}},

Abstract = {{Numeric optimization has successfully been applied in the chemical
   industry to improve process performance, reduce emissions, create
   advanced control systems and intelligently explore process design
   alternatives. Regarding power plants, optimization methods provide a
   systematic approach to balance trade-offs when designing efficient and
   minimal cost carbon capture systems. Coal oxycombustion power plants are
   an ideal candidate for optimization, given the complex trade-offs
   regarding flue gas recycle strategies, heat integration and design of
   cryogenic separation systems.
   Many oxycombustion studies consider sensitivity analysis instead of
   multi-variable optimization, which neglect consequentially important
   interactions between subsystems. Furthermore, these studies rely on
   over-simplified boiler models available in commercial process
   simulators. In this paper we present a hybrid 1D/3D boiler model that
   balances accuracy and computational expense, making it well suited for
   optimization studies of an entire coal power plant. This model is then
   incorporated into an equation-based optimization framework for power
   plants. Trust region optimization methods are used to ensure
   convergence. Finally a proof-of-concept case study is presented, and
   future work is discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Efficient separation systems are essential to the development of
   economical CO2 capture system for fossil flue power plants. Air
   Separation Units (ASU) and CO2 Processing Units (CPU) are considering
   the best commercially available technologies for the O-2/N-2 and
   CO2/N-2, O-2, Ar separations in coal oxycombustion processes. Both of
   these systems operate at cryogenic temperatures and include

   systems for oxy-fired coal power plants. These studies are limited,
   however, as they neglect important interactions between design
   variables.
   In this paper, we apply an advanced equation-based flowsheet
   optimization framework to design these cryogenic separations systems.
   The key advantage of this approach is the ability to use
   state-of-the-art nonlinear optimization solvers that are capable of
   considering 100,000+ variables and constraints. This allows for
   multi-variable optimization of these cryogenic separations systems and
   their accompanying multi-stream heat exchangers. The effectiveness of
   this approach is demonstrated in two case studies. The optimized ASU
   designs requires 0.196 kWh/kg of O-2, which are similar to a ``low
   energy{''} design from American Air Liquide and outperforms other
   academic studies. Similarly, the optimized CPU requires 18\% less
   specific separation energy than an academic reference case. Pareto
   (sensitivity) curves for the ASU and CPU systems are also presented.
   Finally, plans to apply the framework to simultaneously optimize an
   entire oxycombustion process are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and
   costs of ionic liquid (IL)-based CO2 capture systems at pulverized
   coal-fired (PC) power plants. The IL selected for this assessment is
   trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium 2-cyanopyrrolide
   ({[}P66614]{[}2-CNpyr]), achieving a 1:1 and reversible chemical
   reaction between {[}2-CNpyr]- and CO2. A multi-stage equilibrium-based
   modeling framework is established to simulate the adiabatic absorption
   process, whereas a single-stage flash drum in equilibrium is employed
   for the stripping process. The performance model is linked to an
   engineering-economic model that estimates the capital cost, annual
   operating and maintenance (O\&M) costs, and total levelized annual cost.
   The technical and cost models are applied to estimate the cost of CO2
   captured by an IL-based CCS system. The preliminary results show that
   for 90\% CO2 capture, the capture cost would be higher than the U.S.
   Department of Energy's target at \$40 per metric ton of CO2 captured for
   new generation technologies, mainly due to a large capital cost.
   However, current process designs are not yet optimized Based on the cost
   of CO2 captured, the most cost-effective capture cost is found to be at
   a removal efficiency of about 85\% for CO2.}},

   a CaL process, the applicability and operational feasibility of a CaL
   system for new or existing PC power plants also is studied. It was found
   that though the CaL system has better performance than the MEA-based CO2
   capture process, the capital cost of the power plant and the cost of

Abstract = {{We examine the implications of lowering electricity sector CO2 emissions
   in PJM through a Low Carbon Capacity Standard (LCCS) instead of a
   renewables portfolio standard (RPS). An LCCS would create a requirement
   for load-serving entities to procure new low carbon capacity (GW). The
   LCCS would provide a greater balance of energy and capacity supply than
   a renewable portfolio standard, which requires only the supply of energy
   (and excludes non-renewable low carbon generators). Approximately 25 GW
   of PJM generation capacity is scheduled to retire by 2019 and the RPSs
   currently in place in PJM will supply only 5 GW of Equivalent Load
   Carrying Capability (ELLC). An LCCS, providing the same amount of low
   carbon energy, would supply 13 to 16 GW of ELCC. We estimate the
   required reduction of capacity prices required to cover the investment
   cost premium low carbon capacity would require from consumers. For
   example, if the energy from an LCCS costs on average \$20/MWh more than
   energy from an RPS, the annual premium would be approximately \$2.2 B.
   In order for consumers to be better off with an LCCS in this example,
   capacity prices would have to decrease by \$40/MW-day. We find that if
   an LCCS were adopted, coal fired power plants with carbon capture,
   utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) would likely have the lowest cost
   per MW of capacity of all low carbon technologies, based on net Cost of
   New Entry (CONE) estimates. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   summarize examples of the deployability goals for each project as well
   as the architectural decisions that they have made to enable

Abstract = {{We present a system for performing evolution directly on an antenna
   array. The system is composed of three programmable antennas and runs in
   an antenna chamber under the control of an evolutionary algorithm.
   Fitness is measured in two ways. First, we assess how well the antenna
   array radiation pattern matches a desired null-steering pattern, which
   changes over time. Second, we measure how well the algorithms are able
   to reconfigure the arrays hardware settings to recover from a localized
   hardware fault within the array. We describe the in-situ evolution
   hardware system, the algorithms used, and the experimental setup. The
   results show that two types of genetic algorithms and the simulated
   annealing algorithm were able to adapt, in-situ, the antenna arrays
   output pattern to a target nulling pattern. We also show that the
   evolutionary algorithms were able to reconfigure the array to re-steer
   nulls correctly following the introduction of localized hardware faults
   into the array. This provides a proof-of-concept for the idea of
   self-healing antenna arrays.}},

Abstract = {{With the reduction in size and cost of sensor nodes, dense sensor
   networks are becoming more popular in a wide-range of applications. Many
   such applications with dense deployments are geared towards finding
   various patterns or features such as peaks, boundaries and shapes in the
   spread of sensed physical quantities over an area. However, collecting
   all the data from individual sensor nodes can be impractical both in
   terms of timing requirements and the overall resource consumption.
   Hence, it is imperative to devise distributed information processing
   techniques that can help in identifying such features with a high
   accuracy and within certain time constraints.
   In this paper, we exploit the prioritized channel-access mechanism of
   dominance-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols to efficiently
   obtain exterma of the sensed quantities. We show how by the use of
   simple transforms that sensor nodes employ on local data it is also
   possible to efficiently extract certain features such as local extrema
   and boundaries of events. Using these transformations, we show through
   extensive evaluations that our proposed technique is fast and efficient
   at retrieving only sensor data point with the most constructive
   information, independent of the number of sensor nodes in the network.}},

Abstract = {{An improved conventional-to-micro/minichannel threshold was proposed as
   Bo = 4 and BoRe(1)(0.5) = 200, where Bo is the Bond number and Re-1 is
   the liquid Reynolds number. The region Bo < 4 and BoRe(1)(0.5) < 200 is
   termed as micro/minichannel because bubbles tend to be confined and
   elongated in the channel and the conventional two-phase flow theory
   loses its applicability. Flow-pattern based heat transfer correlations
   for elongated bubbly flow and annular flow in flow boiling
   micro/minichannels were developed separately based on a collected
   micro/minichannel heat-transfer database. As significant disagreement in
   experimental trends and heat transfer mechanisms was reported for flow
   boiling in micro/minichannels in the literature, it is not possible to
   explain the discrepancy and predict all data points by a single
   correlation without considering the different flow patterns. The newly
   developed flow-pattern based predictive tool can not only present a
   decent overall accuracy, but also estimate the parametric trends
   correctly. Over 95\% of the data points can be predicted by the proposed
   correlations within a +/- 50\% error band for both elongated bubbly flow
   and annular flow. Therefore, the simple flow-pattern based correlations
   can be applied for heat exchanger design, improve understanding of the
   underlying heat transfer mechanisms, and guide development of further
   enhancement techniques for flow boiling in micro/minichannels.}},

Abstract = {{Thickness dependent thermal conductivity measurements were made on
   aluminum nitride (AIN) thin films grown by two methods on the (0001)
   surfaces of silicon carbide (SiC) and sapphire substrates with differing
   surface roughness. We find that the AIN layer itself makes a small
   contribution to the overall thermal resistance. Instead, the thermal
   boundary resistance (TBR) of 5.1 +/- 2.8m(2)-K/GW between the AIN and
   substrate is equivalent to 240 nm of highly dislocated AIN, or 1450 nm
   of single crystal AIN. An order-of-magnitude larger TBR was measured
   between AIN films and SiC substrates with increased surface roughness
   (1.2 nm vs. 0.2 nm RMS). High resolution TEM images reveal
   near-interface planar defects in the AIN films grown on the rough SiC
   that we hypothesize are the source of increased TBR.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental advantages of hybrid and electric vehicles
   compared to conventional vehicles is the regenerative braking mechanism.
   Some portion of the kinetic energy of the vehicle can be recovered
   during regenerative braking by using the electric drive system as a
   generator with the appropriate control strategy. The control requires
   distribution of the brake forces between front and rear axles of the
   vehicle and also between regenerative braking and frictional braking. In
   this paper, we propose solving the optimal brake force distribution
   problem using an Artificial Neural Network based methodology in order to
   maximize the available energy for recovery while following the rules for
   stability. Using the proposed approach, we find that for urban driving
   pattern, UDDS, up to 37 \% of the total energy demand can be recovered.
   Then we compare the amount of recovered energy for different driving
   cycles and show that aggressive driving reduces recoverable energy up to
   7\%. An increase in the energy recovery rate directly translates into
   improvements in fuel economy and reductions in emissions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the three dimensional flow of granular
   materials and a viscous fluid in a channel. We use Mixture Theory to
   treat this problem as a two-component system {[}1]: One component is the
   solid particles (granular materials), such as sand, coal particles or
   red blood cells; the solid particles are modeled as a generalized
   Reiner-Rivlin type fluid derived by Massoudi {[}2], which not only
   considers the effects of volume fraction but also has a viscosity which
   is shear rate dependent. The other component, the host fluid, is assumed
   to behave as a linear viscous fluid, such as water, oil or plasma. For
   the interaction forces, the effect of different hindrance functions for
   the drag force is studied; moreover a generalized form of the expression
   for the hindrance function is suggested. For studying this two-component
   system numerically, a three dimensional CFD solver based on OpenFOAM has
   been developed. Applying this solver, a specific problem (blood flow)
   has been studied for which our numerical results and experimental data
   {[}3] show good agreement.}},

   comb gap mismatches as a result of different stator and rotor
   displacements due to stress are responsible for the ZRO, and they create

Abstract = {{Controlling thermal conductivity of materials is very important in
   various applications, such as thermal management and energy conversion.
   We have been utilizing femtosecond phonon spectroscopy to excite and
   detect coherent phonons in various materials. However, the impact of
   coherent phonons to overall heat transport is still unknown. In this
   paper, we developed a small perturbation model in molecular dynamics
   (MD) to simulate coherent phonons and investigate the effect on thermal
   conductivity in bismuth telluride. The phonon frequency and lifetime
   predicted by our model agree very well with experimental results. It is
   found that at very low temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity,
   predicted by quasi-equilibrium Green-Kubo method, can be greatly
   enhanced upon coherent phonon generation. Our results suggest that it is
   possible to control lattice thermal conductivity effectively via
   manipulating coherent phonons}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable development could be seen as indispensable condition for

   paradigm in material and building science research in China, requiring
   the accounting for carbon emissions, carbon sequestration, material
   embodied energy, and material thermal properties for this renewable
   resource. This paper studies the application of the timber lattice wall
   in Chinese solar buildings. Firstly, it is analyzed timber structural
   form and mechanical property of the multi-ribbed composite wall, proving
   its high anti-seismic property and firmness by finite element modeling.
   Secondly, the timber structure filled with wheat straw brick contributes
   to low U-value of the wall, which is only 0.3 Watts per square meter per
   degree Celsius and far better than the code of Chinese building, greatly
   promoting building energy efficiency. Besides, the timber structure and
   straw brick are both ``Cradle to Cradle{''} materials and reduce carbon
   emission compared to common building envelope. In the end, the paper is
   analyzed the promising market of the multi-ribbed composite wall for its
   competitive price and outstanding environmental performance.}},

Abstract = {{From consumer productions to energy production, algae is used in many
   industrial processes. Understanding the mechanical behavior of algae is
   important to optimize these processes. To obtain a better understanding
   of algae cell response, we mechanically characterized single, dried
   Scenedesmus dimorphus cells. To accomplish this, we used atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) to image S. dimorphus cells, which enabled us to map
   the AFM measurements to a location on the individual cells. We were then
   able to perform force measurements on the AFM to determine the Young's
   modulus of S. dimorphus. These findings enable a more detailed
   understanding of the mechanical properties of a single S. dimorphus
   cell, which may be useful in many applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, large-eddy simulations (LES) of engine type flow are
   performed using commercially available computer code CONVERGE. First,
   accuracy of the numerical discretization scheme of the code is assessed
   using well established laminar flow configurations. Then, two different
   subgrid scale (SGS) models, an eddy-viscosity model of Vreman (Physics
   of fluids, 16, 2004) and a non eddy-viscosity model of Pomraning and
   Rutland (AIAA Journal, 40, 2002) are employed to predict turbulent flow
   characteristics in a piston-valve assembly. A number of grid resolutions
   are employed to perform the simulations, with and without the SGS
   models. The mean velocity and the root-mean-squared (RMS) values of the
   velocity fluctuations are compared with available experimental data.
   Although satisfactory comparison of model predictions with measured data
   is obtained, it is found that the predictions are more influenced by the
   grid resolution than the SGS model contribution.}},

Abstract = {{For urban driving, knowledge of ego-vehicle's position is a critical
   piece of information that enables advanced driver-assistance systems or
   self-driving cars to execute safety-related, autonomous driving
   maneuvers. This is because, without knowing the current location, it is
   very hard to autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future.
   The existing solutions for localization rely on a combination of Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), an inertial measurement unit, and a
   digital map. However, on urban driving environments, due to poor
   satellite geometry and disruption of radio signal reception, their
   longitudinal and lateral errors are too significant to be used to guide
   an autonomous system. To enhance the existing system's localization
   capability, this work presents an effort of developing a vision-based
   lateral localization algorithm. The algorithm aims at reliably counting,
   with or without observations of lane-markings, the number road-lanes and
   identifying the index of the road-lane on the roadway that our vehicle
   happens to be driving on. Testings the proposed algorithms against
   inter-city and inter-state highway videos showed promising results in
   terms of counting the number of road-lanes and the indices of the
   current road-lanes.}},

   filter emphasizing the intensity contrast between lane-marking pixels
   and their neighboring pixels. We then examine the detected lane-markings
   to identify perpendicular, geometry layouts between longitudinal and
   lateral lane-markings for stop-line detection. To provide reliable
   stop-line recognition, we developed an unscented Kalman filter to track
   the detected stop-line over frames. Through the testings with
   real-world, busy urban street videos, our method demonstrated promising
   results, in terms of the accuracy of the initial detection accuracy and

   electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) with non-precious metal catalyst (NPMC)
   cathodes. NPMCs present an opportunity to dramatically reduce the cost
   of PEFC electrodes by removing the costly Pt catalyst. To address the
   significant transport losses in thick NPMC cathodes (ca. > 60 mu m), we
   developed a hierarchical electrode model that resolves the unique
   structure of the NPMCs we studied. A unique feature of the approach is
   the integration of the model with morphology data extracted from
   nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) imaging of the
   electrodes. A notable finding is the impact of the liquid water
   accumulation in the electrode and the significant performance
   improvement possible if electrode flooding is mitigated.}},

Abstract = {{Combining information from a variety of sources greatly improves the
   classification accuracy compared with a single source. When the
   information sources are asynchronous (i. e., the combined feature set
   has missing values) and training data is limited, the accuracy of
   existing classification approaches are reduced. In this paper we present
   CobLE, an approach for creating an ensemble of classifiers. Each
   classifier operates on data from a single source and a ``confidence{''}
   function is approximated for each classifier over its feature space.
   Classifier outputs are aggregated using weighted voting where the weight
   for each classifier is estimated from its confidence function. We
   present a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results
   demonstrating significant improvement over existing ensemble learning
   and data fusion approaches, especially with asynchronous data sources.
   We also present a thorough evaluation of the effects of CobLE's internal
   parameters on performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by the open questions concerning the ability to
   compute the global optimum of nonlinear state estimators (SE). The major
   cause of these problems comes from the highly nonlinear functions
   relating measurements and voltages defined by the AC power flow models.
   Conventional approaches in today's AC electric power system SE are prone
   to sub-optimal solutions, which, in turn, creates unacceptably large
   differences between the true and estimated voltages. In this paper, we
   first formulate the problem as an equivalent convex optimization
   problem. We then account for the specific structure of the problem, and
   arrive at an efficient algorithm for finding the global optimum, namely
   the most accurate estimate of the state. Notably, under the no noise
   assumption this approach for the first time solved the problem exactly.
   Further, we show that our estimate is close to the global optimum even
   when measurement noise is present, while currently used SE only finds a
   local optimum. Simulations are shown to illustrate improved results
   obtained using the SE formulation proposed in this paper over the
   results obtained using today's SE.}},

Abstract = {{While plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are expected to provide economic
   and environmental benefits to the transportation sector, they may also
   help the electric grid, both as a potential source of energy storage and
   as a means to improve power quality and reliability. In this paper, our
   focus is on the latter, where PEVs offer reactive power compensation
   using P-Q control at their charger inverters. In this regard, we develop
   a new optimization-based P-Q control strategy for PEV charging stations
   to be implemented in line distribution networks that are in great need
   of reactive power compensation, either because of serving large
   industrial loads or due to the inductive impact of distribution level
   wind turbines. Our design is based on a nonlinear power flow analysis,
   and the design objectives are to perform voltage regulation and demand
   response. Through various computer simulations, we assess our proposed
   PEV-based reactive power compensation and compare it with the case where
   no P-Q control is conducted at PEV charging stations.}},

Abstract = {{A computationally efficient module to describe organic aerosol (OA)
   partitioning and chemical aging has been developed and implemented into
   the EMAC atmospheric chemistry-climate model. The model simulates the
   formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from semivolatile (SVOCs),
   intermediate-volatility (IVOCs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
   It distinguishes SVOCs from biomass burning and all other combustion
   sources using two surrogate species for each source category with an
   effective saturation concentration at 298K of C{*} = 0.1 and 10 mu g
   m(-3). Two additional surrogate species with C{*} = 10(3) and 10(5) mu g
   m(-3) are used for the IVOCs emitted by the above source categories.
   Gas-phase photochemical reactions that change the volatility of the
   organics are taken into account. The oxidation products (SOA-sv, SOA-iv,
   and SOA-v) of each group of precursors (SVOCs, IVOCs, and VOCs) are
   simulated separately to keep track of their origin. ORACLE efficiently
   describes the OA composition and evolution in the atmosphere and can be
   used to (i) estimate the relative contributions of SOA and primary
   organic aerosol (POA) to total OA, (ii) determine how SOA concentrations
   are affected by biogenic and anthropogenic emissions, and (iii) evaluate
   the effects of photochemical aging and long-range transport on the OA
   budget. We estimate that the global average near-surface OA
   concentration is 1.5 mu g m(-3) and consists of 7\% POA from fuel
   combustion, 11\% POA from biomass burning, 2\% SOA-sv from fuel
   combustion, 3\% SOA-sv from biomass burning, 15\% SOA-iv from fuel
   combustion, 28\% SOA-iv from biomass burning, 19\% biogenic SOA-v, and
   15\% anthropogenic SOA-v. The modeled tropospheric burden of OA
   components is 0.23 Tg POA, 0.16 Tg SOA-sv, 1.41 Tg SOA-iv, and 1.2 Tg
   SOA-v.}},

Abstract = {{Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are primitives that generate
   high-entropy, tamper resistant bits for use in secure systems. For
   applications such as cryptographic key generation, the PUF response bits
   must be highly reliable, consistent across multiple evaluations under
   voltage and temperature variations. Conventionally, error correcting
   codes (ECC) have been used to improve response reliability, but these
   techniques have significant area, power, and delay overheads and are
   vulnerable to information leakage. In this work, we present a
   highly-reliable, PUF-based, cryptographic key generator that uses no
   ECC, but instead uses built-in self-test to determine which PUF bits are
   reliable and only uses those bits for key generation. We implemented a
   prototype of the key generator in a 65nm bulk CMOS testchip. The key
   generator generates 1213 bits in an area of <50 mu m(2) with a measured
   bit error rate of < 5 {*} 10(-9) in both the nominal and worst case
   corners (100k measurements each). This is equivalent to a 128-bit key
   failure rate of < 10(-6). The system can generate a 128-bit key in 1.15
   mu s. Finally, we present a realization of a ``strong{''}-PUF that uses
   128 of these highly reliable bits in conjunction with an Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic primitive and has a response
   time of 40ns and is realized in an area of 84 mu m(2).}},

   data analysis tools in the emerging electric energy systems, due to the
   recent penetration of distributed green energy, distributed
   intelligence, and plug-in electric vehicles. Instead of taking the
   traditional complex physical model based approach, this paper proposes a
   data-driven method, leading to an effective early event detection
   approach for the smart grid. Our contributions are: (1) introducing the
   early event detection problem, (2) providing a novel method for power
   systems data analysis (PowerScope), i.e. finding hidden power flow
   features which are mutually independent, (3) proposing a learning
   approach for early event detection and identification based on
   PowerScope. Although a machine learning approach is adopted, our
   approach does account for physical constraints to enhance performance.
   By using the proposed early event detection method, we are able to
   obtain an event detector with high accuracy but much smaller detection
   time when comparing to physical model based approach. Such result shows
   the potential for sustainable grid services through real-time data

   connect the source and drain, while the residual stress is used to
   control the actuation voltage. This demonstration is the first of its
   kind to exploit residual stress to deliver a highly scalable switching
   mechanism that exhibits low actuation voltage (similar to 1.8 V), and
   uniquely achieves an equivalent electric body bias via mechanical
   methods. Analytical and FEA simulation show a linear dependence of the
   switching voltage on the residual stress, while the voltage vs. stress
   tuning slope is reduced linearly with scaling the piezoelectric film
   thickness (-16.6 mV/MPa for 10 nm thick AlN film). A scaling analysis
   shows that millivolt switching is possible for aggressively miniaturized

Abstract = {{The alkali-silica reaction is a source of damage in concrete, which can
   cause serious expansion, cracking, and sometimes the failure of
   structures. In this paper, we use three ultrasonic methods, the
   attenuation spectrum method, the ultrasonic passband method, and the
   stretching factor method to detect the existence of alkali-silica
   reaction (ASR) damage and to track its progress in concrete. From our
   tests, we demonstrate the ultrasonic passband method and stretching
   factor method have performed well to achieve the above goals.}},

   (iv) frequency, and (v) vibration mode. A considerable increase in Q was
   attained when using smaller electrode coverage or strategically placing
   the electrodes at low strain locations. These results clearly indicate
   the impact of interfacial loss on Q. A minimal dependence of Q on
   pressure was found, implying that air damping has a minor effect in
   setting Q for these devices. Q vs. temperature of a characteristic
   resonator was also measured, hinting that damping mechanisms of

   Consequently, larger particles migrate towards acoustic nodes faster
   than smaller particles. We have investigated particles flowing in
   channels at an oblique angle relative to the SAW field. By applying the
   drag force and the acoustic force to the particles at an angle,
   depending on the water velocity, larger particles migrate towards one
   side of the channel faster than smaller particles, enabling particle
   separation in a continuous flow system without dilution from sheath
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{Self-powered vehicles that interact with the physical world, such as
   spacecraft, require computing platforms with predictable timing behavior
   and a low energy demand. Energy consumption can be reduced by choosing
   energy-efficient designs for both hardware and software components of
   the platform. We leverage the state-of-the-art in energy-efficient
   hardware design by adopting Heterogeneous Multi-core Processors with
   support for Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling and Dynamic Power
   Management. We address the problem of allocating real-time software
   components onto heterogeneous cores such that total energy is minimized.
   Our approach is to start from an analytically justified target load
   distribution and find a task assignment heuristic that approximates it.
   Our analysis shows that neither balancing the load nor assigning all
   load to the ``cheapest{''} core is the best load distribution strategy,
   unless the cores are extremely alike or extremely different. The optimal
   load distribution is then formulated as a solution to a convex
   optimization problem. A heuristic that approximates this load
   distribution and an alternative method that leverages the solution
   explicitly are proposed as viable task assignment methods. The proposed
   methods are compared to state-of-the-art on simulated problem instances
   and in a case study of a soft-real-time application on an off-the-shelf
   ARM big. LITTLE heterogeneous processor.}},

Abstract = {{Support for multiple concurrent applications is an important enabler for
   promoting the use of sensor networks as an infrastructure technology,
   where multiple users can deploy their applications independently. In
   such a scenario, different applications on a node may transmit packets
   at distinct periods, causing the node to change from sleep to active
   state more often, which negatively impacts the energy consumption of the
   whole network. In this paper, we propose to batch the transmissions
   together by defining a harmonizing period to align the transmissions
   from multiple applications at periodic boundaries. This harmonizing
   period is then leveraged to design a protocol that coordinates the
   transmissions across nodes and provides real-time guarantees in a
   multi-hop network. This protocol, which we call Network-Harmonized
   Scheduling (NHS), takes advantage of the periodicity introduced to
   assign offsets to nodes at different hop-levels such that collisions are
   always avoided, and deterministic behavior is enforced. NHS is a
   light-weight and distributed protocol that does not require any global
   state-keeping mechanism. We implemented NHS on the Contiki operating
   system and show how it can achieve a duty-cycle comparable to an ideal
   TDMA approach.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose unique
   fluorescence properties make them desirable biological imaging probes.
   However, reliable and efficient cellular delivery of QDs remains
   technically challenging. To address this problem, we developed a cell
   penetrating peptide (CPP) based approach that delivers QDs into
   mammalian cells with high reproducibility and efficiency and minimal
   cytotoxicity. To understand the delivery mechanism, we analyzed related
   cell uptake pathways. We followed internalization and endosomal release
   of CPP conjugated QDs (CPP-QDs) and found that although endocytosis
   (micropinocytosis) was the predominant pathway, some CPP-QDs were
   internalized through direct permeation of the plasma membrane.
   Internalized QDs could be released from endosomes to the cytoplasm if
   conjugated with an endosomolytic peptide (HA2), but most of released
   particles either were re-captured by lysosomes or aggregated in the
   cytoplasm. Together, our results provide insights into mechanisms of CPP
   mediated cellular delivery of quantum dots for intracellular imaging as
   well as therapeutic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Deep needle insertion into brain is important for both diagnostic and
   therapeutic clinical interventions. We have developed an automated
   system for robotically steering flexible needles within the brain to
   improve targeting accuracy. In this work, we have developed a finite
   element needle-tissue interaction model that allows for the
   investigation of safe parameters for needle steering. The tissue model
   implemented contains both hyperelastic and viscoelastic properties to
   simulate the instantaneous and time-dependent responses of brain tissue.
   Several needle models were developed with varying parameters to study
   the effects of the parameters on tissue stress, strain and strain rate
   during needle insertion and rotation. The parameters varied include
   needle radius, bevel angle, bevel tip fillet radius, insertion speed,
   and rotation speed. The results will guide the design of safe needle
   tips and control systems for intracerebral needle steering.}},

Abstract = {{Transient stability of power systems is becoming increasingly important
   as the grid evolves toward adopting smart, distributed and renewable
   technologies. The steady state methods, such as (N-1)
   reliability-related methods and Remedial Action Schemes (RAS), do not
   guarantee stable system behavior during transients. Additionally, these
   methods are centralized, while the new technologies, namely fast
   communications and power-electronically-controlled devices, provide
   potential for distributed stabilization. In this paper, we propose an
   approach to designing dynamical controllers for transient stabilization
   of interconnected power systems. This approach is based on modeling and
   stabilization of interaction variables which describe how different
   parts of the system interact. The approach is applicable to large scale
   systems and different controlling devices. We illustrate it on a simple
   system with a converter-based Flexible Alternating Current Transmission
   System (FACTS) device as a controller.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a distributed method to schedule supply and flexible
   demand in a congested network, accommodating diverse benefits of
   end-users. We look at two different time horizons to schedule supply and
   demand; a day ahead and an hour ahead, which we refer to as day-ahead
   and real-time clearing. For day-ahead clearing, we decompose the
   system-level problem and solve it in an iterative way to schedule supply
   and flexible demand over multiple time steps. However, after the
   day-ahead quantities are cleared and the actual consumption/production
   is to occur sooner, we use moving-horizon functional clearing. We show
   an application of this framework to the IEEE 30-bus test system with a
   large number of various air conditioning loads. The experiment shows
   effectiveness of the methods in managing congestion and in coping with
   unexpected conditions such as a rise in the weather temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional power system state estimation methods lack the ability to
   track and manage increasing uncertainties inherent in the new
   technologies, such as recent and ongoing massive penetration of
   renewable energy, distribution intelligence, and plug-in electric
   vehicles. To deal with the inability, a recent work proposes to utilize
   the unused historical data for power system state estimation. Although
   able to achieve much higher accuracy, the new approach is slow due to
   the burden by sequential similarity check over large volumes of high
   dimensional historical measurements, making it unsuitable for online
   services. This calls for a general approach to preprocess the historical
   data. In this paper, we propose to achieve such a goal with three steps.
   First, because the power systems are with periodic patterns, which
   create clustered measurement data, dimension reduction is proposed to
   remove redundancy, but still able to retrieve similar measurements. To
   further reduce the computational time, the k-dimensional tree indexing
   approach is employed in step two to group the clustered power system
   data into a tree structure, resulting in a log-reduction over searching
   time. Finally, we verify the obtained historical power system states via
   AC power system model and the current measurements to filter out bad
   historical data. Simulation results show that the new method can
   dramatically reduce the necessary computational time for online
   data-driven state estimation, while producing a highly accurate state
   estimate.}},

   that David Robertson has employed to quantify many metallurgical
   processes. In calcium treatment of alumina inclusions in aluminum-killed
   steels, solid CaS forms as an intermediate reaction product. During
   subsequent reaction, CaS disappears and calcium aluminate forms; at the
   same time, aluminum and sulfur dissolve in the steel. Kinetic analysis
   shows that the rate of this reaction is not limited by mass transfer of
   dissolved aluminum and sulfur away from the reacting inclusions. The
   reaction rate is likely limited by transport of dissolved calcium. This
   example also illustrates the use of FactSage macros for kinetic
   modeling.}},

   conditions to ensure that 1) is satisfied are obtained by reducing the
   original problem to the travelling salesman problem (TSP). For the case
   described in 2), sufficient conditions for the existence of a minimal
   network are shown to be equivalent to the existence of two disjoint
   solutions to the TSP. The results obtained are illustrated with an
   example from the area of cooperative path following of multiple
   networked vehicles by resorting to an approximate solution to the TSP.}},

   unacceptably reduces the fidelity of analytic conclusions. In this paper
   we discuss SiLK, a tool suite created to analyze this high-volume data

   are optimized to manage this Big Data problem. SiLK provides not just
   network flow capture and analysis, but also includes tools to analyze
   large sets and dictionaries that frequently relate to network flow data,
   incorporating higher-variety data sources. These tools integrate

Abstract = {{We present an iterative and unsupervised learning approach for the
   speaker verification task. In conventional speaker verification,
   Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) has been widely used
   as a supervised backend. However, PLDA requires fully labeled training
   data, which is often difficult to obtain in reality. To automatically
   retrieve the speaker labels of unlabeled training data, we propose to
   use the Affinity Propagation (AP) - a clustering method that takes
   pairwise data similarity as input - to generate the labels for the PLDA
   modeling. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy that
   incrementally updates the similarity input of the AP clustering with the
   previous iteration's PLDA scoring outputs. Moreover, we evaluate the
   performance of different PLDA scoring methods for the multiple
   enrollment task and show that the generalized hypothesis testing
   achieves the best results. Experiments were conducted on the NIST SRE
   2010 and the 2014 i-vector challenge database. The results show that our
   proposed iterative and unsupervised PLDA model learning approach
   outperformed the cosine similarity baseline by 35\% relatively.}},

Abstract = {{As energy efficient model-based controllers gain acceptance in the
   building domain, the problem of identifying accurate building models for
   control becomes even more important. Current literature provides
   analysis on the identifiability of building models. However, in
   practice, building models can be too large and too complex to properly
   identify parameter estimates. Towards that end, we present a strategy to
   decompose large building models into smaller building zone models so
   that these zone models can be individually identified. We find that the
   identifiability of zone models imply the identifiability of the building
   model, and we outline a decentralized approach to identify large
   building models. Finally, we demonstrate this approach with a simulated
   building example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the use of formal methods to design controllers for
   dynamic systems such that the closed-loop system satisfies given safety
   specifications. The usual approach to using formal methods for control
   applications is to verify safety for an abstraction of the closed-loop
   system using a candidate controller. We propose an alternative approach.
   The formal method is applied first to verify the safety of an entire
   class of possible controllers characterized by a nondeterministic
   input-output mapping call a control envelope. Safety of candidate
   controllers can then be verified by showing they are a refinement of the
   control envelope over an invariant set, rather than verifying the entire
   closed-loop system. Alternatively, the control envelope can be
   incorporated as an additional set of constraints directly in the
   controller synthesis procedure. Furthermore, this approach allows the
   designer to evaluate parameter trade-offs. Checking that the control
   envelope is satisfied is a static check on the input-output relation of
   the controller, rather than a dynamic check of closed-loop properties.
   The method is developed using differential dynamic logic (dL) and the
   associated theorem prover KeYMaera as the formal method and illustrated
   for an example of designing a safe strategy for an automotive
   cooperative intersection collision avoidance system for stop-sign assist
   (CICAS-SSA).}},

Abstract = {{Identifying a suspect wearing a mask (where only the suspect's
   periocular region is visible) is one of the toughest real-world
   challenges in biometrics that exist. In this paper, we present a
   practical method to hallucinate the full frontal face given only the
   periocular region of a face. This is an important problem faced in many
   law-enforcement applications on almost a daily basis. In such real-world
   situations, we only have access to the periocular region of a person's
   face. Unfortunately commercial matchers are unable to process these
   images successfully. We propose in this paper, an approach that will
   reconstruct the entire frontal face using just the periocular region. We
   empirically show that our reconstruction technique, based on a modified
   sparsifying dictionary learning algorithm, can effectively reconstruct
   faces which we show are actually very similar to the original
   ground-truth faces. Further, our method is open set, thus can
   reconstruct any face not seen in training. We show the real-world
   applicability of method by benchmarking face verification results using
   the reconstructed faces to show that they still match competitively
   compared to the original faces when evaluated under a large-scale face
   verification protocol such as NIST's FRGC protocol where over 256
   million face matches are made.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency policies are pursued as a way to provide affordable
   and sustainable energy services. Efficiency measures that reduce energy
   service costs will free up resources that can be spent in the form of
   increased consumption-either of that same good or service or of other
   goods and services that require energy (and that have associated
   emissions). This is called the rebound effect. There is still
   significant ambiguity about how the rebound effect should be defined,
   how we can measure it, and how we can characterize its uncertainty.
   Occasionally the debate regarding its importance reemerges, in part
   because the existing studies are not easily comparable. The scope,
   region, end-uses, time period of analysis, and drivers for efficiency
   improvements all differ widely from study to study. As a result, listing
   one single number for rebound effects would be misleading. Rebound
   effects are likely to depend on the specific attributes of the policies
   that trigger the efficiency improvement, but such factors are often
   ignored. Implications for welfare changes resulting from rebound have
   also been largely ignored in the literature until recently.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging applications such as cyber-physical systems and the electric
   smart grid have placed a greater demand for distributed protocols that
   can scale and adapt without centralized control, while providing
   throughput and delay guarantees. This paper proposes a formal approach
   to designing a distributed scheduling protocol. Similar to previous
   queue-length based CSMA-type schedulers, the protocol proposed in this
   paper is a CSMA-type scheduler that is throughput-optimal, generates
   collision-free schedules, is fully distributed, and adapts to traffic
   demands without explicitly knowing the arrival rates.
   However, our design takes a more formal approach, where the
   multi-information (a natural extension of mutual information) between
   links is minimized, rather than maximizing the entropy, as was done by
   previous CSMA-type schedulers. Zero multi-information corresponds to a
   fully distributed scheduler. The formal approach in this paper also
   admits side information (e.g., a universal clock from GPS) into the
   framework. Simulations show our proposed protocol has better delay
   performance compared with previous CSMA-type schedulers.}},

   practiced patient-selection criteria for this therapy. In this study we
   demonstrate the translational application of medical imaging biomarkers
   of phase of ventricular contraction quantified from cardiac magnetic
   resonance (CMR) imaging, in defining correlations between mechanical
   dysynchrony (MD) and electrical dyssynchrony, in an effort to identify a
   means to relate the best-practices for positioning an LV pacing lead
   (viz. localized to the latest mechanically activating, non-scarred
   regions) with the clinical guidelines for electrical dyssynchrony in a
   cohort of heart failure (HF). We retrospectively examine two cohorts of
   HF patients with different electrical conduction characteristics: a)
   Left bundle branch block (LBBB) and wide QRS interval -defining the
   Class I indication for CRT -characteristic of electrical dyssynchrony as
   evidenced from electrocardiograms; and b) HF with large antero-apical
   aneurysms and scarring but narrow QRS interval. Indices of mean and
   standard deviation in phase of regional contraction were examined across
   the entire LV of each patient, including scarred territories.
   Additionally, contraction timing delay between the septal and lateral
   cardiac walls were also examined in the basal LV territories which were
   free from adverse remodelling and scar. The results from this pilot
   study show that MD assessment using CMR imaging based biomarkers of
   phase of LV contraction is highly accurate in predicting electrical
   dyssynchrony defined by QRS duration >= 150 ms, with receiver operator
   characteristics evidencing close to perfect accuracy when MD was
   analyzed in LV territories which excluded scar.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend the basic edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi
   tessellation model (EWCVT) for image segmentation to a new advanced
   model, namely fuzzy and harmonic EWCVT model. This extended model
   introduces a fuzzy and harmonic form of clustering energy by combining
   the image intensity with cluster boundary information. Compared with the
   classic CVT and EWCVT methods, the fuzzy and harmonic EWCVT algorithm
   can not only overcome the sensitivity to the initialization and noise,
   but also improve the accuracy of clustering results, as verified in
   several biomedical images.}},

Abstract = {{Zernike phase contrast is a technique useful for nano-scale Xray imaging
   of materials with a low absorption coefficient. It enhances the image
   contrast using a phase ring. However, it also creates artifacts that
   hinder the use of traditional techniques for X-ray computed tomography
   (CT) image segmentation. We propose an image restoration method that
   models the phase contrast optics and minimizes an energy function.
   Though similar techniques have been used for visible light microscopy,
   this method deals with more spacious samples using an effective edge
   detection method. This paper demonstrates the removal of artifacts in
   multiple slices of phase contrast X-ray CT images and the potential in
   using this technique to aid CT image segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{In product design, designers often generate a large number of concepts
   in the form of sketches and drawings to develop and communicate their
   ideas. Concrete concepts typically evolve through a progressive
   refinement of initially coarse and ambiguous ideas. However, a lack of
   suitable means to visualize the emerging form at these early stages
   forces the designer to constantly maintain and negotiate an elusive
   mental image. To assist this process, we describe a predictive modeling
   technique that allows early, incomplete 2D sketches to be transformed
   into suggestive complete models. This helps designers take a sneak peek
   at the potential end result of a developing concept, without forcing
   them to commit to the suggestion. We demonstrate and discuss preliminary
   results of our technique on 2D shape design problems.}},
