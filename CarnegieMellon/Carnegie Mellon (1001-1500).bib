Abstract = {{The proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction of a quinone has
   been used to create a pH gradient capable of the active pumping of CO2
   through a liquid membrane. The quinone redox couples,
   hydroquinone/benzoquinone and
   2,6-dimethylbenzoquinone/2,6-dimethylhydroquinone, have been
   investigated in the proton transfer mechanisms associated with electron
   transfer in sodium bicarbonate solutions. These same conditions have
   then been applied to an active liquid membrane for proton pumping across
   a membrane electrode assembly under potential bias, acting as an active
   membrane for CO2 separation. Qualitative results are reported toward the
   development of an active redox membrane for CO2 separation from flue
   gas.}},

Title = {{Localized discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator over triangular mesh}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER AIDED GEOMETRIC DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{67-82}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Laplace-Beltrami operator is the foundation of describing geometric
   partial differential equations, and it also plays an important role in
   the fields of computational geometry, computer graphics and image
   processing, such as surface parameterization, shape analysis, matching
   and interpolation. However, constructing the discretized
   Laplace-Beltrami operator with convergent property has been an open
   problem. In this paper we propose a new discretization scheme of the
   Laplace-Beltrami operator over triangulated surfaces. We prove that our
   discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator converges to the
   Laplace-Beltrami operator at every point of an arbitrary smooth surface
   as the size of the triangular mesh over the surface tends to zero.
   Numerical experiments are conducted, which support the theoretical
   analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Taking the mesoscale to mean length and time scales at which a
   material's behavior is too complex to be understood by construction from
   the atomistic scale, we focus on threedimensional characterization and
   modeling of mesoscale responses of polycrystals to thermal and
   mechanical loading. Both elastic and plastic internal structural
   responses are now accessible via high-energy x-ray probes. The
   combination of diffraction experiments and computed tomography, for
   example, is yielding new insights into how void formation correlates
   with microstructural features such as grain boundaries and higher-order
   junctions. The resulting large, combined data sets allow for validation
   of micromechanical and thermal simulations. As detectors improve in
   resolution, quantum efficiency, and speed of readout, data rates and
   data volumes present computational challenges. Spatial resolutions
   approach one micrometer, while data sets span a cubic millimeter.
   Examples are given of applications to tensile deformation of copper,
   grain growth in nickel and titanium, and fatigue cracks in superalloys.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer electrolyte fuel cells are highly efficient and offer high power
   density, but high precious-metal loading and degradation of
   carbon-supported platinum (Pt) catalysts still hinder commercialization.
   Ionomer binders in conventional electrodes also introduce undesirable,
   high oxygen-transport resistance. This paper presents an alternative
   composite Nafion nanofiber catalyst support electrode, in which the
   nanofibers provide robust internal proton transport to a conformal Pt
   catalyst coating without impeding O-2 transport. The high-surface-area
   electrodes are prepared by solution casting ionomer onto a sacrificial
   template to simultaneously fabricate the nanofibers and the membrane.
   Thin Pt films are deposited on the nanofibers using either physical
   vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition. The electrochemical
   characterization of the nanofiber electrodes demonstrates the high
   current density and specific activity of this nanofiber approach
   relative to prior electrodes fabricated by depositing Pt directly onto
   other Nafion surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the nanoscale dimensions of the lubricant, overcoat, and media
   layers, the usual fast and efficient continuum models, such as Fourier
   law, fail to describe the thermal effects occurring during the
   heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) operation. Furthermore, in order
   to couple the local heat transfer to air bearing surface dynamics,
   thermal energy distribution to the surrounding environment should be
   understood apart from the heat penetration in the carbon overcoat/media
   layers. To shed light on this issue, we developed a hybridized
   multiscale methodology that couples a modified continuum approach that
   is capable of accommodating nanoscale heat transfer effects, known as
   Guyer-Krumhansl equation (G-K), with a mesoscale level model based on
   kinetic theory via lattice Boltzmann method. This modified Fourier
   equation in G-K form incorporating parameters from the Boltzmann
   transport equation can accurately capture the nanoscale energy carrier
   dynamics while retaining the computational efficiency of the
   conventional models like Fourier law. We investigate the overall heat
   transfer mechanism originating from the laser hotspot onto the disk via
   analyzing the disk surface temperature distribution of a realistic media
   FePt grain surface, as well as the heat loss to the surroundings,
   including the air bearing environment via convection and radiation.
   Thus, we obtain a possible design criterion, which relates the grain
   size to the heat retention in the disk after a pulsing laser is focused.
   We found out that increasing the grain size may reduce the amount of
   time the heat is stored in the magnetic layer, thereby increasing the
   durability of the disk in the HAMR environment. Our study can provide
   novel design criteria for efficient heat sink materials, for effective
   thermal management in the disk, as well as improving the media
   durability via introducing optimized grain structure parameters,
   including shape and size for preserving lateral temperature gradients at
   the desired location in the disk during the HAMR operation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding metal adsorbate interactions is key to controlling and
   improving the functionality of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in energy and
   biomedical application areas. However, adsorption is dependent on the
   morphological characteristics of the NPs, such as their size and shape,
   and in turn, the NP morphology is dependent on the chemical environment
   (presence of adsorbates). In this work, we introduce a novel and
   computationally tractable framework that is able to capture adsorption
   trends as a function of NP size and shape, including the impact of
   chemical environment on NP morphology. Our methodology is tested in the
   area of catalysis and specifically on the CO oxidation behavior on gold
   (Au), a highly structure-sensitive reaction. Our results reveal a strong
   correlation between the experimentally observed CO oxidation activity
   and the average CO adsorption (binding) energy on Au NPs enabling
   catalytic behavior prediction as a function of NP morphology. We
   demonstrate that the Au NP size plays a pivotal role on CO adsorption,
   whereas the Au NP shape appears to be less significant. Most
   importantly, the developed methodology introduces NP morphology effects
   on adsorption that are key for the rational design of materials with
   fine-tuned properties in applications ranging from catalysis to targeted
   medical imaging to drug delivery.}},

Title = {{A review of learning rates for electricity supply technologies}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{198-218}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A variety of mathematical models have been proposed to characterize and
   quantify the dependency of electricity supply technology costs on
   various drivers of technological change. The most prevalent model form,
   called a learning curve, or experience curve, is a log-linear equation
   relating the unit cost of a technology to its cumulative installed
   capacity or electricity generated. This one-factor model is also the
   most common method used to represent endogenous technical change in
   large-scale energy-economic models that inform energy planning and
   policy analysis. A characteristic parameter is the ``learning rate,{''}
   defined as the fractional reduction in cost for each doubling of
   cumulative production or capacity. In this paper, a literature review of
   the learning rates reported for 11 power generation technologies
   employing an array of fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy
   sources is presented. The review also includes multi-factor models
   proposed for some energy technologies, especially two-factor models
   relating cost to cumulative expenditures for research and development
   (R\&D) as well as the cumulative installed capacity or electricity
   production of a technology. For all technologies studied, we found
   substantial variability (as much as an order of magnitude) in reported
   learning rates across different studies. Such variability is not readily
   explained by systematic differences in the time intervals, geographic
   regions, choice of independent variable, or other parameters of each
   study. This uncertainty in learning rates, together with other
   limitations of current learning curve formulations, suggests the need
   for much more careful and systematic examination of the influence of how
   different factors and assumptions affect policy-relevant outcomes
   related to the future choice and cost of electricity supply and other
   energy technologies. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical stresses on the myocyte nucleus have been associated with
   several diseases and potentially transduce mechanical stimuli into
   cellular responses. Although a number of physical links between the
   nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic filaments have been identified,
   previous studies have focused on the mechanical properties of individual
   components of the nucleus, such as the nuclear envelope and lamin
   network. The mechanical interaction between the cytoskeleton and
   chromatin on nuclear deformability remains elusive. Here, we
   investigated how cytoskeletal and chromatin structures influence nuclear
   mechanics in cardiac myocytes. Rapid decondensation of chromatin and
   rupture of the nuclear membrane caused a sudden expansion of DNA, a
   consequence of prestress exerted on the nucleus. To characterize the
   prestress exerted on the nucleus, we measured the shape and the
   stiffness of isolated nuclei and nuclei in living myocytes during
   disruption of cytoskeletal, myofibrillar, and chromatin structure. We
   found that the nucleus in myocytes is subject to both tensional and
   compressional prestress and its deformability is determined by a balance
   of those opposing forces. By developing a computational model of the
   prestressed nucleus, we showed that cytoskeletal and chromatin
   prestresses create vulnerability in the nuclear envelope. Our studies
   suggest the cytoskeletal-nuclear-chromatin interconnectivity may play an
   important role in mechanics of myocyte contraction and in the
   development of laminopathies by lamin mutations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate three key features of oxide-based

   filamentary oscillations in TaOx; 2) the highest frequency achieved by
   oxide-based oscillators; and 3) a study with linear (resistor) and
   nonlinear (transistor) ballasts to clearly understand the role of
   filament dynamics in scaling. These oscillators show frequency
   tunability over the range of 20 kHz-250 MHz, with 250 MHz being the
   highest reported frequency for this class of oscillators. Different
   types of ballasts show frequency tunability using two distinct methods:
   1) by tuning the channel resistance of the transistor and 2) by
   increasing the rail voltage across the ballast-device pair. This sheds
   new light on the oscillator dynamics for dense oscillator arrays aimed
   at oscillatory neural networks and other applications.}},

Title = {{Enhancing the Structural Performance of Additively Manufactured Objects
   Through Build Orientation Optimization}},

Abstract = {{Additively manufactured objects often exhibit directional dependencies
   in their structure due to the layered nature of the printing process.
   While this dependency has a significant impact on the object's
   functional performance, the problem of finding the best build
   orientation to maximize structural robustness remains largely unsolved.
   We introduce an optimization algorithm that addresses this issue by
   identifying the build orientation that maximizes the factor of safety
   (FS) of an input object under prescribed loading and boundary
   configurations. First, we conduct a minimal number of physical
   experiments to characterize the anisotropic material properties. Next,
   we use a surrogate-based optimization method to determine the build
   orientation that maximizes the minimum factor safety. The
   surrogate-based optimization starts with a small number of finite
   element (FE) solutions corresponding to different build orientations.
   The initial solutions are progressively improved with the addition of
   new solutions until the optimum orientation is computed. We demonstrate
   our method with physical experiments on various test models from
   different categories. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of our
   method by comparing the failure characteristics of parts printed in
   different orientations.}},

Abstract = {{Ice storms can produce extensive damage to physical infrastructure,
   cause deaths and injuries, and result in large losses through business
   interruption. Total costs can be billions of dollars. If society is to
   increase its resilience to such events, we need a better understanding
   of the likely frequency, intensity and geographical distribution of ice
   storms. Unfortunately, due to competing temperature and precipitation
   effects as well as surface effects, it is unclear how climate change
   will affect the frequency, intensity and geographical distribution of
   ice storms. Here we perform a simple ``thought experiment{''} using
   vertical temperature profile data to explore how these might change
   given plausible future temperature regimes. As temperatures increase, we
   find a poleward shift and a shift toward winter. Furthermore, southern
   locations experience fewer ice storms at all times of the year, while
   northern areas experience fewer in the spring and fall and more in the
   winter. Using an approximation for surface effects, we estimate that a
   temperature increase will result in an increased frequency of ice storm
   events throughout much of the winter across eastern Canada and in the
   U.S. west of the Appalachian Mountains as far south as Tennessee. Future
   changes in variability may enhance or moderate these changes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a computational framework for automatically
   generating kinematic models of planar mechanical linkages from raw
   images. The hallmark of our approach is a novel combination of
   supervised learning methods for detecting mechanical parts (e.g. joints,
   rigid bodies) with the optimizing power of a multiobjective evolutionary
   algorithm, which concurrently maximizes image consistency and mechanical
   feasibility. A rigorous set of experiments was conducted to
   systematically evaluate the performance of each phase in our framework,
   comparing various combinations of joint and body detection schemes and
   feasibility constraints. Precision-recall curves are used to assess
   object detection performance. For the optimization, in addition to
   standard accuracy measures such as top-N accuracy, we introduce a new
   performance metric called user effort ratio that quantifies the amount
   of user interaction required to correct an inaccurate optimization
   solution. Current state-of-the-art performance is achieved with (i) one
   (or a cascade of) support vector machines for joint detection, (ii)
   foreground extraction to reduce false positives, (iii) supervised body
   detection using normalized geodesic time, distance, and detected joint
   confidence, and (iv) feasibility constraints derived from graph theory.
   The proposed framework generalizes moderately well from textbook
   graphics to hand-drawn sketches, and user effort ratio results
   demonstrate the potential power of an interactive system in which simple
   user interactions complement computer recognition for fast kinematic
   modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the secure and reliable connectivity of wireless sensor

   predistribution scheme of Chan, Perrig, and Song, and unreliable
   wireless links are represented by independent ON/OFF channels. Modeling
   the network by an intersection of a random K-out graph and an
   Erdos-Renyi graph, we present scaling conditions (on the number of nodes
   n, the scheme parameter K, and the probability p of a wireless channel
   being on), such that the resulting graph contains no nodes with a degree
   less than k with high probability. Results are given in the form of
   zero-one laws with n getting large, and are shown to improve the
   previous results by Yagan and Makowski on the absence of isolated nodes
   (i.e., absence of nodes with degree zero) in the same model. Through
   simulations, the established zero-one laws are also shown to hold for
   the property of k-connectivity, i.e., the property that graph remains
   connected despite the deletion of any k - 1 nodes or edges.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT Brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs) are challenging due to a
   higher symptomatic hemorrhage rate and potential morbidity associated
   with their resection. The authors aimed to preoperatively define the
   relationship of CMs to the perilesional corticospinal tracts (CSTs) by
   obtaining qualitative and quantitative data using high-definition fiber
   tractography. These data were examined postoperatively by using
   longitudinal scans and in relation to patients' symptomatology. The
   extent of involvement of the CST was further evaluated longitudinally
   using the automated ``diffusion connectometry{''} analysis.
   METHODS Fiber tractography was performed with DSI Studio using a
   quantitative anisotropy (QA)-based generalized deterministic tracking
   algorithm. Qualitatively; CST was classified as being ``disrupted{''}
   and/or ``displaced.{''} Quantitative analysis involved obtaining mean QA
   values for the CST and its perilesional and nonperilesional segments.
   The contralateral CST was used for comparison. Diffusion connectometry
   analysis included comparison of patients' data with a template from 90
   normal subjects.
   RESULTS Three patients (mean age 22 years) with symptomatic
   pontomesencephalic hemorrhagic CMs and varying degrees of hemiparesis
   were identified. The mean follow-up period was 37.3 months.
   Qualitatively, CST was partially disrupted and displaced in all.
   Direction of the displacement was different in each case and
   progressively improved corresponding with the patient's neurological
   status. No patient experienced neurological decline related to the
   resection. The perilesional mean QA percentage decreases supported tract
   disruption and decreased further over the follow-up period (Case 1,
   26\%-49\%; Case 2, 35\%-66\%; and Case 3, 63\%-78\%). Diffusion
   connectometry demonstrated rostrocaudal involvement of the CST
   consistent with the quantitative data.
   CONCLUSIONS Hemorrhagic brainstem CMs can disrupt and displace
   perilesional white matter tracts with the latter occurring in
   unpredictable directions. This requires the use, of tractography to
   accurately define their orientation to optimize surgical entry point,
   minimize morbidity, and enhance neurological outcomes. Observed
   anisotropy decreases in the perilesional segments are consistent with
   neural injury following hemorrhagic insults. A model using these values
   in different CST segments can be used to longitudinally monitor its
   craniocaudal integrity. Diffusion connectometry is a complementary
   approach providing longitudinal information on the rostrocaudal
   involvement of the CST.}},

Abstract = {{Complex systems are challenging to design, particularly when they
   contain multi-level organizations with non-obvious relationships among
   design components. Here, we investigate engineering students' capacity
   to search for optimal nanoscale biosystem designs with stochastic
   component and system behaviors. The study aims to characterize
   information types that facilitate human learning and improve their
   complex system understanding and design proficiency. It is hypothesized
   that learning parametric system relationships and/or inter-level causal
   mechanisms improves design proficiency; these relationships and
   mechanisms are teachable through software interfaces. Two contrasting
   learning/design interfaces were developed that presented differing
   information types: an interface with performance charts that emphasized
   parametric relationship learning and an interface with agent-based
   animations that emphasized inter-level causality learning. Users
   improved on pre-/post-learning design tasks with both interfaces; users
   who demonstrated inter-level causal relationship understanding, which
   occurred primarily with the animation interface, had greater
   improvement. All users were then presented contrasting animations of
   systems with opposing emergent behaviors, resulting in many more
   participants demonstrating an understanding of inter-level causal
   behaviors. These findings reveal the difficulties in understanding and
   designing multi-level systems and that interactive software tools may
   convey crucial information that supports engineering design,
   particularly with respect to the development of reasoning skills for how
   system components relate across levels.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure effects in RE-lean Nd2Fe14B-based nanocomposite systems
   developed from nanocrystalline precursors are studied in this work. In
   particular, the pressure dependence of the alpha -> gamma phase
   transformation in the Fe phase is examined along with the suppression of
   coarsening (growth) in both phases at higher pressures. By synchrotron
   X-ray diffraction we determined that the alpha -> gamma-phase
   transformations occur at temperatures of 1120 K (847 A degrees C) at 1
   GPa and 960 K (687 A degrees C) at 5 GPa. A composition rich in Fe
   appears to have an similar to 373 K (100 A degrees C) range of
   temperature over which the alpha, gamma-phases coexist for atmospheric
   pressure. We compare our experimental data with other reported
   observations for Fe and with equations of state (EOS) determined from
   first principle calculations. From this study we observe an important
   feature: the phase transition begins at a higher temperature in flake
   samples than in powder samples. We consider the magnetic contribution to
   the heat capacity in the EOS for Fe and describe the implications of
   dipole moments on the slope of the Clapeyron equation for the P-T phase
   diagram in Fe. Additionally, the phase transition occurs at temperatures
   where growth by diffusional coarsening is also operative. This is
   significant since the size of soft Fe nanostructures is important to
   spring exchange. Suppression of the phase transition and Fe coarsening
   at higher pressures suggest that there may be interesting mechanical
   processing routes to be investigated to optimize spring exchange effects
   in Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{This study contributes a stochastic, multi-objective adaptation of the
   classic environmental economics Lake Problem as a computationally simple
   but mathematically challenging benchmarking problem. The Lake Problem
   considers a hypothetical town by a lake, which hopes to maximize its
   economic benefit without crossing a nonlinear, and potentially
   irreversible, pollution threshold. Optimization objectives are maximize
   economic benefit, minimize phosphorus in the lake, maximize the
   probability of avoiding the pollution threshold, and minimize the
   probability of drastic phosphorus loading reductions in a given year.
   Uncertainty is introduced through a stochastic natural phosphorus
   inflow. We performed comprehensive diagnostics using six algorithms: the
   Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), MOEA/D,
   epsilon-MOEA, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII),
   epsilon-NSGAII, and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3) to
   evaluate their controllability, reliability, efficiency, and
   effectiveness. Our results show only the self-adaptive search of the
   Borg MOEA was capable of performing well on this nontrivial benchmarking
   problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state port-flow simulations with static valve lift are often
   utilized to optimize the performance of intake system of an internal
   combustion engine. Generally, increase in valve lift results in higher
   mass flow rate through the valve. But in certain cases, mass flow rate
   can actually decrease with increased valve lift, caused by separation of
   turbulent flow at the valve seat. Prediction of this phenomenon using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models is not trivial. It is found
   that the computational mesh significantly influences the simulation
   results. A series of steady-state port-flow simulations are carried out
   using a commercial CFD code. Several mesh topologies are applied for the
   simulations. The predicted results are compared with available
   experimental data from flow bench measurements. It is found that the
   flow separation and reduction in mass flow rate with increased valve
   lift can be predicted when high mesh density is used in the proximity of
   the valve seat and the walls of the intake port. Higher mesh density
   also gives better predictions of mass flow rate compared to the
   experiments, but only for high valve lifts. For low valve lifts, the
   error in predicted flow rate is close to 13\%.}},

Abstract = {{To date, methods used to disambiguate inventors in the United States
   Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database have been rule- and
   threshold-based (requiring and leveraging expert knowledge) or
   semi-supervised algorithms trained on statistically generated artificial
   labels. Using a large, hand-disambiguated set of 98,762 labeled USPTO
   inventor records from the field of optoelectronics consisting of four
   sub-samples of inventors with varying characteristics (Akinsanmi et al.,
   2014) and a second large, hand-disambiguated set of 53,378 labeled
   inventor records corresponding to a subset of academics in the life
   sciences (Azoulay et al., 2012), we provide the first supervised
   learning approach for USPTO inventor disambiguation. Using these two
   sets of inventor records, we also provide extensive evaluations of both
   our algorithm and three examples of prior approaches to USPTO
   disambiguation arguably representative of the range of approaches used
   to-date. We show that the three past disambiguation algorithms we
   evaluate demonstrate biases depending on the feature distribution of the
   target disambiguation population. Both the rule- and threshold-based
   methods and the semi-supervised approach perform poorly (10-22\% false
   negative error rates) on a random sample of optoelectronics inventors -
   arguably the closest of our sub-samples to what might be expected of the
   majority of inventors in the USPTO (based on disambiguation-relevant
   metrics). The supervised learning approach, using random forests and
   trained on our labeled optoelectronics dataset, consistently maintains
   error rates below 3\% across all of our available samples. We make
   public both our labeled optoelectronics inventor records and our code to
   build supervised learning models and disambiguate inventors (see
   http://www.cmu.edu/epp/disambiguation). Our code also allows users to
   implement supervised learning approaches with their own representative
   labeled training data. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{963-969}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reanalysis data sets have become a popular data source for large-scale
   wind power analyses because they cover large areas and long time spans,
   but those data are uncertain representations of ``true{''} wind speeds.
   In this work we develop a model that systematically quantifies the
   uncertainties across many sites and corrects for biases of the
   reanalysis data. We apply this model to 32 years of reanalysis data for
   1002 plausible wind-plant sites in the U.S. Great Plains to estimate
   variability of wind energy generation and the smoothing effect of
   aggregating distant wind plants. We find the coefficient of variation
   (COV) of annual energy generation of individual wind plants in the Great
   Plains is 5-12\%, but the COV of all those plants aggregated together is
   3.0\%. The year-to-year variability (of interest to system planners)
   shows a maximum step change of similar to 10\%, and the wind power
   varies by +/- 7.5\% over a 32-year period. Similarly, the average
   variability of quarterly cash flow to equity investors in a single wind
   plant is 29\%, but that can be reduced to 18-21\% by creating small
   portfolios of two wind plants selected from regions with low
   correlations of wind speed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Formal analyses can be valuable aids to decision-making if their limits
   are understood. Those limits arise from the two forms of subjectivity
   found in all analyses: ethical judgments, made when setting the terms of
   an analysis, and scientific judgments, made when conducting it. As
   formal analysis has assumed a larger role in policy decisions, awareness
   of those judgments has grown, as have methods for making them. The
   present review traces these developments, using examples that illustrate
   the issues that arise when designing, executing, and interpreting
   analyses. It concludes with lessons learned from the science and
   practice of analysis. One common thread in these lessons is the
   importance of collaborative processes, whereby analysts and
   decision-makers educate one another about their respective needs and

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle-sized powders have seen more and more use in many of
   today's applications. As particle size decreases, many properties change
   including the ability to embed the small particles in liquids and other
   media. With decreasing size, however, surface energy becomes more
   important and can dictate the final shape of the particle. In
   applications based on polar molecules attaching to the nanoparticle
   surface, the surface morphology can become a key design parameter. A
   nucleation and growth model has been constructed for truncated
   body-centered cubic derivative materials, along with an update to
   previously published work on face-centered cubic materials. The model
   shows that for (110)- and (111)-truncations of a cube with a specified
   surface energy for each surface, the critical nuclei and equilibrium
   growth shapes are the same, supporting the theory of self-similar growth
   that had only been mentioned previously, but never proven. In this
   analysis, saddle points play an important role in determining the
   critical nuclei for comparison with the equilibrium growth shapes.}},

Abstract = {{Proper orthogonal modes (POMs) obtained through proper orthogonal
   decomposition (POD), as a statistical pattern analysis technique, have
   been physically demonstrated to represent the dominant structure of the
   dynamic response data in previous study. In this paper, a novel
   POMs-based damage identification approach for shear-type buildings is
   developed. First, POMs of acceleration dynamic response of a shear-type
   building under Gauss White Noise (GWN) ground motion are obtained using
   singular value decomposition; then, the dominant POMs of acceleration
   response are used to identify the damage locations and severities
   through particle swarm optimization (P5O) algorithm. This proposed
   approach is applied to two three-story shear-type buildings in numerical
   simulation and a three-story shear-type frame in experimental study. The
   results demonstrate that the locations and severities of structural
   damage in shear-type buildings can be effectively identified by using
   the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   microstructure annealed at 800 degrees C, twinned grains form along
   triple lines. Both the grain boundary character and the grain boundary
   dihedral angles were measured before and after the twin formed. These
   measurements make it possible to show that although each new twinned
   grain increases the total grain boundary area, it reduces the total
   grain boundary energy. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new approach of isogeometric analysis (IGA)
   based on the extended Loop's subdivision scheme. This strategy allows us
   to integrate geometric modeling and physical simulation. The geometries
   can be open and with holes. Our proposed method performs geometric
   modeling via the extended Loop's subdivision which allows arbitrary
   topological structure, treats concave/convex vertices, and has at least
   C-1-continuity everywhere. It is capable of handling domains with
   arbitrary shaped boundary represented by piecewise cubic B-spline
   curves. We apply an efficient integration technique to the domain
   elements with a fast evaluation technique for closed Loop's subdivision
   surfaces. As an example, the Poisson equation is solved on three planar
   domains. We develop the approximate estimation of finite element in the
   limit function space of the extended Loop's subdivision. A detailed
   study on the convergence character is given with the comparison to the
   classical finite element analysis (FEA) with linear elements. Numerical
   experiments are consistent with our theoretical results. It shows that
   compared with the FEA with linear elements, the IGA scheme based on
   extended Loop's subdivision converges faster and behaves more robustly
   with respect to the mesh quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Conducting an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in water
   provides several intriguing challenges. In order to attain a deeper
   understanding of the mechanism of aqueous ATRP, with particular
   attention to the reasons for the potential loss of control, a systematic
   investigation was carried out with three copper-amine
   catalysts({[}(CuL)-L-II](2+), L = PMDETA, TPMA and Me6TREN). The
   association constants (K-x) of {[}(CuL)-L-II](2+) and {[}(CuL)-L-I](+)
   with X- and OH-, as well as the relative stabilities and redox
   properties of the complexes, were determined as a function of both
   {[}X-] and pH. In addition, rate constants and equilibrium constants of
   disproportionation for all three {[}(CuL)-L-I](+) complexes were
   measured. Finally, ATRP equilibrium constants (K-ATRP) were estimated
   for all complexes, using 2-hydroxyethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (HEBiB) as
   initiator. The primary factors affecting control in aqueous ATRP were
   identified as catalyst instability at both low and high pH, easy
   dissociation of deactivator (K-x < 15), very high K-ATRP and fast
   disproportionation of {[}(CuL)-L-I](+) Overall, the results obtained in
   this study provide a set of guidelines for a well-controlled aqueous
   ATRP. The guidelines were used to conduct several efficient
   electrochemically mediated aqueous ATRP experiments with oligo(ethylene
   oxide) methyl ether methacrylate as monomer, HEBiB as initiator and
   copper complexes with three different ligands. A successful ATRP in a
   strongly acidic environment (pH 1.5) is reported for the first time,
   contrary to what was believed until now, indicating that ATRPs can be
   easily controlled in acidic conditions, while high pH should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The peak floor acceleration (PFA) is a critical parameter influencing
   the performance of non-structural elements in buildings. This paper
   develops a response spectrum analysis method based on the complete
   quadratic combination (CQC) rule to estimate the PFA. The method
   accounts for the rigid contribution of truncated higher modes and the
   cross-correlations between all pairs of modes. The approximation is
   introduced in the time domain and then formulated in the frequency
   domain by CQC. Application of the method to a continuous cantilever beam
   idealizing a building with shear walls is presented and compared with
   alternative formulations. The proposed method is able to provide a
   consistent estimation of the PFA along the entire structure, not only
   where the PFA is principally influenced by the first few flexible modes
   but also where the PFA is mainly related to the rigid response of the
   structure, for example, near its base. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{As the phosphoinositol-3-kinase antagonist in the PI3K pathway, the PTEN
   tumor suppressor exerts phosphatase activity on
   diacylphosphatidylinositol triphosphate in the plasma membrane. Even
   partial loss of this activity enhances tumorigenesis, but a mechanistic
   basis for this aspect of PTEN physiology has not yet been established.
   It was recently proposed that PTEN mutations have dominant-negative
   effects in cancer via PTEN dimers. We show that PTEN forms homodimers in
   vitro, and determine a structural model of the complex from SAXS and
   Rosetta docking studies. Our findings shed new light on the cellular
   control mechanism of PTEN activity. Phosphorylation of the unstructured
   C-terminal tail of PTEN reduces PTEN activity, and this result was
   interpreted as a blockage of the PTEN membrane binding interface through
   this tail. The results presented here instead suggest that the
   C-terminal tail functions in stabilizing the homodimer, and that tail
   phosphorylation interferes with this stabilization.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{111}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Experimental studies recently performed on single cancer and healthy
   cells have demonstrated that the former are about 70\% softer than the
   latter, regardless of the cell lines and the measurement technique used
   for determining the mechanical properties. At least in principle, the
   difference in cell stiffness might thus be exploited to create
   mechanical-based targeting strategies for discriminating neoplastic
   transformations within human cell populations and for designing
   innovative complementary tools to cell-specific molecular tumour
   markers, leading to possible applications in the diagnosis and treatment
   of cancer diseases. With the aim of characterizing and gaining insight
   into the overall frequency response of single-cell systems to mechanical
   stimuli (typically low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound), a generalized
   viscoelastic paradigm, combining classical and spring-pot-based models,
   is introduced for modelling this problem by neglecting the cascade of
   mechanobiological events involving the cell nucleus, cytoskeleton,
   elastic membrane and cytosol. Theoretical results show that differences
   in stiffness, experimentally observed ex vivo and in vitro, allow
   healthy and cancer cells to be discriminated, by highlighting
   frequencies (from tens to hundreds of kilohertz) associated with
   resonance-like phenomena-prevailing on thermal fluctuations-that could
   be helpful in targeting and selectively attacking tumour cells.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing evidence of global warming, many cities have focused
   attention on response plans to address their populations'
   vulnerabilities. Despite expected increased frequency and intensity of
   heat waves, the health impacts of such events in urban areas can be
   minimized with careful policy and economic investments. We focus on
   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and ask two questions. First, what are the top
   factors contributing to heat vulnerability and how do these
   characteristics manifest geospatially throughout Pittsburgh? Second,
   assuming the City wishes to deploy additional cooling centers, what
   placement will optimally address the vulnerability of the at risk
   populations? We use national census data, ArcGIS geospatial modeling,
   and statistical analysis to determine a range of heat vulnerability
   indices and optimal cooling center placement. We find that while
   different studies use different data and statistical calculations, all
   methods tested locate additional cooling centers at the confluence of
   the three rivers (Downtown), the northeast side of Pittsburgh
   (Shadyside/Highland Park), and the southeast side of Pittsburgh
   (Squirrel Hill). This suggests that for Pittsburgh, a researcher could
   apply the same factor analysis procedure to compare data sets for
   different locations and times; factor analyses for heat vulnerability
   are more robust than previously thought.}},

Title = {{Intermediate Volatility Organic Compound Emissions from On-Road Diesel
   Vehicles: Chemical Composition, Emission Factors, and Estimated
   Secondary Organic Aerosol Production}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{11516-11526}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Emissions of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) from five
   on-road diesel vehicles and one off-road diesel engine were
   characterized during dynamometer testing. The testing evaluated the
   effects of driving cycles, fuel composition and exhaust aftertreatment
   devices. On average, more than 90\% of the IVOC emissions were not
   identified on a molecular basis, instead appearing as an unresolved
   complex mixture (UCM) during gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry
   analysis. Fuel-based emissions factors (EFs) of total IVOCs (speciated +
   unspeciated) depend strongly on aftertreatment technology and driving
   cycle. Total-IVOC emissions from vehicles equipped with catalyzed diesel
   particulate filters (DPF) are substantially lower (factor of 7 to 28,
   depending on driving cycle) than from vehicles without any exhaust
   aftertreatment. Total-IVOC emissions from creep and idle operations are
   substantially higher than emissions from high-speed operations. Although
   the magnitude of the total-IVOC emissions can vary widely, there is
   little variation in the IVOC composition across the set of tests. The
   new emissions data are combined with published yield data to investigate
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. SOA production from
   unspeciated IVOCs is estimated using surrogate compounds, which are
   assigned based on gas-chromatograph retention time and mass spectral
   signature of the IVOC UCM. IVOCs contribute the vast majority of the SOA
   formed from exhaust from on-road diesel vehicles. The estimated SOA
   production is greater than predictions by previous studies and
   substantially higher than primary organic aerosol. Catalyzed DPFs
   substantially reduce SOA formation potential of diesel exhaust, except
   at low speed operations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a simultaneous process optimization and heat
   integration approach, which can be used directly with the rigorous
   models in process simulators. In this approach, the overall process is
   optimized utilizing external derivative-free optimizers, which interact
   directly with the process simulation. The heat integration subproblem is
   formulated as an LP model and solved simultaneously during optimization
   of the flowsheet to update the minimum utility and heat exchanger area
   targets. A piecewise linear approximation for the composite curve is
   applied to obtain more accurate heat integration results. This paper
   describes the application of this simultaneous approach for three cases:
   a recycle process, a separation process and a power plant with carbon
   capture. Case study results indicate that this simultaneous approach is
   relatively easy to implement and achieves higher profit and lower
   operating cost and, in the case of the power plant example, higher net
   efficiency than the sequential approach. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A previously developed equation-based flowsheet optimization framework
   is extended and applied to design sub-ambient separation systems for
   oxy-fired coal power systems with carbon capture. Unlike most commercial
   flowsheet design and optimization tools, the proposed methods use exact
   derivatives and large-scale nonlinear programming algorithms to solve
   large flowsheet design problems with many degrees of freedom, including
   the simultaneous design of air separation units (ASUs) and their
   accompanying multistream heat exchangers. Emphasis is placed on
   additional model improvements regarding thermodynamic calculations. In
   order to maintain differentiability, complementarity constraints are
   used to model switches, including vanishing and reappearing phases.
   Nevertheless, these complementarity constraints may construct trivial
   phase equilibrium solutions, and a procedure based on embedded bubble
   and dew points calculations is proposed to avoid them. Furthermore,
   additional complementarity constraints for the cubic equation of state
   model are proposed to ensure correct phase identification in the
   supercritical region. Finally, the efficacy of these new models are
   demonstrated by optimization of the CO2 processing unit and compression
   train for an oxy-fired power plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microchannels are used for the cooling of electronic chips. However, the
   three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling of the large
   number of channels in a full chip requires a huge number of meshes and
   computation time. Although porous media modeling of microchannels can
   significantly reduce the effort of simulation, most previous porous
   media models are based upon the assumption that the surface heat flux or
   temperature is uniform on the chip. In reality, the heat flux on the
   chip is usually highly nonuniform. In the present study, the porous
   media model considers the simultaneously developing entrance effect at
   the microchannel inlet and the thermally developing entrance effect due
   to the severe heat flux variation along the channel. Duhamel's integral
   is used to provide the Nusselt number distribution corresponding to the
   nonuniform heat flux distribution along the channel. The computing cost
   of this modeling method is only about 1\% of the three-dimensional
   conjugate simulation. This porous media thermal modeling method is
   applied to model two full-scale electronic chips with realistic power
   distributions on the surfaces, and temperature maps are generated. The
   porous media thermal modeling offered by this study is an accurate and
   efficient alternative for modeling the electronic chips cooled by
   microchannels.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an open-loop and a closed-loop stochastic event-triggered
   sensor schedule for remote state estimation. Both schedules overcome the
   essential difficulties of existing schedules in recent literature works
   where, through introducing a deterministic event-triggering mechanism,
   the Gaussian property of the innovation process is destroyed which
   produces a challenging nonlinear filtering problem that cannot be solved
   unless approximation techniques are adopted. The proposed stochastic
   eventtriggered sensor schedules eliminate such approximations. Under
   these two schedules, the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator and
   its estimation error covariance matrix at the remote estimator are given
   in a closed-form. The stability in terms of the expected error
   covariance and the sample path of the error covariance for both
   schedules is studied. We also formulate and solve an optimization
   problem to obtain the minimum communication rate under some estimation
   quality constraint using the open-loop sensor schedule. A numerical
   comparison between the closed-loop MMSE estimator and a typical
   approximate MMSE estimator with deterministic event-triggered sensor
   schedule, in a problem setting of target tracking, shows the superiority
   of the proposed sensor schedule.}},

Abstract = {{In the U.S., the current practice of analyzing the structural integrity
   of embankment dams relies primarily on manual a posteriori analysis of
   instrument data by engineers, leaving much room for improvement through
   the application of advanced data analysis techniques. In this research,
   different types of anomaly detection techniques are examined in an
   effort to propose which data analytics are appropriate for various
   anomaly scenarios as well as piezometer locations. Moreover, both the
   parametric (Auto Regressive {[}AR] and Moving Principal Component
   Analysis {[}MPCA]) and nonparametric (Kullback-Leibler Divergence
   {[}KL]) techniques are applied in order to test if the widely-held
   assumptions about piezometer data, i.e., linearity between piezometer
   data and pool levels, as well as normally distributed piezometer data,
   are necessary in the anomaly detection task. In general, ML performs
   better than MPCA and AR, and delivers more consistent results throughout
   the different piezometers and anomaly scenarios. Given that KL is a
   nonparametric technique, the authors conclude that the prior assumptions
   about piezometer data do not always provide the best performance for
   anomaly prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Building information models (BIMs) provide opportunities to serve as an
   information repository to store and deliver as-built information. Since
   a building is not always constructed exactly as the design information
   specifies, there will be discrepancies between a BIM created in the
   design phase (called as-designed BIM) and the as-built conditions. Point
   clouds captured by laser scans can be used as a reference to update an
   as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM (i.e., the BIM that captures the
   as-built information). Occlusions and construction progress prevent a
   laser scan performed at a single point in time to capture a complete
   view of building components. Progressively scanning a building during
   the construction phase and combining the progressively captured point
   cloud data together can provide the geometric information missing in the
   point cloud data captured previously. However, combining all point cloud
   data will result in large file sizes and might not always guarantee
   additional building component information. This paper provides the
   details of an approach developed to help engineers decide on which
   progressively captured point cloud data to combine in order to get more
   geometric information and eliminate large file sizes due to redundant
   point clouds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Geographic smoothing of solar PV: results from Gujarat}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We examine the potential for geographic smoothing of solar photovoltaic
   (PV) electricity generation using 13 months of observed power production
   from utility-scale plants in Gujarat, India. To our knowledge, this is
   the first published analysis of geographic smoothing of solar PV using
   actual generation data at high time resolution from utility-scale solar
   PV plants. Weuse geographic correlation and Fourier transform estimates
   of the power spectral density (PSD) to characterize the observed
   variability of operating solar PV plants as a function of time scale.
   Most plants show a spectrum that is linear in the log-log domain at high
   frequencies f, ranging from f(-1.23) to f(-1.56) (slopes of -1.23 and
   -1.56), thus exhibiting more relative variability at high frequencies
   than exhibited by wind plants. PSDs for large PV plants have a steeper
   slope than those for small plants, hence more smoothing at short time
   scales. Interconnecting 20 Gujarat plants yields a f(-1.66) spectrum,
   reducing fluctuations at frequencies corresponding to 6 h and 1 h by
   23\% and 45\%, respectively. Half of this smoothing can be obtained
   through connecting 4-5 plants; reaching marginal improvement of 1\% per
   added plant occurs at 12-14 plants. The largest plant (322 MW) showed an
   f(-1.76) spectrum. This suggests that in Gujarat the potential for
   smoothing is limited to that obtained by one large plant.}},

Title = {{Microsecond-sustained lasing from colloidal quantum dot solids}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots have grown in interest as materials for light
   amplification and lasing in view of their bright photoluminescence,
   convenient solution processing and size-controlled spectral tunability.
   To date, lasing in colloidal quantum dot solids has been limited to the
   nanosecond temporal regime, curtailing their application in systems that
   require more sustained emission. Here we find that the chief cause of
   nanosecond-only operation has been thermal runaway: the combination of
   rapid heat injection from the pump source, poor heat removal and a
   highly temperature-dependent threshold. We show microsecond-sustained
   lasing, achieved by placing ultra-compact colloidal quantum dot films on
   a thermally conductive substrate, the combination of which minimizes
   heat accumulation. Specifically, we employ inorganic-halide-capped
   quantum dots that exhibit high modal gain (1,200 cm(-1)) and an ultralow
   amplified spontaneous emission threshold (average peak power of similar
   to 50 kWcm (-2)) and rely on an optical structure that dissipates heat
   while offering minimal modal loss.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental protection and restoration are some of the major
   challenges faced by our society. To address this problem, it is
   fundamental to understand pro-environmental behaviors in the population,
   as well as the factors that determine them. There are, however, very few
   studies conducted in Latin America that are focused in understanding the
   environmental behavior of its citizens. The main goal of this research
   was to study the environmental behaviors of a Chilean community and
   identify the factors that determine them. To that end, a diverse set of
   environmental behaviors (power and water conservation,
   environmentally-aware consumer behavior, biodiversity protection,
   rational automobile use and ecological waste management) and
   sociodemographic and attitudinal factorsbased on the VBN modelwere
   evaluated. Survey data was obtained from a statistically representative
   sample (N = 1537) in Santiago, Chile. Our results suggest that several
   participants displayed tendencies that favor more responsible
   environmental behaviors, with high environmental concern, and
   demonstrating their ample awareness of the consequences of failing to
   protect the environment. Nevertheless, the highest average scores of
   environmental behavior were related to low cost behaviors and those that
   imposed the fewest behavioral restrictions. In global terms, we
   concluded that the youngest subjects in the lowest socioeconomic group
   obtained the lowest scores across the pro-environmental behavior
   spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedure is employed to repair most
   congenital heart defects (CHD). Cannulation is a critical component of
   this procedure where the location and diameter of cannula controls the
   hemodynamic performance. State-of-the-art computational studies of
   neonatal CPB employed an isolated aortic arch region by truncating the
   three-dimensional (3D) patient-specific cerebral system. The present
   work expanded these studies where the 3D patient-specific MRI
   reconstruction of the cerebral system, including the Circle of Willis
   (CoW), is integrated with a hypoplastic neonatal aortic arch. The inlet
   of the arterial cannula is assigned a steady velocity boundary condition
   of the CPB pump, while all outlets are modeled as resistance boundary
   conditions, thus allowing acute comparisons between different cannula
   configurations. Three-dimensional (3D) flow simulations in the aortic
   arch model are performed at a Reynolds number of 2150 using an
   experimentally validated commercial solver. Results demonstrate that the
   inclusion of 3D CoW is essential to predict the accurate head-neck blood
   perfusion and therefore critical in deciding the neonatal aortic
   cannulation strategy preoperatively. Using this integrated model two CPB
   configurations are studied, where the cannulas were placed at innominate
   artery (IA) (IA-cannula configuration) and ductus arteriosus (DA)
   (DA-cannula configuration). Configuration change produced significant
   differences in flow splits and local hemodynamics of blood flow
   throughout the whole aortic arch, neck and cerebral arteries. Percent
   flow rate differences between the IA- and DA-cannula configurations are
   computed to be: 19\%, for descending aorta, 198\% for ascending aorta
   (perfusing coronary arteries), 91\% for right anterior cerebral artery,
   and 68\% for left anterior cerebral artery. Another important finding is
   the retrograde flow at vertebral arteries for IA-cannula configuration,
   but not for DA-cannula. These results may help to translate better
   neonatal arterial cannulae design for minimizing cerebral complications
   during CPB procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the current work was to develop a statistical method
   and associated tool to evaluate the impact of oil and natural gas
   exploration and production activities on local air quality.
   Nonparametric regression of pollutant concentrations on wind direction
   was combined with bootstrap hypothesis testing to provide statistical
   inference regarding the existence of a local/regional air quality
   impact. The block bootstrap method was employed to address the effect of
   autocorrelation on test significance. The method was applied to
   short-term air monitoring data collected at three sites within
   Pennsylvania's Allegheny National Forest. All of the measured pollutant
   concentrations were well below the National Ambient Air Quality
   Standards, so the usual criteria and methods for data analysis were not
   sufficient. Using advanced directional analysis methods, test results
   were first applied to verify the existence of a regional impact at a
   background site. Next the impact of an oil field on local NOx and SO2
   concentrations at a second monitoring site was identified after removal
   of the regional effect. Analysis of a third site also revealed air
   quality impacts from nearby areas with a high density of oil and gas
   wells. All results and conclusions were quantified in terms of
   statistical significance level for the associated inferences. The
   proposed method can be used to formulate hypotheses and verify
   conclusions regarding oil and gas well impacts on air quality and
   support better-informed decisions for their management and regulation.

Abstract = {{An automated method is introduced for deriving the governing dynamic
   equations of electric power systems using the Lagrangian formulation. A
   main advantage of using the Lagrangian formulation to model the system
   dynamics is that this framework has been shown to be useful for

   because for interconnected power systems, it is very complex to derive
   by hand. The automated method is demonstrated on an example
   interconnected power system. Finally, the differential equations derived
   in the stationary three-phase reference frame for this example are
   transformed to the rotating two-phase reference frame, and simulations
   in the different reference frames are shown and analyzed. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Damages from sea level rise, as well as strategies to manage the
   associated risk, hinge critically on the time scale and eventual
   magnitude of sea level rise. Satellite observations and paleo-data
   suggest that the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) loses mass in response to
   increased temperatures, and may thus contribute substantially to sea
   level rise as anthropogenic climate change progresses. The time scale of
   GIS mass loss and sea level rise are deeply uncertain, and are often
   assumed to be constant. However, previous ice sheet modeling studies
   have shown that the time scale of GIS response likely decreases strongly
   with increasing temperature anomaly. Here, we map the relationship
   between temperature anomaly and the time scale of GIS response, by
   perturbing a calibrated, three-dimensional model of GIS behavior.
   Additional simulations with a profile, higher-order, ice sheet model
   yield time scales that are broadly consistent with those obtained using
   the three-dimensional model, and shed light on the feedbacks in the ice
   sheet system that cause the time scale shortening. Semi-empirical
   modeling studies that assume a constant time scale of sea level
   adjustment, and are calibrated to small preanthropogenic temperature and
   sea level changes, may underestimate future sea level rise. Our analysis
   suggests that the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in
   terms of avoided sea level rise from the GIS, may be greatest if
   emissions reductions begin before large temperature increases have been
   realized. Reducing anthropogenic climate change may also allow more time
   for design and deployment of risk management strategies by slowing sea
   level contributions from the GIS.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{35-48}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The combination of real-time optimization (RTO) and model predictive
   control (MPC) methodologies is widely used in the chemical and
   petrochemical industry to optimize continuous processes. However, often
   the setpoint updates computed by the RTO are not frequent enough to
   capture all disturbances. This leads to suboptimal process operation,
   because the system is not re-optimized after a disturbance, until it has
   reached its new (suboptimal) steady state. An efficient way to handle
   this issue is to include economic considerations in the design of the
   lower MPC layer. This is the main idea of self-optimizing control (SOC),
   where controlled variables are selected, such that keeping them constant
   results in near-optimal operation without requiring an RTO update. Thus,
   we argue that SOC is complementary to RTO, and we develop a new MPC
   strategy with zone control and SOC variable targets. In particular, we
   present an approach toward solving the problem of low-frequency setpoint
   updates, also when the active set changes. We demonstrate the
   performance of our approach in steady state and dynamic simulations, and
   compare it to a classic RTO/MPC combination. The results show that our
   approach improves the coordination between the RTO and MPC layers. As it
   gives better performance in between RIO executions, it also leads to a
   higher overall profit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Aqueous Subphases. 1: High Deposition Flux Representative of Aerosol
   Delivery to Large Airways}},

Abstract = {{Background: Aerosol drug delivery is a viable option for treating
   diseased airways, but airway obstructions associated with diseases such
   as cystic fibrosis cause non-uniform drug distribution and limit
   efficacy. Marangoni stresses produced by surfactant addition to aerosol
   formulations may enhance delivery uniformity by post-deposition
   spreading of medications over the airway surface, improving access to
   poorly ventilated regions. We examine the roles of different variables
   affecting the maximum post-deposition spreading of a dye (drug mimic).
   Methods: Entangled aqueous solutions of either poly(acrylamide) (PA) or
   porcine gastric mucin (PGM) serve as airway surface liquid (ASL)
   mimicking subphases for in vitro models of aerosol deposition. Measured
   aerosol deposition fluxes indicate that the experimental delivery
   conditions are representative of aerosol delivery to the conducting
   airways. Post-deposition spreading beyond the locale of direct aerosol
   deposition is tracked by fluorescence microscopy. Aqueous aerosols
   formulated with either nonionic surfactant (tyloxapol) or
   fluorosurfactant (FS-3100) are compared with surfactant-free control
   aerosols. Results: Significant enhancement of post-deposition spreading
   is observed with surfactant solutions relative to surfactant-free
   control solutions, provided the surfactant solution surface tension is
   less than that of the subphase. Amongst the variables
   consideredsurfactant concentration, aerosol flow-rate, total deposited
   volume, time of delivery, and total deposited surfactant masssurfactant
   mass is the primary predictor of maximum spread distance. This
   dependence is also observed for solutions deposited as a single,
   microliter-scale drop with a volume comparable to the total volume of
   deposited aerosol. Conclusions: Marangoni stress-assisted spreading
   after surfactant-laden aerosol deposition at high fluxes on a complex
   fluid subphase is capable of driving aerosol contents over significantly
   greater distances compared to surfactant-free controls. Total delivered
   surfactant mass is the primary determinant of the extent of spreading,
   suggesting a great potential to extend the reach of aerosolized
   medication in partially obstructed airways via a purely physical
   mechanism.}},

Title = {{Surfactant Driven Post-Deposition Spreading of Aerosols on Complex

Abstract = {{Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with the accumulation of
   dehydrated mucus in the pulmonary airways. This alters ventilation and
   aerosol deposition patterns in ways that limit drug delivery to
   peripheral lung regions. We investigated the use of surfactant-based,
   self-dispersing aerosol carriers that produce surface tension gradients
   to drive two-dimensional transport of aerosolized medications via
   Marangoni flows after deposition on the airway surface liquid (ASL). We
   considered the post-deposition spreading of individual aerosol droplets
   and two-dimensional expansion of a field of aerosol droplets, when
   deposited at low fluxes that are representative of aerosol deposition in
   the small airways. Methods: We used physically entangled aqueous
   solutions of poly(acrylamide) or porcine gastric mucin as simple ASL
   mimics that adequately capture the full miscibility but slow penetration
   of entangled macromolecular chains of the ASL into the deposited drop.
   Surfactant formulations were prepared with aqueous solutions of nonionic
   tyloxapol or FS-3100 fluorosurfactant. Fluorescein dye served as a model
   drug tracer and to visualize the extent of post-deposition spreading.
   Results: The surfactants not only enhanced post-deposition spreading of
   individual aerosol droplets due to localized Marangoni stresses, as
   previously observed with macroscopic drops, but they also produced
   large-scale Marangoni stresses that caused the deposited aerosol fields
   to expand into initially unexposed regions of the subphase. We show that
   the latter is the main mechanism for spreading drug over large distances
   when aerosol is deposited at low fluxes representative of the small
   airways. The large scale convective expansion of the aerosol field
   drives the tracer (drug mimic) over areas that would cover an entire
   airway generation or more, in peripheral airways, where sub-monolayer
   droplet deposition is expected during aerosol inhalation. Conclusions:
   The results suggest that aerosolized surfactant formulations may provide
   the means to maximize deposited drug uniformity in and access to small
   airways.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate potentially prothrombotic flow patterns within
   an axial flow ventricular assist device under clinically relevant
   pulsatile hemodynamic conditions.
   Methods: A transparent replica of the HeartMate-II left ventricular
   assist device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif) was visualized using a high
   speed camera at both low and high frame rates (125 and 3000 fps). Three
   steady-state conditions were studied: nominal (4.5 lpm), low flow (3.0
   lpm), and high flow (6.0 lpm). Time-varying conditions were introduced
   with an external pulsatile pump that modulated the flow rate by
   approximately +/- 50\% of the mean, corresponding to a pulsatility index
   of 1.0.
   Results: At nominal and high flow rates, the path lines within the
   upstream region were generally stable, well attached, and streamlined.
   As the flow rate was reduced below 3.8 lpm, a rapid transition to a
   chaotic velocity field occurred, exhibiting a large toroidal vortex
   adjacent to the upstream bearing. The pathlines in the downstream stator
   section were consistently chaotic for all hemodynamic conditions
   investigated. It was common to observe tracer particles trapped within
   recirculation bubbles and drawn retrograde, causing repeated contact
   with the bearing surfaces. The addition of pulsatility caused the flow
   field to become periodically chaotic during the diastolic portion of the
   cardiac cycle depending on the instantaneous flow rate and acceleration.
   Conclusions: The contribution of pulsatility by the native heart may
   induce a periodic disturbance to an otherwise stable flow field within
   an axial flow ventricular assist device, particularly during the
   diastolic and decelerating portion of the cardiac cycle. Potentially
   prothrombotic flow features were found to occur periodically in the
   region of the upstream bearing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that maximizes performance
   under power constraints and is applicable in the general context of
   traditional dynamic voltage/frequency (V/P) scaling, or core
   heterogeneity and emerging dynamic micro-architectural adaptation.
   Performance maximization in these scenarios can be essentially viewed as
   mapping application threads to appropriate core states that have various
   power/performance characteristics. Such problems are formulated as a
   generic 0-1 integer linear program (ILP). The proposed algorithm is an
   iterative heuristic-based solution. Compared with an optimal solution
   generated by commercial ILP solver, the proposed algorithm produces
   results less than 1\% away from optimum on average, with more than two
   orders of magnitude improvement in runtime. The algorithm can be brought
   online for hundred-core heterogeneous systems as it scales to systems
   comprised of 256 cores with less than 1 ms in overhead in worst cases.
   The intrinsic history awareness also provides flexibility to control
   cost induced by switching V/F pairs, migrating threads across cores, or
   tuning on/off micro-architectural resources.}},

Abstract = {{In a machining system, accurate tool wear condition monitoring is
   paramount for guaranteeing the quality of the workpiece and tool life.
   The cutting force signal has been proved to be the most sensitive signal
   to depict the tool wear variation during the machining process. This
   paper introduces a data-driven modeling framework for tool wear
   monitoring in a machining process, which is based on statistical
   processing of cutting force wavelet transform by a hidden Markov tree.
   As a kind of data-driven prognostic approach, this method exploits the
   tool wear states feature from a deeply data mining perspective while the
   Markov dependence of wavelet transformation at different frequencies or
   scales is captured. With lathe turning as the research object, a
   detailed study on the statistical analysis of cutting force in different
   tool conditions is presented. A two phases monitoring process that
   assesses the tool wear conditions from generated model by using the
   statistical features of cutting force wavelet transform is built.
   Compared to the traditional classifiers, which usually have a difficult
   condition in distinguishing tool wear states when given a limited amount
   of samples, the proposed approach make more efficient use of the
   training data with high sensitivity to the tool wear conditions.
   Experimental studies of Inconel 718 cutting show that this approach is
   robust and makes the cutting force information exploited effectively in
   data mining. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method for
   tool condition monitoring outperforms the traditional used Hidden Markov
   model and Gaussian mixture model approach.}},

Abstract = {{Although the phosphorus reaction in steelmaking has been extensively

   sources become less available and more expensive, necessitating the need

   some of the relevant literature on the topic and details the methodology
   and experimental setup used in recent studies on phosphorus equilibrium
   between liquid iron and slags. New data for BOF-type slags are
   presented, where equilibrium was approached from both metal and slag
   sides i.e., phosphorus was transferred from metal to slag and vice
   versa. It was found that slags with basicities higher than 2.5 and FeO
   contents around 20 to 25 wt pct can promote extensive dephosphorization,
   and high L (P), ((pct P)/{[}pct P]), values were observed i.e., greater

Abstract = {{To facilitate isogeometric analysis, this paper presents a new type of
   T-spline named the weighted T-spline, which introduces a new weighting
   idea to T-spline basis functions. Weighted T-spline basis functions
   satisfy partition of unity and are linearly independent. In addition, we
   apply the bicubic weighted T-splines to reparameterize trimmed NURBS
   surface patches. Edge interval extension is performed to reconstruct the
   trimming curve on the T-spline surface, and the trimming curve can be
   exactly preserved. Comparisons with standard T-splines show that the
   weighted T-splines can decrease the required number of control points
   and T-mesh elements. The surface error introduced by weighted T-spline
   basis functions is bounded (within 0.5\%), and the error introduced by
   the trimming curve is constrained within its three-ring neighboring
   elements. Weighted T-spline models are also applied to solve the linear
   elasticity problems and Poisson's equation, demonstrating that they can
   be used in isogeometric analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{With the goal of improving the quality of life for people suffering from
   various motor control disorders, brain-machine interfaces provide direct
   neural control of prosthetic devices by translating neural signals into
   control signals. These systems act by reading motor intent signals
   directly from the brain and using them to control, for example, the
   movement of a cursor on a computer screen. Over the past two decades,
   much attention has been devoted to the decoding problem: how should
   recorded neural activity be translated into the movement of the cursor?
   Most approaches have focused on this problem from an estimation
   standpoint, i.e., decoders are designed to return the best estimate of
   motor intent possible, under various sets of assumptions about how the
   recorded neural signals represent motor intent. Here we recast the
   decoder design problem from a physical control system perspective, and
   investigate how various classes of decoders lead to different types of
   physical systems for the subject to control. This framework leads to new
   interpretations of why certain types of decoders have been shown to
   perform better than others. These results have implications for
   understanding how motor neurons are recruited to perform various tasks,
   and may lend insight into the brain's ability to conceptualize
   artificial systems.}},

   were 3D printed at a resolution of similar to 200 mm and at low cost by
   leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept

Title = {{Estimating the benefits of electric vehicle smart charging at
   non-residential locations: A data-driven approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{515-525}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we use data collected from over 2000 non-residential
   electric vehicle supply equipments (EVSEs) located in Northern
   California for the year of 2013 to estimate the potential benefits of
   smart electric vehicle (EV) charging. We develop a smart charging
   framework to identify the benefits of non-residential EV charging to the
   load aggregators and the distribution grid. Using this extensive
   dataset, we aim to improve upon past studies focusing on the benefits of
   smart EV charging by relaxing the assumptions made in these studies
   regarding: (i) driving patterns, driver behavior and driver types; (ii)
   the scalability of a limited number of simulated vehicles to represent
   different load aggregation points in the power system with different
   customer characteristics; and (iii) the charging profile of EVs. First,
   we study the benefits of EV aggregations behind-the-meter, where a
   time-of-use pricing schema is used to understand the benefits to the
   owner when EV aggregations shift load from high cost periods to lower
   cost periods. For the year of 2013, we show a reduction of up to 24.8\%
   in the monthly bill is possible. Then, following a similar aggregation
   strategy, we show that EV aggregations decrease their contribution to
   the system peak load by approximately 37\% (median) when charging is
   controlled within arrival and departure times. Our results also show
   that it could be expected to shift approximately 0.25 kW h (-2.8\%) of
   energy per non-residential EV charging session from peak periods (12
   PM-6 PM) to off-peak periods (after 6 PM) in Northern California for the
   year of 2013. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Active learning techniques have gained popularity to reduce human effort
   in labeling data instances for inducing a classifier. When faced with
   large amounts of unlabeled data, such algorithms automatically identify
   the exemplar instances for manual annotation. More recently, there have
   been attempts towards a batch mode form of active learning, where a
   batch of data points is simultaneously selected from an unlabeled set.
   In this paper, we propose two novel batch mode active learning (BMAL)
   algorithms: BatchRank and BatchRand. We first formulate the batch
   selection task as an NP-hard optimization problem; we then propose two
   convex relaxations, one based on linear programming and the other based
   on semi-definite programming to solve the batch selection problem.
   Finally, a deterministic bound is derived on the solution quality for
   the first relaxation and a probabilistic bound for the second. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to derive
   mathematical guarantees on the solution quality of the BMAL problem. Our
   extensive empirical studies on 15 binary, multi-class and multi-label
   challenging datasets corroborate that the proposed algorithms perform at
   par with the state-of-the-art techniques, deliver high quality solutions
   and are robust to real-world issues like label noise and class
   imbalance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a Quantized Gossip-based Interactive Kalman Filtering
   (QGIKF) algorithm implemented in a wireless sensor network, where the
   sensors exchange their quantized states with neighbors via inter-sensor
   communications. We show that, in the countable infinite quantization
   alphabet case, the network can still achieve weak consensus with the
   information loss due to quantization, i.e., the estimation error
   variance sequence at a randomly selected sensor can converge weakly (in
   distribution) to a unique invariant measure. To prove the weak
   convergence, we first interpret error variance sequences as interacting
   particles, then model each sequence evolution as a Random Dynamical
   System (RDS), and further prove its stochastically bounded nature.
   Moreover, based on the analysis for the countable infinite quantization
   alphabet case, we also prove that under certain conditions the network
   can also achieve weak consensus, when the quantization alphabet is
   finite, which is more restricted and practical.}},

   mechanisms that consist of a rigid end-effector that is articulated by
   several parallel, flexible limbs (a.k.a. sub-chains). Existing design
   methods can enhance the FPMs' dynamic and stiffness properties by
   conducting a size optimization on their sub-chains. A similar
   optimization process, however, was not performed for their sub-chains'
   topology, and this may severely limit the benefits of a size
   optimization. Thus, this paper proposes to use a structural optimization
   approach to synthesize and optimize the topology, shape and size of the
   FPMs' sub-chains. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated via the
   design and development of a planar X - Y - theta(z), FPM. A prototype of
   this FPM was evaluated experimentally to have a large workspace of 1.2
   mm x 1.2 mm x 6 degrees, a fundamental natural frequency of 102 Hz, and
   stiffness ratios that are greater than 120. The achieved properties show
   significant improvement over existing 3-degrees-of-freedom compliant
   mechanisms that can deflect more than 0.5 mm and 0.5 degrees. These
   compliant mechanisms typically have stiffness ratios that are less than
   60 and a fundamental natural frequency that is less than 45 Hz. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report asserts
   that investment in low-carbon electricity production will need to rise
   by several hundred billion dollars annually, before 2030, in order to
   stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere by 2100. In
   recognition of this urgent need to mitigate climate change, many
   governments have already established policies to spur renewable energy
   investment in the electricity sector. One such policy measure is a
   renewable energy target (RET), which sets a target percentage of
   electricity production to be generated from renewable sources by a
   specified date. Variations on this policy have been implemented around
   the world, from the EU 20-20-20 to diverse renewable portfolio standards
   in U.S. states and municipalities. This work analyzes economic,
   environmental and social aspects of a geographic attribution (i.e.
   Isolated, Regional or Country) of an RET to gain insights on the
   associated tradeoffs. In the case study of the Azores Islands, Portugal,
   the regional geographic attribution of an RET captures the best of all
   three tradeoffs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   structure}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{640}},
Pages = {{127-132}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{CuPd alloys are important materials in hydrogen purification, where they
   are used as dense Pd-based separation membranes. Cu is added to impart
   sulfur tolerance and improved mechanical properties. At intermediate
   compositions and T<873 K, a BCC alloy (B2) phase occurs, which has
   superior separation characteristics to those of the FCC phases that form
   at high Cu and high Pd compositions. Identifying the composition and
   temperature window where the B2 phase forms is a critical need to enable
   the design of improved alloys. A composition spread alloy film of Cu and
   Pd was synthesized. The film was characterized by electron back scatter
   diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, providing the core
   level shifts as a function of bulk composition and bulk structure. An
   anomalous deviation in the Cu core level shift was observed in the
   composition range 0.33 < x(pd) < 0.55 over which the B-2 phase occurs.
   Density functional theory calculations were used to simulate core level
   shifts in the FCC and B2 alloy structures. They suggest that the
   anomalous deviation in core level shift is due to formation of the
   ordered B2 phase in this composition range. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   1075 members of RAND's American Life Panel (56.2\% female, 18-93 years,

   affective/experiential, independent/self-controlled, and an

   likely to be in the affective/experiential profile and more likely to be
   in the independent/self-controlled profile. Women were less likely to be
   in the affective/experiential profile and more likely to be in the

Abstract = {{We consider the image classification problem via kernel collaborative
   representation classification with locality constrained dictionary
   (KCRC-LCD). Specifically, we propose a kernel collaborative
   representation classification. (KCRC) approach in which kernel method is
   used to improve the discrimination ability of collaborative
   representation classification (CRC). We then measure the similarities
   between the query and atoms in the global dictionary in order to
   construct a locality constrained dictionary (LCD) for KCRC. In addition,
   we discuss several similarity measure approaches in LCD and further
   present a simple yet effective unified similarity measure whose
   superiority is validated in experiments. There are several appealing
   aspects associated with LCD. First, LCD can be nicely incorporated under
   the framework of KCRC. The LCD similarity measure can be kernelized
   under KCRC, which theoretically links CRC and LCD under the kernel
   method. Second, KCRC-LCD becomes more scalable to both the training set
   size and the feature dimension. Example shows that KCRC is able to
   perfectly classify data with certain distribution, while conventional
   CRC fails completely. Comprehensive experiments on widely used public
   datasets also show that KCRC-LCD is a robust discriminative classifier
   with both excellent performance and good scalability, being comparable
   or outperforming many other state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{The bulk thermal conductivity of Stillinger-Weber (SW) wurtzite GaN in
   the {[}0001] direction at a temperature of 300K is calculated using
   equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD), non-equilibrium MD (NEMD), and
   lattice dynamics (LD) methods. While the NEMD method predicts a thermal
   conductivity of 166 +/- 611 W/m.K, both the EMD and LD methods predict
   thermal conductivities that are an order of magnitude greater. We
   attribute the discrepancy to significant contributions to thermal
   conductivity from long-mean free path phonons. We propose that the
   Gruneisen parameter for low-frequency phonons is a good predictor of the
   severity of the size effects in NEMD thermal conductivity prediction.
   For weakly anharmonic crystals characterized by small Gruneisen
   parameters, accurate determination of thermal conductivity by NEMD is
   computationally impractical. The simulation results also indicate the
   GaN SW potential, which was originally developed for studying the
   atomic-level structure of dislocations, is not suitable for prediction
   of its thermal conductivity. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   mineral dissolution}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{412}},
Pages = {{26-33}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Alkali and alkaline metal chlorides have been considered as inert
   electrolyte species with respect to sulfide mineral dissolution in the
   presence of oxidizing agents such as O-2 and Fe3+. Under anoxic
   conditions in the laboratory or the field, as exist inmost saline
   subsurface environments, the potential reactivity of alkali and alkaline
   metal chlorides with sulfide minerals has typically been ignored.
   Arsenopyrite (FeAsS(s)), galena (PbS(s)), and pyrite (FeS2(s)) are
   commonly encountered sulfide mineral phases, the dissolution of which
   affects many ecosystems. In this study, dissolution experiments with
   these minerals were conducted under anoxic conditions with 10 mM
   solutions of NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 at constant pH of 2.56. Results show
   that these electrolytes affect sulfide mineral dissolution under anoxic
   conditions, either increasing or decreasing the rate. The extent to
   which sulfide mineral dissolution is affected is small but measurable
   and depends on the anionic species in the mineral and cationic species
   in solution. Specifically, the dissolution of arsenic from arsenopyrite
   increased with an increase in cation activity in solution, while the
   dissolution of sulfur decreased with an increase in chloride ion
   activity. These results suggest that sulfide mineral dissolution under
   anoxic conditions is caused by an interaction of cations in solution
   with anions on the mineral surface, and inhibited by the presence of
   competing anions in solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This Article presents a general framework for the integration of
   operational hedging and financial hedging strategy in the crude oil
   procurement process. The main purpose of the proposed approach is to
   manage the risk in the oil procurement process due to oil price
   fluctuation. The problem is formulated as a one-stage stochastic
   programming model that incorporates Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as
   the risk measure. By introducing production flexibility such as
   inventory and the nonlinear CDU Fractionation Index (FI) model, as well
   as financial derivatives like futures, put option, and call option, the
   integrated hedging strategy enables industrial managers to obtain the
   desired balance between profitability and risk tolerance. In addition, a
   Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method is applied to solve the
   stochastic problem. Numerical studies illustrate the benefits of the
   proposed approach and also provide useful managerial insights.}},

Abstract = {{Significant reductions in expensive platinum catalyst loading for the
   oxygen reduction reaction are needed for commercially viable fuel cell
   electric vehicles as well as other important applications. In reducing
   loading, a resistance at the Pt surface in the presence of thin
   perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) electrolyte film, on the order of 10 nm
   thick, becomes a significant barrier to adequate performance. However,
   the resistance mechanism is unresolved and could be due to gas
   dissolution kinetics, increased diffusion resistance in thin films, or
   electrolyte anion interactions. A common hypothesis for the origin of
   the resistance is a highly reduced oxygen permeability in the thin
   polymer electrolyte films that coat the catalyst relative to bulk
   permeability that is caused by nanoscale confinement effects.
   Unfortunately, the prior work has not separated the thin-film gas
   transport resistance from that associated with PFSA interactions with a
   polarized catalyst surface. Here, we present the first characterization
   of the thin-film 02 transport resistance in the absence of a polarized
   catalyst, using a nanoporous substrate that geometrically mimics the
   active catalyst particles. Through a parametric study of varying PFSA
   film thickness, as thin as SO nm, we observe no enhanced gas transport
   resistance in thin films as a result of either interfacial effects or
   structural changes in the PFSA. Our results suggest that other effects,
   such as anion poisoning at the Pt catalyst, could be the source of the
   additional resistance observed at low Pt loading.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) specific antibodies
   (anti-TNF-alpha Ab) have been shown to be potent TNF inhibitors and
   effective therapeutics for a range of inflammatory diseases. Typically,
   these drugs are administered systemically, but systemic dosing
   sufficient to achieve locally effective concentrations in peripheral
   tissues has been associated with systemic immunosuppression and related
   adverse events. Here, we evaluated the use of tip-loaded dissolvable
   microneedle arrays (MNAs) for localized intradermal delivery of
   anti-TNF-alpha Ab. MNAs with obelisk shape microneedles that incorporate
   the antibody cargo in the needle tips were created from
   carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) using a micromilling/spin-casting
   fabrication method. We found that anti-TNF-alpha Ab integrated into MNAs
   using this room temperature fabrication process maintained
   conformationally dependent TNF-alpha binding activity. Further, these
   MNAs efficiently delivered anti-TNF-alpha antibodies to the dermis of
   human skin with clinically applicable release profiles. To evaluate MNA
   delivered anti-TNF-alpha Ab function, we applied anti-TNF-alpha Ab
   containing MNAs to established psoriasiform lesions on the skin of mice.
   MNA anti-TNF-alpha Ab treatment reduced key biomarkers of psoriasiform
   inflammation including epidermal thickness and IL-1 beta expression.
   Taken together, these results demonstrate efficient and biologically
   effective MNA delivery of anti-TNF-alpha Ab to the intradermal
   microenvironment of the skin in mice and humans, and support the
   development of MNA mediated antibody delivery for clinical applications.

Title = {{Heat affected zone microstructures and their influence on toughness in
   two microalloyed HSLA steels}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{380-391}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Microstructures and Charpy impact properties have been examined in two
   microalloyed steels following heat treatments to simulate weld heat
   affected zone (HAZ) structures over a range of heat input conditions,
   characterised by the cooling time from 800 to 500 degrees C (Delta
   t(8/5)). The base materials were low carbon structural steel plates
   microalloyed with vanadium and nitrogen (V-N) and niobium (Nb),
   respectively. The toughnesses of the HAZs displayed remarkably different
   behaviours as shown by their impact transition temperatures. For the V-N
   steel, the toughness improved with increasingly rapid cooling (low heat
   input conditions) whereas the Nb steel showed an opposite trend. Some of
   this behaviour could be explained by the presence of coarse ferrite
   grains in the slowly cooled V-N steel. However, other conditions where
   all the structures were bainitic and rather similar in optical
   micrographs gave widely different toughness values. The recently
   developed method of five dimensional boundary analysis based on electron
   backscattering diffraction has been applied to these cases for the first
   time. This showed that the lath boundaries in the bainite were
   predominantly on \{110\} planes of the ferrite and that the average
   spacing of these boundaries varied depending on steel composition and
   cooling rate. Since \{110\} is also the slip plane in ferrite, it is
   considered that close spacing between the lath boundaries inhibits
   general plasticity at stress concentrations and favours initiation of
   fracture. The differences between the two steels are believed to be due
   to their transformation behaviours on cooling where precipitation of
   vanadium nitride in austenite accelerates ferrite formation and raises
   the temperature of the phase transformation in V-N steels. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{There has been an increasing interest in the application of membranes to
   flue gas separation, primarily driven by the need of carbon capture for
   significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, there has
   not been general consensus about the advantage of membranes against

   recent research indicates that advances in materials and process designs
   could significantly improve the separation performance of membrane
   capture systems, which make membrane technology competitive with other
   technologies for carbon capture. This paper mainly reviews membrane
   separation for the application to post-combustion CO2 capture with a

Abstract = {{Prediction of transition metal oxide BO2 (B = Ti, V, etc.) polymorph
   energetic properties is critical to tunable material design and
   identifying thermodynamically accessible structures. Determining
   procedures capable of synthesizing particular polymorphs minimally
   requires prior knowledge of their relative energetic favorability.
   Information concerning TiO2 polymorph relative energetic favorability
   has been ascertained from experimental research. In this study, the
   consistency of first-principles predictions and experimental results
   involving the relative energetic ordering of stable (rutile), metastable
   (anatase and brookite), and unstable (columbite) TiO2 polymorphs is
   assessed via density functional theory (DFT). Considering the issues
   involving electron-electron interaction and charge delocalization in
   TiO2 calculations, relative energetic ordering predictions are evaluated
   over trends varying Ti Hubbard U-3d or exact exchange fraction parameter
   values. Energetic trends formed from varying U-3d predict experimentally
   consistent energetic ordering over U-3d intervals when using GGA-based
   functionals, regardless of pseudopotential selection. Given pertinent
   linear response calculated Hubbard U values, these results enable TiO2
   polymorph energetic ordering prediction. Hybrid functional calculations
   involving rutile-anatase relative energetics, though demonstrating
   experimentally consistent energetic ordering over exact exchange
   fraction ranges, are not accompanied by predicted fractions, for a
   first-principles methodology capable of calculating exact exchange
   fractions precisely predicting TiO2 polymorph energetic ordering is not
   available.}},

Title = {{Moderately nonlinear diffuse-charge dynamics under an ac voltage}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{The response of a symmetric binary electrolyte between two parallel,
   blocking electrodes to a moderate amplitude ac voltage is quantified.
   The diffuse charge dynamics are modeled via the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
   equations for a dilute solution of point-like ions. The solution to
   these equations is expressed as a Fourier series with a voltage
   perturbation expansion for arbitrary Debye layer thickness and ac
   frequency. Here, the perturbation expansion in voltage proceeds in
   powers of V-o/(k(B)T/e), where V-o is the amplitude of the driving
   voltage and k(B)T/e is the thermal voltage with k(B) as Boltzmann's
   constant, T as the temperature, and e as the fundamental charge. We show
   that the response of the electrolyte remains essentially linear in
   voltage amplitude at frequencies greater than the RC frequency of Debye
   layer charging, D/lambda L-D, where D is the ion diffusivity, lambda(D)
   is the Debye layer thickness, and L is half the cell width. In contrast,
   nonlinear response is predicted at frequencies below the RC frequency.
   We find that the ion densities exhibit symmetric deviations from the
   (uniform) equilibrium density at even orders of the voltage amplitude.
   This leads to the voltage dependence of the current in the external
   circuit arising from the odd orders of voltage. For instance, the first
   nonlinear contribution to the current is O(V-o(3)) which contains the
   expected third harmonic but also a component oscillating at the applied
   frequency. We use this to compute a generalized impedance for moderate
   voltages, the first nonlinear contribution to which is quadratic in Vo.
   This contribution predicts a decrease in the imaginary part of the
   impedance at low frequency, which is due to the increase in Debye layer
   capacitance with increasing V-o. In contrast, the real part of the
   impedance increases at low frequency, due to adsorption of neutral salt
   from the bulk to the Debye layer.}},

   successfully converted GeTe to ON and OFF states. Device cycling
   prompted the formation of an active area which sustains the majority of
   structural changes during pulsing. A transition region on both sides of
   the active area consisting of polycrystalline GeTe and small nuclei (<15
   nm) in an amorphous matrix was also observed. The switching mechanism,
   determined by variations in pulsing parameters, was shown to be
   predominantly growth-driven. A preliminary model for crystallization and

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{140-154}},

Abstract = {{Due to quantity times quality nonlinear terms inherent in the
   oil-refining industry, performing industrialsized capital investment
   planning (CIP) in this field is traditionally done using linear (LP) or
   nonlinear (NLP) models whereby a gamut of scenarios are generated and
   manually searched to make expand and/or install decisions. Though
   mixed-integer nonlinear (MINLP) solvers have made significant
   advancements, they are often slow for large industrial applications in
   optimization; hence, we propose a more tractable approach to solve the
   CIP problem using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and
   input-output (Leontief) models, where the nonlinearities are
   approximated to linearized operations, activities, or modes in
   large-scaled flowsheet problems. To model the different types of CIP's
   known as revamping, retrofitting, and repairing, we unify the modeling
   by combining planning balances with scheduling concepts of
   sequence-dependent changeovers to represent the construction,
   commission, and correction stages explicitly in similar applications
   such as process design synthesis, asset allocation and utilization, and
   turnaround and inspection scheduling. Two motivating examples illustrate
   the modeling, and a retrofit example and an oil-refinery investment
   planning problem are also highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},

Abstract = {{Low prices and abundant resources open new opportunities for using
   natural gas, one of which is the production of transportation fuels. In
   this study, we use a Monte Carlo analysis combined with a life cycle
   analysis framework to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of a
   transition to natural gas-powered vehicles. We consider six different
   natural gas fuel pathways in two representative light-duty vehicles: a
   passenger vehicle and a sport utility vehicle. We find that a battery
   electric vehicle (BEV) powered with natural gas-based electricity
   achieves around 40\% life cycle emissions reductions when compared to
   conventional gasoline. Gaseous hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles
   (FCEVs) and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles have comparable life
   cycle emissions with conventional gasoline, offering limited reductions
   with 100-year global warming potential (GWP) yet leading to increases
   with 20-year GWP. Other liquid fuel pathways (methanol, ethanol, and
   Fischer-Tropsch liquids) have larger GHG emissions than conventional
   gasoline even when carbon capture and storage technologies are
   available. Life cycle GHG emissions of natural gas pathways are
   sensitive to the vehicle fuel efficiency, to the methane leakage rates
   of natural gas systems, and to the GWP assumed. With the current vehicle
   technologies, the break-even methane leakage rates of CNG, gaseous
   hydrogen FCEV, and BEV are 0.9\%/2.3\%, 1.2\%/2.8\%, and 4.5\%/10.8\%
   (20-year GVVP/100-year GWP). If the actual methane leakage rate is lower
   than the break-even rate of a specific natural gas pathway, that natural
   gas pathway reduces GHG emissions compared to conventional gasoline;
   otherwise, it leads to an increase in emissions.}},

Abstract = {{The Zanzibar Channel lies between the mainland of Tanzania and Zanzibar
   Island in the tropical western Indian Ocean, is about 100 km long, 40 km
   wide, and 40 m deep, and is essential to local socioeconomic activities.
   This paper presents a model of the seasonal and tidal dynamics of the
   Zanzibar Channel based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and
   a comparison of the model and observations. The seasonal dynamics of the
   channel is forced by remote processes and the local wind. Remote forcing
   creates the East African Coastal Current, a portion of which flows
   through the channel northward with a seasonally varying magnitude. The
   local wind enhances this seasonality in the surface Ekman layer,
   resulting in a stronger northward flow during the southwest monsoon
   season and a weak northward or occasionally southward flow during the
   northeast monsoon season. The tidal flows converge and diverge in the
   center of the channel and reduce the transport in the channel. The
   remotely forced, wind-forced, and tidal dynamics contain 5\%, 3\%, and
   92\% of the total kinetic energy, respectively. Despite their low
   kinetic energy, the remotely forced and wind-forced flows are most
   relevant in advecting channel water to the open ocean, which occurs in
   19 days at the peak of the southwest monsoon season. The channel is well
   mixed, except during brief periods in the two rainy seasons, and
   temporarily cools between December and February. The dispersion of
   passive tracers is presented as an example of potential model
   applications.}},

   because of their relative robustness to structural disorder and the
   associated benefit to `manufacturability'. Although hybridization gap
   materials are well known, their economic fabrication and efficient
   control of the gap frequency have remained elusive because of the
   limited property variability and expensive fabrication methodologies.
   Here we report a new strategy to realize hybridization gap materials by
   harnessing the `anisotropic elasticity' across the particle-polymer
   interface in densely polymer-tethered colloidal particles. Theoretical
   and Brillouin scattering analysis confirm both the robustness to
   disorder and the tunability of the resulting hybridization gap and
   provide guidelines for the economic synthesis of new materials with
   deliberately controlled gap position and width frequencies.}},

   particles in UK winter}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) and light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC)
   play key roles in warming the atmosphere, but the magnitude of their
   effects remains highly uncertain. Theoretical modelling and laboratory
   experiments demonstrate that coatings on BC can enhance BC's light
   absorption, therefore many climate models simply assume enhanced BC
   absorption by a factor of similar to 1.5. However, recent field
   observations show negligible absorption enhancement, implying models may
   overestimate BC's warming. Here we report direct evidence of substantial
   field-measured BC absorption enhancement, with the magnitude strongly
   depending on BC coating amount. Increases in BC coating result from a
   combination of changing sources and photochemical aging processes. When
   the influence of BrC is accounted for, observationally constrained model
   calculations of the BC absorption enhancement can be reconciled with the
   observations. We conclude that the influence of coatings on BC
   absorption should be treated as a source and regionally specific
   parameter in climate models.}},

Abstract = {{Novel design methodologies are often evaluated through studies involving
   human designers, but such studies can incur a high personnel cost. It
   can also be difficult to isolate the effects of specific team or
   individual characteristics. This work introduces the
   Cognitively-Inspired Simulated Annealing Teams (CISAT) modeling
   framework, a platform for efficiently simulating and analyzing human
   design teams. The framework models a number of empirically demonstrated
   cognitive phenomena, thus balancing simplicity and direct applicability.
   This paper discusses the model's composition, and demonstrates its
   utility through simulating human design teams in a cognitive study.
   Simulation results are compared directly to the results from human
   designers. The CISAT model is also used to identify the most beneficial
   characteristics in the cognitive study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Rapid actuation of thermo-responsive polymers is desirable for many
   applications including soft robotics and medical devices. Shape recovery
   rates in thermo-responsive shape memory polymers (SMP) are governed by
   extrinsic diffusion length scales and intrinsic material properties
   including the thermal conductivity of bulk polymers and the nature of
   the temperature-dependent modulus change during phase transitions. The
   sharpness of the glass transition is a strong function of the molecular
   heterogeneity of the SMP. Strategies to maximize the rate of shape
   recovery in thermo-responsive SMP could improve intrinsic properties by
   increasing the bulk thermal conductivity and minimizing molecular
   heterogeneity. Extrinsic properties could be improved by choosing form
   factors that minimize the characteristic length scale for thermal
   diffusion. Shape memory actuators with embedded vascular structures can
   be fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D
   printing. Here, we present the shape recovery kinetics in 3D-printed
   vascularized thermoplastic structures. Experimental and modeled shape
   recovery rates are compared to validate the utility of finite element
   modeling (FEM) to predict shape recovery rates. Theoretical and
   experimental time scales for shape recovery are in close agreement. This
   framework can predict the intrinsic physical property of SMP that limits
   the actuation rate. Taken together, this analysis can provide forward
   guidance when designing next-generation SMP with accelerated shape
   memory kinetics.}},

Title = {{Category-Aware API Clustering and Distributed Recommendation for
   Automatic Mashup Creation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{674-687}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mashup has emeraged as a promising way to allow developers to compose
   existed APIs (services) to create new or value-added services. With the
   rapid increasing number of services published on the Internet, service
   recommendation for automatic mashup creation gains a lot of momentum.
   Since mashup inherently requires services with different functions, the
   recommendation result should contain services from various categories.
   However, most existing recommendation approaches only rank all candidate
   services in a single list, which has two deficiencies. First, ranking
   services without considering to which categories they belong may lead to
   meaningless service ranking and affect the recommendation accuracy.
   Second, mashup developers are not always clear about which service
   categories they need and services in which categories cooperate better
   for mashup creation. Without explicitly recommending which service
   categories are relevant for mashup creation, it remains difficult for
   mashup developers to select proper services in a mixed ranking list,
   which lower the user friendliness of recommendation. To overcome these
   deficiencies, a novel category-aware service clustering and distributed
   recommending method is proposed for automatic mashup creation. First, a
   Kmeans variant (vKmeans) method based on topic model Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation is introduced for enhancing service categorization and
   providing a basis for recommendation. Second, on top of vKmeans, a
   service category relevance ranking (SCRR) model, which combines machine
   learning and collaborative filtering, is developed to decompose mashup
   requirements and explicitly predict relevant service categories.
   Finally, a category-aware distributed service recommendation (CDSR)
   model, which is based on a distributed machine learning framework, is
   developed for predicting service ranking order within each category.
   Experiments on a real-world dataset have proved that the proposed
   approach not only gains significant improvement at precision rate but
   also enhances the diversity of recommendation results.}},

Abstract = {{A diversity of signals can be recorded with extracellular electrodes. It
   remains unclear whether different signal types convey similar or
   different information and whether they capture the same or different
   underlying neural phenomena. Some researchers focus on spiking activity,
   while others examine local field potentials, and still others posit that
   these are fundamentally the same signals. We examined the similarities
   and differences in the information contained in four signal types
   recorded simultaneously from multielectrode arrays implanted in primary
   motor cortex: well-isolated action potentials from putative single
   units, multiunit threshold crossings, and local field potentials (LFPs)
   at two distinct frequency bands. We quantified the tuning of these
   signal types to kinematic parameters of reaching movements. We found 1)
   threshold crossing activity is not a proxy for single-unit activity; 2)
   when examined on individual electrodes, threshold crossing activity more
   closely resembles LFP activity at frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz
   than it does single-unit activity; 3) when examined across multiple
   electrodes, threshold crossing activity and LFP integrate neural
   activity at different spatial scales; and 4) LFP power in the ``beta
   band{''} (between 10 and 40 Hz) is a reliable indicator of movement
   onset but does not encode kinematic features on an instant-by-instant
   basis. These results show that the diverse signals recorded from
   extracellular electrodes provide somewhat distinct and complementary
   information. It may be that these signal types arise from biological
   phenomena that are partially distinct. These results also have practical
   implications for harnessing richer signals to improve brain-machine
   interface control.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to assess the current costs of CO2
   capture and storage (CCS) for new fossil fuel power plants and to
   compare those results to the costs reported a decade ago in the IPCC
   Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (SRCCS). Toward
   that end, we employed a similar methodology based on review and analysis
   of recent cost studies for the major CCS options identified in the
   SRCCS, namely, post-combustion CO2 capture at supercritical pulverized
   coal (SCPC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants, plus
   pre-combustion capture at coal-based integrated gasification combined
   cycle (IGCC) power plants. We also report current costs for SCPC plants
   employing oxy-combustion for CO2 capture an option that was still in the
   early stages of development at the time of the SRCCS. To compare current
   CCS cost estimates to those in the SRCCS, we adjust all costs to
   constant 2013 US dollars using cost indices for power plant capital
   costs, fuel costs and other O\&M costs. On this basis, we report changes
   in capital cost, levelized cost of electricity, and mitigation costs for
   each power plant system with and without CCS. We also discuss the
   outlook for future CCS costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Researchers across the globe are searching for energy sources to replace
   the petroleum-based fuels used by the transportation sector. A fuel of
   particular interest is biodiesel, produced from a diverse variety of
   feedstock oils with differing fuel properties that alter the operation
   and emissions of the engines using them. As biodiesel may be mixed with
   petroleum-based diesel, the fuel being used by a diesel engine may vary
   by both biodiesel blend percentage and source. Therefore, the influence
   of biodiesel properties as a function of blend is important to
   understand. In this study, four biodiesels, produced from palm,
   jatropha, soybean, and beef tallow, are tested with blends of petroleum
   diesel at ratios of 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 50\% biodiesel content. The
   results are compared with tests of neat diesel and each biodiesel. Using
   electronic injection, timing is modulated to normalize combustion
   phasing for all fuels tested to directly investigate the effects of
   biodiesel on combustion. Results indicate that fuel viscosity, energy
   content, and molecular structure have distinct influences on combustion
   that must be considered for engine calibration. When adjusted for
   combustion timing, biodiesel blends also showed a general decrease in
   NOx emissions compared to ultra-low sulfur diesel. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   grafting of sodium styrene sulfonate (NaSS) films from
   trichlorosilane/10-undecen-1-yl 2-bromo-2-methylpropionate (ester ClSi)
   functionalized titanium substrates. The process variables explored were:
   (1) ATRP initiator surface functionalization reaction time; (2) grafting
   reaction time; (3) CuBr2 concentration; and (4) reducing agent (vitamin
   C) concentration. All samples were characterized using x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Two statistical methods were used to
   analyze the results: (1) analysis of variance with alpha = 0: 05, using
   average root Ti XPS atomic percent as the response; and (2) principal
   component analysis using a peak list compiled from all the XPS
   composition results. Through this analysis combined with follow-up
   studies, the following conclusions are reached: (1) ATRP-initiator
   surface functionalization reaction times have no discernable effect on
   NaSS film quality; (2) minimum (<= 24 h for this system) grafting
   reaction times should be used on titanium substrates since NaSS film
   quality decreased and variability increased with increasing reaction
   times; (3) minimum (<= 0.5 mg cm(-2) for this system) CuBr2
   concentrations should be used to graft thicker NaSS films; and (4) no

Abstract = {{Conventional white matter (WM) imaging approaches, such as diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI), have been used to preoperatively identify the
   location of affected WM tracts in patients with intracranial tumors in
   order to maximize the extent of resection and potentially reduce
   postoperative morbidity. DTI, however, has limitations that include its
   inability to resolve multiple crossing fibers and its susceptibility to
   partial volume effects. Therefore, recent focus has shifted to more
   advanced WM imaging techniques such as high-definition fiber
   tractography (HDFT). In this paper, we illustrate the application of
   HDFT, which in our preliminary experience has enabled accurate depiction
   of perilesional tracts in a 3-dimensional manner in multiple anatomical
   compartments including edematous zones around high-grade gliomas. This
   has facilitated accurate surgical planning. This is illustrated by using
   case examples of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. We also discuss
   future directions in the role of these techniques in surgery for
   gliomas.}},

Abstract = {{New facility-level methane (CH4) emissions measurements obtained from
   114 natural gas gathering facilities and 16 processing plants in 13 U.S.
   states were combined with facility counts obtained from state and
   national databases in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate CH4 emissions
   from U.S. natural gas gathering and processing operations. Total annual
   CH4 emissions of 2421 (+245/ - 237) Gg were estimated for all U.S.
   gathering and processing operations, which represents a CH4 loss rate of
   0.47\% (+/- 0.05\%) when normalized by 2012 CH4 production. Over 90\% of
   those emissions were attributed to normal operation of gathering
   facilities (1697 +189/-185 Gg) and processing plants (506 +55/-52 Gg),
   with the balance attributed to gathering pipelines and processing plant
   routine maintenance and upsets. Compressor Engine Power The median CH4
   emissions estimate for processing plants is a factor of 1.7 lower than
   the 2012 EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimate, with the
   difference due largely to fewer reciprocating compressors, and a factor
   of 3.0 higher than that reported under the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting
   Program. Since gathering operations are currently embedded within the
   production segment of the EPA GHGI, direct comparison to our results is
   complicated. However, the study results suggest that CH4 emissions from
   gathering are substantially higher than the current EPA GHGI estimate
   and are equivalent to 30\% of the total net CH4 emissions in the natural
   gas systems GHGI. Because CH4 emissions from most gathering facilities
   are not reported under the current rule and not all source categories
   are reported for processing plants, the total CH4 emissions from
   gathering and processing reported under the EPA GHGRP (180 Gg)
   represents only 14\% of that tabulated in the EPA GHGI and 7\% of that
   predicted from this study.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced oxidation processes/technologies (AOT) that combine a
   semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), with a UV source have
   been used to eliminate microorganisms in various water treatment
   applications. To facilitate the applicability of this technique, the
   gain in efficiency from the semiconductor compared to the UV source
   alone with respect to different target organisms requires evaluation.
   The primary objective of this study was to determine the effects of TiO2
   and UV wavelength on a freshwater alga, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata
   and a marine alga, Tetraselmis suecica. For each species, dose-response
   experiments were conducted to determine the median lethal dose (LC50) of
   the following treatments: UV light emitted with a peak of 254nm, UV
   light emitted with a peak of 254nm in the presence of TiO2 and UV light
   emitted with a peak of 254 and 185nm in the presence of TiO2. In both
   species, the presence of TiO2 significantly increased mortality. Across
   all three treatments, P.subcapitata was more sensitive than T.suecica;
   moreover, the addition of the 185nm wavelength significantly increased
   cell mortality in P.subcapitata but not in T.suecica.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2493-2500}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Communications network plays a key role in the next-generation microgrid
   protection schemes, as the protective relays need to communicate with
   each other to dynamically track their tripping currents due to the
   time-varying nature of the loads and the distributed generation (DG)
   outputs. Hence, communications cost and reliability are some of the key
   factors that need to be considered before deploying a microgrid
   protection scheme. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a hybrid
   microgrid protection system, which implements traditional differential
   protection scheme along with an adaptive microgrid protection scheme.
   While the differential scheme is more sensitive, yet relies on extensive
   communications, the adaptive scheme is less sensitive but has low
   communications load. The joint deployment of these two schemes has the
   potential to increase the accuracy and precision of the whole protection
   scheme, while reducing the overall communications cost. Moreover, we
   propose a preemptive switching algorithm for the microgrid relays, which
   ensures a seamless transition from differential protection to adaptive
   protection based on the bit error rate of the communications links. Some
   illustrative results are provided based on an IEEE 802.16/WiMAX network
   to justify the proposed hybrid protection scheme.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2560-2568}},

Abstract = {{Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been shown
   to hold promise as demand response resources. However, the evaluation of
   these promises has relied on simulations of individual TCLs that make
   important assumptions about the thermal dynamics and properties of the
   loads, the end-user's interactions with individual TCLs and the
   disturbances to their operation. In this paper, we first propose a
   data-driven modeling strategy to simulate individual TCLs-specifically,
   household refrigeration units (HRUs)-that allows us to relax some of
   these assumptions and evaluate the validity of the approaches proposed
   to date. Specifically, we fit probability distributions to a year-long
   dataset of power measurements for HRUs and use these models to create
   more realistic simulations. We then derive the aggregate system
   equations using a bottomup approach that results in a more flexible
   {[}linear time invariant (LTI)] system. Finally, we quantify the
   plant-model mismatch and evaluate the proposed strategy with the more
   realistic simulation. Our results show that the effects of invalid
   assumptions about the disturbances and time-invariant properties of
   individual HRUs may be mitigated by a faster sampling of the state
   variables and that, when this is not possible, the proposed LTI system
   reduces the plant-model mismatch.}},

Abstract = {{Techniques proposed for assisting locomotion with exoskeletons have
   often included a combination of active work input and passive torque
   support, but the physiological effects of different assistance
   techniques remain unclear. We performed an experiment to study the
   independent effects of net exoskeleton work and average exoskeleton
   torque on human locomotion. Subjects wore a unilateral ankle exoskeleton
   and walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m.s(-1) while net exoskeleton work
   rate was systematically varied from -0.054 to 0.25 J.kg(-1).s(-1), with
   constant (0.12 N.m.kg(-1)) average exoskeleton torque, and while average
   exoskeleton torque was systematically varied from approximately zero to
   0.18 N.m.kg(-1), with approximately zero net exoskeleton work. We
   measured metabolic rate, center-of-mass mechanics, joint mechanics, and
   muscle activity. Both techniques reduced effort-related measures at the
   assisted ankle, but this form of work input reduced metabolic cost
   (-17\% with maximum net work input) while this form of torque support
   increased metabolic cost (+13\% with maximum average torque). Disparate
   effects on metabolic rate seem to be due to cascading effects on whole
   body coordination, particularly related to assisted ankle muscle
   dynamics and the effects of trailing ankle behavior on leading leg
   mechanics during double support. It would be difficult to predict these
   results using simple walking models without muscles or musculoskeletal
   models that assume fixed kinematics or kinetics. Data from this
   experiment can be used to improve predictive models of human
   neuromuscular adaptation and guide the design of assistive devices.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past century, the conventional film-based radiographic X-ray
   imaging has evolved into digital radiography (DR). Amorphous silicon
   thin-film transistor (TFT)-based flat panel X-ray detector was
   introduced two decades ago, and has become a ubiquitous platform for
   several imaging modalities, including chest radiography, mammography,
   and fluoroscopy. As a fundamental building block, an advanced pixel has
   thus been developed to tackle clinical challenges. However, all types of
   pixel architectures, either passive or active, unanimously keep sensing,
   storage, and readout components separate. This is disadvantageous in
   further reducing pixel size and improving spatial resolution. To address
   these problems, we hereby propose a novel architecture, which combines
   the abovementioned three functional units in one single dual-gate
   photo-TFT. In other words, the dual-gate photo-TFT alone works as a
   sensor, a storage, and a switch. In addition, by harnessing the
   amplification effect of TFT, it, for the first time, realizes one
   single-transistor active pixel sensor that makes a tremendous promise in
   achieving low-dose X-ray imaging for DR. In this paper, the
   proof-of-concept device was fabricated using the conventional amorphous
   silicon TFT technology and the device was characterized in a series of
   measurements of electrical and optoelectronic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Since thermal effects play a major role in filamentary RRAM devices, we
   compare the two localized thermometry methods developed for such
   devices. One method is based on short-pulsed measurements and the other
   on the measurement of minority-carrier injection from the filament into
   a semiconductor electrode by thermionic emission. We carried out and
   compared the measurements on the same functional oxide layer. Both
   methods indicate that the filament temperature is at least similar to
   550 K during device operation. Furthermore, comparison between the
   measured thermal resistance and the thermal simulations of both
   techniques shows that under the conditions of low forming current
   compliance (similar to 10 mu A), the filament dimensions are below
   similar to 5 nm. We show that the thermionic emission method is useful
   for high-resistance (>100 k Omega) devices operating at low-power
   conditions (<10 mu W), whereas the pulsed thermometry is more suitable
   for lower resistance devices (<500 k Omega) operated above 1 mu W. The
   average thermal resistance measured by the pulse technique decreases
   with applied power. Our simulations indicate that the expansion of the
   heated zone surrounding the filament can explain the observed reduction
   in thermal resistance with applied power. The underlying physics of the
   two methods is discussed.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchical assembly of self-healing adhesive proteins creates strong
   and robust structural and interfacial materials, but understanding of
   the molecular design and structure-property relationships of structural
   proteins remains unclear. Elucidating this relationship would allow
   rational design of next generation genetically engineered self-healing
   structural proteins. Here we report a general self-healing and -assembly
   strategy based on a multiphase recombinant protein based material.
   Segmented structure of the protein shows soft glycine-and tyrosine-rich
   segments with self-healing capability and hard beta-sheet segments. The
   soft segments are strongly plasticized by water, lowering the
   self-healing temperature close to body temperature. The hard segments
   self-assemble into nanoconfined domains to reinforce the material. The
   healing strength scales sublinearly with contact time, which associates
   with diffusion and wetting of autohesion. The finding suggests that
   recombinant structural proteins from heterologous expression have
   potential as strong and repairable engineering materials.}},

Title = {{Optimal Planning and Learning in Uncertain Environments for the
   Management of Wind Farms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wind energy is a key renewable source, yet wind farms have relatively
   high cost compared with many traditional energy sources. Among the life
   cycle costs of wind farms, operation and maintenance (O\&M) accounts for
   25-30\%, and an efficient strategy for management of turbines can
   significantly reduce the O\&M cost. Wind turbines are subject to
   fatigue-induced degradation and need periodic inspections and repairs,
   which are usually performed through semiannual scheduled maintenance.
   However, better maintenance can be achieved by flexible policies based
   on prior knowledge of the degradation process and on data collected in
   the field by sensors and visual inspections. Traditional methods to
   model the O\&M process, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and
   partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), have limitations that do not allow
   the model to properly include the knowledge available and that may
   result in nonoptimal strategies for management of the farm.
   Specifically, the conditional probabilities for modeling the degradation
   process and the precision of the observations are usually affected by
   epistemic uncertainty. Although MDPs and POMDPs are formulated for fixed
   transition and emission probabilities, the Bayes-adaptive POMDP
   (BA-POMDP) framework treats those conditional probabilities as random
   variables and is therefore suitable for including epistemic uncertainty.
   In this paper, a novel learning and planning method is proposed, called
   planning and learning in uncertain dynamic systems (PLUS), within the
   BA-POMDP framework that can learn from the environment, update the
   distributions of model parameters, and select the optimal strategy
   considering the uncertainty related to the model. Validating with
   synthetic data, the total management cost of a wind farm using PLUS is
   shown to be significantly less than costs achieved by a fixed policy or
   through the POMDP framework. The preliminary results show the promise of
   the proposed methodology for optimal management of wind farms. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Body condition scoring (BCS) is the most widely used method to assess
   changes in body fat reserves, which reflects its high potential to be
   included in onfarm welfare assessment protocols. Currently used scoring
   systems in dairy goats require animal restraint for body palpation. In
   this study, the Animal Welfare Indicators project (AWIN) proposes to
   overcome this constraint by developing a scoring system based only on
   visual assessment. The AWIN visual body condition scoring system
   highlights representative animals from 3 categories: very thin, normal,
   and very fat, and was built from data sets with photographs of animals
   scored by a commonly used 6-point scoring system that requires palpation
   in 2 anatomical regions. Development of the AWIN scoring system required
   3 steps: (1) identification and validation of a body region of interest;
   (2) sketching the region from photographs; and (3) creation of training
   material. The scoring system's reliability was statistically confirmed.
   An initial study identified features in the rump region from which we
   could compute a set of body measurements (i.e., measures based on
   anatomical references of the rump region) that showed a strong
   correlation with the assigned BCS. To validate the result, we collected
   a final data set from 171 goats. To account for variability in animal
   size and camera position, we mapped a subset of features to a standard
   template and aligned all the rump images before computing the body
   measurements. Scientific illustrations were created from the aligned
   images of animals identified as representative of each category to
   increase clarity and reproducibility. For training material, we created
   sketches representing the threshold between consecutive categories.
   Finally, we conducted 2 field reliability studies. In the first test, no
   training was given to 4 observers, whereas in the second, training using
   the threshold images was delivered to the same observers. In the first
   experiment, interobserver results was substantial, showing that the
   visual scoring system is clear and unambiguous. Moreover, results
   improved after training, reaching almost perfect agreement for the very
   fat category. The visual body condition scoring system is not only a
   practical tool for BCS in dairy goats but also shows potential to be
   fully automated, which would enhance its use in welfare assessment
   schemes and farm management.}},

Title = {{Extracting Low-Dimensional Latent Structure from Time Series in the
   Presence of Delays}},
Journal = {{NEURAL COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1825-1856}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Noisy, high-dimensional time series observations can often be described
   by a set of low-dimensional latent variables. Commonly used methods to
   extract these latent variables typically assume instantaneous
   relationships between the latent and observed variables. In many
   physical systems, changes in the latent variables manifest as changes in
   the observed variables after time delays. Techniques that do not account
   for these delays can recover a larger number of latent variables than
   are present in the system, thereby making the latent representation more
   difficult to interpret. In this work, we introduce a novel probabilistic
   technique, time-delay gaussian-process factor analysis (TD-GPFA), that
   performs dimensionality reduction in the presence of a different time
   delay between each pair of latent and observed variables. We demonstrate
   how using a gaussian process to model the evolution of each latent
   variable allows us to tractably learn these delays over a continuous
   domain. Additionally, we show how TD-GPFA combines temporal smoothing
   and dimensionality reduction into a common probabilistic framework. We
   present an expectation/conditional maximization either (ECME) algorithm
   to learn the model parameters. Our simulations demonstrate that when
   time delays are present, TD-GPFA is able to correctly identify these
   delays and recover the latent space. We then applied TD-GPFA to the
   activity of tens of neurons recorded simultaneously in the macaque motor
   cortex during a reaching task. TD-GPFA is able to better describe the
   neural activity using a more parsimonious latent space than GPFA, a
   method that has been used to interpret motor cortex data but does not
   account for time delays. More broadly, TD-GPFA can help to unravel the
   mechanisms underlying high-dimensional time series data by taking into
   account physical delays in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Rotodynamic blood pumps (also known as rotary or continuous flow blood
   pumps) are commonly evaluated in vitro under steady flow conditions.
   However, when these devices are used clinically as ventricular assist
   devices (VADs), the flow is pulsatile due to the contribution of the
   native heart. This study investigated the influence of this unsteady
   flow upon the internal hemodynamics of a centrifugal blood pump. The
   flow field within the median axial plane of the flow path was visualized
   with particle image velocimetry (PIV) using a transparent replica of the
   Levacor VAD. The replica was inserted in a dynamic cardiovascular
   simulator that synchronized the image acquisition to the cardiac cycle.
   As compared to steady flow, pulsatile conditions produced periodic,
   transient recirculation regions within the impeller and separation in
   the outlet diffuser. Dimensional analysis revealed that the flow
   characteristics could be uniquely described by the non-dimensional flow
   coefficient (Phi) and its time derivative (Phi), thereby eliminating
   impeller speed from the experimental matrix. Four regimes within the
   Phi-Phi plane were found to classify the flow patterns, well-attached or
   disturbed. These results and methods can be generalized to provide
   insights for both design and operation of rotodynamic blood pumps for
   safety and efficacy.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In conjoint analysis, interaction effects characterize how preference
   for the level of one product attribute is dependent on the level of
   another attribute. When interaction effects are negligible, a main
   effects fractional factorial experimental design can be used to reduce
   data requirements and survey cost. This is particularly important when
   the presence of many parameters or levels makes full factorial designs
   intractable. However, if interaction effects are relevant, main effects
   design can create biased estimates and lead to erroneous conclusions.
   This work investigates consumer preference interactions in the
   nontraditional context of visual choice-based conjoint analysis, where
   the conjoint attributes are parameters that define a product's shape.
   Although many conjoint studies assume interaction effects to be
   negligible, they may play a larger role for shape parameters. The role
   of interaction effects is explored in two visual conjoint case studies.
   The results suggest that interactions can be either negligible or
   dominant in visual conjoint, depending on consumer preferences.
   Generally, we suggest using randomized designs to avoid any bias
   resulting from the presence of interaction effects.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical method for solving the thermoelastic problem in
   heterogeneous polycrystals based on fast Fourier transforms is applied
   to thermal barrier coating systems. Several high resolution
   microstructures are generated synthetically to approximate thermal
   barrier coatings, with control over the grain size, grain morphology,

   modified by applying a localized Potts model to introduce interface
   rumpling. The global results of residual stress and elastic energy
   density are compared across the various microstructure instantiations.
   The local variations in elastic energy density are correlated to the
   amount of interface rumpling. The simulation result are also compared to
   an analytical result for an idealized interface morphology. The
   implications of the behavior of the local variations in elastic energy
   density are discussed in the context of thermal barrier coating failure.

Abstract = {{The Potts model of grain growth was adapted for the purpose of
   simulating abnormal grain growth (AGG) resulting from grain boundary
   complexion transitions. The transition in grain boundary structure
   between specific complexion types results in changes in properties.
   Where the transitions decrease energy and increase the mobility of
   boundaries, AGG occurs provided that such transitions predominantly
   occur via propagation to adjacent boundaries. Thus the model increases
   the mobility of selected boundaries on the basis of their adjacency to
   zero, one, or a multiplicity of boundaries that have already
   transitioned. The effect of transitions to a high mobility complexion
   was investigated separately from the effect of changes in energy. The
   influence of the frequency of complexion transitions with different
   adjacencies on the occurrence of AGG was explored. The simulations show
   how propagating complexion transitions can explain the AGG observed in
   certain ceramic systems. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{106-117}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The overarching objective behind this work is to merge publicly
   available data with utility consumption histories and extract
   statistically significant insight on utility usage for a group of houses
   (n = 7022) in Gainesville, USA. This study investigates the statistical
   descriptive power of publicly available information for modeling utility
   usage. We first examine the deviations that arise from monthly utility
   usage reading dates as reading dates tend to shift and reading periods
   tend to vary across different months. Then we run regression models for
   individual months which in turn we compare to a yearly regression model
   which accounts for months as a dummy variable to understand whether a
   monthly model or a yearly model has a larger statistical power. It is
   shown that publicly available data can be used to model residential
   utility usage in the absence of highly private utility data. The
   obtained results are helpful for utilities for two reasons: (1) using
   the models to predict the monthly changes in demand; and (2) predicting
   utility usage can be translated into energy-use intensity as a first-cut
   metric for energy efficiency targeting in their service territory to
   meet their state demand reduction targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The periocular region as a biometric trait has recently gained
   considerable traction, especially under challenging scenarios where
   reliable iris information is not available for human authentication. In
   this paper, we consider the problem of one-to-one (1 : 1) matching of
   highly nonideal periocular images captured in-the-wild under
   unconstrained imaging conditions. Such images exhibit considerable
   appearance variations, including nonuniform illumination variations,
   motion and defocus blur, off-axis gaze, and nonstationary pattern
   deformations. To address these challenges, we propose periocular
   probabilistic deformation models (PPDMs) that: 1) reduce the image
   matching problem to matching local image regions and 2) approximate the
   periocular distortions by local patch level spatial translations whose
   relationships are modeled by a Gaussian Markov random field. Given a
   periocular image pair, we determine the distortion-tolerant similarity
   metric by regularizing local match scores by the maximum a posteriori
   probability estimate of the relative local deformations between them.
   Unlike the existing global periocular image matching techniques, by
   accounting for local image deformations in the periocular matching
   process, PPDM exhibits greater tolerance to pattern variations. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our model via extensive evaluation on a
   large number of in-the-wild periocular images. We find that PPDMs
   outperform many benchmark 1 : 1 image matching techniques (improving
   verification rates at 0.1\% false accept rate by similar to 30\% over
   previous work and similar to 40\% when compared with the best baseline)
   in challenging scenarios leading to state-of-the-art verification
   performance on multiple real-world periocular data sets.}},

Title = {{A review of large-scale wind integration studies}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{768-794}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wind integration studies are an important tool for understanding the
   effects of increasing wind power deployment on grid reliability and
   system costs. This paper provides a detailed review of the statistical
   methods and results from 12 large-scale regional wind integration
   studies. In particular, we focus our review on the modeling methods and
   conclusions associated with estimating short-term balancing reserves
   (regulation and load-following). Several important observations proceed
   from this review. First, we found that many of the studies either
   explicitly or implicitly assume that wind power step-change data follow
   exponential probability distributions, such as the Gaussian
   distribution. To understand the importance of this issue we compared
   empirical wind power data to Gaussian data. The results illustrate that
   the Gaussian assumption significantly underestimates the frequency of
   very large changes in wind power, and thus may lead to an
   underestimation of undesirable reliability effects and of operating
   costs. Secondly, most of these studies make extensive use of wind speed
   data generated from mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.
   We compared the wind speed data from NWP models with empirical data and
   found that the NWP data have substantially less power spectral energy, a
   measure of variability, at higher frequencies relative to the empirical
   wind data. To the extent that this difference results in reduced
   high-frequency variability in the simulated wind power plants, studies
   using this approach could underestimate the need for fast ramping
   balancing resources. On the other hand, the magnitude of this potential
   underestimation is uncertain, largely because the methods used for
   estimating balancing reserve requirements depend on a number of
   heuristics, several of which are discussed in this review. Finally, we
   compared the power systems modeling methods used in the studies and
   suggest potential areas where research and development can reduce
   uncertainty in future wind integration studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{The potential of renewables versus natural gas with CO2 capture and
   storage for power generation under CO2 constraints}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The costs of intermittent renewable energy systems (IRES) and power
   storage technologies are compared on a level playing field to those of
   natural gas combined cycle power plants with CO2 capture and storage
   (NGCC-CCS). To account for technological progress over time, an
   ``experience curve{''} approach is used to project future levelised
   costs of electricity (LCOE) based on technology progress ratios and
   deployment rates in worldwide energy scenarios, together with European
   energy and technology cost estimates. Under base case assumptions, the
   LCOE in 2040 for baseload NGCC-CCS plants is estimated to be 71
   (sic)(2012)/MWh. In contrast, the LCOE for electricity generated
   intermittently from IRES is estimated at 68, 82, and 104 (sic)(2012)/MWh
   for concentrated solar power, offshore wind, and photovoltaic systems,
   respectively. Considering uncertainties in costs, deployment rates and
   geographical conditions, LCOE ranges for IRES are wider than for
   NGCC-CCS. We also assess energy storage technologies versus NGCC-CCS as
   backup options for IRES. Here, for base case assumptions NGCC-CCS with
   an LCOE of 90 (sic)(2012)/MWh in 2040 is more costly than pumped hydro
   storage (PHS) or compressed air and energy storage (CAES) with LCOEs of
   57 and 88 (sic)(2012)/MWh, respectively. Projected costs for battery
   backup are 78, 149, and 321 (sic)(2012)/MWh for Zn-Br, ZEBRA, and Li-ion
   battery systems, respectively. Finally, we compare four stylised
   low-carbon systems on a common basis (including all ancillary costs for
   IRES). In the 2040 base case, the system employing only NGCC-CCS has the
   lowest LCOE and lowest cost of CO2 avoided with CO2 emissions of 45
   kg/MWh. A zero CO2 emission system with IRES plus PHS as backup is 42\%
   more expensive in terms of LCOE, and 13\% more costly than a system with
   IRES plus NGCC-CCS backup with emissions of 23 kg CO2/MWh. Sensitivity
   results and study limitations are fully discussed within the paper. (C)

Title = {{Flexing into motion: A locomotion mechanism for soft robots}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{7-17}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Several recent designs of soft robots feature locomotion mechanisms that
   entail orchestrating changes to intrinsic curvature to enable the
   robot's limbs to either stick, adhere, or slip on the robot's workspace.
   The resulting locomotion mechanism has several features in common with
   peristaltic locomotion that can be found in the animal world. The
   purpose of the present paper is to examine the feasibility of, and
   design guidelines for, a locomotion mechanism that exploits the control
   of intrinsic curvature on a rough surface. With the help of a
   quasi-static analysis of a continuous model of a soft robot's limb, we
   show precisely how locomotion is induced and how the performance can be
   enhanced by controlling the curvature profile. Our work provides a
   framework for the theoretical analysis of the locomotion of the soft
   robot and the resulting analysis is also used to develop some design
   guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fe-C-Mn-Al steels have the potential to substitute for commercial Ni-Cr
   stainless steels. For the development of Fe-C-Mn-Al stainless steels,
   phase transformations play an important role. Our methods of studying
   the phase transformations of the steel include heating, cooling, and/or
   annealing. The results of our study show that spinodal decomposition, an
   atomic ordering reaction and the transformation of the L1(2) phase to
   kappa-carbide occur in the Fe-C-Mn-Al steel. After cooling, the
   austenite decomposes by the spinodal mechanism into solute-lean and
   solute-rich austenite phases. The solute-rich austenite phase also
   transforms into the L1(2) phase via the ordering reaction upon cooling
   to lower temperatures. After quenching and prolonged annealing, the
   L1(2) phase grows in the austenite and finally transforms into
   kappa-carbide. This L1(2) phase to kappa-carbide transformation has not
   been observed previously. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling of electrically controlled molecular diffusion in a nanofluidic
   channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to understand and quantitatively model the
   diffusive transport in electrically gated nanofluidic channels suitable
   for applications in drug delivery. Specifically, this work analyzed
   gated molecular diffusion through simulation in nanochannels between two
   chambers with asymmetric concentrations under a number of different
   control variables including surface charge, channel structure, drug
   molecule charge number, and background ionic concentration. When the
   dimension of the fluidic channel is comparable to the thickness of
   electrical double layer, the potential generated by gating inside of the
   channel becomes significant, which allows control of charged molecular
   diffusion inside of the nanochannel through electrostatic repulsion and
   attraction. In this work, the diffusion of molecules through a
   nanochannel is simulated in planar and cylindrical nanochannels when
   applying a gate voltage in two different surface charging scenarios. The
   gated nanochannel structures were modeled in the finite element software
   (COMSOL Multiphysics). The simulation results indicate that a small
   applied voltage can alter the diffusion rate by many orders of magnitude
   under certain conditions. The cylindrical nanochannel showed the best
   control of diffusion of charged molecules due to the
   exclusion-enrichment effect inside the nanochannel. (C) 2015 AIP

Title = {{Elasticity of frictionless particles near jamming}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{We study the linear elastic response of harmonic disk packings near
   jamming via three types of probes: (i) point forcing, (ii) constrained
   homogeneous deformation of subregions of large systems, and (iii)
   unconstrained deformation of the full system subject to periodic
   boundary conditions. For the point forcing, our results indicate that
   the transverse component of the response is governed by a lengthscale
   xi(T), which scales with the confining pressure, p, as xi(T) similar to
   p(-0.25), while the longitudinal component is governed by xi(L), which
   scales as xi(L) similar to p- 0.4. The former scaling is precisely the
   transverse lengthscale, which has been invoked to explain the structure
   of normal modes near the density of states anomaly in sphere packings,
   while the latter is much closer to the rigidity length, l({*}) similar
   to p-0.5, which has been invoked to describe the jamming scenario. For
   the case of constrained homogeneous deformation, we find that mu(R), the
   value of the shear modulus measured in boxes of size R, gives a value
   much higher than the continuum result for small boxes and recedes to its
   continuum limit only for boxes bigger than a characteristic length,
   which scales like p(-0.5), precisely the same way as l({*}). Finally,
   for the case of unconstrained homogeneous deformation, we find
   displacement fields with power spectra, which are consistent with
   independent, uncorrelated Eshelby transformations. The transverse sector
   is amazingly invariant with respect to p and very similar to what is
   seen in Lennard- Jones glasses. The longitudinal piece, however, is
   sensitive to p. It develops a plateau at long wavelength, the start of
   which occurs at a length that grows in the p -> 0 limit. Strikingly, the
   same behavior is observed both for applied shear and dilation.}},

Abstract = {{Complex, hypersaline brines including those coproduced with oil and gas,
   rejected from desalination technologies, or used as working fluids for
   geothermal electricity generation could contain critical materials such
   as the rare earth elements (REE) in valuable concentrations. Accurate
   quantitation of these analytes in complex, aqueous matrices is necessary
   for evaluation and implementation of systems aimed at recovering those
   critical materials. However, most analytical methods for measuring trace
   metals have not been validated for highly saline and/or chemically
   complex brines. Here we modified and optimized previously published
   liquid liquid extraction (LLE) techniques using bis(2-ethylhexyl)
   phosphate as the extractant in a heptane diluent, and studied its
   efficacy for REE recovery as a function of three primary variables:
   background salinity (as NaCl), concentration of a competing species
   (here Fe), and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Results
   showed that the modified LLE was robust to a range of salinity, Fe, and
   DOC concentrations studied as well as constant, elevated Ba
   concentrations. With proper characterization of the natural samples of
   interest, this method could be deployed for accurate analysis of REE in
   small volumes of hyper-saline and chemically complex brines.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method of in situ incorporation of an ATRP initiator during
   synthesis of hydroxyapatite particles is described. Calcium nitrate
   tetrahydrate, ammonium hydrogenphosphate and 2-bromo-2-methylpropionic
   acid were used as the functionalized hydroxyapatite precursors.
   Particles with homogenous size distribution within the diameter range of
   300 divided by 500 nm and controlled initiator content were synthetized.
   The synthetic procedure of hydroxyapatite was investigated in detail to
   determine the influence of numerous parameters such as pH of reaction
   mixture, ATRP initiator concentration, dilution of ammonium hydroxide,
   on the final properties of the particles. It appeared the optimal
   conditions were those in which reaction was carried out under basic
   conditions, namely pH = 10, attained by slow addition of the diluted
   ammonium hydroxide and using no more than 1 M initial concentration of
   ATRP initiator. The effectiveness of incorporated ATRP initiator was
   verified on the basis of surface initiated polymerization of methyl
   methacrylate. Particles and hybrids properties were investigated by DLS,
   elemental analysis, XRD, TEM, FT-IR and GPC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Understanding of the governing parameters that control the interaction
   of bio-sourced fillers with synthetic polymer materials is a
   long-standing challenge for their exploitation as a platform for
   material engineering. For the case of graft-lignin embedded in poly
   (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) it is demonstrated that tethering of
   polymeric chains with appropriate chain length to the surface of
   lignin-fillers dramatically increases the mechanical properties of
   PMMA/lignin composites, suggesting the PMMA grafts significantly
   enhanced filler-matrix interactions. Most metrics were maximized at 1\%
   loading, with a 3-fold increase in yield stress, a 4-fold increase in
   tensile strength, and a 7-fold increase in toughness, with a combination
   of properties that compare favorably to high-performance engineering
   polymers and polymer nanocomposites based on inorganic nanoparticles.
   The versatility of the surface-initiated controlled radical
   polymerization used for polymer graft modification suggests that the
   approach should be broadly applicable to a wide range of commodity and
   engineering polymers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Certain wastewaters from the nonalcoholic sugar-sweetened beverage
   industry, particularly those discarded because of deficient bottling
   processes or those returned from the market because of quality
   constraints, exhibit chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels as high as
   135000 mg of O-2/L because of their sugar content: 60-119 g/L, depending
   on the beverage. Thus, treating such wastewaters before discharging them
   into the environment involves high investment and operating costs.
   Therefore, any treatment process capable of transforming the sugars into
   other compounds that are easy to separate from the treated wastewater,
   such as ethanol or CO2, should be regarded as an interesting
   alternative. In this work, a process that comprises an alcoholic
   fermentation of sugar-sweetened beverage industry wastewaters followed
   by ethanol and biomass separation and subsequent aerobic propagation of
   yeast was developed, and its technical feasibility was studied. The
   proposed process was found to allow 98\% of the COD to be depleted.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important
   for tracking the health of individuals and populations over time.
   Generic HRQoL measures allow for comparison across health conditions.
   One form of generic HRQoL measures are profile measures, which provide a
   description of health across several different domains (such as physical
   functioning, depression, and pain). Recent advances in health profile
   measurement include the development of measures based on item response
   theory. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
   (PROMIS (R)) has been constructed using this theory. Another form of
   generic HRQoL measures are utility measures, which assess the value of
   health states. Multi-attribute utility theory provides a framework for
   valuing disparate domains of health and aggregating them into a single
   preference-based score. Such a score provides an overall measure of
   health outcomes as well as a quality of life weight for use in decision
   analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. Developing a utility score for
   PROMIS (R) would allow simultaneous estimation of both health profile
   and utility scores using a single measure. The purpose of this paper is
   to provide a roadmap of the methodological steps necessary to create
   such a scoring system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel Immersed Boundary Method where the embedded
   domain is exactly described by using its Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
   boundary representation with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) or
   T-splines. The common feature with other immersed methods is that the
   current approach substantially reduces the burden of mesh generation. In
   contrast, the exact boundary representation of the embedded domain
   allows to overcome the major drawback of existing immersed methods that
   is the inaccurate representation of the physical domain. A novel
   approach to perform the numerical integration in the region of the cut
   elements that is internal to the physical domain is presented and its
   accuracy and performance evaluated using numerical tests. The
   applicability, performance, and optimal convergence of the proposed
   methodology is assessed by using numerical examples in three dimensions.
   It is also shown that the accuracy of the proposed methodology is
   independent on the CAD technology used to describe the geometry of the
   embedded domain. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The recent growth in production and utilization of natural gas offers
   potential climate benefits, but those benefits depend on lifecycle
   emissions of methane, the primary component of natural gas and a potent
   greenhouse gas. This study estimates methane emissions from the
   transmission and storage (T\&S) sector of the United States natural gas
   industry using new data collected during 2012, including 2,292 onsite
   measurements, additional emissions data from 677 facilities and activity
   data from 922 facilities. The largest emission sources were fugitive
   emissions from certain compressor-related equipment and super-emitter
   facilities. We estimate total methane emissions from the T\&S sector at
   1,503 {[}1,220 to 1,950] Gg/yr (95\% confidence interval) compared to
   the 2012 Environmental Protection Agencys Greenhouse Gas Inventory
   (GHGI) estimate of 2,071 {[}1,680 to 2,690] Gg/yr. While the overlap in
   confidence intervals indicates that the difference is not statistically
   significant, this is the result of several significant, but offsetting,
   factors. Factors which reduce the study estimate include a lower
   estimated facility count, a shift away from engines toward
   lower-emitting turbine and electric compressor drivers, and reductions
   in the usage of gas-driven pneumatic devices. Factors that increase the
   study estimate relative to the GHGI include updated emission rates in
   certain emission categories and explicit treatment of skewed emissions
   at both component and facility levels. For T\&S stations that are
   required to report to the EPAs Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP),
   this study estimates total emissions to be 260\% {[}215\% to 330\%] of
   the reportable emissions for these stations, primarily due to the
   inclusion of emission sources that are not reported under the GHGRP
   rules, updated emission factors, and super-emitter emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Albedo modification (AM) is sometimes characterized as a potential means
   of avoiding climate threshold responses, including large-scale ice sheet
   mass loss. Previous work has investigated the effects of AM on total
   sea-level rise over the present century, as well as AM's ability to
   reduce long-term (>> 10(3) yr) contributions to sea-level rise from the
   Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). These studies have broken new ground, but
   neglect important feedbacks in the GIS system, or are silent on AM's
   effectiveness over the short time scales that may be most relevant for
   decision-making (< 10(3) yr). Here, we assess AM's ability to reduce GIS
   sea-level contributions over decades to centuries, using a simplified
   ice sheet model. We drive this model using a business-as-usual base
   temperature forcing scenario, as well as scenarios that reflect
   AM-induced temperature stabilization or temperature drawdown. Our model
   results suggest that (i) AM produces substantial near-term reductions in
   the rate of GIS-driven sea-level rise. However, (ii) sea-level rise
   contributions from the GIS continue after AM begins. These continued sea
   level rise contributions persist for decades to centuries after
   temperature stabilization and temperature drawdown begin, unless AM
   begins in the next few decades. Moreover, (iii) any regrowth of the GIS
   is delayed by decades or centuries after temperature drawdown begins,
   and is slow compared to pre-AM rates of mass loss. Combined with recent
   work that suggests AM would not prevent mass loss from the West
   Antarctic Ice Sheet, our results provide a nuanced picture of AM's
   possible effects on future sea-level rise.}},

Abstract = {{The electric power industry plays a critical role in the economy and the
   environment, and it is important to examine the economic, environmental,
   and policy implications of current and future power generation
   scenarios. However, the tools that exist to perform the life cycle
   assessments are either too complex or too aggregated to be useful for
   these types of activities. In this work, we build upon the framework of
   existing input-output (I-O) models by adding data about the electric
   power industry and disaggregating this single sector into additional
   sectors, each representing a specific portion of electric power industry
   operations. For each of these disaggregated sectors, we create a
   process-specific supply chain and a set of emission factors that allow
   calculation of the environmental effects of that sector's output. This
   new model allows a much better fit for scenarios requiring more
   specificity than is possible with the current I-O model.}},

Abstract = {{Most Lamb wave localization techniques require that we know the wave's
   velocity characteristics; yet, in many practical scenarios, velocity
   estimates can be challenging to acquire, are unavailable, or are
   unreliable because of the complexity of Lamb waves. As a result, there
   is a significant need for new methods that can reduce a system's
   reliance on a priori velocity information. This paper addresses this
   challenge through two novel source localization methods designed for
   sparse sensor arrays in isotropic media. Both methods exploit the
   fundamental sparse structure of a Lamb wave's frequency-wavenumber
   representation. The first method uses sparse recovery techniques to
   extract velocities from calibration data. The second method uses
   kurtosis and the support earth mover's distance to measure the
   sparseness of a Lamb wave's approximate frequency-wavenumber
   representation. These measures are then used to locate acoustic sources
   with no prior calibration data. We experimentally study each method with
   a collection of acoustic emission data measured from a 1.22 m by 1.22 m
   isotropic aluminum plate. We show that both methods can achieve less
   than 1 cm localization error and have less systematic error than
   traditional time-of-arrival localization methods.}},

   morphologies and crystallographic orientations of the high-temperature
   body-centered cubic prior-beta grains. The combination of these data has
   been used to gain an understanding of the role of the prior-beta grain
   structure in the formation of specific morphologies and spatial

Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{64-76}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present two dual control approaches to the model maintenance problem
   based on adaptive model predictive control (MPC). The controllers employ
   systematic self-excitation and design experiments that are performed
   under normal operation, resulting in improved control performance with
   smaller output variance and less control effort. Our control
   formulations offer a novel approach to the question of how to excite the
   plant input to generate informative data within the context of MPC and
   adaptive control. One controller actively tries to reduce the
   parameter-estimate error covariances; the other controller maximizes the
   information in the signals for enhanced learning. Our approach differs
   from existing ones in that we let our controllers converge to standard
   certainty equivalence (a) MPC when the parameter uncertainty decreases
   or more information is generated, and as a result we avoid plant
   excitation when the uncertainty is low or enough information has been
   generated. We demonstrate that the controllers work well with a large
   number of tuning configurations and also address the issue of models
   that are not admissible for control design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Failure rates and data driven policies for vehicle safety inspections in
   Pennsylvania}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{Rail, truck, commercial bus, and aircraft have federally mandated safety
   inspection programs in the United States, while inspections of personal
   vehicles, which make up the majority of passenger miles, are optionally
   imposed at the state level. In recent years, some states have chosen to
   eliminate the vehicle safety inspection program because of budget
   constraints and concerns about program effectiveness. Currently, 26
   states have a schedule for conducting safety inspections, but
   Pennsylvania is one of thirteen states that currently require all
   personal light duty vehicles to be inspected every year. The remaining
   states have completely eliminated safety inspection programs. However,
   as automobiles become safer, Pennsylvania legislators are now pushing to
   phase out the inspection program to reduce the costs of owning a
   vehicle. This study combines Pennsylvania vehicle registration data with
   two large samples of results from state safety inspections. We find that
   the state safety inspection fail rate for light-duty vehicles is
   12-18\%, well above the often-cited rate of 2\%. Vehicles that are older
   than three years old or have more than about 30,000 miles can have much
   higher rates. When analyzing new vehicles, less than or equal to one
   year old, it is found that even these vehicles have a failure rate
   greater than zero. Furthermore, while the vehicle fleet appears to be
   getting safer over the past few years by improvements in technology or
   other external circumstances, the inspection failure rate does not
   appear to be trending toward zero in the near future. We also show that
   accurate inspection data is limited and often incorrectly analyzed.
   Lastly, the importance of vehicle maintenance over a vehicle's lifetime
   is proven to be evident, since regular usage causes vehicles to
   deteriorate. We conclude that vehicle safety inspections should continue
   to be implemented in order to keep driving conditions safe. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Systematic defects within integrated circuits (ICs) are a significant
   source of failures in nanoscale technologies. Identification of
   systematic defects is therefore very important for yield improvement.
   This paper discusses a diagnosis-driven systematic defect identification
   methodology that we call layout analysis for systematic IC-defect
   identification using clustering (LASIC). By clustering images of the
   layout locations that correspond to diagnosed sites for a statistically
   large number of IC failures, LASIC uncovers the common layout features.
   To reduce computation time, only the dominant coefficients of a discrete
   cosine transform analysis of the layout images are used for clustering.
   LASIC is applied to an industrial chip and it is found to be effective.
   In addition, detailed simulations reveal that LASIC is both accurate and
   effective.}},

   CH3CH=O (CD3CD=O, CF3CH=O), CH2=CH2 (CD2=CD2, CF2=CH2), H2O (D2O) and
   H-2 (D-2) were formed in all cases. The CH3CH2OH decomposition mechanism
   includes the formation of two intermediate species on the surface:
   CH3CH2- bonded to surface lattice O atoms decomposes to form CH2=CH2
   while CH3CH2O- bonded to surface Zn atoms decomposes to form CH3CH=O. A
   significant isotope effect observed for the formation of CH2=CH2 versus
   CD2=CD2 suggests that C-H(D) bond breaking at the beta-carbon is the
   rate-limiting step in CH3CH2- (CD3CD2-) decomposition. Decomposition of
   CF3CH2OH leaves F-atoms on the surface as a result of beta-fluoride
   elimination in CF3CH2-. A significant F substituent effect in desorption
   of CF3CH=O versus CH3CH=O indicates that the CF3 group increases the
   barrier to the beta-hydride elimination step yielding CF3CH=O and
   suggests that the transition state is cationic, C delta+ center dot

Abstract = {{Active learning techniques have gained popularity to reduce human effort
   in labeling data instances for inducing a classifier. When faced with
   large amounts of unlabeled data, such algorithms automatically identify
   the exemplar and representative instances to be selected for manual
   annotation. More recently, there have been attempts toward a batch mode
   form of active learning, where a batch of data points is simultaneously
   selected from an unlabeled set. Real-world applications require adaptive
   approaches for batch selection in active learning, depending on the
   complexity of the data stream in question. However, the existing work in
   this field has primarily focused on static or heuristic batch size
   selection. In this paper, we propose two novel optimization-based
   frameworks for adaptive batch mode active learning (BMAL), where the
   batch size as well as the selection criteria are combined in a single
   formulation. We exploit gradient-descent-based optimization strategies
   as well as properties of submodular functions to derive the adaptive
   BMAL algorithms. The solution procedures have the same computational
   complexity as existing state-of-the-art static BMAL techniques. Our
   empirical results on the widely used VidTIMIT and the mobile biometric
   (MOBIO) data sets portray the efficacy of the proposed frameworks and
   also certify the potential of these approaches in being used for
   real-world biometric recognition applications.}},

Abstract = {{Several methods have recently been proposed for modeling spatially
   continuous head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) using techniques
   based on finite-order spherical harmonic expansion. These techniques
   inherently impart some amount of spatial smoothing to the measured
   HRTFs. However, the effect this spatial smoothing has on the
   localization accuracy has not been analyzed. Consequently, the
   relationship between the order of a spherical harmonic representation
   for HRTFs and the maximum localization ability that can be achieved with
   that representation remains unknown. The present study investigates the
   effect that spatial smoothing has on virtual sound source localization
   by systematically reducing the order of a spherical-harmonic-based HRTF
   representation. Results of virtual localization tests indicate that
   accurate localization performance is retained with spherical harmonic
   representations as low as fourth-order, and several important physical
   HRTF cues are shown to be present even in a first-order representation.
   These results suggest that listeners do not rely on the fine details in
   an HRTF's spatial structure and imply that some of the
   theoretically-derived bounds for HRTF sampling may be exceeding
   perceptual requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation filters (CFs) are a class of classifiers that are attractive
   for object localization and tracking applications. Traditionally, CFs
   have been designed in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier
   transform (DFT), where correlation is efficiently implemented. However,
   existing CF designs do not account for the fact that the multiplication
   of two DFTs in the frequency domain corresponds to a circular
   correlation in the time/spatial domain. Because this was previously
   unaccounted for, prior CF designs are not truly optimal, as their
   optimization criteria do not accurately quantify their optimization
   intention. In this paper, we introduce new zero-aliasing constraints
   that completely eliminate this aliasing problem by ensuring that the
   optimization criterion for a given CF corresponds to a linear
   correlation rather than a circular correlation. This means that previous
   CF designs can be significantly improved by this reformulation. We
   demonstrate the benefits of this new CF design approach with several
   important CFs. We present experimental results on diverse data sets and
   present solutions to the computational challenges associated with
   computing these CFs. Code for the CFs described in this paper and their
   respective zero-aliasing versions is available at

Abstract = {{Actuated lidar, where a scanning lidar is combined with an actuation
   mechanism to scan a three-dimensional volume rather than a single line,
   has been used heavily in a wide variety of field robotics applications.
   Common examples of actuated lidar include spinning/rolling and
   nodding/pitching configurations. Due to the construction of actuated
   lidar, the center of rotation of the lidar mirror may not coincide with
   the center of rotation of the actuation mechanism. To triangulate a
   precise point cloud representation of the environment, the centers of
   rotation must be brought into alignment using a suitable calibration
   procedure. We refer to this problem as estimating the internal
   parameters of actuated lidar. In this work, we focus on spinning/rolling
   lidar and present a fully automated algorithm for calibration using
   generic scenes without the need for specialized calibration targets. The
   algorithm is evaluated on a range of real and synthetic data and is
   shown to be robust, accurate, and have a large basin of convergence.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of severe clinically significant forms of congenital heart
   disease (CHD) are associated with great artery lesions, including
   hypoplastic, double, right or interrupted aortic arch morphologies.
   While fetal and neonatal interventions are advancing, their potential
   ability to restore cardiac function, optimal timing, location, and
   intensity required for intervention remain largely unknown. Here, we
   combine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with in vivo
   experiments to test how individual pharyngeal arch artery hemodynamics
   alter as a result of local interventions obstructing individual arch
   artery flow. Simulated isolated occlusions within each pharyngeal arch
   artery were created with image-derived three-dimensional (3D)
   reconstructions of normal chick pharyngeal arch anatomy at
   Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) developmental stages HH18 and HH24. Acute flow
   redistributions were then computed using in vivo measured
   subject-specific aortic sinus inflow velocity profiles. A kinematic
   vascular growth-rendering algorithm was then developed and implemented
   to test the role of changing local wall shear stress patterns in
   downstream 3D morphogenesis of arch arteries. CFD simulations predicted
   that altered pressure gradients and flow redistributions were most
   sensitive to occlusion of the IVth arches. To evaluate these simulations
   experimentally, a novel in vivo experimental model of pharyngeal arch
   occlusion was developed and implemented using two-photon
   microscopy-guided femtosecond laser-based photodisruption surgery. The
   right IVth arch was occluded at HH18, and resulting diameter changes
   were followed for up to 24 h. Pharyngeal arch diameter responses to
   acute hemodynamic changes were predicted qualitatively but poorly
   quantitatively. Chronic growth and adaptation to hemodynamic changes,
   however, were predicted in a subset of arches. Our findings suggest that
   this complex biodynamic process is governed through more complex forms
   of mechanobiological vascular growth rules. Other factors in addition to
   wall shear stress or more complex WSS rules are likely important in the
   long-term arterial growth and patterning. Combination in
   silico/experimental platforms are essential for accelerating our
   understanding and prediction of consequences from embryonic/fetal
   cardiovascular occlusions and lay the foundation for noninvasive methods
   to guide CHD diagnosis and fetal intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with distributed learning in large-scale games.
   The well-known fictitious play (FP) algorithm is addressed, which,
   despite theoretical convergence results, might be impractical to
   implement in large-scale settings due to intense computation and
   communication requirements. An adaptation of the FP algorithm,
   designated as the empirical centroid fictitious play (ECFP), is
   presented. In ECFP players respond to the centroid of all players'
   actions rather than track and respond to the individual actions of every
   player. Convergence of the ECFP algorithm in terms of average empirical
   frequency (a notion made precise in the paper) to a subset of the Nash
   equilibria is proven under the assumption that the game is a potential
   game with permutation invariant potential function. A more general
   formulation of ECFP is then given (which subsumes FP as a special case)
   and convergence results are given for the class of potential games.
   Furthermore, a distributed formulation of the ECFP algorithm is
   presented, in which, players endowed with a (possibly sparse)
   preassigned communication graph, engage in local, non-strategic
   information exchange to eventually agree on a common equilibrium.

Title = {{The Impact of Sustainability on Consumer Preference Judgments of Product
   Attributes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite significant interest from consumers, sustainable products often
   struggle to find success in the marketplace. This failure is frequently
   attributed to the perception that consumers remain unwilling to
   sacrifice product attributes such as form, function, or price in order
   to adopt a product whose environmental impact is less than that of a
   competing product. This work aims to better understand how knowing a
   product's environmental impact affects preference for that product's
   disparate attributes. Three products of various monetary investments and
   numbers of relevant features were explored through a conjoint analysis
   experiment that uncovers consumer preference for discrete form,
   function, and price attributes. In this work, single use spoons,
   reusable water bottles, and home washing machines were used for
   analysis. These three products were decomposed into form, function, and
   price attributes that were varied in discrete levels. After a form-only
   ratings-based conjoint analysis study was conducted to find high,
   medium, and low preference form designs for each participant, two
   separate form-function-price discrete choice studies were conducted for
   each of the three products. These two discrete choice trials were
   identical in all aspects except in the second trial participants were
   provided with calculated environmental impact values for all design
   configurations; the presented environmental impact information was a
   dependent variable based on a life cycle analysis calculation using the
   current product configuration being shown to the participant. Further,
   adding this information raises the decision to one of a social or moral
   choice. Results show that when participants are provided with this
   additional piece of information, their preference for form, function,
   and price attributes of a product is greatly impacted. In particular, we
   find that for the products chosen here, the importance of functional
   attributes increases in the context of environmental impact metrics,
   while the importance of form decreases and the importance of price
   decreases modestly. In other words, placing the preference judgment
   within a social or moral choice context changes decisions about product
   preferences.}},

Title = {{Deciphering the Influence of Product Shape on Consumer Judgments Through
   Geometric Abstraction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Understanding and tailoring the visual elements of a developing product
   to evoke desired perceived qualities and a positive response from the
   consumer is a key challenge in industrial design. To date, computational
   approaches to assist this process have either relied on stiff geometric
   representations, or focused on superficial features that exclude often
   elusive shape characteristics. In this work, we aim to study the
   relationship between product geometry and consumers' qualitative
   judgments through a visual decomposition and abstraction of existing
   products. At the heart of our investigation is a shape analysis method
   that produces a spectrum of abstractions for a given three-dimensional
   (3D) computer model. Our approach produces a hierarchical simplification
   of an end product, whereby consumer response to geometric elements can
   be statistically studied across different products, as well as across
   the different abstractions of one particular product. The results of our
   case study show that consumer judgments formed by coarse product
   ``impressions{''} are strongly correlated with those evoked by the final
   production models. This outcome highlights the importance of early
   geometric explorations and assessments before committing to detailed
   design efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The strain glass transition has been found in many ferroelastic systems,
   but the microstructural nature of strain glass is still unclear. Here,
   two-dimensional second and fourth order moment invariants as well as
   image entropy are used to evaluate the presence of a strain-glass state
   in simulated microstructure images of a doped ferroelastic system. Four
   different microstructural states are identified, depending on the doping
   concentration of point defects and the temperature. The martensitic
   state is characterized by a broad moment invariant distribution peaking
   near the invariants for the circle, whereas systems that display the
   strain glass transition produce distinctly different distributions. The
   image entropy is found to increase with increasing defect concentration;
   above the critical defect concentration of 0.1, image entropy becomes
   nearly linearly dependent on temperature. The image analysis approach is
   capable of characterizing the range of strain domain shapes that occur
   in the different microstructural states of a doped ferroelastic system.

Abstract = {{Bacterial infection of subcutaneous ``pockets{''} housing cardiovascular
   implantable electronic devices is a significant clinical complication.
   In this study, pacemakers encapsulated in a blood plasma-based material
   (PBM) composited with antibiotics were investigated for use as
   prophylactics against such infections. PBMs, which are made from pooled
   allogeneic plasma and platelets, are off-the-shelf biomaterials that can
   be manufactured in the form of complex 3D shapes, extrudable putties, or
   injectable pastes. In vitro studies with PBM pastes formulated with
   rifampicin and minocycline demonstrated antibiotic release over 6 days,
   activity against Escherichia coli, and reduced cytotoxic effects of the
   antibiotics on fibroblasts. The materials were also evaluated in vivo in
   a rabbit model in which pacemaker pockets were inoculated with
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strain and
   examined 1 week later. The pockets containing the pacemaker plus S.
   aureus were grossly purulent and culture positive, whereas pockets into
   which PBM with antibiotics were injected around the pacemaker were free
   of purulence and culture negative (p < 0.001). None of the pockets into
   which PBM without antibiotics were placed demonstrated purulence, but
   60\% were culture positive. These results demonstrate the potential of
   PBMs to deliver antibiotics to diminish the incidence of pocket
   infections for pacemakers and other implantable devices. (C) 2015

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{61-67}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory analyses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) often do not
   quantitate the 209 individual PCB congeners, thereby requiring analyst
   interpretation to determine individual congener concentrations. Error
   introduced during this interpretation is subsequently propagated to
   calculated surrogate variables, such as the number of chlorines per
   biphenyl (CPB), and the molar dechlorination product ratio (MDPR), which
   are used to assess the extent of dechlorination and inform remedial
   decisions. The present work applies a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis to
   assess current methods for quantitating co-eluting congeners and the
   errors that could occur in individual congeners and derived CPB and MDPR
   estimates. Synthetic chromatograms, which were created using two
   alternative methods (random assignment and assignment based on relative
   proportions in Aroclors) for assigning mass to co-eluting congeners,
   were compared to their fully-quantitated counterparts. The percent error
   introduced in total PCB (PCB) concentration ranges from approximately
   -60\% to +50\%. Similarly, the errors associated with CPB and MDPR
   estimates range from approximately -20\% to +20\% and -120\% to +30\%,
   respectively. Uncertainties introduced during congener analysis and
   propagated to surrogate variables can thus be substantial, and should be
   considered in assessments of the extent of dechlorination and associated
   remedial decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations of Ag films equilibrated on Ni have been
   performed for 12 different Ni substrate orientations. The results show
   that well-equilibrated films display several different orientation
   relationships (ORs) depending on the Ni substrate orientation:
   cube-on-cube, twin, oct-cube, and a series of special ORs that are a
   consequence of the oct-cube OR that develops on Ni(100). It is found
   that an important feature displayed by the observed ORs is the alignment
   of the step edges of the Ag film with those of the Ni substrate at the
   interface. Such alignment is initiated during film formation, but also
   tends to produce minimum energy interfaces between film and substrate.
   This feature of hetero-epitaxy and of the resulting ORs has not

Abstract = {{The orientation relationships (ORs) that develop when Ag films are
   equilibrated on more than 200 different Ni substrate orientations
   distributed over the standard stereographic triangle have been
   determined by electron backscatter diffraction. Four different types of
   OR have been observed, including cube-on-cube, twin-related, oct-cube
   (that develops only on Ni(100)), as well as a family of more complex ORs
   (referred to as ``special{''}) that arise during the gradual transition
   from the oct-cube to the twin OR. The importance of the alignment of
   step edges on the Ag side of the interface with those of the Ni
   substrate, in the development of ORs, has been validated by comparison
   with the results obtained on the large range of substrate orientations
   investigated in this study. This step alignment occurs in the early
   stages of film formation, but is also consistent with equilibrium ORs as
   it tends to produce minimum energy interfaces. This feature of
   hetero-epitaxy and of the resulting ORs has not previously been

Abstract = {{The ability to accurately and safely monitor hydrogen concentration is
   of significant importance for abroad range of energy, defense, aviation,
   and aerospace applications with one of the most notable applications
   being leak detection for hydrogen above the lower explosive limit.
   Optical-based approaches offer significant safety advantages as compared
   to electrical-based sensors and Pd or AuPd-alloys are commonly utilized
   as the functional sensor layer due to a well-known, characteristic, and
   selective interaction with H-2. In this work, optical fiber-based
   sensors comprised of Pd and AuPd alloy nanoparticle incorporated SiO2
   thin films deposited onto unclad multimode silica-based optical fiber
   evanescent wave absorption spectroscopy sensing elements have been
   investigated. Selective, sensitive, and monotonic H-2 sensing responses
   have been demonstrated at levels significantly greater than the lower
   explosive limitin the presence of CO and O-2 near room temperature. A
   tendency for partial oxidation of the noble metal nanoparticles upon
   exposure to oxidizing atmospheres is confirmed directly through X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, particularly at elevated temperatures.
   Monotonic H-2 sensing responses are also observed at elevated
   temperatures in cases where oxygen is not introduced into the
   atmosphere. However, more complex sensing responses in multi-component
   elevated temperature gas streams containing oxidizing and reducing
   species can be observed which likely result from oxidation and reduction
   of noble metal nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that the
   incorporation of noble metals such as Pd and Pd-alloy nanoparticles into
   inert dielectric matrices such as SiO2 can impart new optical sensing
   functionality potentially useful for H-2 sensing applications. Published

Abstract = {{We propose two data-driven, optimization-based frameworks
   (simulation-optimization and bi-objective optimization) to account for
   production variability in the operations planning stage of the sales and
   operations planning (S\&OP) of an enterprise. Production variability is
   measured as the deviation between historical planned (target) and actual
   (achieved) production rates. A statistical technique, namely, quantile
   regression, is used to model the distribution,of deviation values given
   planned production rates. Scenarios are constructed by sampling from the
   distribution of deviation values and used as inputs to the proposed
   optimization-based frameworks. Advantages and disadvantages of the two
   proposed frameworks are discussed. The applicability of the proposed
   methodology is illustrated with a detailed analysis of the results of a
   motivating example and a real-world production planning problem from a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{A high-throughput investigation of local epitaxy (called combinatorial
   substrate epitaxy) was carried out on Ca2MnO4 Ruddlesden-Popper thin
   films of six thicknesses (from 20 to 400 nm), all deposited on
   isostructural polycrystalline Sr2TiO4 substrates. Electron backscatter
   diffraction revealed grain-over-grain local epitaxial growth for all
   films, resulting in a single orientation relationship (OR) for each
   substrate-film grain pair. Two preferred epitaxial ORs accounted for
   more than 90\% of all ORs on 300 different microcrystals, based on
   analyzing 50 grain pairs for each thickness. The unit cell over unit
   cell OR ({[}100]{[}001](film) parallel to {[}100]{[}001] (substrate), or
   OR1) accounted for approximately 30\% of each film. The OR that
   accounted for 60\% of each film ({[}100]{[}001] (film) parallel to
   {[}100]{[}010] substrate, or OR2) corresponds to a rotation from OR1 by
   90 degrees about the a-axis. OR2 is strongly favored for substrate
   orientations in the center of the stereographic triangle, and OR1 is
   observed for orientations very close to (001) or to those near the edge
   connecting (100) and (110). While OR1 should be lower in energy, the
   majority observation of OR2 implies kinetic hindrances decrease the
   frequency of OR1. Persistent grain over grain growth and the absence of
   variations of the OR frequencies with thickness implies that the growth
   competition is finished within the first few nm, and local epitaxy
   persists thereafter during growth. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The structural details of bottlebrush polymers, specifically the
   grafting density and molecular weight distribution of side chains,
   influence their physical properties; however, they are difficult to
   analyze using conventional techniques. Herein we report the synthesis,
   chatacterization, and molecular imaging of bottlebrush macromolecules
   with both uniform and bimodal length distributions of poly(n-butyl
   acrylate) (PnBA) side chains. The densely grafted copolymers were
   prepared via the ``grafting from{''} approach using atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP). Bottlebrush macromolecules with both
   shorter and longer grafted chains were prepared by removal of a fraction
   of the bromine chain ends of the initial densely grafted brush by
   selective capping with 4-butoxy-TEMPO and subsequent chain extension of
   remaining active chains forming longer PnBA grafts. This procedure
   provided bottlebrush macromolecules with two distinct degrees of
   polymerization of the grafted side chains herein called bimodal grafts.
   AFM imaging of individual macromolecules confirmed the formation of
   wormlike structures with a distinct halo of diffuse side chains
   originating from bottlebrushes with bimodal PnBA grafts, To quantify the
   grafting density and dispersity of the initial monomodal side chains,
   the side chains were cleaved froth the backbone and independently
   characterized. Utilizing a combination of AFM molecular imaging and the
   Langmuir-Blodgett technique, the grafting density of monomodal
   bottlebrushes was measured. The distance between macromolecules is
   linearly proportional to the weight-average degree of polymerization of
   the side chains for both the monomodal and bimodal brushes.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous and nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloys have garnered
   interests in academia and industry due to their potentials for
   applications, such as power transformers, electric motors, and sensors.
   To achieve good glass formability, thermal stability, and prevent grain

   magnetic systems. However, the high price of these precursors results in
   expensive soft magnetic alloys. Herein, we report on substituting Ta and
   Hf with TaC and HfC, respectively, to significantly reduce the cost of
   Fe-based FINEMET and Co-based HTX005 alloys. Soft magnetic properties of
   these alloys are studied. The effect of thermal annealing and strain
   annealing on TaC and HfC substituted alloys are also investigated.
   Lastly, we discuss the cost analysis on these alloys. Using the
   synthesis route presented here, a cost reduction of up to 74\% can be
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Among the ``beyond Li-ion{''} battery chemistries, nonaqueous Li-O-2
   batteries have the highest theoretical specific energy and, as a result,
   have attracted significant research attention over the past decade. A
   critical scientific challenge facing nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries is the
   electronically insulating nature of the primary discharge product,
   lithium peroxide, which passivates the battery cathode as it is formed,
   leading to low ultimate cell capacities. Recently, strategies to enhance
   solubility to circumvent this issue have been reported, but rely upon
   electrolyte formulations that further decrease the overall
   electrochemical stability of the system, thereby deleteriously affecting
   battery rechargeability. In this study, we report that a significant
   enhancement (greater than fourfold) in Li-O-2 cell capacity is possible
   by appropriately selecting the salt anion in the electrolyte solution.
   Using Li-7 NMR and modeling, we confirm that this improvement is a
   result of enhanced Li+ stability in solution, which, in turn, induces
   solubility of the intermediate to Li2O2 formation. Using this strategy,
   the challenging task of identifying an electrolyte solvent that
   possesses the anticorrelated properties of high intermediate solubility
   and solvent stability is alleviated, potentially providing a pathway to
   develop an electrolyte that affords both high capacity and
   rechargeability. We believe the model and strategy presented here will
   be generally useful to enhance Coulombic efficiency in many
   electrochemical systems (e. g., Li-S batteries) where improving
   intermediate stability in solution could induce desired mechanisms of
   product formation.}},

Abstract = {{Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) was used to characterize
   coherently strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) films grown on
   (110)(cubic)-SrTiO3 (STO) and (100)(orthorhombic)-NdGaO3 (NGO). We focus
   on the characterization of a relatively low density (1-3 mu m/mu m(2))
   of meandering loops (MLs) found in the LSM film on STO and absent in the
   film on NGO. The MLs exhibit a uniform contrast variation from the
   background and a strong contrast dependence on the diffraction vector g.
   The MLs are quantitatively consistent with LSM anti-phase boundaries
   (APBs) having a displacement vector R = 1/2{[}001](LSM). These APBs are
   consistent with a ``double positioning{''} degeneracy of tilted
   octahedra along {[}001](LSM) on untilted octahedra along {[}001](STO).
   The results highlight the non-destructive capacity of ECCI to
   characterize extended defects in oxide films. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Graphene Plasmonic Metasurfaces to Steer Infrared Light}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Metasurfaces utilizing engineered metallic nanostructures have recently
   emerged as an important means to manipulate the propagation of light
   waves in a prescribed manner. However, conventional metallic
   metasurfaces mainly efficiently work in the visible and near-infrared
   regime, and lack sufficient tunability. In this work, combining the
   pronounced plasmonic resonance of patterned graphene structures with a
   subwavelength-thick optical cavity, we propose and demonstrate novel
   graphene metasurfaces that manifest the potential to dynamically control
   the phase and amplitude of infrared light with very high efficiency. It
   is shown that the phase of the infrared light reflected from a simple
   graphene ribbon metasurface can span over almost the entire 2 pi range
   by changing the width of the graphene ribbons, while the amplitude of
   the reflection can be maintained at high values without significant
   variations. We successfully realize anomalous reflection, reflective
   focusing lenses, and non-diffracting Airy beams based on graphene
   metasurfaces. Our results open up a new paradigm of highly integrated
   photonic platforms for dynamic beam shaping and adaptive optics in the
   crucial infrared wavelength range.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary application of unconverted heat produced during electric power
   generation has the potential to improve the life-cycle fuel efficiency
   of the electric power industry and the sectors it serves. This work
   quantifies the residual heat (also known as waste heat) generated by
   U.S. thermal power plants and assesses the intermittency and transport
   issues that must be considered when planning to utilize this heat.
   Combining Energy Information Administration plant-level data with
   literature-reported process efficiency data, we develop estimates of the
   unconverted heat flux from individual U.S. thermal power plants in 2012.
   Together these power plants discharged an estimated 18.9 billion GJth of
   residual heat in 2012, 4\% of which was discharged at temperatures
   greater than 90 degrees C. We also characterize the temperature, spatial
   distribution, and temporal availability of this residual heat at the
   plant level and model the implications for the technical and economic
   feasibility of its end use. Increased implementation of flue gas
   desulfurization technologies at coal-fired facilities and the higher
   quality heat generated in the exhaust of natural gas fuel cycles are
   expected to increase the availability of residual heat generated by
   10.6\% in 2040.}},

Title = {{Speciation Matters: Bioavailability of Silver and Silver Sulfide
   Nanoparticles to Alfalfa (Medicago sativa)}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial crops are directly exposed to silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs)
   and their environmentally transformed analog silver sulfide
   nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs) when wastewater treatment biosolids are applied
   as fertilizer to agricultural soils. This leads to a need to understand
   their bioavailability to plants. In the present study, the mechanisms of
   uptake and distribution of silver in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) were
   quantified and visualized upon hydroponic exposure to Ag-NPs, Ag2S-NPs,
   and AgNO3 at 3 mg total Ag/L. Total silver uptake was measured in dried
   roots and shoots, and the spatial distribution of elements was
   investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   synchrotron-based X-ray imaging techniques. Despite large differences in
   release of Ag+ ions from the particles, Ag-NPs, Ag2S-NPs, and Ag+ became
   associated with plant roots to a similar degree, and exhibited similarly
   limited (<1\%) amounts of translocation of silver into the shoot system.
   X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping revealed differences in the
   distribution of Ag into roots for each treatment. Silver nanoparticles
   mainly accumulated in the (columella) border cells and elongation zone,
   whereas Ag+ accumulated more uniformly throughout the root. In contrast,
   Ag2S-NPs remained largely adhered to the root exterior, and the presence
   of cytoplasmic nano-SixOy aggregates was observed. Exclusively in roots
   exposed to particulate silver, NPs smaller than the originally dosed NPs
   were identified by TEM in the cell walls. The apparent accumulation of
   Ag in the root apoplast determined by XRF, and the presence of small NPs
   in root cell walls suggests uptake of partially dissolved NPs and
   translocation along the apoplast.}},

   micron-sized TiO2 (dissolved/bulk metal biosolids) introduced into the
   influent wastewater stream, or (3) no metal added to influent wastewater

   reductions in nodulation frequency, plant growth, and significant shifts
   in soil microbial community composition were found for the ENM treatment

   location (using average emission factors), We argue that
   consumption-based marginal emission factors are conceptually appropriate
   for evaluating the emissions implications of policies, that increase
   electric vehicle sales or use in a region, We also examine generation
   based marginal emission factors to assess robustness. Using, these two
   estimates of NERC region marginal emission factors, we find the
   following: (1) delayed charging starting at midnight) leads to higher
   emissions in most cases due largely to increased coal in the
   marginal,generation mix at night; (2) the Chevrolet Volt has higher
   expected life cycle emissions than the Toyota Prius hybrid electric
   vehicle (the most efficient U.S. gasoline vehicle) across the U.S. in
   nearly all scenarios; (3) the Nissan Leaf BEV has lower life cycle
   emissions than the Prius in the western U.S. and in Texas, but the Prius
   has lower emissions in the northern Midwest regardless of assumed
   Charging scheme and marginal, emissions estimation method; (4) in other
   regions the lowest emitting vehicle depends on charge timing and
   emission factor estimation assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{Short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) therapeutics show promise for
   the treatment of intestinal diseases by specifically suppressing the
   expression of disease relevant proteins. Recently, a class of lipid-like
   materials termed ``lipidoids{''} have been shown to potently deliver
   siRNA to the liver and immune cells. Here, we seek to establish the
   utility of lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs) in the context of siRNA
   delivery to the intestinal epithelium. Initial studies demonstrated that
   the siRNA-loaded LNPs mediated potent, dose dependent, and durable gene
   silencing in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, with a single 10 nM
   dose depressing GAPDH mRNA expression for one week. Transfection with
   siRNA-loaded LNPs did not induce significant cytotoxicity in Caco-2
   cells or alter intestinal barrier function. Protein silencing was
   confirmed by Western blotting, with the lowest levels of GAPDH protein
   expression observed five days post-transfection. Together, these data
   underscore the potential of LNPs for the treatment of intestinal
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainties surrounding the initial conditions in Earth system
   models can considerably influence interpretations about climate trends
   and variability. Here we present results from a new climate change
   ensemble experiment using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to
   analyze the effect of internal variability on regional climate variables
   that are relevant for decision making. Each simulation is initialized
   from a unique and dynamically consistent model state sampled from a
   similar to 10,000year fully coupled equilibrium simulation, which
   captures the internal unforced variability of the coupled Earth system.
   We find that internal variability has a sizeable contribution to the
   modeled ranges of temperature and precipitation. The effects increase
   for more localized regions. The ensemble exhibits skill in simulating
   key regional climate processes relevant to decision makers, such as
   seasonal temperature variability and extremes. The presented ensemble
   framework and results can provide useful resources for uncertainty
   quantification, integrated assessment, and climate risk management.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of vast clinical utility, with tens
   of millions of scans performed annually: Chemical contrast agents (CAs)
   can greatly enhance the diagnostic potential of MRI, and similar to 50\%
   of MRI scans use CAs. However, CAs have significant limitations such as
   low contrast enhancement, lack of specificity, and potential toxicity.
   Recently developed, Gd3+-loaded ultrashort single-walled carbon
   nanotubes, also referred to as gadonanotubes or GNTs, exhibit similar to
   40 times the relaxivities of clinical CAs, representing a potential
   major advance in clinically relevant MRI CA materials. Although initial
   cytotoxicity and MRI studies have suggested great promise for GNTs,
   relatively little is known regarding their subcellular interactions,
   which are crucial for further, safe development of GNTs as CAs. In this
   work, we administered GNTs to a well-established human cell line (HeLa)
   and to murine macrophage-like cells (J774A.1). GNTs were not acutely
   cytotoxic and did not reduce proliferation, except for the highest
   exposure concentration of 27 mu g/mL for J774A.1 macrophages, yet bulk
   uptake of GNTs occurred in minutes at picogram quantities, or millions
   of GNTs per cell. J774A.1 macrophages internalized substantially more
   GNTs than HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner, and Raman imaging of
   the subcellular distribution of GNTs revealed perinuclear localization.
   Fluorescence intensity and lifetime imaging demonstrated that GNTs did
   not grossly alter subcellular compartments, including filamentous-actin
   structures. Together, these results provide subcellular evidence
   necessary to establish GNTs as a new MRI CA material.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially distributed first-principles process models provide an
   accurate physical description of chemical processes, but lead to
   large-scale models whose numerical solution can be challenging and
   computationally expensive. Therefore, fast reduced order models are
   requited for model-based real-the applications, such as advanced process
   control and dynamic real-time optimization. In this papery-we focus on
   the model reduction Of a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) adsorber, which is
   a key component of a postcombustion carbon capture System. From a
   temporal aspect, dynamic reduced models are generated using the
   nullspace projection and eigenvalue analysis method, with the basic idea
   of quasi-steady state approximation for the states with fast dynamics.
   From a spatial aspect, dynamic reduced models are developed using
   orthogonal collocation and proper orthogonal decomposition to reduce the
   size of the rigorous model. Finally, a computationally efficient and
   accurate dynamic reduced model is developed for the BFB adsorber by
   combining temporal and spatial model reduction techniques, Which
   is,suitable for an online optimization-based control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphines have been successfully used as additives for Fe-based ATRP.
   To understand their role in detail, the kinetics of Fe-based ATRP in the

   spectroscopy. No significant effect on the ATRP equilibrium constant,
   K-ATRP, was observed upon the addition of up to 1.5 equiv of phosphine
   relative to Fe. The strongly Lewis basic TTMPP may coordinate to Fe-II
   species, but primarily it acts as a reducing agent for
   {[}(FeBr4)-Br-III](-) in ATRP above 100 degrees C, thus transforming
   TTMPP to TTMPP-Br+. TPP is a weaker Lewis base and consequently a less

Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{We propose a data-driven, nonparametric approach to reformulate
   (conditional) individual and joint chance constraints with right-hand
   side uncertainty into algebraic constraints. The approach consists of
   using kernel smoothing to approximate unknown true continuous
   probability density/distribution functions. Given historical data for
   continuous univariate or multivariate random variables (uncertain
   parameters in an optimization model), the inverse cumulative
   distribution function (quantile function) and the joint cumulative
   distribution function are estimated for the univariate and multivariate
   cases, respectively. The approach relies on the construction of a
   confidence set that contains the unknown true distribution. The distance
   between the true distribution and its estimate is modeled via
   phi-divergences. We propose a new way of specifying the size of the
   confidence set (i.e., the phi-divergence tolerance) based on point-wise
   standard errors of the smoothing estimates. The approach is illustrated
   with a motivating and an industrial production planning problem with
   uncertain plant production rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fragility functions that define the probabilistic relationship between
   structural damage and ground motion intensity are an integral part of
   performance-based earthquake engineering or seismic risk analysis. This
   paper introduces three approaches based on kernel smoothing methods for
   developing analytical and empirical fragility functions. A kernel
   assigns a weight to each data that is inversely related to the distance
   between the data value and the input of the fragility function of
   interest. The kernel smoothing methods are, therefore, non-parametric
   forms of data interpolation. These methods enable the implicit treatment
   of uncertainty in either or both of ground motion intensity and
   structural damage without making any assumption about the shape of the
   resulting fragility functions. They are particularly beneficial for
   sparse, noisy, or non-homogeneous data sets. For illustration purposes,
   two types of data are considered. The first is a set of numerically
   simulated responses for a four-story steel moment-resisting frame, and
   the second is a set of field observations collected after the 2010 Haiti
   earthquake. The results demonstrate that these methods can develop
   continuous representations of fragility functions without specifying
   their functional forms and treat sparse data sets more efficiently than
   conventional data binning and parametric curve fitting methods.
   Moreover, various uncertainty analyses are conducted to address the
   issues of over-fitting, bias, and confidence intervals. Copyright (c)

Title = {{Deciding when to stop: efficient experimentation to learn to predict
   drug-target interactions}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Active learning is a powerful tool for guiding an
   experimentation process. Instead of doing all possible experiments in a
   given domain, active learning can be used to pick the experiments that
   will add the most knowledge to the current model. Especially, for drug
   discovery and development, active learning has been shown to reduce the
   number of experiments needed to obtain high-confidence predictions.
   However, in practice, it is crucial to have a method to evaluate the
   quality of the current predictions and decide when to stop the
   experimentation process. Only by applying reliable stopping criteria to
   active learning can time and costs in the experimental process actually
   be saved.
   Results: We compute active learning traces on simulated drug-target
   matrices in order to determine a regression model for the accuracy of
   the active learner. By analyzing the performance of the regression model
   on simulated data, we design stopping criteria for previously unseen
   experimental matrices. We demonstrate on four previously characterized
   drug effect data sets that applying the stopping criteria can result in
   upto 40\% savings of the total experiments for highly accurate
   predictions.
   Conclusions: We show that active learning accuracy can be predicted
   using simulated data and results in substantial savings in the number of
   experiments required to make accurate drug-target predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This study employs a power plant modeling tool to explore the
   feasibility of reducing unit-level emission rates of CO2 by 30\% by
   retrofitting carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) to existing
   U.S. coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs). Our goal is to
   identify feasible EGUs and their key attributes. The results indicate
   that for about 60 gigawatts of the existing coal-fired capacity, the
   implementation of partial CO2 capture appears feasible, though its cost
   is highly dependent on the unit characteristics and fuel prices.
   Auxiliary gas-fired boilers can be employed to power a carbon capture
   process without significant increases in the cost of electricity
   generation. A complementary CO2 emission trading program can provide
   additional economic incentives for the deployment of CCS with 90\% CO2
   capture. Selling and utilizing the captured CO2 product for enhanced oil
   recovery can further accelerate CCUS deployment and also help reinforce
   a CO2 emission trading market. These efforts would allow existing
   coal-fired EGUs to continue to provide a significant share of the U.S.
   electricity demand.}},

Title = {{Constructing a Spatially Resolved Methane Emission Inventory for the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{8147-8157}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Methane emissions from the oil and gas industry (O\&G) and other sources
   in the Barnett Shale region were estimated by constructing a spatially
   resolved emission inventory. Eighteen source categories were estimated
   using multiple data sets, including new empirical measurements at
   regional O\&G sites and a national study of gathering and processing
   facilities. Spatially referenced activity data were compiled from
   federal and state databases and combined with O\&G facility emission
   factors calculated using Monte Carlo simulations that account for high
   emission sites representing the very upper portion, or fat-tail, in the
   observed emissions distributions. Total methane emissions in the
   25-county Barnett Shale region in October 2013 were estimated to be
   72,300 (63,400-82,400) kg CH4 h(-1). O\&G emissions were estimated to be
   46,200 (40,000-54,100) kg CH4 h(-1) with 19\% of emissions from fat tail
   sites representing less than 2\% of sites. Our estimate of O\&G
   emissions in the Barnett Shale region was higher than alternative
   inventories based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Inventory, EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,
   and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research by factors of
   1.5, 2.7, and 4.3, respectively. Gathering compressor stations, which
   accounted for 40\% of O\&G emissions in our inventory, had the largest
   difference from emission estimates based on EPA data sources. Our
   inventory's higher O\&G emission estimate was due primarily to its more
   comprehensive activity factors and inclusion of emissions from fat-tail
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present manuscript is three-fold: (i) to study the
   detailed pressure field inside a patient-specific abdominal aortic
   aneurysm (AAA) model experimentally and numerically and discuss its
   clinical relevance, (ii) to validate a number of possible numerical
   model options and their ability to predict the experimental pressure
   field and (iii) to compare the spatial pressure drop in the AAA before
   and after the formation of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) for a late
   disease development timeline. A finite volume method was used to solve
   the governing equations of fluid flow to simulate the flow dynamics in a
   numerical model of the AAA. Following our patient-specific anatomical
   rapid prototyping technique, physical models of the aneurysm were
   created with seven ports for pressure measurement along the blood flow
   path. A flow loop operating with a blood analogue fluid was used to
   replicate the patient-specific flow conditions, acquired with
   phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging, and measure pressure in the
   flow model. The Navier-Stokes equations and two turbulent models were
   implemented numerically to compare the pressure estimations with
   experimental measurements. The relative pressure difference from
   experiments obtained with the best performing model (unsteady laminar
   simulation) was similar to 1.1\% for the AAA model without ILT and
   similar to 15.4\% for the AAA model with ILT (using Reynolds Stress
   Model). Future investigations should include validation of the 3D
   velocity field and wall shear stresses within the AAA sac predicted by
   the three numerical models.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of a material or device is dependent on its
   characteristic dimension. When the characteristic dimension is
   commensurate to the mean free paths of thermal energy carriers, the
   thermal conductivity decreases. The precise relationship between
   characteristic size and thermal conductivity, which depends on the
   distribution of energy carrier mean free paths in the material, is not
   straightforward to determine experimentally. The utility of this
   relationship has led many researchers to study the mean free path
   dependent contributions of thermal energy carriers to the thermal
   conductivity of materials, known as the thermal conductivity
   accumulation function. This review highlights a number of recent
   experimental results and techniques used to study the thermal
   conductivity accumulation function, including transient thermal grating,
   time domain thermoreflectance, and broadband frequency domain
   thermoreflectance. In these techniques, nondiffusive thermal transport
   is induced (i.e., thermal gradients occur over length scales comparable
   to energy carrier mean free paths) and an effective thermal conductivity
   of the material is determined. We conclude with our outlook on future
   directions for the field focused on improved interpretations of the
   experiments and new materials with unique mean free path distributions.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{The processes controlling the morphology of dendrites have been of great
   interest to a wide range of communities, since they are examples of an
   out-of-equilibrium pattern forming system, there is a clear connection
   with battery failure processes, and their morphology sets the properties
   of many metallic alloys. We determine the three-dimensional morphology
   of free growing metallic dendrites using a novel X-ray tomographic
   technique that improves the temporal resolution by more than an order of
   magnitude compared to conventional techniques. These measurements show
   that the growth morphology of metallic dendrites is surprisingly
   different from that seen in model systems, the morphology is not
   self-similar with distance back from the tip, and that this morphology
   can have an unexpectedly strong influence on solute segregation in
   castings. These experiments also provide benchmark data that can be used
   to validate simulations of free dendritic growth.}},

Abstract = {{Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) aerogels produced by
   critical-point-drying of wet-gel precursors exhibit unique properties,
   such as high surface-area-to-volume and strength-to-weight ratios. They
   are free-standing, are binder-free, and can be scaled to thicknesses of
   more than 1 mm. Here, we examine the electric double layer capacitive
   behavior of these materials using a common room temperature ionic liquid
   electrolyte, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis
   (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI). Electrochemical performance
   is assessed through galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry and
   impedance spectroscopy. Results indicate stable capacitive performance
   over 10,000 cycles as well as an impressive performance at high charge
   and discharge rates, due to accessible pore networks and enhanced
   electronic and ionic conductivities of SWCNT aerogels. These materials
   can find applications in mechanically compressible and flexible
   supercapacitor devices with high power requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Energy dissipation distributions and particle displacement statistics
   are studied in the mean-field version of Durian's bubble model. A
   two-dimensional (2D) bi-disperse mixture is simulated at various strain
   rates, (gamma)over dot, and packing ratios, phi, above the rigidity
   onset at phi = phi(C). Well above phi(C), and at sufficiently low
   (gamma)over dot, the system responds in a highly bursty way, reminiscent
   of other dynamically critical systems with a power-law distribution of
   energy dissipation. As one increases (gamma)over dot at fixed phi or
   tunes phi -> phi(C) at fixed (gamma)over dot, the bursty behavior
   vanishes. Displacement distributions are non-Fickian at short times but
   cross to a Fickian regime at a universal strain, Delta gamma({*}),
   independent of (gamma)over dot and phi. Despite the profound differences
   in short-time dynamics, at intermediate Delta gamma the systems exhibit
   qualitatively similar spatial patterns of deformation with lines of slip
   extending across large fractions of the simulation cell. These
   deformation patterns explain the observed diffusion constants and the
   universal crossover time to Fickian behavior. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2015}},

Title = {{Risk-Based Decision Making for Reoccupation of Contaminated Areas

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an analysis of postattack response strategies to
   mitigate the risks of reoccupying contaminated areas following a release
   of Bacillus anthracis spores (the bacterium responsible for causing
   anthrax) in an urban setting. The analysis is based on a hypothetical
   attack scenario in which individuals are exposed to B. anthracis spores
   during an initial aerosol release and then placed on prophylactic
   antibiotics that successfully protect them against the initial aerosol
   exposure. The risk from reoccupying buildings contaminated with spores
   due to their reaerosolization and inhalation is then evaluated. The
   response options considered include: decontamination of the buildings,
   vaccination of individuals reoccupying the buildings, extended
   evacuation of individuals from the contaminated buildings, and
   combinations of these options. The study uses a decision tree to
   estimate the costs and benefits of alternative response strategies
   across a range of exposure risks. Results for best estimates of model
   inputs suggest that the most cost-effective response for high-risk
   scenarios (individual chance of infection exceeding 11\%) consists of
   evacuation and building decontamination. For infection risks between 4\%
   and 11\%, the preferred option is to evacuate for a short period,
   vaccinate, and then reoccupy once the vaccine has taken effect. For
   risks between 0.003\% and 4\%, the preferred option is to vaccinate
   only. For risks below 0.003\%, none of the mitigation actions have
   positive expected monetary benefits. A sensitivity analysis indicates
   that for high-infection-likelihood scenarios, vaccination is recommended
   in the case where decontamination efficacy is less than 99.99\%.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{774}},
Pages = {{245-266}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The transient deformation of a weakly conducting ('leaky dielectric')
   drop under a uniform DC electric field is computed via an axisymmetric
   boundary integral method, which accounts for surface charge convection
   and a finite relaxation time scale over which the drop interface
   charges. We focus on drops that attain an ultimate oblate (major axis
   normal to the applied field) steady-state configuration. The
   computations predict that as the time scale for interfacial charging
   increases, a shape transition from prolate deformation (major axis
   parallel to the applied field) to oblate deformation occurs at
   intermediate times due to the slow buildup of charge at the surface of
   the drop. Convection of surface charge towards the equator of the drop
   is shown to weaken the steady-state oblate deformation. Additionally,
   convection results in sharp shock-like variations in surface charge
   density near the equator of the drop. Our numerical results are then
   compared with an experimental system consisting of a millimetre-sized
   silicone oil drop suspended in castor oil. Agreement in the transient
   deformation is observed between our numerical results and experimental
   measurements for moderate electric field strengths. This suggests that
   both charge relaxation and charge convection are required, in general,
   to quantify the time-dependent deformation of leaky dielectric drops.
   Importantly, accurate prediction of the observed modest deformation
   requires a nonlinear model. Discrepancies between our numerical
   calculations and experimental results arise as the field strength is
   increased. We believe that this is due to the observed onset of rotation
   and three-dimensional flow at such high electric fields in the
   experiments, which an axisymmetric boundary integral formulation
   naturally cannot capture.}},

Abstract = {{A meta-analytical review of design studies (N = 43) was conducted
   examining whether and under what conditions the presence of examples
   will induce fixation or inspiration. The analysis revealed that
   providing examples made individuals generate more example-related and
   fewer categories of ideas, however, the ideas produced were more novel.
   Also, the quality of solutions ideas was positively correlated with the
   degree of copying from examples. The facilitatory effects on novelty and
   quality increased when fewer and less common examples were presented.
   Presenting a single and uncommon example may encourage individuals to
   shift from traversing between different parts of the problem space to
   conducting a deeper search in a specific and remote domain, facilitating
   the generation of high-quality and novel ideas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We study the effect of radio signal shadowing dynamics, caused by
   vehicles and by buildings, on the performance of beaconing protocols in
   Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC). Recent research indicates that
   beaconing, i. e., one hop message broadcast, shows excellent
   characteristics and can outperform other communication approaches for
   both safety and efficiency applications, which require low latency and
   wide area information dissemination, respectively. To mitigate the
   broadcast storm problem, adaptive beaconing solutions have been proposed
   and designed. We show how shadowing dynamics of moving obstacles hurt
   IVC, reducing the performance of beaconing protocols. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is one of the first studies on identifying the problem
   and the underlying challenges and proposing the opportunities presented
   by such challenges. Shadowing also limits the risk of overloading the
   wireless channel. We demonstrate how these challenges and opportunities
   can be taken into account and outline a novel approach to dynamic
   beaconing. It provides low-latency communication (i. e., very short
   beaconing intervals), while ensuring not to overload the wireless
   channel. The presented simulation results substantiate our theoretical
   considerations.}},

Abstract = {{A significant portion of the carbon sequestration research being
   performed in the United States involves the risk assessment of injecting
   large quantities of carbon dioxide into deep saline aquifers. Leakage of
   CO2 has the potential to affect the quality of groundwater supplies in
   case contaminants migrate through underlying conduits. New remote
   sensing and near-surface monitoring technologies are needed to ensure
   that injection, abandoned, and monitoring wells are structurally sound,
   and that CO2 remains within the geologic storage reservoir. In this
   paper, we propose underwater laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy
   (underwater LIBS) as an analytical method for monitoring naturally
   occurring elements that can act as tracers to detect a CO2 leak from
   storage sites. Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to measure
   Sr2+, Ca2+, K+, and Li+ in bulk solutions to ascertain the analytical
   performance of underwater LIBS. We compared the effect of NaCl, Na2CO3,
   and Na2SO4 on the analytes calibration curves to determine underwater
   LIBS' ability to analyze samples of sodium compounds. In all cases, the
   calibration curves showed a good linearity within 2 orders of magnitude.
   The limit of detections (LODs) obtained for K+ (30 +/- 1 ppb) and Li+
   (60 +/- 2 ppb) were in ppb range, while higher LODs were observed for
   Ca2+ (0.94 +/- 0.14 ppm) and Sr2+ (2.89 +/- 0.11 ppm). Evaluation of the
   calibration curves for the analytes in mixed solutions showed dependence
   of the lines' intensity with the sodium compounds. The intensities
   increased respectively in the presence of dissolved NaCl and Na2SO4,
   whereas the intensities slightly decreased in the presence of Na2CO3.
   Finally, the capabilities of underwater LIBS to detect certain elements
   in the ppb or in the low ppm range make it particularly appealing for in
   situ monitoring of a CO2 leak. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this brief, a low-overhead self-healing method for current matching
   in current-steering digital-to-analog converters (CS-DACs) is
   demonstrated. In contrast to traditional calibration methods that adjust
   current values, a statistical element selection (SES) algorithm
   optimizes the selection of unary current cells via combinatorial
   redundancy. This SES-based self-healing method relaxes the matching
   requirements for the current source array and achieves high static
   linearity at a minimum overhead cost of one current comparator and one
   digital controller. Moreover, this proposed low-overhead method is fully
   compatible with other segmented CS-DAC designs. A 14-bit CS-DAC design
   with on-chip self-healing control loop was implemented in 130-nm CMOS
   technology to demonstrate the proposed approach. The core area of the
   prototype chip was measured as 0.9 mm(2), with less than 0.1 mm(2)
   occupied by the current source array. After self-healing, the INLmax was
   measured as 0.64 least significant bit and spurious-free dynamic range
   was 85 dB for a 2-MHz input signal at 200-MS/s sampling rate.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed energy resources and demand-side management are expected to
   become more prevalent in the future electric power system. Coordinating
   the increased number of grid participants in an efficient and reliable
   way is going to be a major challenge. A potential solution is the
   employment of a distributed energy management approach, which uses
   intelligence distributed over the grid to balance supply and demand. In
   this paper, we specifically consider the situation in which distributed
   resources and loads form microgrids within the bulk power system in
   which the load is supplied by local generation. A distributed energy
   management approach based on the consensus + innovations method is
   presented and used to coordinate local generation, flexible load, and
   storage devices within the microgrid. The approach takes advantage of
   the fact that, at the optimal allocation settings, the marginal costs
   given as a function of the power output/consumption need to be equal for
   all nonbinding network resources. Solutions for single time step, as
   well as multitime step optimization including intertemporal constraints,
   are presented.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{An olive tree branches burning emission inventory for Greece is
   developed based on recently measured emission factors and the spatial
   distribution of olive trees. A three-dimensional chemical transport
   model (CTM), PMCAMx, is used to estimate the corresponding impact on
   PM2.5 concentrations during a typical winter period. Assuming that
   burning of olive tree branches takes place only during days with low
   wind speed and without precipitation, the contribution of olive tree
   branches burning emissions on PM2.5 levels is more significant during
   the most polluted days. Increases of hourly PM2.5 exceeding 50\% and
   locally reaching up to 150\% in Crete are predicted during the most
   polluted periods. On a monthly-average basis, the corresponding
   emissions are predicted to increase PM2.5 levels up to 1.5 mu g m(-3)
   (20\%) in Crete and Peloponnese, where the largest fraction of olive
   trees is located, and by 0.4 mu g m(-3) (5\%) on average over Greece. OA
   and EC levels increase by 20\% and 13\% respectively on average over
   Greece, and up to 70\% in Crete. The magnitude of the effect is quite
   sensitive to burning practices. Assuming that burning of olive tree
   branches takes place during all days results in a smaller effect of
   burning on PM2.5 levels (9\% increase instead of 20\%). These results
   suggest that this type of agricultural waste burning is a major source
   of particulate pollution in the Mediterranean countries where this
   practice is prevalent during winter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   organic carbon}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{317-325}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The elemental carbon (EC) tracer method has often been used to estimate
   the primary and secondary organic aerosol (OA) fractions using field
   measurements of organic carbon (OC) and EC. In this observation-based
   approach, EC is used as a tracer for primary OC (POC), which allows for
   the estimation of secondary OC (SOC). The accuracy of this approach is
   evaluated using concentrations generated by PMCAMx, a three-dimensional
   chemical transport model that simulates the complex processes leading to
   SOC formation (including evaporation and chemical processing of POC and
   chemical aging of semivolatile and intermediate volatility organics).
   The ratio of primary organic to elemental carbon {[}OC/EC](p) is
   estimated in various locations in the Eastern United States, and is then
   used to calculate the primary and secondary OC concentrations. To
   estimate the {[}OC/EC](p) from simulated concentrations, we use both a
   traditional approach and the high EC edge method, in which only values
   with the highest EC/OC ratio are used. Both methods perform best on a
   daily-averaged basis, because of the variability of the {[}OC/EC](p)
   ratio during the day. The SOC estimated by the EC tracer methods
   corresponds to the biogenic and anthropogenic SOC formed during the
   oxidation of volatile organic compounds. On the other hand, the
   estimated POC corresponds to the sum of the fresh POC, the SOC from
   oxidation of the evaporated POC and the intermediate volatility organic
   compounds, and the OC from long-distance transport. With this
   correspondence, the traditional EC tracer method tends to overpredict
   primary OC and underpredict secondary OC for the selected urban areas in
   the eastern United States. The high EC edge method performs better,
   especially in areas where the primary contribution to OC is smaller.
   Despite the weaknesses of models like the one used here, the conclusions
   about the accuracy of observation-based methods like the EC-tracer
   approach should be relatively robust due to the internal consistency of
   the data and the approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately estimating the rare failure rates for nanoscale circuit
   blocks (e.g., static random-access memory, D flip-flop, etc.) is a
   challenging task, especially when the variation space is
   high-dimensional. In this paper, we propose a novel scaled-sigma
   sampling (SSS) method to address this technical challenge. The key idea
   of SSS is to generate random samples from a distorted distribution for
   which the standard deviation (i.e., sigma) is scaled up. Next, the
   failure rate is accurately estimated from these scaled random samples by
   using an analytical model derived from the theorem of ``soft
   maximum.{''} Our proposed SSS method can simultaneously estimate the
   rare failure rates for multiple performances and/or specifications with
   only a single set of transistor-level simulations. To quantitatively
   assess the accuracy of SSS, we estimate the confidence interval of SSS
   based on bootstrap. Several circuit examples designed in nanoscale
   technologies demonstrate that the proposed SSS method achieves
   significantly better accuracy than the traditional importance sampling
   technique when the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a
   few hundred.}},

Title = {{Crack Healing Between Rough Polycrystalline Silicon Hydrophilic Surfaces
   in n-Pentanol and Water Vapors}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The crack healing rates of polycrystalline silicon microcantilevers in
   contact with a substrate are measured in n-pentanol vapor at different
   partial pressures, p/p(s). The absolute value of the slope of the
   logarithmic average crack healing velocity (nu) over bar versus the
   energy release rate G, vertical bar d vertical bar log((nu) over
   bar)]/dG vertical bar, is constant and decreases with increasing p/p(s).
   The slope dependence on p/p(s) is equivalent to that in a water vapor
   environment. This slope is independent of p/p(s) in glass stress
   corrosion cracking experiments due to chemical kinetics, while the
   present experiments reflect a capillary bridge nucleation mechanism
   across nanometer-scale gaps created by surface roughness. Equilibrium
   measurements of adhesion versus p/p(s) are also compared for n-pentanol
   and water vapor. For p/p(s) <= 0.5, adhesion is comparable for the two
   vapors, while for p/p(s) > 0.5, adhesion in water vapor is approximately
   twice that in n-pentanol vapor. At lower p/p(s), this is explained by
   the larger Kelvin radius and the larger adsorbed layer thickness of
   n-pentanol. This combination enables larger asperity gaps to be bridged
   by capillary liquids. At higher p/p(s), adhesion in water vapor is
   larger because the work of adhesion of capillary bridges becomes twice
   that of n-pentanol.}},

Title = {{Controlled surface topography regulates collective 3D migration by
   epithelial-mesenchymal composite embryonic tissues}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Cells in tissues encounter a range of physical cues as they migrate.
   Probing single cell and collective migratory responses to physically
   defined three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments and the factors that
   modulate those responses are critical to understanding how tissue
   migration is regulated during development, regeneration, and cancer. One
   key physical factor that regulates cell migration is topography. Most
   studies on surface topography and cell mechanics have been carried out
   with single migratory cells, yet little is known about the spreading and
   motility response of 3D complex multicellular tissues to topographical
   cues. Here, we examine the response to complex topographical cues of
   microsurgically isolated tissue explants composed of epithelial and
   mesenchymal cell layers from naturally 3D organized embryos of the
   aquatic frog Xenopus laevis. We control topography using fabricated
   micropost arrays (MPAs) and investigate the collective 3D migration of
   these multi-cellular systems in these MPAs. We find that the topography
   regulates both collective and individual cell migration and that dense
   MPAs reduce but do not eliminate tissue spreading. By modulating cell
   size through the cell cycle inhibitor Mitomycin C or the spacing of the
   MPAs we uncover how 3D topographical cues disrupt collective cell
   migration. We find surface topography can direct both single cell
   motility and tissue spreading, altering tissue-scale processes that
   enable efficient conversion of single cell motility into collective
   movement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Random key graphs form a class of random intersection graphs that are
   naturally induced by the random key predistribution scheme of Eschenauer
   and Gligor for securing wireless sensor network (WSN) communications.
   Random key graphs have received much attention recently, owing in part
   to their wide applicability in various domains, including recommender
   systems, social networks, secure sensor networks, clustering and
   classification analysis, and cryptanalysis to name a few. In this paper,
   we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of
   unreliable links. Unreliability of graph links is captured by
   independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering them to be on or off
   independently from each other. The resulting model is an intersection of
   a random key graph and an Erdos-Renyi graph, and is expected to be
   useful in capturing various real-world networks; e.g., with secure WSN
   applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh
   environmental conditions severely impairing transmissions. We present
   conditions on how to scale this model's parameters so that: 1) the
   minimum node degree in the graph is at least k and 2) the graph is
   k-connected, both with high probability as the number of nodes becomes
   large. The results are given in the form of zero-one laws with critical
   thresholds identified and shown to coincide for both graph properties.
   These findings improve the previous results by Rybarczyk on
   k-connectivity of random key graphs (with reliable links), as well as
   the zero-one laws by Ya. gan on one-connectivity of random key graphs
   with unreliable links.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to their more rigid counterparts, soft robots have the
   ability to gently grip and maneuver objects with open-loop kinematic
   control. Guided by several recent designs and implementations of soft
   robot hands, the present paper analyzes a rod-based model for the
   fingers in the hand of a soft robot. We show precisely how gripping is
   achieved and how the performance can be affected by varying the system's
   parameters. The designs we are interested in feature pneumatic control
   of the soft robot and we model this actuation as a varying intrinsic
   curvature profile of the rod. Our work provides a framework for the
   theoretical analysis of the soft robot and the resulting analysis can
   also be used to develop some design guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a case study of design and engineering change

   communication processes, the paper identifies the sources of engineering
   changes in the design process. Further, the paper takes cognizance of
   the change in the organizational structure of the company's engineering
   change processes to evaluate the engineering change notice (ECN)
   policies and its application in the company to identify the cause of
   errors in the engineering change process itself. Based on the analysis,
   the paper describes a support system that incorporates a novel,
   context-based ECN generation and workflow routing support system that is
   intended to reduce the cognitive load of the design engineer. The goal
   of the system is also to measure the causes of ECN to aid and improve

Abstract = {{PdCuAu ternary alloy samples with different composition were synthesized
   on top of ZrO2-modified porous stainless steel disks by the sequential
   electroless deposition technique. The structure, morphology and bulk
   composition of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDX). Complete alloy formation with a pure fcc phase for
   the Pd71Cu26Au3, Pd70Cu25Au5 and Pd67Cu24Au9 samples and a bcc structure
   for the Pd62Cu36Au2 and Pd60Cu37Au3 samples were obtained upon annealing
   at 500 degrees C for 120h as revealed by XRD. A combination of
   low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) was used to investigate the surface properties of the PdCuAu
   alloys. XPS results confirmed alloy formation under the annealing
   conditions. XPS analysis also revealed that the near-surface regions of
   the alloys became enriched in Pd with respect to the bulk composition
   determined by EDX. In contrast, LEIS and angle-resolved XPS analyses
   showed that the top-most surface layers in all samples were copper-rich
   compared with the bulk composition. This high Cu surface concentration
   could impart resistance to bulk sulfide formation to the PdCuAu alloy
   membranes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently garnered significant
   interest as a substrate and dielectric for two-dimensional materials and
   devices based on graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides such as
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). As substrate surface impurities and defects
   can negatively impact the structure and properties of two-dimensional
   materials, h-BN surface preparation and cleaning are a critical
   consideration. In this regard, we have utilized X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy to investigate the influence of several ex situ wet
   chemical and in situ thermal desorption cleaning procedures on pyrolytic
   h-BN surfaces. Of the various wet chemistries investigated, a 10:1
   buffered HF solution was found to produce surfaces with the lowest
   amount of oxygen and carbon contamination. Ultraviolet/ozone oxidation
   was found to be the most effective ex situ treatment for reducing carbon
   contamination. Annealing at 1050 degrees C in vacuum or 10(-5)Torr NH3
   was found to further reduce oxygen and carbon contamination to the XPS
   detection limits. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{142-158}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about how perceived network topology factors, which are
   common components of information system risk metrics, impact human
   judgments of risk. Using a half fractional factorial design, this study
   experimentally manipulated five perceivable network topology factors
   (network partitioning, network diversity, wireless status, network
   footprint and connectivity) to assess the relationship between these
   factors and network risk judgments. The consistency of network risk
   ratings and rankings were evaluated for each of the 16 network
   topologies across a sample of 55 network security professionals who
   reviewed these topologies. Three robust significant main effects
   (network partitioning, wireless status, and connectivity) and one
   significant interaction (network partitioning X wireless status) were
   found. While some topologies were consistently rated and ranked as
   significantly more risky than others, there was some variability in
   ratings at each main effect level as well as the spread of the mean
   ratings between the two main effect levels (e.g., wireless and wired).
   We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to network risk
   metric rigor. (C) 2016 Carnegie Mellon University. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Eliciting public concerns about an emerging energy technology: The case
   of unconventional shale gas development in the United States}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Development of shale gas resources using hydraulic fracturing has
   dramatically increased U.S. gas production, but also created new needs
   for risk analysis and governance. Risk analysis for an emerging
   technology has traditionally relied on experts with knowledge of the
   technology and its anticipated impacts. But today it is accepted that
   input from non-expert interested and affected parties (IAPs) is also
   essential. We present a novel method to elicit concerns from IAPs about
   the development of shale gas resources. We used an Internet-based
   snowball sample to identify IAPs and an open-ended prompt to gather
   their concerns. Reported concerns included potential consequences for
   environmental, social, and health systems, as well as hazards, hazardous
   events, precursors to hazards, risk amplifiers, and issues concerning
   the effective and fair governance of the risks. Some concerns raised
   have not been addressed in expert-led analyses of shale gas risks.
   Long-term consequences such as disruptions to economic activities, and
   governance issues such as regulatory capacity, were more prominent in
   the responses than in expert analyses. These findings show how
   engagement with interested and affected parties can elucidate key issues
   for risk governance in shale gas development. The method can also be
   applied to other emerging energy development issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Energy policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change need public
   support to be successful. Deliberative democracy forums serve to both
   better inform the public of the available options and provide a way for

   support for City-wide energy policies to address climate change. A
   convenience sample completed pre and post-surveys during a deliberative
   forum: ``Building a Resilient Pittsburgh: Climate Challenges and
   Opportunities{''}. The surveys focused on knowledge, perceptions, and
   opinions related to the existence of climate change as well as energy
   policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Results suggest that
   the forum was useful in shifting perceptions, but did not significantly
   influence objective knowledge or policy support. Participants had a
   slight preference for energy efficiency strategies over renewable energy
   and public information. More research is needed to evaluate deliberative
   democracy approaches and expand these findings to a more diverse

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new method termed Truncated Hierarchical
   Catmull-Clark Subdivision (THCCS), which generalizes truncated
   hierarchical B-splines to control grids of arbitrary topology. THCCS
   basis functions satisfy partition of unity, are linearly independent,
   and are locally refinable. THCCS also preserves geometry during adaptive
   h-refinement and thus inherits the surface continuity of Catmull-Clark
   subdivision, namely C-2-continuous everywhere except at the local region
   surrounding extraordinary nodes, where the surface continuity is C-1.
   Adaptive isogeometric analysis is performed with THCCS basis functions
   on a benchmark problem with extraordinary nodes. Local refinement on
   complex surfaces is also studied to show potential wide application of

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a thin cell (10 gm) was used
   to infer conductivity, permittivity and the differential double-layer
   capacitance of solutions of dodecane doped with OLOA 11000
   {[}poly(isobutylene) succinimide] for concentrations of dopant between
   0.1\% and 10\% by weight. All spectra (frequencies between 1 Hz and 100
   kHz) were well fit by an equivalent circuit having four elements
   including a constant-phase element representing the double-layer
   capacitance. Using Gouy-Chapman theory for small zeta potentials and
   assuming univalent charge carriers, the double-layer capacitances were
   converted into charge carrier concentration which was found to be
   directly proportional to the weight percent of dopant withal wt\%
   solution having 87 carriers/mu m(3) (the concentration of either
   positive or negative charges). This is only 17 ppm of the total monomer
   concentration calculated from the average molecule weight of the dopant.
   Dividing the measured conductivities by the charge carrier
   concentration, we inferred the mobility and hydrodynamic diameters for
   the charged micelles. The hydrodynamic diameters of carriers were
   significantly larger than the average diameter of all micelles measured
   independently by dynamic light scattering. This suggests that only large
   micelles become charged. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{449}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Silica nanoparticles displaying densely grafted
   poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) polycationic brushes
   are highly efficient emulsifiers, stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions at
   concentrations as low as 0.05 to 0.1 wt\%. Adding conventional
   surfactants is expected to alter emulsification efficiency by
   interacting with grafted nanoparticles in bulk and/or at the oil/water
   interface.
   Experiments: Emulsification efficiency was studied in the presence of
   three different surfactants, namely the anionic surfactant sodium
   dodecyl sulfate, the nonionic water-soluble surfactant Triton X-100 and
   the nonionic, oil-soluble surfactant Span 85. SDS complexation with
   PDMAEMA-grafted nanoparticles was monitored by electrophoretic mobility
   and optical density changes.
   Findings: Even though SDS is a poor emulsifier, emulsification was
   promoted by SDS at low concentrations, where complexation with
   PD1VIAEMA-grafted particles produced a synergistic effect on
   emulsification efficiency. Increasing the SOS concentration did not
   enhance emulsification, and stable emulsions formed in the absence of
   SDS were broken by its addition. The enhancement of emulsification
   efficiency with dilute SDS correlated with low degrees of complexation
   with PDMAEMA such that the nanoparticle-grafted brush had a lower charge
   density and more of an amphiphilic nature. The hindrance of
   emulsification at higher SDS concentrations was attributed to more
   extensive complexation and the resulting brush charge reversal that
   would inhibit adsorption at the oil/water interface in the presence of
   adsorbing SDS. Synergism was also observed in the presence of Triton
   X-100, while Span 85 had no discernible effect on emulsification
   efficiency, although it is noted that only a single concentration of the
   latter surfactant was investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Coalescence between oil caps with irreversibly adsorbed layers of
   nonionic surfactant is characterized in deionized water and electrolyte
   solution. The coalescence is characterized using a modified capillary
   tensiometer allowing for accurate measurement of the coalescence time.
   Results suggest two types of coalescence behavior, fast coalescence at
   low surface coverages that are independent of ionic strength and slow
   coalescence at high coverage. These slow coalescence events (orders of
   magnitude slower) are argued to be due to electric double layer forces
   or more complicated stabilization mechanisms arising from interfacial
   deformation and surface forces. A simple film drainage model is used in
   combination with measured values for interfacial properties to quantify
   the interaction potential between the two interfaces. Since this
   approach allows the two caps to have the same history, interfacial
   coverage and curvature, the results offer a tool to better understand a
   mechanism that is important to emulsion stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the geochemistry of the rare earth elements (REE) was
   studied in eleven outcrop samples and six, depth-interval samples of a
   core from the Marcellus Shale. The REE are classically applied analytes
   for investigating depositional environments and inferring geochemical
   processes, making them of interest as potential, naturally occurring
   indicators of fluid sources as well as indicators of geochemical
   processes in solid waste disposal. However, little is known of the REE
   occurrence in the Marcellus Shale or its produced waters, and this study
   represents one of the first, thorough characterizations of the REE in
   the Marcellus Shale. In these samples, the abundance of REE and the
   fractionation of REE profiles were correlated with different mineral
   components of the shale. Namely, samples with a larger clay component
   were inferred to have higher absolute concentrations of REE but have
   less distinctive patterns. Conversely, samples with larger carbonate
   fractions exhibited a greater degree of fractionation, albeit with lower
   total abundance. Further study is necessary to determine release
   mechanisms, as well as REE fate-and-transport, however these results
   have implications for future brine and solid waste management
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Hemodynamics of the fetal to neonatal transition are orchestrated
   through complex physiological changes and results in cardiovascular
   adaptation to the adult biventricular circulation. Clinical practice
   during this critical period can influence vital organ physiology for
   normal newborns, premature babies and congenital heart defect patients.
   Particularly, the timing of the cord clamping procedure, immediate (ICC)
   vs. delayed cord clamping (DCC), is hypothesized to be an important
   factor for the transitory fetal hemodynamics. The clinical need for a
   quantitative understanding of this physiology motivated the development
   of a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the fetal cardio-respiratory system
   covering the late-gestation to neonatal period. The LPM was validated
   with in vivo clinical data and then used to predict the effects of cord
   clamping procedures on hemodynamics and vital gases. Clinical
   time-dependent resistance functions to simulate the vascular changes
   were introduced. For DCC, placental transfusion (313 ml) increased
   neonatal blood volume by 11.7\%. This increased blood volume is
   reflected in an increase in preload pressures by similar to 20\%
   compared to ICC, which in turn increased the cardiac output (CO) by 20\%
   (COICC= 993 ml/min; CODCC= 1197 ml/min). Our model accurately predicted
   dynamic flow patterns in vivo. DCC was shown to maintain oxygenation if
   the onset of pulmonary respiration was delayed or impaired. On the other
   hand, a significant 25\% decrease in oxygen saturations was observed
   when applying ICC under the same physiological conditions. We conclude
   that DCC has a significant impact on newborn hemodynamics, mainly
   because of the improved blood volume and the sustained placental
   respiration. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{The resolution dependence of orientation gradients was studied in a
   well-annealed 99.9995\% pure polycrystalline copper pulled to failure in
   tension. Owing to the well developed neck, different regions in the
   sample correspond to different tensile strains. Post-mortem
   characterization was performed using EBSD on cross-sections containing
   the tensile axis. Kernel average misorientation (KAM) was calculated as
   a metric to establish correlation between defect accumulation and
   microstructural features, with a threshold of 5 degrees to focus on
   intra-granular gradients. The region with the lowest strain (2\%) showed
   high KAM values adjacent to grain boundaries compared to the grain
   interior, regardless of the point spacing, i.e. the spatial resolution.
   However, in the region with the highest strain (13\%) a strong
   dependence on resolution was found. For point spacings of 0.5 mu m or
   smaller, the same correlation of high KAM with locations near boundaries
   was found. At coarse spacings i.e. low spatial resolution, by contrast,
   the reverse was found in that the highest KAM values appear in the grain
   interiors, as previously observed in X-ray microscopy on the same sample
   which had a similar coarse resolution. An analysis of orientation
   gradients parallel to, and perpendicular to boundaries suggested that
   the latter tend to be the larger of the two. This helps to explain why
   boundary-adjacent points have low KAM values. The conclusion is that
   measurement of local orientation gradient requires a resolution that is
   comparable to the dislocation substructure. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Forward osmosis (FO) has the potential to improve the energy efficiency
   of membrane-based water treatment by leveraging waste heat from steam
   electric power generation as the primary driving force for separation.
   In this study, we develop a comprehensive FO process model, consisting
   of membrane separation, heat recovery, and draw-solute regeneration
   (DSR) models. We quantitatively characterize three alternative processes
   for DSR: distillation, steam stripping, and air stripping. We then
   construct a mathematical model of the distillation process for DSR that
   incorporates hydrodynamics, mass- and heat-transport resistances, and
   reaction kinetics, and we integrate this into a model for the full FO
   process. Finally, we utilize this FO process model to derive a
   first-order approximation of the water production capacity given the
   rejected-heat quantity and quality available at U.S. electric power
   facilities. We find that the upper bound of FO water treatment capacity
   using low-grade heat sources at electric power facilities exceeds
   process water treatment demand for boiler water makeup and
   flue-gas-desulfurization wastewater systems.}},

Abstract = {{Immunodeficient mouse-human chimeras provide a powerful approach to
   study host specific pathogens like Plasmodium (P.) falciparum that
   causes human malaria. Existing mouse models of P. falciparum infection
   require repeated injections of human red blood cells (RBCs). In
   addition, clodronate lipsomes and anti-neutrophil antibodies are
   injected to suppress the clearance of human RBCs by the residual immune
   system of the immunodeficient mice. Engraftment of NOD-scid Il2rg(-/-)
   mice with human hematopoietic stem cells leads to reconstitution of
   human immune cells. Although human B cell reconstitution is robust and T
   cell reconstitution is reasonable in the recipient mice, human RBC
   reconstitution is generally poor or undetectable. The poor
   reconstitution is mainly the result of a deficiency of appropriate human
   cytokines that are necessary for the development and maintenance of
   these cell lineages. Delivery of plasmid DNA encoding human
   erythropoietin and interleukin-3 into humanized mice by hydrodynamic
   tail-vein injection resulted in significantly enhanced reconstitution of
   erythrocytes. With this improved humanized mouse, here we show that P.
   falciparum infects de novo generated human RBCs, develops into schizonts
   and causes successive reinvasion. We also show that different parasite
   strains exhibit variation in their ability to infect these humanized
   mice. Parasites could be detected by nested PCR in the blood samples of
   humanized mice infected with P. falciparum K1 and HB3 strains for 3
   cycles, whereas in other strains such as 3D7, DD2, 7G8, FCR3 and W2mef
   parasites could only be detected for 1 cycle. In vivo adaptation of K1
   strain further improves the infection efficiency and parasites can be
   detected by microscopy for 3 cycles. The parasitemia ranges between 0.13
   and 0.25\% at the first cycle of infection, falls between 0.08 and
   0.15\% at the second cycle, and drops to barely detectable levels at the
   third cycle of infection. Compared to existing mouse models, our model
   generates human RBCs de novo and does not require the treatment of mice
   with immunomodulators.}},

Title = {{New perspectives for motivating better decisions in older adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{Decision-making competence in later adulthood is affected by declines in
   cognitive skills, and age-related changes in affect and experience can
   sometimes compensate. However, recent findings suggest that age-related
   changes in motivation also affect the extent to which adults draw from
   experience, affect, and deliberative skills when making decisions. To
   date, relatively little attention has been given to strategies for
   addressing age-related changes in motivation to promote better decisions
   in older adults. To address this limitation, we draw from diverse
   literatures to suggest promising intervention strategies for motivating
   older recipients' motivation to make better decisions. We start by
   reviewing the life-span developmental literature, which suggests that
   older adults' motivation to put effort into decisions depends on the
   perceived personal relevance of decisions as well as their self-efficacy
   (i.e., confidence in applying their ability and knowledge). Next, we
   discuss two approaches from the health intervention design literature,
   the mental models approach and the patient activation approach, which
   aim to improve motivation for decision making by improving personal
   relevance or by building self-efficacy or confidence to use new
   information and skills. Using examples from these literatures, we
   discuss how to construct interventions to motivate good decisions in
   later adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical transport model PMCAMx is used to examine the effect of
   climate change on fine (under 2.5 mu ms) particulate matter (PM2.5)
   during the summer in the eastern United States. Meteorology from 10years
   in the 1990s (present) and 10years in the 2050s (future) based on the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario is used.
   Anthropogenic pollutant emissions are assumed to remain constant, while
   biogenic emissions are climate sensitive and, depending on species,
   increase between 15 and 27\% on average. The predicted changes of PM2.5
   are modest (increases of less than 10\% on average across the domain)
   and quite variable in space, ranging from +13\% in the Plains to -7\% in
   the Northeast. Variability is driven concurrently by changes in
   temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and relative humidity, with no single
   dominant meteorological factor. Sulfate and organic aerosol are
   responsible for most of the PM2.5 change. The improved treatment of
   organic aerosol using the volatility basis set does not increase
   significantly its sensitivity to climate change compared to traditional
   treatments that neglect the volatility of primary particles and do not
   simulate the chemical aging processes. Future organic aerosol is
   predicted to be more oxidized due to increases of its secondary biogenic
   and anthropogenic components. These results suggest that the effects of
   planned and expected emission anthropogenic emission controls will be
   more important than those of climate change for PM2.5 concentrations in
   2050. Maximum daily 8h average ozone increases by 5\% on average are
   predicted, with a marked increase in the Northeast, Southeast, and
   Midwest.}},

Abstract = {{The low-cost and abundant supply of shale gas in the United States has
   increased the interest in using natural gas for transportation. We
   compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different
   natural gas pathways for medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs). For
   Class 8 tractor-trailers and refuse trucks, none of the natural gas
   pathways provide emissions reductions per unit of freight-distance moved
   compared to diesel trucks. When compared to the petroleum-based fuels
   currently used in these vehicles, CNG and centrally produced LNG
   increase emissions by 0-3\% and 2-13\%, respectively, for Class 8
   trucks. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered with natural
   gas-produced electricity are the only fuel-technology combination that
   achieves emission reductions for Class 8 transit buses (31\% reduction
   compared to the petroleum-fueled vehicles). For non-Class 8 trucks
   (pick-up trucks, parcel delivery trucks, and box trucks), BEVs reduce
   emissions significantly (31-40\%) compared to their diesel or gasoline
   counterparts. CNG and propane achieve relatively smaller emissions
   reductions (0-6\% and 19\%, respectively, compared to the
   petroleum-based fuels), while other natural gas pathways increase
   emissions for non-Class 8 MHDVs. While using natural gas to fuel
   electric vehicles could achieve large emission reductions for
   medium-duty trucks, the results suggest there are no great opportunities
   to achieve large emission reductions for Class 8 trucks through natural
   gas pathways with current technologies. There are strategies to reduce
   the carbon footprint of using natural gas for MHDVs, ranging from
   increasing vehicle fuel efficiency, reducing life cycle methane leakage
   rate, to achieving the same payloads and cargo volumes as conventional
   diesel trucks.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models are needed to estimate environmental concentrations
   of engineered nanoparticles (NPs), which enter the environment upon the
   use and disposal of consumer goods and other products. We present a
   spatially resolved environmental fate model for the James River Basin,
   Virginia, that explores the influence of daily variation in streamflow,
   sediment transport, and stream loads from point and nonpoint sources on
   water column and sediment concentrations of zinc oxide (ZnO) and silver
   (Ag) NPs and their reaction byproducts over 20 simulation years. Spatial
   and temporal variability in sediment transport rates led to high NP
   transport such that less than 6\% of NP-derived metals were retained in
   the river and sediments. Chemical transformations entirely eliminated
   ZnO NPs and doubled Zn mobility in the stream relative to Ag.
   Agricultural runoff accounted for 23\% of total metal stream loads from
   NPs. Average NP-derived metal concentrations in the sediment varied
   spatially up to 9 orders of magnitude, highlighting the need for
   high-resolution models. Overall, our results suggest that ``first

   freshwater rivers due to low model resolutions and the simplification of

Title = {{pH-Taxis of Biohybrid Microsystems}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The last decade has seen an increasing number of studies developing
   bacteria and other cellintegrated biohybrid microsystems. However, the
   highly stochastic motion of these microsystems severely limits their
   potential use. Here, we present a method that exploits the pH sensing of
   flagellated bacteria to realize robust drift control of multi-bacteria
   propelled microrobots. Under three specifically configured pH gradients,
   we demonstrate that the microrobots exhibit both unidirectional and
   bidirectional pH-tactic behaviors, which are also observed in
   free-swimming bacteria. From trajectory analysis, we find that the
   swimming direction and speed biases are two major factors that
   contribute to their tactic drift motion. The motion analysis of
   microrobots also sheds light on the propulsion dynamics of the
   flagellated bacteria as bioactuators. It is expected that similar
   driving mechanisms are shared among pH-taxis, chemotaxis, and
   thermotaxis. By identifying the mechanism that drives the tactic
   behavior of bacteria-propelled microsystems, this study opens up an
   avenue towards improving the control of biohybrid microsystems.
   Furthermore, assuming that it is possible to tune the preferred pH of
   bioactuators by genetic engineering, these biohybrid microsystems could
   potentially be applied to sense the pH gradient induced by cancerous
   cells in stagnant fluids inside human body and realize targeted drug
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a multi-phase, two-dimensional model that integrates the
   bipolar plate (BP) and gas diffusion layer (GDL) interfacial morphology
   was developed to understand the effects of this interface on mass,
   charge and heat transport and performance of polymer electrolyte fuel
   cells (PEFCs). Two different case studies were performed. The first case
   assumes a perfect contact interface between the BP and GDL, whereas in
   the second case, the BP|GDL interfacial layer was incorporated as a
   separate domain based on the measured BP|GDL morphology. In the BP|GDL
   interface case, the interfacial voids were assumed to be filled with
   liquid water to investigate the role of the interfacial voids. For both
   cases, the effects of different current densities on the in-plane
   temperature, saturation, and oxygen concentration distribution in the
   GDL were investigated. Simulations indicate that the Ohmic and
   concentration losses are increased due to the inclusion of the realistic
   BP|GDL interface. The electrical contact resistance contribution of the
   BP|GDL interface was predicted to be 3.8 m Omega cm(2). The saturation
   in the GDL was found to be higher for the BP|GDL interface case, which
   results in higher concentration losses. The temperature was predicted to
   be slightly higher for the BP|GDL interface case, which could be
   attributed to the higher thermal contact resistance due to the fewer
   contact regions at the interface. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Reducing the energy cost of human walking using an unpowered exoskeleton}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{522}},
Number = {{7555}},
Pages = {{212+}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans
   are very well-tuned for locomotion(1). Metabolic energy used during
   walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton(2),
   but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an
   additional energy source? This would require an improvement in the
   efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and would be
   remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show
   that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered
   ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in
   parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and
   thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The
   device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and
   relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to
   fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike
   muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton
   consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive
   mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 +/-
   2.6\% for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to
   savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way
   is analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is more
   energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already
   shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible.
   Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-phase equilibrium adsorption of D- and L-serine (Ser) mixtures and
   D- and L-phenylalanine (Phe) mixtures has been studied on the naturally
   chiral Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) surfaces. C-13 labeling of the L enantiomers
   ({*}L-Ser and {*}L-Phe) has enabled mass spectrometric
   enantiodiscrimination of the species desorbing from the surface
   following equilibrium adsorption. On the Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) surfaces,
   both equilibrium adsorption and the thermal decomposition kinetics of
   the D and {*}L enantiomers exhibit diastereomerism. Following exposure
   of the surfaces to D/{*}L mixtures, the relative equilibrium coverages
   of the two enantiomers are equal to their relative partial pressures in
   the gas phase, theta(D)/theta{*}(L) = P-D/P{*}(L). This implies that
   adsorption is not measurably enantiospecific. The decomposition kinetics
   of Ser are enantiospecific whereas those of Phe are not. Comparison of
   these results with those for aspartic acid, alanine, and lysine suggests
   that enantiospecific adsorption on the naturally chiral Cu surfaces
   occurs for those amino acids that have side chains with functional
   groups that allow strong interactions with the surface. There is no
   apparent correlation between amino acids that exhibit enantiospecific
   adsorption and those that exhibit enantiospecific decomposition
   kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{A single product maritime inventory routing problem is addressed in this
   paper by exploring the use of continuous and discrete time models. We
   first present a continuous time model based on time slots for single

   parallel docks. A discrete time is also presented based on a single
   commodity fixed-charge network flow problem (FCNF). All the models are
   solved for multiple randomly generated instances of different problems
   to compare their computational efficiency, and to illustrate the

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{547-559}},

Abstract = {{The complex specific heat is measured over a wide temperature range for
   the liquid crystal (LC) 4-cyano-4-octylbiphenyl (8CB) and cadmium
   sulfate quantum dots (QDs) composites as a function of QD concentration.
   The thermal scans were performed under near-equilibrium conditions for
   all samples having QDs weight percent (phi(w)) from 0 to 3wt\% over a
   wide range of temperature well above and below the two transitions in
   pure 8CB. Isotropic (I) to nematic (N) and nematic to smectic-A (SmA)
   phase transitions evolve in character and their transition temperatures
   offset by (approximate to 2.3 to 2.6K) lower for all composite samples
   as compared to that in pure 8CB. The enthalpy change associated with I-N
   phase transitions shows slightly different behavior on heating and
   cooling and it also shows crossover behavior at lower and higher QD
   content. The enthalpy change associated with N-SmA phase transitions is
   independent of QD loading and thermal treatment. Given the homogeneous
   and random distribution of QD in these nanocomposites, we interpret that
   these results as arising that the nematic phase imposes self-assembly on
   QDs to form one-dimensional arrays leading to QDs and induces net local
   disordering effect in LC media.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework for indexing of grain and subgrain structures in
   electron backscatter diffraction patterns of polycrystalline materials.
   We discretize the domain of a dynamical forward model onto a dense grid
   of orientations, producing a dictionary of patterns. For each measured
   pattern, we identify the most similar patterns in the dictionary, and
   identify boundaries, detect anomalies, and index crystal orientations.
   The statistical distribution of these closest matches is used in an
   unsupervised binary decision tree (DT) classifier to identify grain
   boundaries and anomalous regions. The DT classifies a pattern as an
   anomaly if it has an abnormally low similarity to any pattern in the
   dictionary. It classifies a pixel as being near a grain boundary if the
   highly ranked patterns in the dictionary differ significantly over the
   pixel's neighborhood. Indexing is accomplished by computing the mean
   orientation of the closest matches to each pattern. The mean orientation
   is estimated using a maximum likelihood approach that models the
   orientation distribution as a mixture of Von Mises-Fisher distributions
   over the quaternionic three sphere. The proposed dictionary matching
   approach permits segmentation, anomaly detection, and indexing to be
   performed in a unified manner with the additional benefit of uncertainty
   quantification.}},

   scaffolds coated with a calcium phosphate (CP) formulation (E1001(1k) +
   CP) supplemented with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2
   (rhBMP-2). Specific doses of rhBMP-2 (0, 17, and 35 mu g/scaffold) were
   used. E1001(1k) + CP scaffolds were implanted in unilateral segmental
   defects (15 mm length) in the radial diaphyses of New Zealand White
   rabbits. At 4 and 8 weeks post-implantation, bone regeneration was
   determined using micro-computed tomography (mu CT), histology, and
   histomorphometry. The quantitative outcome data suggest that E1001(1k) +
   CP scaffolds with rhBMP-2 were biocompatible and promoted bone
   regeneration in segmental bone defects. Histological examination of the
   implant sites showed that scaffolds made of E1001(1k) + CP did not
   elicit adverse cellular or tissue responses throughout test periods up
   to 8 weeks. Noteworthy is that the incorporation of a very small amount
   of rhBMP-2 into the scaffolds (as low as 17 mu g/defect site) promoted
   significant bone regeneration compared to scaffolds consisting of
   E1001(1k) + CP alone. This finding indicates that E1001(1k) + CP may be
   an effective platform for bone regeneration in a critical size rabbit
   radius segmental defect model, requiring only a minimal dose of rhBMP-2.}},

Title = {{CO2 storage associated with CO2 enhanced oil recovery: A statistical

Abstract = {{This work analyzes a database of 31 existing CO2 enhanced oil recovery
   (EOR) projects that was compiled for the estimation of oil reserves to
   better understand the CO2 retention, incremental oil recovery, and net
   CO2 utilization for these oil fields. The measured data begin at the
   start date of the CO2 flood and extend through the year 2007. Cumulative
   CO2 retention (in the formation), incremental oil recovery factors, and
   net CO2 utilization factors were-calculated for each of the sites. To
   express all site data on a common dimensionless scale, the data were
   extrapolated to 300\% cumulative hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) by
   fitting nonlinear functions. Summary statistics were then calculated
   from 0\% to 300\% HCPV. Across all 31 sites, the 10th, 50th (median),
   and 90th percentile values for the three factors at 300\% HCPV were: CO2
   retention: 23.1\%, 48.3\%, and 61.8\% retained; incremental oil
   recovery: 5.3\%, 12.2\%, and 21.5\% of OOIP (original oil in place); and
   net CO2 utilization: 4.8, 8.7, and 10.5 Mscf/STB (stock-tank barrel).
   This work employs a novel approach that incorporates nonlinear functions
   to quantify uncertainty in the estimated values as a function of HCPV
   and to describe the shape of the CO2 retention or incremental oil
   recovery response with a handful of parameters, providing insight into
   the behavior of the reservoir across the entire timeline of the CO2
   flood. These nonlinear curve fits are focused on statistical inference -
   i.e., what is the likely outcome and uncertainty ranges for CO2
   retention, incremental oil recovery, and net CO2 utilization given the
   historical data from the 31 CO2 EOR sites? However, the approach
   described in this work also provides useful information for prediction -
   i.e., given a set of inputs from another site with similar geology, what
   are plausible ranges in outcomes for each of these factors?
   Consequently, the results of this work can be used to estimate the
   potential range of expected performance for similar candidate oil fields
   that are not currently undergoing CO2 injection, including estimates of
   the associated CO2 storage potential of these candidate fields. The
   results of this work allow estimation of CO2 storage capacity in CO2-EOR
   operations with various degrees of confidence. The sites in the dataset
   reflect water -alternating gas CO2 floods - all within the continental
   United States and heavily dominated by the West Texas carbonate floods.
   Other floods outside of this region, where the data were available, are
   also included in this study (i.e., the Rocky Mountain region and the
   State of Oklahoma). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neurocomputers offer a massively parallel computing paradigm by
   mimicking the human brain. Their efficient use in statistical
   information processing has been proposed to overcome critical
   bottlenecks with traditional computing schemes for applications such as
   image and speech processing, and associative memory. However, large
   power consumption and high circuit complexity of CMOS-based
   implementations have precluded adoption of such systems, and have led
   researchers to explore the use of emerging technologies. Although they
   provide intriguing properties, previously proposed neurocomputing
   components based on emerging technologies have not offered a complete
   and practical solution to efficiently construct an entire system. In
   this paper we explore the generalized problem of co-optimization of
   technology and architecture for such systems, and develop a recipe for
   device requirements and target capabilities. We describe two plausible
   case study examples, each of which could potentially enable the
   implementation of an efficient and fully functional analog
   neurocomputing system.}},

Abstract = {{In massively parallel computational tasks, such as pattern recognition,
   conventional computing architectures have insufficient power efficiency
   for energy constrained environments. This has made alternative
   architectures, such as neuromorphic computing, increasingly attractive.
   Oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) are one promising architecture, but
   efficient hardware implementations have been limited by shortcomings in
   CMOS technology, specifically in the efficient implementation of
   oscillators and synaptic weights. The authors have recently demonstrated
   that metal-oxide based resistive switching (RRAM) structures can be
   engineered to create low-power, scalable, voltage-controlled oscillators
   that utilize inherent meta-stability in the device. This work proposes
   an RRAM-based ONN that couples oscillatory ``neurons{''} through
   weighted ``synapses{''} using oscillator phase as the state-variable.
   This paper demonstrates a robust architecture using only a few logic
   gates per neuron to implement phase initialization and locking of these
   oscillators, and demonstrate their capability to identify stored
   patterns from noisy inputs. Using measured characteristics of RRAMs as
   oscillators and programmable resistors, compact models are derived and
   used to simulate both an 8-neuron and 20-neuron network.}},

Abstract = {{Electric and magnetic properties, including saturation induction,
   resistivity, Curie temperature, and others, that make soft magnetic
   materials attractive for applications such as power converters and
   electric machines depend on local alloy composition. In this paper, we
   address this dependence quantifiably. First, we correlate the
   crystallization state to local composition with a novel mass balance.
   Second, we perform atom probe tomography on
   (Fe65Co35)(79.5)B13Si2Nb4Cu1.5 magnetic nanocomposites to explore local
   compositional evolution with devitrification and test predictions.
   Precise 3-D atom maps of constituent elements are constructed from
   as-cast, intermediate, and late stage crystallized samples. Local
   compositions and final crystal fraction predicted from mass balances are
   tested. Analysis of chemical partitioning during growth quantifies the
   depletion of glass formers (GFs) in nanocrystals, and enrichment of GFs
   and depletion of Fe and Co in the amorphous phase. Finally, we
   demonstrate the direct measurement of local composition on a nanometer

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Vascular growth and remodeling during embryonic development are
   associated with blood flow and pressure induced stress distribution, in
   which residual strains and stresses play a central role. Residual
   strains are typically measured by performing in vitro tests on the
   excised vascular tissue. In this paper, we investigated the possibility
   of estimating residual strains and stresses using physiological
   pressure-radius data obtained through in vivo noninvasive measurement
   techniques, such as optical coherence tomography or ultrasound
   modalities. This analytical approach first tested with in vitro results
   using experimental data sets for three different arteries such as rabbit
   carotid artery, rabbit thoracic artery, and human carotid artery based
   on Fung's pseudostrain energy function and Delfino's exponential strain
   energy function (SEF). We also examined residual strains and stresses in
   the human swine iliac artery using the in vivo experimental ultrasound
   data sets corresponding to the systolic-to-diastolic region only. This
   allowed computation of the in vivo residual stress information for
   loading and unloading states separately. Residual strain parameters as
   well as the material parameters were successfully computed with high
   accuracy, where the relative errors are introduced in the range of
   0-7.5\%. Corresponding residual stress distributions demonstrated global
   errors all in acceptable ranges. A slight discrepancy was observed in
   the computed reduced axial force. Results of computations performed
   based on in vivo experimental data obtained from loading and unloading
   states of the artery exhibited alterations in material properties and
   residual strain parameters as well. Emerging noninvasive measurement
   techniques combined with the present analytical approach can be used to
   estimate residual strains and stresses in vascular tissues as a
   precursor for growth estimates. This approach is also validated with a
   finite element model of a general two-layered artery, where the material
   remodeling states and residual strain generation are investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Recent results in the development of efficient large-scale nonlinear
   programming (NLP) algorithms have led to fast, on-line realizations of
   optimization-based methods for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)
   and dynamic real-time optimization (D-RTO), with predictive nonlinear
   dynamic (e.g., first principle) models. For NMPC, optimization-based
   controllers are developed that lead to well-understood stability and
   robustness properties, even for large, complex plant models. The
   realization of NMPC requires the application of a fast NLP solver for
   time-critical, on-line optimization, as well as efficient NLP
   sensitivity tools that require 2-3 orders of magnitude less computation
   than the NLP solution. This leads to advanced step NMPC (asNMPC), which
   essentially eliminates computational delay. We also extend these
   capabilities to dynamic real-time optimization (D-RTO) with more general
   stage costs that are economically based. This overview also extends
   input to state stability (ISS) properties for asNMPC to handle active
   set changes, and also for D-RTO through convex regularizations. Two
   large scale distillation case studies, based on nonlinear first
   principle models, are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of
   these approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A contact lens (CL) separates the tear film into a pre-lens tear film
   (PrLTF), the fluid layer between the CL and the outside environment, and
   a post-lens tear film (PoLTF), the fluid layer between the CL and the
   cornea. We examine a model for evaporation of a PrLTF on a modern
   permeable CL allowing fluid transfer between the PrLTF and the PoLTF.
   Evaporation depletes the PrLTF, and continued evaporation causes
   depletion of the PoLTF via fluid loss through the CL. Governing
   equations include Navier-Stokes, heat and Darcy's equations for the
   fluid flow and heat transfer in the PrLTF and porous layer. The PoLTF is
   modelled by a fixed pressure condition on the posterior surface of the
   CL. The original model is simplified using lubrication theory for the
   PrLTF and CL applied to a sagittal plane through the eye. We obtain a
   partial differential equation (PDE) for the PrLTF thickness that is
   first-order in time and fourth-order in space. This model incorporates
   evaporation, conjoining pressure effects in the PrLTF, capillarity and
   heat transfer. For a planar film, we find that this PDE can be reduced
   to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that can be solved
   analytically or numerically. This reduced model allows for
   interpretation of the various system parameters and captures most of the
   basic physics contained in the model. Comparisons of ODE and PDE models,
   including estimates for the loss of fluid through the lens due to
   evaporation, are given.}},

Abstract = {{Multiplexed genome engineering approaches can be used to generate
   targeted genetic diversity in cell populations on laboratory timescales,
   but methods to track mutations and link them to phenotypes have been
   lacking. We present an approach for tracking combinatorial engineered
   libraries (TRACE) through the simultaneous mapping of millions of
   combinatorially engineered genomes at single-cell resolution. Distal
   genomic sites are assembled into individual DNA constructs that are
   compatible with next-generation sequencing strategies. We used TRACE to
   map growth selection dynamics for Escherichia coli combinatorial
   libraries created by recursive multiplex recombineering at a depth
   10(4)-fold greater than before. TRACE was used to identify
   genotype-to-phenotype correlations and to map the evolutionary
   trajectory of two individual combinatorial mutants in E. coli.
   Combinatorial mutations in the human ES2 ovarian carcinoma cell line
   were also assessed with TRACE. TRACE completes the combinatorial
   engineering cycle and enables more sophisticated approaches to genome
   engineering in both bacteria and eukaryotic cells than are currently
   possible.}},

Title = {{The Ran-GTP Gradient Spatially Regulates XCTK2 in the Spindle}},
Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Ran is a small GTP binding protein that was originally identified as a
   regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport {[}1] and subsequently found to
   be important for spindle formation {[}2-5]. In mitosis, a gradient of
   Ran-GTP emanates from chromatin and diminishes toward spindle poles
   {[}6]. Ran-GTP promotes spindle self-organization through the release of
   importin-bound spindle assembly factors (SAFs), which stimulate
   microtubule (MT) nucleation and organization and regulate MT dynamics
   {[}7-9]. Although many SAFs are non-motile MT-associated proteins, such
   as NuMA, TPX2, and HURP {[}7, 10-12], Ran also controls motor proteins,
   including Kid and HSET/XCTK2 {[}13, 14]. The Kinesin-14XCKT2 is
   important for spindle assembly and pole organization {[}15-20], and
   Ran-GTP is proposed to promote XCKT2 MT crosslinking activity by
   releasing importin alpha/beta from a bipartite nuclear localization
   signal (NLS) located in the tail domain {[}14]. Here, we show that the
   Ran-GTP gradient spatially regulates XCTK2 within the spindle. A
   flattened RanGTP gradient blocked the ability of excess XCTK2 to
   stimulate bipolar spindle assembly and resulted in XCTK2-mediated
   bundling of free MTs. These effects required the XCTK2 tail, which
   promoted the motility of XCTK2 within the spindle independent of the
   RanGTP gradient. In addition, the turnover kinetics of XCTK2 were
   spatially controlled: they were faster near the poles relative to the
   chromatin, but not with a mutant XCTK2 that cannot bind to importin
   alpha/beta. Our results support a model in which the Ran-GTP gradient
   spatially coordinates motor localization with motility to ensure
   efficient spindle formation.}},

Abstract = {{Major challenges of water use in the drilling and fracturing process in
   shale gas production are large volumes required in a short-period of
   time and the nonsteady nature of wastewater treatment. A new
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimizing capital
   investment decisions for water use for shale gas production through a
   discrete-time representation of the State-Task Network is presented. The
   objective is to minimize the capital cost of impoundment, piping, and
   treatment facility, and operating cost including freshwater, pumping,
   and treatment. The goal is to determine the location and capacity of
   impoundment, the type of piping, treatment facility locations and
   removal capability, freshwater sources, as well as the frac schedule. In
   addition, the impact of several factors such as limiting truck hauling
   and increasing flowback volume on the solution is examined. A case study
   is optimized to illustrate the application of the proposed formulation.

Abstract = {{Many consumers have monetary or environmental motivations for saving
   energy. Indeed, saving energy produces both monetary benefits, by
   reducing energy bills, and environmental benefits, by reducing carbon
   footprints. We examined how consumers' willingness and reasons to enroll
   in energy-savings programs are affected by whether advertisements
   emphasize monetary benefits, environmental benefits, or both. From a
   normative perspective, having 2 noteworthy kinds of benefit should not
   decrease a program's attractiveness. In contrast, psychological research
   suggests that adding external incentives to an intrinsically motivating
   task may backfire. To date, however, it remains unclear whether this is
   the case when both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are inherent to
   the task, as with energy savings, and whether removing explicit mention
   of extrinsic motivation will reduce its importance. We found that
   emphasizing a program's monetary benefits reduced participants'
   willingness to enroll. In addition, participants' explanations about
   enrollment revealed less attention to environmental concerns when
   programs emphasized monetary savings, even when environmental savings
   were also emphasized. We found equal attention to monetary motivations
   in all conditions, revealing an asymmetric attention to monetary and
   environmental motives. These results also provide practical guidance
   regarding the positioning of energy-saving programs: emphasize intrinsic
   benefits; the extrinsic ones may speak for themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Many recent advances in genomics and the expectations of personalized
   medicine are made possible thanks to power of high throughput sequencing
   (HTS) in sequencing large collections of human genomes. There are tens
   of different sequencing technologies currently available, and each HTS
   platform have different strengths and biases. This diversity both makes
   it possible to use different technologies to correct for shortcomings;
   but also requires to develop different algorithms for each platform due
   to the differences in data types and error models. The first problem to
   tackle in analyzing HTS data for resequencing applications is the read
   mapping stage, where many tools have been developed for the most popular
   HTS methods, but publicly available and open source aligners are still
   lacking for the Complete Genomics (CG) platform. Unfortunately,
   Burrows-Wheeler based methods are not practical for CG data due to the
   gapped nature of the reads generated by this method. Here we provide a
   sensitive read mapper (sirFAST) for the CG technology based on the
   seed-and-extend paradigm that can quickly map CG reads to a reference
   genome. We evaluate the performance and accuracy of sirFAST using both
   simulated and publicly available real data sets, showing high precision
   and recall rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sources of ultrafine particles in the Eastern United States}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{103-112}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Source contributions to ultrafine particle number concentrations for a
   summertime period in the Eastern U.S. are investigated using the
   chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF. New source-resolved number emissions
   inventories are developed for biomass burning, dust, gasoline
   automobiles, industrial sources, non-road and on-road diesel. According
   to the inventory for this summertime period in the Eastern U.S.,
   gasoline automobiles are responsible for 40\% of the ultrafine particle
   number emissions, followed by industrial sources (33\%), non-road diesel
   (16\%), on-road diesel (10\%), and 1\% from biomass burning and dust.
   With these emissions as input, the chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF
   reproduces observed ultrafine particle number concentrations (N3-100) in
   Pittsburgh with an error of 12\%. For this summertime period in the
   Eastern U.S., nucleation is predicted to be the source of more than 90\%
   of the total particle number concentrations. The source contributions to
   primary particle number concentrations are on average similar to those
   of their source emissions contributions: gasoline is predicted to
   contribute 36\% of the total particle number concentrations, followed by
   industrial sources (31\%), non-road diesel (18\%), on-road diesel
   (10\%), biomass burning (1\%), and long-range transport (4\%). For this
   summertime period in Pittsburgh, number source apportionment predictions
   for particles larger than 3 nm in diameter (traffic 65\%, other
   combustion sources 35\%) are consistent with measurement-based source
   apportionment (traffic 60\%, combustion sources 40\%). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Sudden motility reversal indicates sensing of magnetic field gradients
   in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 strain}},
Journal = {{ISME JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1399-1409}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Many motile unicellular organisms have evolved specialized behaviors for
   detecting and responding to environmental cues such as chemical
   gradients (chemotaxis) and oxygen gradients (aerotaxis). Magnetotaxis is
   found in magnetotactic bacteria and it is defined as the passive
   alignment of these cells to the geomagnetic field along with active
   swimming. Herein we show that Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB-1) show a
   unique set of responses that indicates they sense and respond not only
   to the direction of magnetic fields by aligning and swimming, but also
   to changes in the magnetic field or magnetic field gradients. We present
   data showing that AMB-1 cells exhibit sudden motility reversals when we
   impose them to local magnetic field gradients. Our system employs
   permalloy (Ni80Fe20) islands to curve and diverge the magnetic field
   lines emanating from our custom-designed Helmholtz coils in the vicinity
   of the islands (creating a drop in the field across the islands). The
   three distinct movements we have observed as they approach the permalloy
   islands are: unidirectional, single reverse and double reverse. Our
   findings indicate that these reverse movements occur in response to
   magnetic field gradients. In addition, using a permanent magnet we found
   further evidence that supports this claim. Motile AMB-1 cells swim away
   from the north and south poles of a permanent magnet when the magnet is
   positioned less than similar to 30mm from the droplet of cells. All
   together, these results indicate previously unknown response
   capabilities arising from the magnetic sensing systems of AMB-1 cells.
   These responses could enable them to cope with magnetic disturbances
   that could in turn potentially inhibit their efficient search for
   nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Steel reoxidation in the tundish has a significant influence on the
   steel cleanliness and therefore on the mechanical properties of the
   final product. In the present work, the steel reoxidation by two types
   of gunning mass (GM), viz. magnesia- and alumina-based GM, and two types
   of tundish slag, viz. lime-alumina-silica and lime-alumina slags, has
   been investigated. The evolution of the steel composition during the
   test was analyzed and predicted based on thermodynamic and kinetic
   considerations. The calculated steel composition agrees well with
   measured values, when assuming the mass transfer in slag phase limits
   the reoxidation reactions. The oxidation capacity of the gunning mass
   and tundish slag is quantified by calculating the oxygen amount supplied
   from the GM and the slag to the steel phase. It was found that compared
   to alumina GM, magnesia GM exhibits a stronger oxidation capacity due to
   its higher content of reducible oxides (10 wt pct SiO2 + 6 wt pct FeO).
   Compared to lime-alumina-silica tundish slag, lime-alumina slag (with
   more FeO + MnO contents) provides more oxygen to the molten steel in the
   present experimental conditions and consequently shows a stronger
   oxidation capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The homochirality of biomolecules is a signature of life on Earth and
   has significant implications in, for example, the production of
   pharmaceutical compounds. It has been suggested that biomolecular
   homochirality may have arisen from the amplification of a spontaneously
   formed small enantiomeric excess (e.e.). Many minerals exhibit naturally
   chiral surfaces and so adsorption has been proposed as one possible
   mechanism for such an amplification of e.e. Here we show that when
   gas-phase mixtures of D-and L-aspartic acid are exposed to an achiral
   Cu(111) surface, a small e.e. in the gas phase, e.e.(g), leads to an
   amplification of the e.e. on the surface, e.e.(s), under equilibrium
   conditions. Adsorption-induced amplification of e.e. does not require a
   chiral surface. The dependence of e.e.(s) on e.e.(g) has been modelled
   successfully using a Langmuir-like adsorption isotherm that incorporates
   the formation of homochiral adsorbate clusters on the surface.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a conductive propylene-based elastomer (cPBE) that rapidly
   and reversibly changes its mechanical rigidity when powered with
   electrical current. The elastomer is rigid in its natural state, with an
   elastic (Young's) modulus of 175.5 MPa, and softens when electrically
   activated. By embedding the cPBE in an electrically insulating sheet of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), we create a cPBE-PDMS composite that can
   reversibly change its tensile modulus between 37 and 1.5 MPa. The
   rigidity change takes similar to 6 s and is initiated when a 100 V
   voltage drop is applied across the two ends of the cPBE film. This
   magnitude of change in elastic rigidity is similar to that observed in
   natural skeletal muscle and catch connective tissue. We characterize the
   tunable load-bearing capability of the cPBE-PDMS composite with a
   motorized tensile test and deadweight experiment. Lastly, we demonstrate
   the ability to control the routing of internal forces by embedding
   several cPBE-PDMS `active tendons' into a soft robotic pneumatic bending
   actuator. Selectively activating the artificial tendons controls the
   neutral axis and direction of bending during inflation.}},

Abstract = {{The transportation sector is the second largest source of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions in the United States. This study examines the cost
   effectiveness of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
   (LEED)-certified residential brownfield developments as vehicle miles
   traveled (VMT) and GHG-emission-reduction strategy. Costs incurred by
   developers (including cleanup and LEED transportation credit
   implementation) and savings incurred by residents and the society
   (including driving time, fuel, and external air pollution) were examined
   using 16 sites in Baltimore, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh.
   Travel-demand models were used to estimate VMT reductions. Air
   pollution-valuation data were used to estimate environmental cost
   savings. Results indicate that on average LEED-certified residential
   brownfield developments annually save an average household between
   \$3,500 and \$4,000. Comparing cost savings of these developments with
   other VMT-reduction strategies shows that with minimal implementation
   cost incurred by transportation authorities (75-95\% less than other
   VMT-reduction strategies), LEED-certified residential brownfield
   developments can be a beneficial travel-demand strategy and an
   environmentally viable option to assist federal, state, and local

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (SXCT) is increasingly being used
   for 3-D imaging of material samples at micron and finer scales. The
   success of these techniques has increased interest in 4-D reconstruction
   methods that can image a sample in both space and time. However, the
   temporal resolution of widely used 4-D reconstruction methods is
   severely limited by the need to acquire a very large number of views for
   each reconstructed 3-D volume. Consequently, the temporal resolution of
   current methods is insufficient to observe important physical phenomena.
   Furthermore, measurement nonidealities also tend to introduce ring and
   streak artifacts into the 4-D reconstructions. In this paper, we present
   a time-interlaced model-based iterative reconstruction (TIMBIR) method,
   which is a synergistic combination of two innovations. The first
   innovation, interlaced view sampling, is a novel method of data
   acquisition, which distributes the view anglesmore evenly in time. The
   second innovation is a 4-D model-based iterative reconstruction
   algorithm (MBIR), which can produce time-resolved volumetric
   reconstruction of the sample from the interlaced views. In addition to
   modeling both the sensor noise statistics and the 4-D object, the MBIR
   algorithm also reduces ring and streak artifacts by more accurately
   modeling the measurement nonidealities. We present reconstructions of
   both simulated and real X-ray synchrotron data, which indicate that
   TIMBIR can improve temporal resolution by an order of magnitude relative
   to existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A near-equiatomic NiTi shape memory alloy was subjected to a variety of
   thermomechanical treatments including pure thermal cycling and
   load-biased thermal cycling to investigate microstructural evolution of
   the material under actuating conditions. In situ and post mortem
   scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to study the
   effects of stress on the development of defect substructures during
   cycling through the martensitic transformation. High temperature
   observations of the austenite phase show rapid accumulation of
   dislocations and moderate deformation twinning upon thermomechanical
   cycling. Additionally, TEM-based orientation mapping suggests the
   emergence of fine crystallites from the original coarse austenite grain
   structure. A possible mechanism is proposed for the observed grain
   refinement based on the crystallographic theory of martensite
   transformation. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Cationic Nanogel-mediated Runx2 and Osterix siRNA Delivery Decreases
   Mineralization in MC3T3 Cells}},

Abstract = {{Heterotopic ossification (HO) may occur after musculoskeletal trauma,
   traumatic brain injury, and total joint arthroplasty. As such, HO is a
   compelling clinical concern in both military and civilian medicine. A
   possible etiology of HO involves dysregulated signals in the bone
   morphogenetic protein osteogenic cascade. Contemporary treatment options
   for HO (ie, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and radiation therapy)
   have adverse effects associated with their use and are not biologically
   engineered to abrogate the molecular mechanisms that govern osteogenic
   differentiation.
   We hypothesized that (1) nanogel-mediated short interfering RNA (siRNA)
   delivery against Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osterix
   (Osx) genes will decrease messenger RNA expression; (2) inhibit activity
   of the osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and (3) inhibit
   hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition in osteoblast cell cultures.
   Nanogel nanostructured polymers delivered siRNA in 48-hour treatment
   cycles against master osteogenic regulators, Runx2 and Osx, in murine
   calvarial preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1.4) stimulated for osteogenic
   differentiation by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein
   (rhBMP-2). The efficacy of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics was
   determined by quantitation of messenger RNA knockdown (by quantitative
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), downstream protein
   knockdown (determined ALP enzymatic activity assay), and HA deposition
   (determined by OsteoImage (TM) assay).
   Gene expression assays demonstrated that nanogel-based RNAi treatments
   at 1:1 and 5:1 nanogel:short interfering RNA weight ratios reduced Runx2
   expression by 48.59\% +/- A 19.53\% (p < 0.001) and 43.22\% +/- A
   18.01\% (both p < 0.001). The same 1:1 and 5:1 treatments against both
   Runx2 and Osx reduced expression of Osx by 51.65\% +/- A 10.85\% and
   47.65\% +/- A 9.80\% (both p < 0.001). Moreover, repeated 48-hour RNAi
   treatment cycles against Runx2 and Osx rhBMP-2 administration reduced
   ALP activity after 4 and 7 days. ALP reductions after 4 days in culture
   by nanogel 5:1 and 10:1 RNAi treatments were 32.4\% +/- A 12.0\% and
   33.6\% +/- A 13.8\% (both p < 0.001). After 7 days in culture, nanogel
   1:1 and 5:1 RNAi treatments produced 35.9\% +/- A 14.0\% and 47.7\% +/-
   A 3.2\% reductions in ALP activity. Osteoblast mineralization data after
   21 days suggested that nanogel 1:1, 5:1, and 10:1 RNAi treatments
   decreased mineralization (ie, HA deposition) from cultures treated only
   with rhBMP-2 (p < 0.001). However, despite RNAi attack on Runx2 and Osx,
   HA deposition levels remained greater than non-rhBMP-2-treated cell
   cultures.
   Although mRNA and protein knockdown were confirmed as a result of RNAi
   treatments against Runx2 and Osx, complete elimination of mineralization
   processes was not achieved. RNAi targeting mid- and late-stage
   osteoblast differentiation markers such as ALP, osteocalcin,
   osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein) may produce the desired RNAi-nanogel
   nanostructured polymer HO prophylaxis.
   Successful HO prophylaxis should target and silence osteogenic markers
   critical for heterotopic bone formation processes. The identification of
   such markers, beyond RUNX2 and OSX, may enhance the effectiveness of
   RNAi prophylaxes for HO.}},

Abstract = {{The extraordinary properties of graphene surface plasmons like strong
   field confinement, long propagation distance and tunability have made
   graphene an attractive alternative to noble metals. However, it is still
   experimentally challenging to increase the resonance frequency in
   graphene nanostructures beyond the mid-IR limit. In this work, we
   investigate the blueshift of surface plasmon resonance frequency via
   plasmon hybridization in graphene disk stacks. Based on a nonretarded
   approach, we study the Plasmon hybrid modes in graphene disk stack
   structures, considering the optical coupling between the uncouple
   eigenmodes of each disk. Through this methodology we were also able to
   extract the scattered and absorbed fields. We find that due to plasmon,
   hybridization in an N-disk stack, each uncoupled mode splits into N
   hybrid modes. When the distance between disks is close to the strong
   coupling limit, we observe that for each uncoupled mode there is only
   one hybrid mode that is blue-shifted compared with the resonance
   frequency of its respective uncoupled mode. Analysis of the
   hybridization by reducing the distance between disks shows that in the
   transition between the weak and strong coupling regimes the interaction
   is mainly driven by the coupling of edge plasmons. For a stack with 25
   graphene disks having a Fermi level of 1.0 eV and a 50 nm disk diameter,
   we observe that surface plasmon hybridization can effectively blueshift
   the resonance frequency up to 0.69 eV (1.8 mu m). In addition, compared
   to a single graphene disk with the same diameter, the 25-disk stack can
   increase the peak of absorption and scattering cross sections by 12 and
   38 times, respectively, opening up a wide range of applications for
   graphene surface plasmons in the near-infrared regime. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present an investigation of the effect of deformation twinning on the
   visco-plastic response and stress localization in a low stacking fault
   energy twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel under uniaxial tension
   loading. The three-dimensional full field response was simulated using
   the fast Fourier transform method. The initial microstructure was
   obtained from a three dimensional serial section using electron
   backscatter diffraction. Twin volume fraction evolution upon strain was
   measured so the hardening parameters of the simple Voce model could be
   identified to fit both the stress-strain behavior and twinning activity.
   General trends of texture evolution were acceptably predicted including
   the typical sharpening and balance between the <111> fiber and the <100>
   fiber. Twinning was found to nucleate preferentially at grain boundaries
   although the predominant twin reorientation scheme did not allow spatial
   propagation to be captured. Hot spots in stress correlated with the
   boundaries of twinned voxel domains, which either impeded or enhanced
   twinning based on which deformation modes were active locally.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional physics-based cellular automata model for granular
   shear flow}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{287-302}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Granular flows continue to be a complex problem in nature and industry
   where solid particles exhibit solid, liquid, and gaseous behavior in a
   manner which is often difficult to predict both locally and globally. In
   solids processing applications such as pharmaceutical production, food
   processing, and coal processing, the ability to accurately predict
   particle flows can improve process efficiency and product effectiveness.
   The ``gold standard{''} for the modeling and prediction of granular
   flows is the discrete element method (DEN), which provides a rigorous
   physical treatment of particle interactions. One `possible supplement to
   DEM-based analysis is lattice-based cellular automata (CA). CA provides
   a platform for obtaining fast predictions by pairing rule-based
   mathematics with high-fidelity physics to rapidly model physical
   processes, such as granular flows. The present work develops a novel
   three-dimensional (3D) physics-based CA framework for modeling granular
   shear flows. This 3D CA model extends the framework's modeling
   capabilities beyond the granular kinetic regime, includes treatments for
   force chains, and provides reasonably high accuracy in terms of
   predicting fundamental granular flow experiments. The predictive
   capabilities and quantitative accuracy of this CA model have been tested
   and validated against experimental shear flow results from an annular
   shear cell. Results from this validation work suggest that the model
   accurately predicts local flow properties. A parametric study varying
   the particle-particle coefficient of restitution demonstrated the
   ability of the 3D CA model to capture nonlinear trends in the local
   solid fraction profiles. A time study was also performed to highlight
   the computational efficiency of the 3D CA framework developed in this
   work. Results of this study showed that even at relatively low particle
   counts (10(4)), the 3D CA model provides for considerable computational
   savings, with run times of two orders of magnitude less than a 2D DEM
   model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of varying alkaline electrolyte and electrolyte Fe levels on
   the performance and active-phase structure of NiOOH thin films for
   catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction were studied. An electrolyte
   effect on catalytic performance was observed. Under purified conditions,
   current densities followed the trend Cs+ > K+ approximate to Na+
   approximate to Li+ at current densities > 1 mA/cm(2). Under Fe-saturated
   conditions, current densities followed the trend K+ approximate to Na+ >
   Cs+ > Li+ at all current densities. Voltammetry was coupled with Raman
   spectroscopy for studies in LiOH and CsOH. Raman spectra were fit to
   Gaussian functions and analyzed quantitatively based on mean peak
   positions. Both purified and Fe-saturated CsOH promoted slightly lower
   peak positions than purified and Fe-saturated LiOH, indicating that CsOH
   promoted a NiOOH active-phase structure with longer Ni-O bonds. Both
   Fe-saturated CsOH and LiOH promoted slightly lower Raman peak positions
   than purified CsOH and LiOH, but only for one of the two Raman peaks.
   These results indicate that Fe promoted an active-phase structure with
   slightly longer Ni-O bonds. This study shows that the catalytic
   performance and active-phase structure of NiOOH can be tuned by simply
   varying the alkaline electrolyte and electrolyte Fe levels.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy with in situ biasing has been performed
   on TiN/single-crystal rutile TiO2/Pt resistive switching structures.
   Three elementary processes essential for switching: i) creation of
   oxygen vacancies by electrochemical reactions at low temperatures (<150
   degrees C), ii) their drift in the electric field, and iii) their
   coalescence into planar faults ( and dissociation from them) have been
   documented. The faults have a form of vacancy discs in \{110\} and
   \{121\} planes, are bound by partial dislocation loops, and are
   identical to Wadsley defects observed in nonstoichiometric TiO2 annealed
   at high temperatures. The faults can be regarded as a precursor to the
   formation of oxygen-deficient Magneli phases, but 3D secondary phase
   inclusions have not been detected. Together, the observations shed light
   on the behavior of oxygen vacancies in relatively low electric fields
   and temperatures, suggesting that, in addition to the rather accepted
   notion of oxygen vacancy motion during the writing processes in
   resistive switching devices, such motion may occur even during reading,
   and may be accompanied by significant oxygen vacancy creation at modest
   device excitation levels.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) solution is measured
   in this study using a transient hot wire technique, where DMSO is a key
   ingredient in many cryoprotective agent (CPA) cocktails.
   Characterization of thermal properties of cryoprotective agents is
   essential to the analysis of cryopreservation processes, either when
   evaluating experimental data or for the design of new protocols. Also
   presented are reference measurements of thermal conductivity for pure
   water ice and glycerol. The thermal conductivity measurement setup is
   integrated into the experimentation stage of a scanning cryomacroscope
   apparatus, which facilitates the correlation of measured data with
   visualization of physical events. Thermal conductivity measurements were
   conducted for a DMSO concentration range of 2M and 10M, in a temperature
   range of -180 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Vitrified samples showed
   decreased thermal conductivity with decreasing temperature, while
   crystalline samples showed increased thermal conductivity with
   decreasing temperature. These different behaviors result in up to a
   tenfold difference in thermal conductivity at -180 degrees C. Such
   dramatic differences can drastically impact heat transfer during
   cryopreservation and their quantification is therefore critical to
   cryobiology.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Calculating the edit-distance (i.e. minimum number of
   insertions, deletions and substitutions) between short DNA sequences is
   the primary task performed by seed-and-extend based mappers, which
   compare billions of sequences. In practice, only sequence pairs with a
   small edit-distance provide useful scientific data. However, the
   majority of sequence pairs analyzed by seed-and-extend based mappers
   differ by significantly more errors than what is typically allowed. Such
   error-abundant sequence pairs needlessly waste resources and severely
   hinder the performance of read mappers. Therefore, it is crucial to
   develop a fast and accurate filter that can rapidly and efficiently
   detect error-abundant string pairs and remove them from consideration
   before more computationally expensive methods are used.
   Results: We present a simple and efficient algorithm, Shifted Hamming
   Distance (SHD), which accelerates the alignment verification procedure
   in read mapping, by quickly filtering out error-abundant sequence pairs
   using bit-parallel and SIMD-parallel operations. SHD only filters string
   pairs that contain more errors than a user-defined threshold, making it
   fully comprehensive. It also maintains high accuracy with moderate error
   threshold (up to 5\% of the string length) while achieving a 3-fold
   speedup over the best previous algorithm (Gene Myers's bit-vector
   algorithm). SHD is compatible with all mappers that perform sequence
   alignment for verification.}},

Title = {{Fault diagnosis in DSL networks using support vector machines}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{72-84}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The adequate operation for a number of service distribution networks
   relies on the effective maintenance and fault management of their
   underlay DSL infrastructure. Thus, new tools are required in order to
   adequately monitor and further diagnose anomalies that other segments of
   the DSL network cannot identify due to the pragmatic issues raised by
   hardware or software misconfigurations. In this work we present a
   fundamentally new approach for classifying known DSL-level anomalies by
   exploiting the properties of novelty detection via the employment of
   one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By virtue of the imbalance
   residing in the training samples that consequently lead to problematic
   prediction outcomes when used within two-class formulations, we adopt
   the properties of one-class classification and construct models for
   independently identifying and classifying a single type of a DSL-level
   anomaly. Given the fact that the greater number of the installed Digital
   Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) within the DSL network of a
   large European ISP were misconfigured, thus unable to accurately flag
   anomalous events, we utilize as inference solutions the models derived
   by the one-class SVM formulations built by the known labels as flagged
   by the much smaller number of correctly configured DSLAMs in the same
   network in order to aid the classification aspect against the monitored
   unlabeled events. By reaching an average over 95\% on a number of
   classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and F-score we
   show that one-class SVM classifiers overcome the biased classification
   outcomes achieved by the traditional two-class formulations and that
   they may constitute as viable and promising components within the design
   of future network fault management strategies. In addition, we
   demonstrate their superiority over commonly used two-class machine
   learning approaches such as Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks that
   has been used in the same context within past solutions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and KOH etching were used to
   analyze the motion of dislocations after the conversion of basal plane
   dislocations (BPDs) to threading edge dislocations (TEDs) during 4H-SiC
   epitaxy. The locations of TED etch pits on the epilayer surface were
   shifted compared to the original locations of BPD etch pits on the
   substrate surface. The shift of the TED etch pits was mostly along the
   BPD line directions towards the up-step direction. For converted screw
   type BPDs, the conversion points were located below the
   substrate/epilayer interface. The shift distances in the step-flow
   direction were proportional to the depths of the BPD-TED conversion
   points below the substrate/epilayer interface. For converted mixed type
   BPDs, the conversion points were exactly at the interface. Through TEM
   analysis, it was concluded that the dislocation shift is caused by a
   combined effect of H-2 etching prior to growth and glide of the
   threading segments during high temperature epitaxy. The TED glide is
   only possible for converted pure screw type BPDs and could present a
   viable means for eliminating BPDs from the epilayer during growth by
   moving the conversion point below the substrate/epilayer interface. (C)

Abstract = {{Copper films deposited on m- and r-plane sapphire substrates have been
   dewetted in either the solid or the liquid state, and equilibrated at

   backscatter diffraction. In addition, the shape of the copper/sapphire
   interface has been studied by scanning electron microscopy. Although the

   substrates, after solid state dewetting the copper crystals on the
   m-plane substrate are found to change their interface plane from Cu\{1 1
   1\} parallel to Al2O3 (m-plane) to Cu\{1 1 1\} parallel to Al2O3
   (a-plane), and after liquid state dowelling the preferred OR of copper

Title = {{Image segmentation of nanoscale Zernike phase contrast X-ray computed
   tomography images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Zernike phase contrast is a useful technique for nanoscale X-ray
   computed tomography (CT) imaging of materials with a low X-ray
   absorption coefficient. It enhances the image contrast by phase shifting
   X-ray waves to create changes in amplitude. However, it creates
   artifacts that hinder the use of traditional image segmentation
   techniques. We propose an image restoration method that models the X-ray
   phase contrast optics and the three-dimensional image reconstruction
   method. We generate artifact-free images through an optimization problem
   that inverts this model. Though similar approaches have been used for
   Zernike phase contrast in visible light microscopy, this optimization
   employs an effective edge detection method tailored to handle Zernike
   phase contrast artifacts. We characterize this optics-based restoration
   method by removing the artifacts in and thresholding multiple Zernike
   phase contrast X-ray CT images to produce segmented results that are
   consistent with the physical specimens. We quantitatively evaluate and
   compare our method to other segmentation techniques to demonstrate its
   high accuracy. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Multiple stiffening effects of nanoscale knobs on human red blood cells
   infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite}},

Abstract = {{During its asexual development within the red blood cell (RBC),
   Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most virulent human malaria parasite,
   exports proteins that modify the host RBC membrane. The attendant
   increase in cell stiffness and cytoadherence leads to sequestration of
   infected RBCs in microvasculature, which enables the parasite to evade
   the spleen, and leads to organ dysfunction in severe cases of malaria.
   Despite progress in understanding malaria pathogenesis, the molecular
   mechanisms responsible for the dramatic loss of deformability of
   Pf-infected RBCs have remained elusive. By recourse to a coarse-grained
   (CG) model that captures the molecular structures of Pf-infected RBC
   membrane, here we show that nanoscale surface protrusions, known as
   ``knobs,{''} introduce multiple stiffening mechanisms through composite
   strengthening, strain hardening, and knob density-dependent vertical
   coupling. On one hand, the knobs act as structural strengtheners for the
   spectrin network; on the other, the presence of knobs results in strain
   inhomogeneity in the spectrin network with elevated shear strain in the
   knob-free regions, which, given its strain-hardening property,
   effectively stiffens the network. From the trophozoite to the schizont
   stage that ensues within 24-48 h of parasite invasion into the RBC, the
   rise in the knob density results in the increased number of vertical
   constraints between the spectrin network and the lipid bilayer, which
   further stiffens the membrane. The shear moduli of Pf-infected RBCs
   predicted by the CG model at different stages of parasite maturation are
   in agreement with experimental results. In addition to providing a
   fundamental understanding of the stiffening mechanisms of Pf-infected
   RBCs, our simulation results suggest potential targets for antimalarial
   therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of SrTiO3(001) surfaces was studied using
   scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density-functional theory. With high
   dynamic range measurements, an in-gap transition level was observed on
   SrO-terminated surfaces, at 2.7 eV above the valence band maximum. The
   density of centers responsible for this level was found to increase with
   surface segregation of oxygen vacancies and decrease with exposure to
   molecular oxygen. Based on these findings, the level is attributed to
   surface O vacancies. A level at a similar energy is predicted
   theoretically on SrO-terminated surfaces. For TiO2-terminated surfaces,
   no discrete in-gap state was observed, although one is predicted
   theoretically. This lack of signal is believed to be due to the nature
   of the defect wave function involved, as well as the possible influence
   of transport limitations in the tunneling spectroscopy measurements.}},

Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we present a new Big-M reformulation for Generalized
   Disjunctive Programs. Unlike the traditional Big-M reformulation that
   uses one M-parameter for each constraint, the new approach uses multiple
   M-parameters for each constraint. Each of these M-parameters is
   associated with each alternative in the disjunction to which the
   constraint belongs. In this way, the proposed MINLP reformulation is at
   least as tight as the traditional Big-M, and it does not require
   additional variables or constraints. We present the new Big-M, and
   analyze the strength in its continuous relaxation compared to that of
   the traditional Big-M. The new formulation is tested by solving several
   instances with an NLP-based branch and bound method. The results show
   that, in most cases, the new reformulation requires fewer nodes and less
   time to find the optimal solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   crystallization, more typical of application environments, has not been
   reported in literature. Here, a TTT diagram for the Co based,
   Co-Fe-Si-Nb-B-Mn MANC system is presented, along with a method for
   determining such. The method accounts for the presence of primary
   crystal phases and yields crystal fraction of secondary phase(s) by
   using a novel four stage heating profile. The diagram, affirmed by
   Kissinger activation energy analysis, reports thermal stability of the
   MANC for millennia at conventional device operating temperatures, and
   stability limits less than a minute at elevated temperatures. Both
   extremes are necessary to be able to avoid secondary crystalline
   products and establish operating limits for this mechanically
   attractive, high induction soft magnetic nanocomposite. (C) 2015 AIP

Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Monodisperse hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanoparticles were synthesized by
   forced hydrolysis of acidic Fe3+ solution. Rietveld analysis was applied
   to the X-ray powder diffraction data to refine the lattice constants and
   atomic positions. The lattice constants for a hexagonal unit cell were
   determined to be a similar to 0.50327 and c similar to 1.37521 nm. High
   resolution transmission electron microscopy was employed to study the
   morphology of the particles. Atomic scale micrographs and diffraction
   patterns from several zone axes were obtained. These reveal the high
   degree of crystallinity of the particles. A series of observations made
   on the particles by tilting them through a range of +/- 45 degrees
   revealed the particles to be micaceous with stacking of platelets with
   well defined crystallographic orientations. The Morin transition in
   these nanoparticles was found to occur at 210 K, which is lower
   temperature than 263K of bulk hematite. It was ascertained from the
   previous Mossbauer studies that the spin orientation for nano-sized
   hematite particle flips from 90 degrees to 28 degrees with respect to
   the c-axis of the hexagonal structure during the Morin transition, which
   is in contrast to that observed in bulk hematite where spin orientation
   flips from 90 degrees to 0 degrees. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Magnetic resonance imaging-based computational modelling of blood flow
   and nanomedicine deposition in patients with peripheral arterial disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{106}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is generally attributed to the
   progressive vascular accumulation of lipoproteins and circulating
   monocytes in the vessel walls leading to the formation of
   atherosclerotic plaques. This is known to be regulated by the local
   vascular geometry, haemodynamics and biophysical conditions. Here, an
   isogeometric analysis framework is proposed to analyse the blood flow
   and vascular deposition of circulating nanoparticles (NPs) into the
   superficial femoral artery (SFA) of a PAD patient. The local geometry of
   the blood vessel and the haemodynamic conditions are derived from
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed at baseline and at 24 months
   post intervention. A dramatic improvement in blood flow dynamics is
   observed post intervention. A 500\% increase in peak flow rate is
   measured in vivo as a consequence of luminal enlargement. Furthermore,
   blood flow simulations reveal a 32\% drop in the mean oscillatory shear
   index, indicating reduced disturbed flow post intervention. The same
   patient information (vascular geometry and blood flow) is used to
   predict in silico in a simulation of the vascular deposition of
   systemically injected nanomedicines. NPs, targeted to inflammatory
   vascular molecules including VCAM-1, E-selectin and ICAM-1, are
   predicted to preferentially accumulate near the stenosis in the baseline
   configuration, with VCAM-1 providing the highest accumulation (approx.
   1.33 and 1.50 times higher concentration than that of ICAM-1 and
   E-selectin, respectively). Such selective deposition of NPs within the
   stenosis could be effectively used for the detection and treatment of
   plaques forming in the SFA. The presented MRI-based computational
   protocol can be used to analyse data from clinical trials to explore
   possible correlations between haemodynamics and disease progression in
   PAD patients, and potentially predict disease occurrence as well as the
   outcome of an intervention.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to estimate the

   plant fleet that reflects upcoming plant retirements, and (3) the 2018
   fleet with increased wind capacity. We find that controlled electric
   vehicle charging can reduce associated generation costs by 23\%-34\% in
   part by shifting loads to lower-cost, higher-emitting coal plants. This
   shift results in increased externality costs of health and environmental
   damages from increased air pollution. On balance, we find that
   controlled charging of electric vehicles produces negative net social
   benefits in the recent PJM grid but could have positive net social
   benefits in a future grid with sufficient coal retirements and wind

Title = {{Once-per-step control of ankle-foot prosthesis push-off work reduces
   effort associated with balance during walking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with below-knee amputation have more difficulty
   balancing during walking, yet few studies have explored balance
   enhancement through active prosthesis control. We previously used a
   dynamical model to show that prosthetic ankle push-off work affects both
   sagittal and frontal plane dynamics, and that appropriate step-by-step
   control of push-off work can improve stability. We hypothesized that
   this approach could be applied to a robotic prosthesis to partially
   fulfill the active balance requirements of human walking, thereby
   reducing balance-related activity and associated effort for the person
   using the device.
   Methods: We conducted experiments on human participants (N = 10) with
   simulated amputation. Prosthetic ankle push-off work was varied on each
   step in ways expected to either stabilize, destabilize or have no effect
   on balance. Average ankle push-off work, known to affect effort, was
   kept constant across conditions. Stabilizing controllers commanded more
   push-off work on steps when the mediolateral velocity of the center of
   mass was lower than usual at the moment of contralateral heel strike.
   Destabilizing controllers enforced the opposite relationship, while a
   neutral controller maintained constant push-off work regardless of body
   state. A random disturbance to landing foot angle and a cognitive
   distraction task were applied, further challenging participants'
   balance. We measured metabolic rate, foot placement kinematics, center
   of pressure kinematics, distraction task performance, and user
   preference in each condition. We expected the stabilizing controller to
   reduce active control of balance and balance-related effort for the
   user, improving user preference.
   Results: The best stabilizing controller lowered metabolic rate by 5.5\%
   (p = 0.003) and 8.5\% (p = 0.02), and step width variability by 10.0\%
   (p = 0.009) and 10.7\% (p = 0.03) compared to conditions with no control
   and destabilizing control, respectively. Participants tended to prefer
   stabilizing controllers. These effects were not due to differences in
   average push-off work, which was unchanged across conditions, or to
   average gait mechanics, which were also unchanged. Instead, benefits
   were derived from step-by-step adjustments to prosthesis behavior in
   response to variations in mediolateral velocity at heel strike.
   Conclusions: Once-per-step control of prosthetic ankle push-off work can
   reduce both active control of foot placement and balance-related
   metabolic energy use during walking.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleoskeleton contains mainly nuclear intermediate filaments made
   of lamin proteins. Lamins provide nuclear structure and also play a role
   in various nuclear processes including signal transduction,
   transcription regulation and chromatin organization. The disparate
   functions of lamins may be related to the intrinsic disorder of the tail
   domains, which allows for altered and promiscuous binding. Here, we show
   modulation of lamin tail domain structures in the presence of divalent
   cations. We utilize changes in fluorescence of tryptophan residues
   within the Ig-fold flanked by disordered regions to experimentally
   measure protein thermodynamics. Using spectroscopy experiments and
   molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tail domain of lamin B1
   shows enhanced association with both Ca2+ and Mg2+ compared to the tail
   domain of lamin A. Binding curves show a similar K-D between protein and
   ion (250-300M) for both proteins with both ions. However, we observe a
   maximum binding of ions to lamin B1 tail domain which is 2-3times
   greater than that for lamin A tail domain by both experiment and
   simulation. Using simulations, we show that divalent ion association
   alters the Ig-fold by pinning flanking regions. With cells in culture,
   we observe altered lamin B1 organization in the presence of excess Mg2+
   more so than for lamin A. We suggest that the differential sensitivity
   to divalent cations contributes to the vastly different functionalities
   and binding of the 2 proteins.}},

   indirect experimental inference. Here we demonstrate the application of
   a new algorithm to reliably estimate centerlines of biological filament
   bundles and extract individual filaments from the centerlines by
   systematically disambiguating filament intersections. We utilize a
   filament enhancement step followed by reverse diffusion based filament
   localization and an integer programming based set combination to
   systematically extract accurate filaments automatically from microscopy

   flat cells (2D images) show efficacy of the new method.}},

Abstract = {{Web service recommendation has become a critical problem as services
   become increasingly prevalent on the Internet. Some existing methods
   focus on content matching techniques, while others are based on QoS
   measurement. However, service ecosystem is evolving over time with
   services publishing, prospering and perishing. Few existing methods
   consider or exploit the evolution of service ecosystem on service
   recommendation. This paper employs a probabilistic approach to predict
   the popularity of services to enhance the recommendation performance. A
   method is presented that extracts service evolution patterns by
   exploiting latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and time series prediction.
   A time-aware service recommendation framework is established for mashup
   creation that conducts joint analysis of temporal information, content
   description and historical mashup-service usage in an evolving service
   ecosystem. Experiments on a real-world service repository,
   ProgrammableWeb.com, show that the proposed approach leads to a higher
   precision than traditional collaborative filtering and content matching
   methods, by taking into account temporal information.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics simulations and the lattice-based scattering
   boundary method to compute the thermal conductance of finite-length
   Lennard-Jones superlattice junctions confined by bulk crystalline leads.
   The superlattice junction thermal conductance depends on the properties
   of the leads. For junctions with a superlattice period of four atomic
   monolayers at temperatures between 5 and 20 K, those with
   mass-mismatched leads have a greater thermal conductance than those with
   mass-matched leads. We attribute this lead effect to interference
   between and the ballistic transport of emergent junction vibrational
   modes. The lead effect diminishes when the temperature is increased,
   when the superlattice period is increased, and when interfacial disorder
   is introduced, but is reversed in the harmonic limit. (C) 2015 Author(

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The topographic and electronic structure of cleaved SrTiO3(001) surfaces
   were studied, employing samples that either had or had not been coated
   with Ti on their outer surfaces prior to fracture. In both cases, SrO-
   and TiO2-terminated terraces were present on the cleavage surface,
   enabling in situ studies on either termination. However, the samples
   coated with Ti prior to fracture were found to yield a rougher
   morphology on TiO2-terminated terraces as well as a higher density of
   oxygen vacancies during an annealing (outgassing) step following the
   coating. The higher density of oxygen vacancies in the bulk of the
   Ti-coated samples also provides higher conductivity, which, in turn,
   improves a sensitivity of the spectroscopy and reduces the effect of
   tip-induced band bending. Nonetheless, similar spectral features, unique
   to each termination, were observed for samples both with and without the
   Ti coating. Notably, with moderate-temperature annealing following
   fracture, a strong discrete peak in the conductance spectra, arising
   from oxygen vacancies, was observed on the SrO-terminated terraces. This
   peak appears at slightly different voltages for coated and uncoated
   samples, signifying a possible effect of tip-induced band bending. (C)

Abstract = {{Thermal management becomes a huge challenge for modern IC designers,

   (VeSFET) technology provides an alternative thermal-friendly design
   choice. VeSFET-based chips not only have a much lower power density but
   also a better vertical thermal conductivity than their CMOS
   counterparts. For a VeSFET chip with ten stacked dies, the temperature
   increase is only 30\% of that for CMOS-based chip. Assuming the same
   scaling trend for CMOS and VeSFET, VeSFET 3-D chips can postpone the
   appearance of dark silicon by three technology nodes compared with CMOS
   implementations. For VeSFET-based designs, different topologies of
   transistor arrays may result in different thermal behaviors. We perform
   thermal characterization of two-transistor array topologies.}},

Abstract = {{We present measurements of the thermal conductance of self-assembled
   monolayer (SAM) junctions formed between metal leads (Au, Ag, Pt, and
   Pd) with mismatched phonon spectra. The thermal conductance obtained
   from frequency domain thermoreflectance experiments is 65 +/- 7 MW/m(2)
   K for matched Au-alkanedithiolAu junctions, while the mismatched
   Au-alkanedithiolPd junctions yield a thermal conductance of 36 +/- 3
   MW/m(2) K. The experimental observation that junction thermal
   conductance (per molecule) decreases as the mismatch between the lead
   vibrational spectra increases, paired with results from molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations, suggest that phonons scatter elastically at
   the metalSAM interfaces. Furthermore, we resolve a known discrepancy
   between measurements and MD predictions of SAM thermal conductance by
   using a contact mechanics model to predict 54 +/- 15\% areal contact in
   the Au-alkanedithiolAu experimental junction. This incomplete contact
   obscures the actual junction thermal conductance of 115 +/- 22 MW/m(2)
   K, which is comparable to that of metaldielectric interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between alloy catalyst activity and valence band
   electronic structure has been investigated experimentally across a
   broad, continuous span of CuxPd1-x composition space. CuxPd1-x
   composition spread alloy films (CSAFs) were used as catalyst libraries
   with a 100 channel microreactor to measure the H-2-D-2 exchange kinetics
   over a temperature range of 333-593 K at 100 discrete CuxPd1-x
   compositions spanning the range x = 0.30-0.97. The H-2-D-2 exchange
   activity exhibits a monotonic decrease over the composition range x =
   0.30-0.97. A steady state, microkinetic model was used to estimate the
   energy barriers to dissociative H-2 adsorption, Delta E-ads(double
   dagger), and recombinative H-2 desorption, Delta E-des(double dagger),
   as functions of alloy composition, x. Their values fall in the ranges
   Delta E-ads(double dagger)(x) = 0.15 to 0.45 eV and Delta E-des(double
   dagger) (x) = 0.55-0.65 eV. Spatially resolved UV photoemission spectra
   were obtained from the CuxPd1-x CSAF and used to estimate the average
   energy of the filled states of the valence band as a function of alloy
   composition, epsilon(v)(x). The energy of the v-band center shifted
   monotonically from epsilon(v) = -3.3 to -3.9 eV across the composition
   range x = 0.30-0.97. This monotonic shift and its magnitude were
   corroborated by DFT calculations. The correlation of Delta E-ads(double
   dagger)(x) with epsilon(v)(x) across alloy composition space yields
   Delta E-ads(double dagger)(epsilon(v)) which decreases as the v-band
   energy shifts toward the Fermi level.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of cryogenic energy storage (CES) is to store energy in the
   form of liquid gas and vaporize it when needed to drive a turbine.
   Although CES on an industrial scale is a relatively new approach, the
   technology is well known and essentially part of any air separation unit
   that utilizes cryogenic separation. In this work, the operational
   benefits of adding CES to an existing air separation plant are assessed.
   Three new potential opportunities are investigated: (1) increasing the
   plant's flexibility for load shifting, (2) storing purchased energy and
   selling it back to the market during higher-price periods, and (3)
   creating additional revenue by providing operating reserve capacity. A
   mixed-integer linear programming scheduling model is developed and a
   robust optimization approach is applied to model the uncertainty in
   reserve demand. The proposed model is applied to an industrial case
   study, which shows significant potential economic benefits. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{IEEE 802.11p-based Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is
   considered a promising wireless technology for enhancing transportation
   safety and improving highway efficiency. One major challenge of IEEE
   802.11p technology development ensuring its communication reliability in
   highly dynamic Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) environments. In this paper, by
   investigating the characteristics of V2V channels through empirical
   measurements, we show that the decreased reliability of V2V
   communication is because the IEEE 802.11p design does not have
   sufficient number of training symbols in time domain and pilot
   subcarriers in frequency domain to enable estimation of the
   fast-changing V2V channels accurately. To tackle this challenge, we
   propose a new approach called Tentpoles scheme, which utilizes a small
   subset of data symbols and subcarriers protected by a strong Error
   Correction Code (ECC) to track and estimate V2V channel variations.
   Since this subset of data symbols and subcarriers provide dual-use, our
   Tentpoles scheme not only improves the accuracy of channel estimation
   and communication reliability, but has only a small impact on effective
   throughput. Through extensive simulations in synthetic V2V channels and
   emulation experiments using empirical measurements, our proposed
   Tentpoles scheme is shown to significantly outperform other V2V channel
   estimation and equalization methods in terms of communication
   reliability, at the cost of only moderate loss of throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the feasibility of a computed tomography (CT) guided
   renal endoarterial ablation procedure.
   Materials and Methods: Five large (40-60 kg) pigs were studied,
   Abdominal CT images that were Obtained preoperatively were registered to
   the operative field, and subsequent virtual navigation of a
   multielectrode ablation catheter within the CT environment was
   performed. The ablation electrodes were visualized using an impedance
   technique, Ablation lesions were applied within each artery. Histologic
   analysis was performed to judge accuracy of the catheter location as
   portrayed in the. virtual image.
   Results: The error between virtual and actual lesion locations along the
   longitudinal plane of the artery was 3.0 mm +/- 2.5 (range, 0-6 mm) in
   the left renal artery and 3.4 mm +/- 2.7 (range, 0-7 mm; P = .7) in the
   right renal artery. The accuracy of circumferential localization of the
   electrode was 92\% in the right artery and 88\% in the left artety.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate that a CT-guided renal artery
   ablation procedure is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{A cluster tool which is widely used for wafer fabrication processes
   consists of several processing modules (PMs), a transport robot,
   loadlocks, and an equipment front-end module (EFEM) in which a wafer
   cassette is loaded and unloaded. A wafer cassette with 25 identical
   wafers is transported by an overhead hoist transfer (OHT) between
   cluster tools and stored in a stocker when the corresponding tool is not
   available. Due to a large number of tools and wafer cassettes in a fab,
   it is extremely complicated to operate OHTs so as to minimize the idle
   times of the tools. Therefore, fabs tend to reduce the transportation
   tasks by arranging tools in a line with a buffer. In this paper, we
   introduce a new system called in-line multiple cluster tools which have
   many challenging operation issues for researchers and propose simple and
   practical methods to operate the system. We first develop mixed integer
   programming models to assign wafers to parallel PMs and derive a
   priority rule-based scheduling policy for the EFEM operation while
   minimizing the makespan of producing 25 wafers. We also propose
   multimode operation in which a component tool in the system processes
   multiple wafer types at the same time to improve the utilization rate of
   the tool.}},

Title = {{The influence of surgical correction on white matter microstructural
   integrity in rabbits with familial coronal suture craniosynostosis}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the
   calvarial sutures fuses prematurely. In addition to the cosmetic
   ramifications attributable to premature suture fusion, aberrations in
   neurophysiological parameters are seen, which may result in more
   significant damage. This work examines the microstructural integrity of
   white matter, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a homogeneous
   strain of rabbits with simple, familial coronal suture synostosis before
   and after surgical correction.
   METHODS After diagnosis, rabbits were assigned to different groups:
   wild-type (WT), rabbits with early-onset complete fusion of the coronal
   suture (BC), and rabbits that had undergone surgical correction with
   suturectomy (BC-SU) at 10 days of age. Fixed rabbit heads were imaged at
   12, 25, or 42 days of life using a 4.7-T, 40-cm bore Avance scanner with
   a 7.2-cm radiofrequency coil. For DTI, a 3D spin echo sequence was used
   with a diffusion gradient (b = 2000 sec/mm(2)) applied in 6 directions.
   RESULTS As age increased from 12 to 42 days, the DTI differences between
   WT and BC groups became more pronounced (p < 0.05, 1-way ANOVA),
   especially in the corpus callosum, cingulum, and fimbriae. Suturectomy
   resulted in rabbits with no significant differences compared with WT
   animals, as assessed by DTI of white matter tracts. Also, it was
   possible to predict to which group an animal belonged (WT, BC, and
   BC-SU) with high accuracy based on imaging data alone using a linear
   support vector machine classifier. The ability to predict to which group
   the animal belonged improved as the age of the animal increased (71\%
   accurate at 12 days and 100\% accurate at 42 days).
   CONCLUSIONS Craniosynostosis results in characteristic changes of major
   white matter tracts, with differences becoming more apparent as the age
   of the rabbits increases. Early suturectomy (at 10 days of life) appears
   to mitigate these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical compliance is a critical attribute for organic semiconductors
   in flexible, stretchable, mechanically robust, and biologically
   integrated electronics. This paper substantially develops the
   observation that a small change in the length of the alkyl side chain of
   regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene)s has a dramatic effect on the
   interplay between their mechanical and charge-transport properties.
   Specifically, the thermal, mechanical, and charge-transport properties
   of poly(3-heptylthiophene) (P3HpT, n = 7), which we found to be an
   unusual example of a stretchable semiconducting thermoplastic, are
   described in comparison to those of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, n = 6)
   and poly(3octylthiophene) (P3OT, n= 8). Neat P3HpT was found to have
   mechanical properties similar to that of P3 OT, and when mixed in 1:1
   blends with the fullerene {[}6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester
   (PCBM), exhibited electronic properties comparable to P3 HI. However,
   the charge-carrier mobility of neat P3HpT is substantially inferior to
   that of P3HT; the good performance of P3HpT-based solar cells is the
   result of improved mobility in P3HpT:PCBM blends compared to the neat
   material. While P3HpT may be a favorable alternative to P31-IT in
   ultra-flexible, stretchable, and mechanically robust organic solar
   cells, P3HpT would only make a good field-effect transistor in
   situations in which mechanical compliance was more important than high
   mobility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness of force
   augmentation in haptic perception tasks.
   Background: Considerable engineering effort has been devoted to
   developing force augmented reality (AR) systems to assist users in
   delicate procedures like microsurgery. In contrast, far less has been
   done to characterize the behavioral outcomes of these systems, and no
   research has systematically examined the impact of sensory and
   perceptual processes on force augmentation effectiveness.
   Method: Using a handheld force magnifier as an exemplar haptic AR, we
   conducted three experiments to characterize its utility in the
   perception of force and stiffness. Experiments 1 and 2 measured,
   respectively, the user's ability to detect and differentiate weak force
   (<0.5 N) with or without the assistance of the device and compared it to
   direct perception. Experiment 3 examined the perception of stiffness
   through the force augmentation.
   Results: The user's ability to detect and differentiate small forces was
   significantly improved by augmentation at both threshold and
   suprathreshold levels. The augmentation also enhanced stiffness
   perception. However, although perception of augmented forces matches
   that of the physical equivalent for weak forces, it falls off with
   increasing intensity.
   Conclusion: The loss in the effectiveness reflects the nature of sensory
   and perceptual processing. Such perceptual limitations should be taken
   into consideration in the design and development of haptic AR systems to
   maximize utility.
   Application: The findings provide useful information for building
   effective haptic AR systems, particularly for use in microsurgery.}},

Abstract = {{Sample locations for large river studies affect the representativeness

   2012. The sampling plans cover the same 145 km of river but differ in
   frequency, sample location and type (e.g., river water sample vs
   drinking water plant intake sample). Differences resulting from temporal
   and spatial variability in sampling lead to different conclusions
   regarding water quality in the river (including regulatory listing
   decisions), especially when low flow leads to concentrations at or near
   the water quality criteria (500 mg/L TDS). Drinking water samples
   exceeded the criteria 82 out of 650 samples (12.6\%), while river water
   samples exceeded the criteria 47 out of 464 samples (10.1\%). Different
   water sample types could provide different pictures of water quality in
   the river and lead to different regulatory listing decisions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Neutron reflection (NR) from planar interfaces is an emerging technology
   that provides unique and otherwise inaccessible structural information
   on disordered molecular systems such as membrane proteins associated
   with fluid bilayers, thus addressing one of the remaining challenges of
   structural biology. Although intrinsically a low-resolution technique,
   using structural information from crystallography or NMR allows the
   construction of NR models that describe the architecture of
   protein-membrane complexes at high resolution. In addition, a
   combination of these methods with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   has the potential to reveal the dynamics of protein interactions with
   the bilayer in atomistic detail. We review recent advances in this area
   by discussing the application of these techniques to the complex formed
   by the PTEN phosphatase with the plasma membrane. These studies provide
   insights in the cellular regulation of PTEN, its interaction with
   PI(4,5)P-2 in the inner plasma membrane and the pathway by which its
   substrate, PI(3,4,5)P-3, accesses the PTEN catalytic site. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Technical tools and techno-centric methods used for energy resource
   management and policy planning and development can miss important social
   and cultural factors. This can in turn result in a failure to recognize
   potential barriers and opportunities for energy and resource development
   in culturally diverse communities. Given the complexity of
   socio-technical energy systems, multidisciplinary analysis approaches
   are needed to ensure that modeling exercises more accurately represent
   real phenomena and outcomes of value. This paper describes the results
   of a public elicitation effort to gather information about stakeholder
   views and concerns related to energy development in the Navajo Nation,
   the largest American Indian group in the United States. Our results show
   that the potential for economic gain from energy resource development
   does not alleviate concern about environmental impacts, despite high
   poverty and unemployment on the reservation. Participants placed
   significant importance on environmental preservation, not only for the
   viability of future generations, but also for transmission of culture
   and identity that supports stewardship of the environment. Future work
   will use the results of this project to develop a survey that can be
   more broadly deployed across the Navajo Nation, and to develop a
   decision-support tool that links techno-economic energy models with
   socio-cultural attributes. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a systematic methodology and corresponding tools
   to support the decision-making process for the integration of various

   processes. The proposed methodology was applied on a case study focusing
   on planning the capacity supply to meet the projected electricity demand
   for the fleet of electric generating stations owned and operated by
   Ontario Power Generation (OPG). A deterministic mixed integer linear
   program with a goal to minimize total annualized costs while satisfying
   various CO2 emission constraints was developed. The results show that
   achieving the CO2 emission mitigation goal while minimizing costs
   affects the configuration of the OPG fleet in terms of generation mix,
   capacity, selection of new technologies and optimal configuration with
   and without new technologies. By using new technologies including
   integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and natural gas combined
   cycle (NGCC) with and without carbon capture and sequestration, the
   optimum electricity cost obtained was 1.1661 c/KW h at base caseload

Abstract = {{Whole-body-contact sensing will be crucial in the quest to make robots
   capable of safe interaction with humans. This paper describes a novel
   design and a fabrication method of artificial tactile sensing skin for
   robots. The manufacturing method described in this paper allows easy
   filling of a complex microchannel network with a liquid conductor (e.g.,
   room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)). The proposed sensing skin can
   detect the magnitude and location of surface contacts using electrical
   impedance tomography (EIT), an imaging technique mostly used in the
   medical field and examined recently in conjunction with sensors based on
   a piezoresistive polymer sheet for robotic applications. Unlike
   piezoresistive polymers, our IL-filled artificial skin changes its
   impedance in a more predictable manner, since the measured value is
   determined by a simple function of the microchannel geometry only,
   rather than complex physical phenomena. As a proof of concept, we
   demonstrate that our EIT artificial skin can detect surface contacts and
   graphically show their magnitudes and locations.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CM) have many
   potential applications in disease modelling and drug target discovery
   but their phenotypic similarity to early fetal stages of cardiac
   development limits their applicability. In this study we compared
   contraction stresses of hPSC-CM to 2nd trimester human fetal derived
   cardiomyocytes (hFetal-CM) by imaging displacement of fluorescent beads
   by single contracting hPSC-CM, aligned by microcontact-printing on
   polyacrylamide gels. hPSC-CM showed distinctly lower contraction stress
   than cardiomyocytes isolated from hFetal-CM. To improve maturation of
   hPSC-CM in vitro we made use of commercial media optimized for
   cardiomyocyte maturation, which promoted significantly higher
   contraction stress in hPSC-compared with hFetal-CM. Accordingly, other
   features of cardiomyocyte maturation were observed, most strikingly
   increased upstroke velocities and action potential amplitudes, lower
   resting membrane potentials, improved sarcomeric organization and
   alterations in cardiac-specific gene expression. Performing contraction
   force and electrophysiology measurements on individual cardiomyocytes
   revealed strong correlations between an increase in contraction force
   and a rise of the upstroke velocity and action potential amplitude and
   with a decrease in the resting membrane potential.
   We showed that under standard differentiation conditions hPSC-CM display
   lower contractile force than primary hFetal-CM and identified conditions
   under which a commercially available culture medium could induce
   molecular, morphological and functional maturation of hPSC-CM in vitro.
   These results are an important contribution for full implementation of
   hPSC-CM in cardiac disease modelling and drug discovery. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Marcellus Shale development is occurring rapidly and relatively
   unconstrained across Pennsylvania (PA). Through 2013, over 7400
   unconventional wells had been drilled in the Commonwealth. Well pads,
   access roads, and gathering lines fragment forestland resulting in
   irreversible alterations to the forest ecosystem. Changes in forest
   quantity, composition, and structural pattern can result in increased
   predation, brood parasitism, altered light, wind, and noise intensity,
   and spread of invasive species. These fragmentation effects pose a risk
   to PA's rich biodiversity. This study projects the structure of future
   alternative pathways for Marcellus shale development and quantifies the
   potential ecological impact of future drilling using a core forest
   region of Bradford County, PA. Modeling presented here suggests that
   future development could cause the level of fragmentation in the study
   area to more than double throughout the lifetime of gas development.
   Specifically, gathering lines are responsible for approximately 94\% of
   the incremental fragmentation in the core forest study region. However,
   by requiring gathering lines to follow pre-existing road routes in
   forested regions, shale resources can be exploited to their full
   potential, while essentially preventing any further fragmentation from
   occurring across the core forested landscape of Bradford County. In the
   study region, assuming an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 1-3
   billion cubic feet (Bcf) per well, this policy could be implemented for
   a minimal incremental economic investment of approximately
   \$0.005-\$0.02 per Mcf of natural gas produced over the modeled
   traditional gathering line development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   degradation in ohmic switch contacts}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{48-55}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{As scaling of silicon-based metal oxide semiconductor field effect
   transistor approaches its limits, the ohmic switch has recently been
   regarded as a viable alternative or complementary technology. However,
   the electrical contacts in these devices are prone to contamination from
   ambient hydrocarbons that reduces signal transmission through the
   switch. In this work we report how two key parameters, electrical
   current and temperature, affect contaminant-induced degradation
   mechanisms. It is shown that passing electrical current through the
   contacts significantly increases contamination growth but also increases
   its conductivity. We also demonstrate that increasing the ambient
   temperature delays and reduces the rate of contamination growth. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new set of speech features called
   Locally-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (LNCC) that are based on
   Seneff's Generalized Synchrony Detector (GSD). First, an analysis of the
   GSD frequency response is provided to show that it generates spurious
   peaks at harmonics of the detected frequency. Then, the GSD frequency
   response is modeled as a quotient of two filters centered at the
   detected frequency. The numerator is a triangular band pass filter
   centered around a particular frequency similar to the ordinary Mel
   filters. The denominator term is a filter that responds maximally to
   frequency components on either side of the numerator filter. As a
   result, a local normalization is performed without the spurious peaks of
   the original GSD. Speaker verification results demonstrate that the
   proposed LNCC features are of low computational complexity and far more
   effectively compensate for spectral tilt than ordinary MFCC
   coefficients. LNCC features do not require the computation and storage
   of a moving average of the feature values, and they provide relative
   reductions in Equal Error Rate (EER) as high as 47.7\%, 34.0\% or 25.8\%
   when compared with MFCC, MFCC + CMN, or MFCC + RASTA in one case of
   variable spectral tilt, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose a model-based optimization approach for the integration of
   production scheduling and dynamic process operation for general
   continuous/batch processes. The method introduces a discrete time
   formulation for simultaneous optimization of scheduling arid operating
   decisions. The process is described by the resource task network (RTN)
   representation coupled with detailed first-principles process dynamic
   models. General cbmplications in Scheduling and control can be fully
   represented in this modeling framework, such as customer orders,
   transfer policies, and requirements on product quality and process
   safety. The scheduling and operation layers are linked with the task
   history state variables in the state space RTN model: A tailored
   generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) algorithm is applied to
   efficiently solve the resulting large nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear
   program by exploring the particular model structure. We apply the
   integrated optimization approach to a polymerization process with two
   parallel semibatch reactors and continuous storage and purification
   units. The two polymerization reactors share cooling utility from the
   same source, and the utility price is dependent on the consumption rate.
   The optimization objective is to design the process schedule and reactor
   control policies simultaneously to maximize the overall process profit.
   The case study results suggest improvements in plant profitability for
   the integrated approach, in contrast to the typical sequential approach,
   where recipes of the polymerization tasks are individually optimized but
   the interactions among process units are overlooked.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we optimize the simultaneous production of biodiesel
   (fatty acid ethyl esters, FAEE) and ethanol from switchgrass. Two
   technologies are considered for switchgrass pretreatment: dilute acid
   and ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX). Next, enzymatic hydrolysiS followS
   any of the pretreaments to obtain fermentable sugars, mainly xylose and
   glucose. We separate the lignin, and, with the sugars, we consider the
   production of bioethanol and/or FAEE. Based on a superstructure of
   alternatives, the problem is formulated as an mixed-integer nonlinear
   program (MINLP) with simultaneous optimization and heat integration. An
   economic evaluation is performed and water consumption is calculated.
   The simultaneous production of bio ethanol and FAEE from switchgrass is
   shown not to be competitive at the current development of the conversion
   of sugars to FAEE, but it can become promising if the conversion from
   sugar exceeds 0.5. The optimal solution indicates bioethanol to be the
   preferred product because of its higher yield.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous and nanocrystalline soft magnets have been investigated
   extensively in the past two decades. Many materials with attractive soft
   magnetic properties contain boron, which improves the glass formability,
   thermal stability and prevents undesirable grain growth. The high price
   of boron, however, makes the development of new soft magnetic materials
   and alternative synthesis routes important. We report here a synthesis
   of cobalt-rich alloys by substituting boron carbide for elemental boron
   to achieve significantly lower cost. Ribbons produced with and without
   boron carbide substitution were observed to exhibit comparable soft
   magnetic properties while the former results in 31-48\% cost reduction.
   Extrapolating this idea to commercial VITROVAC 6025 and 6150, the cost
   reductions were calculated to be 56 and 50\%, respectively, while both
   synthesis routes produced ribbons of similar soft magnetic properties.
   Our work here provides an attractive route to reduce the cost and
   increase the market competitiveness of soft magnets.}},

Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing, a mature post-combustion carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) technology, could increase ambient concentrations of fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5) due to its ammonia emissions. To capture 2.0
   Gt CO2/year, for example, it could emit 32 Gg NH3/year in the United
   States given current design targets or 15 times higher (480 Gg NH3/year)
   at rates typical of current pilot plants. Employing a chemical transport
   model, we found that the latter emission rate would cause an increase of
   2.0 mu g PM2.5/m(3) in nonattainment areas during wintertime, which
   would be troublesome for PM2.5-burdened areas, and much lower increases
   during other seasons. Wintertime PM2.5 increases in nonattainment areas
   were fairly linear at a rate of 3.4 mu g PM2.5/m(3) per 1 Tg NH3,
   allowing these results to be applied to other CCS emissions scenarios.
   The PM2.5 impacts are modestly uncertain (+/- 20\%) depending on future
   emissions of SO2, NOx, and NH3. The public health costs of CCS NH3
   emissions were valued at \$31+68 per tonne CO2 captured, comparable to
   the social cost of carbon itself. Because the costs of solvent loss to
   CCS operators are lower than the social costs of CCS ammonia, there is a
   regulatory interest to limit ammonia emissions from CCS.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are important targets for cancer biology
   studies. To further elucidate the role of CTCs in cancer metastasis and
   prognosis, effective methods for isolating extremely rare tumor cells
   from peripheral blood must be developed. Acoustic-based methods, which
   are known to preserve the integrity, functionality, and viability of
   biological cells using label-free and contact-free sorting, have thus
   far not been successfully developed to isolate rare CTCs using clinical
   samples from cancer patients owing to technical constraints,
   insufficient throughput, and lack of long-term device stability. In this
   work, we demonstrate the development of an acoustic-based microfluidic
   device that is capable of high-throughput separation of CTCs from
   peripheral blood samples obtained from cancer patients. Our method uses
   tilted-angle standing surface acoustic waves. Parametric numerical
   simulations were performed to design optimum device geometry, tilt
   angle, and cell throughput that is more than 20 times higher than
   previously possible for such devices. We first validated the capability
   of this device by successfully separating low concentrations (similar to
   100 cells/mL) of a variety of cancer cells from cell culture lines from
   WBCs with a recovery rate better than 83\%. We then demonstrated the
   isolation of CTCs in blood samples obtained from patients with breast
   cancer. Our acoustic-based separation method thus offers the potential
   to serve as an invaluable supplemental tool in cancer research,
   diagnostics, drug efficacy assessment, and therapeutics owing to its
   excellent biocompatibility, simple design, and label-free automated
   operation while offering the capability to isolate rare CTCs in a viable
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Atomistic simulations using the embedded atom method were employed to
   compute the energies of 408 distinct grain boundaries in bcc Fe and Mo.
   This set includes grain boundaries that have tilt, twist, and mixed
   character and coincidence site lattices ranging from Sigma 3 to Sigma
   323. The results show that grain boundary energies in Fe and Mo are
   influenced more by the grain boundary plane orientation than by the
   lattice misorientation or lattice coincidence. Furthermore, grain
   boundaries with (110) planes on both sides of the boundary have low
   energies, regardless of the misorientation angle or geometric character.
   Grain boundaries of the same type in Fe and Mo have strongly correlated
   energies that scale with the ratio of the cohesive energies of the two
   metals. (c) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aerosol-OT (AOT) and Tween 80 are two of the main surfactants in
   commercial dispersants used in response to oil spills. Understanding how
   multicomponent surfactant systems interact at oil/aqueous interfaces is
   crucial for improving both dispersant design and application efficacy.
   This is true of many multicomponent formulations; a lack of
   understanding of competition for the oil/water interface hinders
   formulation optimization. In this study, we have characterized the
   sequential adsorption behavior of AOT on squalane/aqueous interfaces
   that have been precoated with Tween 80. A microtensiometer is used to
   measure the dynamic interfacial tension of the system. Tween 80 either
   partially or completely irreversibly adsorbs to squalane/aqueous
   interfaces when rinsed with deionized water. These Tween 80 coated
   interfaces are then exposed to AOT. AOT adsorption increases with AOT
   concentration for all Tween 80 coverages, and the resulting steady-state
   interfacial tension values are interpreted using a Langmuir isotherm
   model. In the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, AOT adsorption significantly
   increases due to counterion charge screening of the negatively charged
   head groups. The presence of Tween 80 on the interface inhibits AOT
   adsorption, reducing the maximum surface coverage as compared to a clean
   interface. Tween 80 persists on the interface even after exposure to
   high concentrations of AOT.}},

   coefficients, kact, for monomer-free model systems. In weakly polar
   solvents such as esters, ketones, and substituted benzenes, kact was

Abstract = {{We validate the usage of the calculated, linear response Hubbard U for
   evaluating accurate electronic and chemical properties of bulk 3d
   transition metal oxides. We find calculated values of U lead to improved
   band gaps. For the evaluation of accurate reaction energies, we first
   identify and eliminate contributions to the reaction energies of bulk
   systems due only to changes in U and construct a thermodynamic cycle
   that references the total energies of unique U systems to a common point
   using a DFT + U(V) method, which we recast from a recently introduced
   DFT + U(R) method for molecular systems. We then introduce a
   semi-empirical method based on weighted DFT/DFT + U cohesive energies to
   calculate bulk oxidation energies of transition metal oxides using
   density functional theory and linear response calculated U values. We
   validate this method by calculating 14 reactions energies involving V,
   Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co oxides. We find up to an 85\% reduction of the mean
   average error (MAE) compared to energies calculated with the
   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. When our method is compared with DFT
   + U with empirically derived U values and the HSE06 hybrid functional,
   we find up to 65\% and 39\% reductions in the MAE, respectively. (C)

Title = {{Innovation by patients with rare diseases and chronic needs}},
Journal = {{ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{We provide the first empirical exploration of disease-related innovation
   by patients and their caregivers. Our aims were to explore to what
   degree do patients develop innovative solutions; how many of these are
   unique developments; and do these solutions have positive perceived
   impact on the patients' overall quality of life? In addition, we
   explored the factors associated with patient innovation development, and
   sharing of the solutions that the patients developed.
   Methods: We administered a questionnaire via telephone interviewing to a
   sample of 500 rare disease patients and caregivers. The solutions
   reported were pre-screened by the authors for their fit with the
   self-developed innovation aim of the study. All the reported solutions
   were then validated for their novelty by two medical professionals.
   Logistic regression models were used to test the relationships between
   our key variables, patient innovation and solution sharing.
   Results: 263 (53\%) of our survey respondents reported developing and
   using a solution to improve management of their diseases. An initial
   screening removed 81 (16\%) solutions for being an obvious misfit to the
   self-developed innovation aim of the study. This lowered the sample of
   potentially innovative solutions to 182 (36\%). Assessment of novelty
   and usefulness of the solutions, conducted by two medical evaluators,
   confirmed that 40 solutions (8\%) were indeed novel, while the remaining
   142 (28\%) were already known to medicine. The likelihood of patient
   innovation increased as the education level increased (OR 2, p < 0.05),
   and as their perception of limitations imposed by their disease
   increased (OR 1.3, p < 0.05). 55 individuals diffused their solutions to
   some degree, with 50 of these sharing via direct diffusion to other
   patients. There is a positive relationship between the impact of a
   solution on the respondents' overall quality of life and likelihood of
   solution sharing.
   Conclusions: Given that hundreds of millions of people worldwide are
   afflicted by rare diseases, patient and their caregivers can be a
   tremendous source of innovation for many who are similarly afflicted.
   Our findings suggest that many patients could be greatly assisted by
   improved diffusion of known solutions and best practices to and among
   patients and their caregivers.}},

Abstract = {{Most behavioral decision research takes place in carefully controlled

   reported on the Decision Outcomes Inventory (DOI). The DOI score
   reflects avoidance of outcomes that could result from poor decisions,
   ranging from serious (e.g., bankruptcy) to minor (e.g., blisters from
   sunburn). The present analyses go beyond the initial work, which focused
   on the overall DOI score, by analyzing the relationships between
   specific decision outcomes and A-DMC performance. Most outcomes are
   significantly more likely among people with lower A-DMC scores, even
   after taking into account two variables expected to produce worse
   real-world decision outcomes: younger age and lower socio-economic
   status. We discuss the usefulness of DOI as a measure of successful

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{495}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{We prepared a series of Pd catalysts for total oxidation of methane on
   different supports: Al2O3, ZrO2-CeO2 and CeO2. We characterized the
   catalysts' structures by XRD and their surface chemistries by
   temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and oxidation (TPO); and measured
   their activities for methane oxidation in temperature programmed
   reaction experiments (TPRx). By fitting a kinetic model to the TPRx
   results, we extracted apparent activation barriers (E-app) and
   pre-exponents (A(app)) for methane oxidation over each of the catalysts.
   Activity correlates strongly with Aapp, which we interpret as a relative
   measure of the density of PdO-Pd{*} ({*} is an O-vacancy) site pairs.
   TPR results support this view: PdO in low activity (low A(app))
   catalysts, such as Pd/CeO2, is relatively resistant to reduction,
   meaning that formation of the Pd{*} partner of the site pair is
   difficult and the number of site pairs that can form is low. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nanoscale thermal transport has attracted considerable attention because
   of both fundamental scientific interest and important engineering

   dominated by phonons, whose behavior at surfaces and interfaces plays a

   present opinions on phonon dynamics at surfaces and interfaces and the
   implications on nanoscale thermal transport. The effects of roughness,
   bonding strength, coherence, and nanoscale constrictions are discussed.
   The existence of two specularity parameters at an interface (separate
   values for transmitted and reflected phonons) and the implications of
   phonon reflection at free surfaces to the thermal conductance of nearby
   interfaces are two concepts that have not been previously discussed in
   the literature. We provide some outlook and potential topics for future

Abstract = {{The development of high-capacity rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries requires
   the identification of stable solvents that can promote a solution based
   discharge mechanism, which has been shown to result in higher discharge
   capacities. Solution driven discharge product growth requires
   dissolution of the adsorbed intermediate LiO2{*}, thus generating
   solvated Li+ and O-2(-) ions. Such a mechanism is possible in solvents
   with high Gutmann donor or acceptor numbers. However, O-2(-) is a strong
   nucleophile and is known to attack solvents via proton/hydrogen
   abstraction or substitution. This kind of a parasitic process is
   extremely detrimental to the battery's rechargeability. In this work, we
   develop a thermodynamic model to describe these two effects and
   demonstrate an anticorrelation between solvents' stability and their
   ability to enhance capacity via solution mediated discharge product
   growth. We analyze the commonly used solvents in the same framework and
   describe why solvents that can promote higher discharge capacity are
   also prone to degradation. Solvating additives for practical Li-O-2
   batteries will have to be outliers to this observed anticorrelation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyze moving front dynamics of ions and
   holes in a planar, mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymer film. As
   cations invade the film, holes evacuate; thus, an ionic current is
   converted to an electronic signal. Recent experiments show that the
   location of the advancing ion front increases as the square-root of
   time, a scaling typically associated with diffusive transport, which is
   surprising given the large driving voltages utilized. Ionic and
   electronic transport is modeled via the drift-diffusion equations. A
   similarity transformation reduces the governing partial differential
   equations to ordinary differential equations that are solved
   numerically. The similarity transformation elucidates the origin of the
   square-root-of-time front scaling. The similarity solution is then
   compared to the numerical solution of the full drift-diffusion
   equations, finding excellent agreement. When compared with experimental
   data, our model captures the front location; however, qualitative
   differences between the ion profiles are observed. (C) 2015 American

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In complex systems with stochastic components, systems laws often emerge
   that describe higher level behavior regardless of lower level component
   configurations. In this paper, emergent laws for describing
   mechanochemical systems are investigated for processive myosin-actin
   motility systems. On the basis of prior experimental evidence that
   longer processive lifetimes are enabled by larger myosin ensembles, it
   is hypothesized that emergent scaling laws could coincide with
   myosin-actin contact probability or system energy consumption. Because
   processivity is difficult to predict analytically and measure
   experimentally, agent-based computational techniques are developed to
   simulate processive myosin ensembles and produce novel processive
   lifetime measurements. It is demonstrated that only systems energy
   relationships hold regardless of isoform configurations or ensemble
   size, and a unified expression for predicting processive lifetime is
   revealed. The finding of such laws provides insight for how patterns
   emerge in stochastic mechanochemical systems, while also informing
   understanding and engineering of complex biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional polymer nanocomposites that simultaneously possess high
   modulus and strength, high thermal stability, novel optical responses,
   and high electrical and thermal conductivity have been actively
   researched. Carbon nanotubes are considered an ideal additive for
   composites because of their superlative physical, electronic and optical
   properties. While nanotubes have successfully added electrical
   conductivity, thermal stability, and novel optical responses to
   polymers, mechanical reinforcements, although substantial, have been
   well below any theoretical estimations. Here, we integrated preformed
   hydrogels and aerogels of individually dispersed nanotubes with polymer
   to increase elastic modulus of composites according to Halpin-Tsai model
   up to at least 25 vol \% of nanotubes. Our solution-based fabrication
   method allowed us to create bulk composites with tunable form-factors,
   and with polymers that were incompatible with nanotubes. Further, in
   this approach, nanotubes were not covalently linked among themselves and
   to the polymer, so intrinsic optical, electrical, and thermal properties
   of nanotubes could be exploited. The optically active nanotubes, for
   example, added a strain-dependent, spatially resolved fluorescence to
   these composites. Finally, the nanoporous nanotube networks suppressed
   the polymer glass transition and extended the mechanical integrity of
   polymer well above its polymer melting point, and both the nanotubes and
   polymer remained thermally stable above their decomposition
   temperatures.}},

Title = {{Calculation of grain boundary normals directly from 3D microstructure
   images}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The determination of grain boundary normals is an integral part of the
   characterization of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. These
   normal vectors are difficult to quantify due to the discretized nature
   of available microstructure characterization techniques. The most common
   method to determine grain boundary normals is by generating a surface
   mesh from an image of the microstructure, but this process can be slow,
   and is subject to smoothing issues. A new technique is proposed,
   utilizing first order Cartesian moments of binary indicator functions,
   to determine grain boundary normals directly from a voxelized
   microstructure image. To validate the accuracy of this technique, the
   surface normals obtained by the proposed method are compared to those
   generated by a surface meshing algorithm. Specifically, the local
   divergence between the surface normals obtained by different variants of
   the proposed technique and those generated from a surface mesh of a
   synthetic microstructure constructed using a marching cubes algorithm
   followed by Laplacian smoothing is quantified. Next, surface normals
   obtained with the proposed method from a measured 3D microstructure
   image of a Ni polycrystal are used to generate grain boundary character
   distributions (GBCD) for Sigma 3 and Sigma 9 boundaries, and compared to
   the GBCD generated using a surface mesh obtained from the same image.
   The results show that the proposed technique is an efficient and
   accurate method to determine voxelized fields of grain boundary normals.}},

Abstract = {{The total water withdrawal for U.S. industrial sectors decreased by

   production structure, and consumption pattern to changes in total water
   withdrawal for industrial sectors during the five years were
   investigated on the basis of the most recent U.S. economic input output
   and U.S. Geological Survey water withdrawal data. Changes in population
   and consumption pattern caused increases in water withdrawal, while
   changes in GDP per capita, water use intensity, and production structure
   contributed to declines in water withdrawal between 2005 and 2010. The
   change in water use intensity was the greatest contributor to the
   overall reduction in total water withdrawal during 2005-2010.}},

Abstract = {{We consider signal design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   systems with spatial multiplexing and noncoherent reception in a flat
   Rayleigh fading environment. We obtain the symbol vector error
   probability (SEP) of noncoherent detection as a function of the signal
   amplitude levels and the effective precoder matrix, which depends on the
   precoder structure and the channel transmit covariance matrix. It is
   found that at high values of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per
   symbol vector per diversity branch, the SEP tends to reach saturation.
   To obtain the best error performance, we need to find the optimal
   precoder and constellation parameters that minimize the saturation value
   of the SEP. Optimization of the saturation value of the SEP is carried
   out using the binary signal constellations \{0,1\} and \{1, -r\}, r > 1,
   two transmit antennas, a real valued transmit covariance matrix with
   equal diagonal elements, and a diagonal precoder. Results show that the
   optimal values of the parameters are almost independent of the number of
   receive antennas when the number of receive antennas is large. We also
   observe that the error performance of MIMO noncoherent reception is
   better than that of MIMO coherent reception with imperfect channel state
   information for a certain range of average SNR.}},

Abstract = {{Validating the integrity of pipes is an important task for safe natural
   gas production and many other operations (e.g. refineries, sewers,
   etc.). Indeed, there is a growing industry of actuated, actively driven
   mobile robots that are used to inspect pipes. Many rely on a remote
   operator to inspect data from a fisheye camera to perform manual
   inspection and provide no localization or mapping capability. In this
   work, we introduce a visual odometry-based system using calibrated
   fisheye imagery and sparse structured lighting to produce
   high-resolution 3D textured surface models of the inner pipe wall. Our
   work extends state-of-the-art visual odometry and mapping for fisheye
   systems to incorporate weak geometric constraints based on prior
   knowledge of the pipe components into a sparse bundle adjustment
   framework. These constraints prove essential for obtaining high-accuracy
   solutions given the limited spatial resolution of the fisheye system and
   challenging raw imagery. We show that sub-millimeter resolution modeling
   is viable even in pipes which are 400mm (16) in diameter, and that
   sparse range measurements from a structured lighting solution can be
   used to avoid the inevitable monocular scale drift. Our results show
   that practical, high-accuracy pipe mapping from a single fisheye camera
   is within reach.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between microstructure and magnetic properties of a

   analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microstructures
   of (Fe0.5Co0.5)(80)Nb4B13Ge2Cu1 nanocrystalline alloys annealed at
   different temperatures were characterized by TEM and electron
   diffraction. The magnetic structures were analyzed by Lorentz microscopy
   and off-axis electron holography, including quantitative measurement of
   domain wall width, induction, and in situ magnetic domain imaging. The
   results indicate that the magnetic domain structure and particularly the
   dynamical magnetization behavior of the alloys strongly depend on the
   microstructure of the nanocrystalline alloys. Smaller grain size and
   random orientation of the fine particles decrease the
   magneto-crystalline anisotropy and suggests better soft magnetic
   properties which may be explained by the anisotropy model of Herzer.}},

Title = {{How will we fund our roads? A case of decreasing revenue from electric
   vehicles}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{136-147}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Annual expenditures for transportation infrastructure have recently
   surpassed the funding available through tax and fee collection. One
   large source of revenue generation for transportation infrastructure is
   use fees that are charged through taxes on gasoline both on a federal
   and state level. A massive adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the
   United States would result in significantly lower gasoline consumption
   and thus reduce the revenue collected to maintain the U.S.
   transportation infrastructure. We investigate how different vehicles
   will change the annual fee collected on a marginal basis. In addition,
   we assess the effects of adoption of alternative vehicles on revenues
   using several projections of alternative vehicles adoption, both on a
   state-by-state basis and at the national level. We find that baseline
   midsize and compact vehicles such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Civic
   generate approximately \$2500-\$4000 in tax revenue over their lifetime.
   Under the current funding structure, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs)
   such as the Nissan Leaf generate substantially less at \$400-\$1300,
   while plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) such as the Chevrolet
   Volt generate \$1500-\$2700. Even in states with high lifetime fees due
   to fuel taxes, such as California, revenue generation can be upwards of
   50\% lower than in states with high registration fees such as Colorado.
   Total annual revenue generation decreases by about \$200 million by 2025
   as a result of EV adoption in our base case, but in projections with
   larger adoption of alternative vehicles could lead to revenue generation
   reductions as large as \$900 million by 2025. Potential schemes that
   charge user fees on alternative fuel vehicles to overcome the decrease
   in revenue include a flat annual registration fee at 0.6\% of the
   vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) or 22 phi per mile
   fee. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Toward Gravity-Independent Climbing Using a Biologically Inspired
   Distributed Inward Gripping Strategy}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The biologically inspired strategy of distributed inward gripping (DIG)
   is presented in this study as a method for foot attachment and adhesion
   during gravity-independent climbing. As observed in nature, this
   strategy enables climbing animals to maneuver rapidly on surfaces in any
   orientation with respect to gravity, and does not require significant
   energy expenditure for attachment or detachment. DIG is an advanced
   implementation of directional attachment mechanisms that directs
   contralateral legs to engage their cockroach-inspired prehensile spines
   by pulling inward toward the body, rather than downward opposing
   gravity. By using opposing foot forces to engage the spines, the
   dependency on gravity is removed and the experimental system designed to
   test the attachment strategy, DIGbot, is able to climb and make turns on
   both vertical and inverted mesh screen. This behavior has not been
   achieved previously by a legged system, and requires novel design and
   algorithmic features that will be discussed. The spacing in the mesh
   screen requires each foot to perform a local search for an adequate
   foothold, which mimics what has been observed in climbing insects. The
   inward gripping principle is also suited for use with microspine arrays
   and gecko-inspired dry adhesive pads that require pulling tangential to
   the surface for attachment, and ultimately will allow for rapid and
   complex maneuvers on irregular terrain.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, spacecraft requirements have trended toward smaller,
   lighter, and less expensive systems with more capabilities. At the same
   time, demands on the communication systems have increased, including
   faster data rates, lower power budgets, reduced system volume, and
   smaller link margins. The combination of these factors has posed
   numerous engineering challenges for antenna system designers, often
   forming complex tradeoffs among design parameters such as bandwidth,
   pattern control, beamwidth, and antenna size. In this paper, we show how
   a challenging set of antenna requirements were met for NASA's recent
   LADEE mission. We focus on the difficulties inherent in the requirements
   for both omnidirectional and medium gain antennas, both in S-band. We
   present techniques used to develop a requirements-compliant system based
   on our research in antenna synthesis methods. Compared to the
   conventional antennas considered by NASA for the mission, the antennas
   we developed yielded 65\% increased downlink coverage and 44\% cost
   savings for the mission. The deployed flight antennas were the only
   antennas on the mission and performed above expectations during the
   8-month mission, which concluded in April 2014.}},

Abstract = {{Mesothelioma is a form of cancer generally caused from previous exposure
   to asbestos. Although it was considered a rare neoplasm in the past, its
   incidence is increasing worldwide due to extensive use of asbestos. In
   the current practice of medicine, the gold standard for diagnosing
   mesothelioma is through a pleural biopsy with subsequent histologic
   examination of the tissue. The diagnostic tissue should demonstrate the
   invasion by the tumor and is obtained through thoracoscopy or open
   thoracotomy, both being highly invasive surgical operations. On the
   other hand, thoracocentesis, which is removal of effusion fluid from the
   pleural space, is a far less invasive procedure that can provide
   material for cytological examination. In this study, we aim at detecting
   and classifying malignant mesothelioma based on the nuclear chromatin
   distribution from digital images of mesothelial cells in effusion
   cytology specimens. Accordingly, a computerized method is developed to
   determine whether a set of nuclei belonging to a patient is benign or
   malignant. The quantification of chromatin distribution is performed by
   using the optimal transport-based linear embedding for segmented nuclei
   in combination with the modified Fisher discriminant analysis.
   Classification is then performed through a k-nearest neighborhood
   approach and a basic voting strategy. Our experiments on 34 different
   human cases result in 100\% accurate predictions computed with blind
   cross validation. Experimental comparisons also show that the new method
   can significantly outperform standard numerical feature-type methods in
   terms of agreement with the clinical diagnosis gold standard. According
   to our results, we conclude that nuclear structure of mesothelial cells
   alone may contain enough information to separate malignant mesothelioma
   from benign mesothelial proliferations. (c) 2015 International Society

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing number of sensors deployed in modern vehicles,
   intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks (IVWSNs) have recently received
   a lot of attention in the automotive industry, as they can reduce the
   amount of wiring harness inside a vehicle. By removing the wires, car
   manufacturers can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve engine
   performance, fuel economy, and reliability. In addition to these direct
   benefits, an IVWSN is a versatile platform that can support other
   vehicular applications as well. An example application, known as a side
   blind zone alert (SBZA) system, which monitors the blind zone of the
   vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent collisions,
   is discussed in this paper. The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA
   system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles.
   Our results show that the proposed system can achieve approximately
   95\%-99\% detection rate with less than 15\% false alarm rate. Compared
   with commercial systems using radars or cameras, the main benefit of the
   IVWSN-based SBZA is substantially lower cost.}},

Abstract = {{Each year, stroke and traumatic brain injury leave millions of survivors
   with motion control loss, which results in great demand for recovery
   training. The great labor intensity in traditional human-based therapies
   has recently boosted the research on rehabilitation robotics. Existing
   controllers for rehabilitative robotics cannot solve the closed-loop
   system stability with uncertain nonlinear dynamics and conflicting
   human-robot interactions. This paper presents a theoretical framework
   that establishes the passivity of the closed-loop upper-limb
   rehabilitative robotic systems and allows rigorous stability analysis of
   human-robot interaction. Position-dependent stiffness and
   position-dependent desired trajectory are employed to resolve the
   possible conflicts in motions between patient and robot. The proposed
   method also realizes the ``assist-as-needed{''} strategy. In addition,
   it handles human-robot interactions in such a way that correct movements
   are encouraged and incorrect ones are suppressed to make the training
   process more effective. While guaranteeing these properties, the
   proposed controller allows parameter adjustment to provide flexibility
   for therapists to adjust and fine tune depending on the conditions of
   the patients and the progress of their recovery. Simulation and
   experiment results are presented to illustrate the performance of the
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze possible sources of dissipation in aluminium
   nitride (AlN) contour mode resonators for three different resonance
   frequency devices (f(r)) (220 MHz, 370 MHz, and 1.05 GHz). For this
   purpose, anchors of different widths (W-a) and lengths (L-a)
   proportional to the acoustic wavelength (lambda) are designed as
   supports for resonators in which the dimensions of the vibrating body
   are kept fixed. The Q extracted experimentally confirms that anchor
   losses are the dominant source of damping for most anchor designs when
   f(r) is equal to 220 and 370 MHz. For specific anchor dimensions
   (W-a/lambda is in the range of 1/4-1/2) that mitigate energy leakage
   through the supports, a temperature-dependent dissipation mechanism
   dominates as seen in higher f(r) resonators operating close to 1.05 GHz.
   To describe the Q due to anchor losses, we use a finite-element method
   with absorbing boundary conditions. We also propose a simple analytical
   formulation for describing the dependence of the temperature-dependent
   damping mechanism on frequency. In this way, we are able to
   quantitatively predict Q due to anchor losses and qualitatively describe
   the trends observed experimentally.}},

   of Social Dynamics Using Deep Learning}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Social media exhibit rich yet distinct temporal dynamics which cover a
   wide range of different scales. In order to study this complex dynamics,
   two fundamental questions revolve around (1) the signatures of social
   dynamics at different time scales, and (2) the way in which these
   signatures interact and form higher-level meanings.
   Method
   In this paper, we propose the Recursive Convolutional Bayesian Model
   (RCBM) to address both of these fundamental questions. The key idea
   behind our approach consists of constructing a deep-learning framework
   using specialized convolution operators that are designed to exploit the
   inherent heterogeneity of social dynamics. RCBM's runtime and
   convergence properties are guaranteed by formal analyses.
   Results
   Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the
   state-of-the-art approaches both in terms of solution quality and
   computational efficiency. Indeed, by applying the proposed method on two
   social network datasets, Twitter and Yelp, we are able to identify the
   compositional structures that can accurately characterize the complex
   social dynamics from these two social media. We further show that
   identifying these patterns can enable new applications such as anomaly
   detection and improved social dynamics forecasting. Finally, our
   analysis offers new insights on understanding and engineering social
   media dynamics, with direct applications to opinion spreading and online
   content promotion.}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study we model and examine the energy efficiency profile of
   individual single-family houses from Gainesville, Florida, in our sample
   (n = 7091). For this we use Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) which
   processes historical weather data and monthly utility usage data as
   inputs using an iterative regression approach to compute three energy
   efficiency parameters: (1) baseload consumption for enduses which do not
   change with weather, e.g., lighting, refrigerator, water heater; (2)
   heating/cooling slope which is a function of the building shell
   insulation and the efficiency of the heating/cooling unit; (3) reference
   temperature, i.e., the outside temperature at which the house turns on
   heating/cooling. These parameters make up the normalized annual
   consumption (NAC). We then proceed to regress these parameters against
   the publicly available data to study the extent we can extract
   statistical insight for residential energy efficiency profiling using
   publicly available information (n = 5243). These regression models are
   to pave a path to creating energy efficiency ``reservoir maps{''} across
   individual homes and reducing the information barrier to energy
   efficiency adoption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of shear transfer in composite deck with mechanical
   fasteners}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{251-261}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete construction and steel construction are two of the
   most common contemporary construction methods. Both methods make use of
   composite decks as floor systems and diaphragms. During the design of
   composite decks, the interaction between the steel deck and concrete
   slab is typically disregarded when calculating the strength of the
   composite diaphragm due to lack of complete shear transfer, as existing
   practices such as stamping are not effective to provide substantial
   composite action. This conservative assumption essentially results in
   non-efficient use of material. This paper presents a method for ensuring
   shear transfer through the use of conventional sheet metal screws,
   driven through the corrugated steel deck and embedded in the fresh
   concrete. This method is proposed for use in the field between formed
   steel beams. Both experimental and analytical studies support an
   increase in strength with the addition of embedded fasteners. Further,
   experimental results indicate an additional increase in strength with
   the addition of synthetic reinforcing fibers. The increase in strength
   with the addition of the fasteners is on the order of 100\%. When
   fasteners are already in use, the addition of synthetic reinforcing
   fibers can increase strength on the order of 10\%. The ultimate
   deflection of enhanced deck is comparable to deck tested without
   fasteners, but the initial stiffness of enhanced deck is much higher.

Abstract = {{We consider the estimation of a scalar state based on m measurements
   that can be potentially manipulated by an adversary. The attacker is
   assumed to have full knowledge about the true value of the state to be
   estimated and about the value of all the measurements. However, the
   attacker has limited resources and can only manipulate up to l of the m
   measurements. The problem is formulated as a minimax optimization, where
   one seeks to construct an optimal estimator that minimizes the
   ``worst-case{''} expected cost against all possible manipulations by the
   attacker. We show that if the attacker can manipulate at least half the
   measurements (l >= m/2), then the optimal worst-case estimator should
   ignore all measurements and be based solely on the a-priori information.
   We provide the explicit form of the optimal estimator when the attacker
   can manipulate less than half the measurements (l < m/2), which is based
   on ((m)(2l)) local estimators. We further prove that such an estimator
   can be reduced into simpler forms for two special cases, i.e., either
   the estimator is symmetric and monotone or m = 2l + 1. Finally we apply
   the proposed methodology in the case of Gaussian measurements.}},

   interfacial tension can occur which can lead to a phenomenon called
   spontaneous emulsification. In steelmaking, this behavior has been
   observed for several reactions that involve the transfer of impurities
   from molten steel to a molten-oxide slag but little quantification has
   been made. This work focuses on spontaneous emulsification due to the
   dephosphorization of a Fe-P drop immersed in a basic oxygen furnace type
   slag. An Au-image furnace attached to a confocal scanning laser
   microscope was used to rapidly heat and cool the samples at different
   times, and X-ray computerized tomography was used to perform the surface
   area calculations of the samples where the slag/steel reaction was
   allowed to occur for distinct times. The results show that the surface
   area of the metal drop rapidly increases by over one order of magnitude
   during the first 60 seconds of the reaction while the chemical reaction
   is occurring at a fast rate. Once the reaction slows down, approximately
   after 60 seconds, the droplets start to coalesce back together
   minimizing the surface area and returning to a geometry close to its
   equilibrium shape. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Silicomanganese (SiMn) as an alloy supplies silicon and manganese to the
   steelmaking industry. It is produced through carbothermic reduction in a
   submerged arc furnace. The slag and metal are typically tapped through a
   single-level tap hole at 50 K (50 degrees C) below the process
   temperature of 1873 K to 1923 K (1600 degrees C to 1650 degrees C). In
   one tapblock refractory design configuration, the tap hole is installed
   as a carbon tapblock and rebuilt during the life of the lining using
   carbon-based cold ramming paste. The carbon tapblock lasts for a number
   of years and ramming paste only for months. The purpose of the study
   presented here was to determine to what extent chemical reactions
   between carbon-based refractory and slag or metal in the tap hole of a
   SiMn furnace can contribute to wear of tap-hole refractory. The results
   of the study are reported in two parts. In Part I, the results of
   thermodynamic calculations of the potential for chemical reaction
   between carbon-based refractory material and slag or metal are reported.
   The results were tested experimentally using pure graphite and synthetic
   SiMn slag (produced from pure oxides). The paper also reports the
   composition, microstructure, and phases of industrial SiMn slag, and
   commercially available carbon block and cold ramming paste refractory
   materials. These compositions were used in predicted equilibria of
   refractory-slag reactions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that
   reaction between SiMn slag and carbon-based tap-hole refractory is
   possible, and experiments with nominally pure materials support this.
   However, practical refractory materials are by no means pure materials,
   and contain secondary phases and porosity which can be expected to
   affect reaction with slag. Such reactions are examined in Part II. (C)

   SiC and, it appears, metal droplets. Both carbon block and ramming paste
   refractory reacted with slag, with preferential attack on and
   penetration into the binder phase rather than aggregate particles. The
   two types of carbon-based refractory materials showed similar extents of

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of information embedding where the encoder
   modifies a white Gaussian host signal in a power-constrained manner to
   encode a message, and the decoder recovers both the embedded message and
   the modified host signal. This partially extends the recent work of
   Sumszyk and Steinberg to the continuous-alphabet Gaussian setting.
   Through a control-theoretic lens, we observe that the problem is a
   minimalist example of what is called the triple role of control actions.
   We show that a dirty-paper-coding strategy achieves the optimal rate for
   perfect recovery of the modified host and the message for any message
   rate. For imperfect recovery of the modified host, by deriving bounds on
   the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in recovering the modified host
   signal, we show that Dirty-Paper Coding-based strategies are guaranteed
   to attain within a uniform constant factor of 16 of the optimal weighted
   sum of power required in host signal modification and the MMSE in the
   modified host signal reconstruction for all weights and all message
   rates. When specialized to the zero-rate case, our results provide the
   tightest known lower bounds on the asymptotic costs for the vector
   version of a famous open problem in decentralized control: the
   Witsenhausen counterexample. Numerically, this tighter bound helps us
   characterize the asymptotically optimal costs for the vector
   Witsenhausen problem to within a factor of 1.3 for all problem
   parameters, improving on the earlier best known bound of 2.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed quantitative measurements of biological filament networks
   represent a crucial step in understanding architecture and structure of
   cells and tissues, which in turn explain important biological events
   such as wound healing and cancer metastases. Microscopic images of
   biological specimens marked for different structural proteins constitute
   an important source for observing and measuring meaningful parameters of
   biological networks. Unfortunately, current efforts at quantitative
   estimation of architecture and orientation of biological filament
   networks from microscopy images are predominantly limited to visual
   estimation and indirect experimental inference. Here, we describe a new
   method for localizing and extracting filament distributions from 2D
   microscopy images of different modalities. The method combines a
   filter-based detection of pixels likely to contain a filament with a
   constrained reverse diffusion-based approach for localizing the
   filaments centrelines. We show with qualitative and quantitative
   experiments, using both simulated and real data, that the new method can
   provide more accurate centreline estimates of filament in comparison to
   other approaches currently available. In addition, we show the algorithm
   is more robust with respect to variations in the initial filter-based
   filament detection step often used. We demonstrate the application of
   the method in extracting quantitative parameters from confocal
   microscopy images of actin filaments and atomic force microscopy images
   of DNA fragments.}},

Pages = {{38-48}},

Abstract = {{We present a data-driven exploratory study to investigate whether
   trained object detectors generalize well to test images from a different
   modality. We focus on the domain of planar kinematic mechanisms, which
   can be viewed as a set of rigid bodies connected by joints, and use
   textbook graphics and images of hand-drawn sketches as input modalities.
   The goal of our algorithm is to automatically recognize the underlying
   mechanical structure shown in an input image by leveraging well-known
   computer vision methods for object recognition with the optimizing power
   of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Taking a raw image as input,
   we detect pin joints using local feature descriptors in a support vector
   machine framework. Improving upon previous work, detection confidence
   depends on multiple context-based classifiers of varying image patch
   size and greedy foreground extraction. The likelihood of rigid body
   connections is approximated using normalized geodesic time, and NSGA-II
   is used to evolve optimal mechanisms using this data. The present work
   is motivated by the observation that textbook diagrams and hand-drawn
   sketches of mechanisms exhibit similar object structure, yet have
   different visual characteristics. We apply our method using various
   combinations of images for training and testing, and the results
   demonstrate a trade-off between solvability and accuracy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Although the thrombogenic nature of the surfaces of cardiovascular
   devices is an important aspect of blood biocompatibility, few studies
   have examined platelet deposition onto opaque materials used for these
   devices in real time. This is particularly true for the metallic
   surfaces used in current ventricular assist devices (VADs). Using
   hemoglobin depleted red blood cells (RBC ghosts) and long working
   distance optics to visualize platelet deposition, we sought to perform
   such an evaluation. Fluorescently labeled platelets mixed with human RBC
   ghosts were perfused across six opaque materials (a titanium alloy
   (Ti6Al4V), silicon carbide (SiC), alumina (Al2O3),
   2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine polymer coated Ti6Al4V
   (MPC-Ti6Al4V), yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YZTP), and zirconia
   toughened alumina (ZTA)) for 5 min at wall shear rates of 400 and 1000
   s(-1). Ti6Al4V had significantly increased platelet deposition relative
   to MPC-Ti6Al4V, Al2O3, YZTP, and ZTA at both wall shear rates (p<0.01).
   For all test surfaces, increasing the wall shear rate produced a trend
   of decreased platelet adhesion. The described system can be a utilized
   as a tool for comparative analysis of candidate blood-contacting
   materials with acute blood contact. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Title = {{PdCuAu ternary alloy membranes: Hydrogen permeation properties in the
   presence of H2S}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{479}},

Abstract = {{PdCuAu ternary alloy membranes with different component compositions
   were synthesized by sequential electroless deposition of components onto
   porous stainless steel substrates. The ternary with the highest Au
   content, Pd69Cu14Au17, exhibited the highest hydrogen permeation flux,
   comparable to that of a Pd91Au9 membrane. Upon exposure to 100 ppm
   H2S/H-2 at 673 K for 24 h, all PdCuAu membranes experienced flux
   reductions of similar to 55\%, followed by recovery to similar to 80\%
   of the initial hydrogen flux upon reintroduction of pure hydrogen at 400
   degrees C. Complete flux recovery after H2S exposure required hydrogen
   treatment at 500 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the
   H2S-exposed PdCuAu membranes revealed fcc alloy structure with no
   evidence of bulk sulfide formation. In agreement with the XRD results,
   sulfur was not defected in the bulk of H2S-exposed samples by energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). However, analysis of H2S-exposed PdCuAu
   alloys by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling
   revealed low, but measureable, amounts of sulfur in the near surface
   region, about 10 nm in depth. The depth profiles of samples after
   hydrogen recovery treatment showed significantly reduced sulfur content.
   These results indicate that H2S exposure causes flux loss in PdCuAu
   alloys through a surface-poisoning mechanism, and that the surface
   sulfide can be removed-and flux recovered-by high temperature treatment
   in hydrogen. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Robust ultrasonic damage detection under complex environmental
   conditions using singular value decomposition}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{75-86}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Guided wave ultrasonics is an attractive monitoring technique for damage
   diagnosis in large-scale plate and pipe structures. Damage can be
   detected by comparing incoming records with baseline records collected
   on intact structure. However, during long-term monitoring, environmental
   and operational conditions often vary significantly and produce large
   changes in the ultrasonic signals, thereby challenging the baseline
   comparison based damage detection. Researchers developed temperature
   compensation methods to eliminate the effects of temperature variation,
   but they have limitations in practical implementations.
   In this paper, we develop a robust damage detection method based on
   singular value decomposition (SVD). We show that the orthogonality of
   singular vectors ensures that the effect of damage and that of
   environmental and operational variations are separated into different
   singular vectors. We report on our field ultrasonic monitoring of a
   273.05 mm outer diameter pipe segment, which belongs to a hot water
   piping system in continuous operation. We demonstrate the efficacy of
   our method on experimental pitch-catch records collected during seven
   months. We show that our method accurately detects the presence of a
   mass scatterer, and is robust to the environmental and operational
   variations exhibited in the practical system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Dopamine-melanin (DM or polydopamine) can be deposited on virtually any
   substrate from solution through autoxidation of dopamine. The
   versatility of this process has allowed surface-mediated assembly of DM
   for a wide variety of functional coatings. Here we report the impact of
   well-defined surface chemistries on the nucleation and growth of such
   films. DM was deposited on silicon dioxide (SiO2) and SiO2 substrates
   modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) bearing octadecyl (C18),
   phenethyl, and aminopropyl functional groups. Atomic force microscopy
   revealed three-dimensional islands whose areal density and surface
   coverage are lowest on bare SiO2 substrates and highest on the neutral
   aromatic and aliphatic substrates. Increasing the pH of the solution
   from 8.2 to 10 dissociates catechol moieties in DM and inhibits
   adsorption on negatively charged SiO2 substrates. The growth rate of DM
   films on SAM-modified SiO2 is maximized at pH 9.5 and almost completely
   abolished at pH 10 because of increased DM solubility. The initial rates
   of DM adsorption were measured using quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation measurements. The initial adsorption rate is proportional to
   the nucleation density, which increases as the hydrophobicity of the
   substrate increases. Taken together, these data provide insight into the
   rates of heterogeneous nucleation and growth of DM on substrates with
   well-defined chemistries.}},

Abstract = {{We characterize the effect of regional temperature differences on
   battery electric vehicle (BEV) efficiency, range, and use-phase power
   plant CO2 emissions in the U.S. The efficiency of a BEV varies with
   ambient temperature due to battery efficiency and cabin climate control.
   We find that annual energy consumption of BEVs can increase by an
   average of 15\% in the Upper Midwest or in the Southwest compared to the
   Pacific Coast due to temperature differences. Greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions from BEVs vary primarily with marginal regional grid mix,
   which has three times the GHG intensity in the Upper Midwest as on the
   Pacific Coast. However, even within a grid region, REV emissions vary by
   up to 22\% due to spatial and temporal ambient temperature variation and
   its implications for vehicle efficiency and charging duration and
   timing. Cold climate regions also encounter days with substantial
   reduction in EV range: the average range of a Nissan Leaf on the coldest
   day of the year drops from 70 Miles on the Pacific Coast to less than 45
   miles in the Upper Midwest. These regional differences are large enough
   to affect adoption patterns and energy and environmental implications of
   BEVs relative to alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Intracortical electrode arrays that can record extracellular
   action potentials from small, targeted groups of neurons are critical
   for basic neuroscience research and emerging clinical applications. In
   general, these electrode devices suffer from reliability and variability
   issues, which have led to comparative studies of existing and emerging
   electrode designs to optimize performance. Comparisons of different
   chronic recording devices have been limited to single-unit (SU) activity
   and employed a bulk averaging approach treating brain architecture as
   homogeneous with respect to electrode distribution.
   New method: In this study, we optimize the methods and parameters to
   quantify evoked multi-unit (MU) and local field potential (LFP)
   recordings in eight mice visual cortices.
   Results: These findings quantify the large recording differences
   stemming from anatomical differences in depth and the layer dependent
   relative changes to SU and MU recording performance over 6-months. For
   example, performance metrics in Layer V and stratum pyramidale were
   initially higher than Layer but decrease more rapidly. On the other
   hand, Layer II/III maintained recording metrics longer. In addition,
   chronic changes at the level of layer IV are evaluated using visually
   evoked current source density.
   Comparison with existing method(s): The use of MU and LFP activity for
   evaluation and tracking biological depth provides a more comprehensive
   characterization of the electrophysiological performance landscape of
   microelectrodes.
   Conclusions: A more extensive spatial and temporal insight into the
   chronic electrophysiological performance over time will help uncover the
   biological and mechanical failure mechanisms of the neural electrodes
   and direct future research toward the elucidation of design optimization
   for specific applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate the
   underlying physics describing the adsorption energies on doped late
   transition metal dioxide rutiles. Adsorption energies of atomic oxygen
   on doped rutiles M-D-(MO2)-O-H, where transition metal MD is doped into
   (MO2)-O-H, were expressed in terms of a contribution from adsorption on
   the pure oxide of the dopant M-D and perturbations to this adsorption
   energy caused by changing its neighboring metal cations and lattice
   parameters to that of the host oxide (MO2)-O-H, which we call the ligand
   and strain effects, respectively. Our analysis of atom projected density
   of states revealed that the t(2g)-band center had the strongest
   correlation with adsorption energies. We show that charge transfer
   mediated shifts to the t(2g)-band center describe the ligand effect, and
   the radii of the atomic orbitals of metal cations can predict the
   magnitude and direction of this charge transfer. Strain produces
   systematic shifts to all features of the atom projected density of
   states, but correlations between the strain effect and the electronic
   structure were dependent on the chemical identity of the metal cation.
   The slope of these correlations can be related to the idealized d-band
   filling. This work elucidates the underlying physics describing
   adsorption on doped late transition metal oxides and establishes a
   foundation for models that use known chemical properties for the
   prediction of reactivity. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum oxide nanofibers having different fiber diameters were
   characterized to determine if and how the fiber diameter affects their
   colloidal behavior and solubility in water. The measurements provide
   initial data on the behavior of alumina nanofibers in aqueous systems.
   Three different aluminum oxide materials with average fiber diameters
   ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers were acquired
   from ANF Technology (Nafen (TM)), MemPro Materials, and Pardam
   Nanotechnology. The morphology, dimensions, chemical composition, and
   surface properties of each material were measured using scanning
   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N-2-BET surface area
   analysis. Properties measured for aqueous suspensions of the fibers
   included electrophoretic mobility, point of zero charge, apparent
   hydrodynamic radius via dynamic light scattering, and solubility. TEM
   images were used to determine the size distribution of the fiber
   diameter, and the smooth, non-porous, non-tubular structure of the
   materials. Fiber diameters were 5-10 nm for Nafen (TM), 90-175 nm for
   MemPro, and 150-600 nm for Pardam. SEM showed that samples of the dry
   materials consisted of long (micron sized) fibers having these
   diameters. Specific surface area ranged from 2.7 m(2)/g for the largest
   diameter Pardam fibers to 136 m(2)/g for the smallest diameter Nafen
   (TM) fibers. The pH of the point of zero charge for the three materials
   ranged from 5.0 for Pardam to 8.5 for Nafen (TM) in 10 mM NaCl. Dynamic
   light scattering revealed that the fibers readily aggregate in both
   deionized water and solutions of high ionic strength. Fiber solubility
   ranged from a dissolved aluminum concentration of 23-83 mu g/L for pH
   from 6.67 to 8.23. The observed solubilities were similar to those
   calculated from thermodynamic data for corundum (alpha-Al2O3) and
   boehmite (gamma-AlO(OH)), phases that were observed by XRD in the aged
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging applications for electrochemical energy storage require devices
   that not only possess high power and energy, but also are capable of
   withstanding mechanical deformation without degradation of performance.
   To this end, we have constructed electric double layer capacitors
   (EDLCs), also referred to as supercapacitors, using thick,
   ultracompressible graphene-coated carbon nanotube aerogels as
   electrodes. These electrodes showed a high capacitance in both aqueous
   and room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolytes, achieving between
   60 and100 F/g, respectively, with the performance stable over hundreds
   of charge/discharge cycles and at high rates exceeding 1 V/s. This
   performance was retained fully under 90\% compression of the systems,
   allowing us to construct cells with high volumetric capacitances of
   similar to 5-18 F/cm(3) in aqueous and RTIL electrolytes, respectively,
   which are 50-100 times higher than comparable compressible EDLCs
   (similar to 0.1 F/cm(3)). Further, the volumetric capacitances approach
   values reported for compressible pseudocapacitors (similar to 15-30
   F/cm(3)) but without the degraded lifetime and reversibility that
   typically plague compressible pseudocapacitors. The electrodes
   demonstrated largely strain-invariant ion transport with no change in
   capacitance and high-rate performance even at 90\% compressive strain.
   This material serves as an excellent platform for exploring the
   possibility for use of extremely compressible EDLCs with negligible
   degradation in capacitance in applications such as electric vehicles and
   wearable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Photoreconfigurable physically cross-linked hydrogel networks are
   prepared by self-assembly from amphiphilic ABA triblock polymers with
   photolabile poly(o-nitrobenzyl methacrylate) (PNBMA) A blocks and
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) B blocks. Generalizable structure property
   relationships of this class of photosensitive compounds have yet to be
   reported. Here, a library of amphiphilic linear PNBMA-b-PEG-b-PNBMA
   triblock copolymers is synthesized; and the physical properties of
   subsequent hydrogel networks are characterized across two parameters:
   the degree of polymerization Of PNBMA segments and the concentration of
   PNBMA-b-PEG-b-PNBMA in precursor solutions. The storage modulus,
   photodisintegration kinetics, and swelling ratio are reported. A
   quantitative model to correlate molecular scale photolysis Of NBMA
   groups with macroscopic mechanical properties is proposed and validated.
   Hydrogel network parameters including cross-link density and mesh size
   are also included and compared to covalently cross-linked PEG-diacrylate
   analogues. The concept of reduced swelling ratio is introduced to map
   the physical properties of self-assembled physically cross-linked
   photolabile networks with covalently crosslinked hydrogels. This revised
   parameter permits direct comparisons of macroscopic network properties
   between PEG-based gels with either physical or covalent cross-links.}},

Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{When the replication of a plasmid based on sucrose selection is
   deregulated via the inc1 and inc2 mutations, high copy numbers (7,000 or
   greater) are attained while the growth rate on minimal medium is
   negligibly affected. Adaptions were assumed to be required in order to
   sustain the growth rate. Proteomics indicated that indeed a number of
   adaptations occurred that included increased expression of ribosomal
   proteins and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. The operating space
   prescribed by a basic flux model that maintained phenotypic traits (e.g.
   growth, byproducts, etc.) within typical bounds of resolution was
   consistent with the flux implications of the proteomic changes.}},

Abstract = {{There are known errors in oxidation energies of transition metal oxides

   the cornputationally cheapest addition one can use to capture correct

   empirically determined only when suitable experimental data exist. We
   evaluated the effect of addling a calculated, linear response U on the
   predicted adsorption energies, scaling relationships, and activity
   trends with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction for a set of
   transition metal dioxides. We find that applying a U greater than zero
   always causes adsorption energies to be more endothermic. Furthermore,
   the addition of the Hubbard U greater than zero does not break scaling
   relationships established without the Hubbard U. The addition of the
   calculated linear response U value produces shifts of different systems
   along the activity volcano that results in improved activity trends when
   compared with experimental results.}},

   energy arbitrage service. We calculate the profits under two scenarios
   (perfect and imperfect information about future electricity prices), and
   estimate the effect of bulk storage on net emissions of CO2, SO2, and
   NOx for 20 eGRID subregions in the United States. We find that net
   system CO2 emissions resulting from storage operation are nontrivial
   when compared to the emissions from electricity generation, ranging from
   104 to 407 kg/MWh of delivered energy depending on location, storage
   operation mode, and assumptions regarding carbon intensity. Net NOx
   emissions range from -0.16 (i.e., producing net savings) to 0.49 kg/MWh,
   and are generally small when compared to average generation-related
   emissions. Net SO2 emissions from storage operation range from -0.01 to
   1.7 kg/MWh, depending on location and storage operation mode.}},

Abstract = {{Facility-level methane emissions were measured at 114 gathering
   facilities and 16 processing plants in the United States natural gas
   system. At gathering facilities, the measured methane emission rates
   ranged from 0.7 to 700 kg per hour (kg/h) (0.6 to 600 standard cubic
   feet per minute (scfm)). Normalized emissions (as a \% of total methane
   throughput) were less than 1\% for 85 gathering facilities and 19 had
   normalized emissions less than 0.1\%. The range of methane emissions
   rates for processing plants was 3 to 600 kg/h (3 to 524 scfm),
   corresponding to normalized methane emissions rates <1\% in all cases.
   The distributions of methane emissions, particularly for gathering
   facilities, are skewed. For example, 30\% of gathering facilities
   contribute 80\% of the total emissions. Normalized emissions rates are
   negatively correlated with facility throughput. The variation in methane
   emissions also appears driven by differences between inlet and outlet
   pressure, as well as venting and leaking equipment. Substantial venting
   from liquids storage tanks was observed at 20\% of gathering facilities.
   Emissions rates at these facilities were, on average, around four times
   the rates observed at similar facilities without substantial venting.}},

   Exports: Implications for End Uses}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes how incremental U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG)
   exports affect global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We find that
   exported U.S. LNG has mean precombustion emissions of 37 g CO2-equiv/MJ
   when regasified in Europe and Asia. Shipping emissions of LNG exported
   from U.S. ports to Asian and European markets account for only 3.5-5.5\%
   of precombustion life cycle emissions, hence shipping distance is not a
   major driver of GHGs. A scenario-based analysis addressing how potential
   end uses (electricity and industrial heating) and displacement of
   existing fuels (coal and Russian natural gas) affect GHG emissions shows
   the mean emissions for electricity generation using U.S. exported LNG
   were 655 g CO2-equiv/kWh (with a 90\% confidence interval of 562770), an
   11\% increase over U.S. natural gas electricity generation. Mean
   emissions from industrial heating were 104 g CO2-equiv/MJ (90\% CI:
   87123). By displacing coal, LNG saves 550 g CO2-equiv per kWh of
   electricity and 20 g per MJ of heat. LNG saves GHGs under upstream
   fugitive emissions rates up to 9\% and 5\% for electricity and heating,
   respectively. GHG reductions were found if Russian pipeline natural gas
   was displaced for electricity and heating use regardless of GWP, as long
   as U.S. fugitive emission rates remain below the estimated 57\% rate of
   Russian gas. However, from a country specific carbon accounting
   perspective, there is an imbalance in accrued social costs and benefits.
   Assuming a mean social cost of carbon of \$49/metric ton, mean global
   savings from U.S. LNG displacement of coal for electricity generation
   are \$1.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gaseous natural gas exported
   as LNG (\$.028/kWh). Conversely, the U.S. carbon cost of exporting the
   LNG is \$1.80/Mcf (\$.013/kWh), or \$0.50-\$5.50/Mcf across the range of
   potential discount rates. This spatial shift in embodied carbon
   emissions is important to consider in national interest estimates for
   LNG exports.}},

Title = {{Methane Emissions from Natural Gas Compressor Stations in the
   Transmission and Storage Sector: Measurements and Comparisons with the
   EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{3252-3261}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Equipment- and site-level methane emissions from 45 compressor stations
   in the transmission and storage (T\&S) sector of the US natural gas
   system were measured, including 25 sites required to report under the
   EPA greenhouse gas reporting program (GHGRP). Direct measurements of
   fugitive and vented sources were combined with AP-42-based exhaust
   emission factors (for operating reciprocating engines and turbines) to
   produce a study onsite estimate. Site-level methane emissions were also
   concurrently measured with downwind-tracer-flux techniques. At most
   sites, these two independent estimates agreed within experimental
   uncertainty. Site-level methane emissions varied from 2880 SCFM.
   Compressor vents, leaky isolation valves, reciprocating engine exhaust,
   and equipment leaks were major sources, and substantial emissions were
   observed at both operating and standby compressor stations. The
   site-level methane emission rates were highly skewed; the highest
   emitting 10\% of sites (including two superemitters) contributed 50\% of
   the aggregate methane emissions, while the lowest emitting 50\% of sites
   contributed less than 10\% of the aggregate emissions. Excluding the two
   superemitters, study-average methane emissions from compressor housings
   and noncompressor sources are comparable to or lower than the
   corresponding effective emission factors used in the EPA greenhouse gas
   inventory. If the two superemitters are included in the analysis, then
   the average emission factors based on this study could exceed the EPA
   greenhouse gas inventory emission factors, which highlights the
   potentially important contribution of superemitters to national
   emissions. However, quantification of their influence requires knowledge
   of the magnitude and frequency of superemitters across the entire T\&S
   sector. Only 38\% of the methane emissions measured by the comprehensive
   onsite measurements were reportable under the new EPA GHGRP because of a
   combination of inaccurate emission factors for leakers and exhaust
   methane, and various exclusions. The bias is even larger if one accounts
   for the superemitters, which were not captured by the onsite
   measurements. The magnitude of the bias varied from site to site by site
   type and operating state. Therefore, while the GHGRP is a valuable new
   source of emissions information, care must be taken when incorporating
   these data into emission inventories. The value of the GHGRP can be
   increased by requiring more direct measurements of emissions (as opposed
   to using counts and emission factors), eliminating exclusions such as
   rod-packing vents on pressurized reciprocating compressors in standby
   mode under Subpart-W, and using more appropriate emission factors for
   exhaust methane from reciprocating engines under Subpart-C.}},

Abstract = {{We consider global optimization of nonconvex problems containing
   multilinear functions. It is well known that the convex hull of a
   multilinear function over a box is polyhedral, and the facets of this
   polyhedron can be obtained by solving a linear optimization problem
   (LP). When used as cutting planes, these facets can significantly
   enhance the quality of conventional relaxations in general-purpose
   global solvers. However, in general, the size of this LP grows
   exponentially with the number of variables in the multilinear function.
   To cope with this growth, we propose a graph decomposition scheme that
   exploits the structure of a multilinear function to decompose it to
   lower-dimensional components, for which the aforementioned LP can be
   solved very efficiently by employing a customized simplex algorithm. We
   embed this cutting plane generation strategy at every node of the
   branch-and-reduce global solver BARON, and carry out an extensive
   computational study on quadratically constrained quadratic problems,
   multilinear problems, and polynomial optimization problems. Results show
   that the proposed multilinear cuts enable BARON to solve many more
   problems to global optimality and lead to an average 60 \% CPU time
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a nondestructive
   diffraction-based scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique that can
   provide microstructural analysis similar to transmission
   electronmicroscopy (TEM). However, because ECCI is performed within an
   SEM and requires little to no sample preparation, such analysis can be
   accomplished in a fraction of the time. Like TEM, ECCI can be used to
   image a variety of extended defects and enables the use of standard
   invisibility criteria to provide further defect characterization (e.g.,
   Burgers vector determination). Here, we use ECCI to characterize various
   extended defects, including threading dislocations, misfit dislocations,
   and stacking faults, in heteroepitaxial GaP/Si(1 0 0) samples. We also
   present applications for which ECCI is particularly well suited compared
   with conventional methods. First, misfit dislocations are surveyed via
   ECCI across the radius of a 4-in GaP/Si wafer, yielding a
   proof-of-concept rapid (similar to 3 h) approach to large-area defect
   characterization. Second, by simply wet etching away a portion of a
   thick epitaxial GaP-on-Si layer, we use ECCI to image specific targeted
   interfaces within a heterostructure. Both of these applications are

Title = {{Efficient Transient Analysis of Power Delivery Network With Clock/Power
   Gating by Sparse Approximation}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Transient analysis of large-scale power delivery network (PDN) is a
   critical task to ensure the functional correctness and desired
   performance of today's integrated circuits (ICs), especially if
   significant transient noises are induced by clock and/or power gating
   due to the utilization of extensive power management. In this paper, we
   propose an efficient algorithm for PDN transient analysis based on
   sparse approximation. The key idea is to exploit the fact that the
   transient response caused by clock/power gating is often localized and
   the voltages at many other ``inactive{''} nodes are almost unchanged,
   thereby rendering a unique sparse structure. By taking advantage of the
   underlying sparsity of the solution structure, a modified conjugate
   gradient algorithm is developed and tuned to efficiently solve the PDN
   analysis problem with low computational cost. Our numerical experiments
   based on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed transient
   analysis with sparse approximation offers up to 2.2x runtime speedup
   over other traditional methods, while simultaneously achieving similar
   accuracy.}},

Title = {{Will subsidies drive electric vehicle adoption? Measuring consumer
   preferences in the US and China}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{96-112}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We model consumer preferences for conventional, hybrid electric, plug-in
   hybrid electric (PHEV), and battery electric (BEV) vehicle technologies
   in China and the U.S. using data from choice-based conjoint surveys
   fielded in 2012-2013 in both countries. We find that with the combined
   bundle of attributes offered by vehicles available today, gasoline
   vehicles continue in both countries to be most attractive to consumers,
   and American respondents have significantly lower relative
   willingness-to-pay for BEV technology than Chinese respondents. While
   U.S. and Chinese subsidies are similar, favoring vehicles with larger
   battery packs, differences in consumer preferences lead to different
   outcomes. Our results suggest that with or without each country's
   2012-2013 subsidies, Chinese consumers are willing to adopt today's BEVs
   and mid-range PHEVs at similar rates relative to their respective
   gasoline counterparts, whereas American consumers prefer low-range PHEVs
   despite subsidies. This implies potential for earlier BEV adoption in
   China, given adequate supply. While there are clear national security
   benefits for adoption of BEVs in China, the local and global social
   impact is unclear: With higher electricity generation emissions in
   China, a transition to BEVs may reduce oil consumption at the expense of
   increased air pollution and/or greenhouse gas emissions. On the other
   hand, demand from China could increase global incentives for electric
   vehicle technology development with the potential to reduce emissions in
   countries where electricity generation is associated with lower
   emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of biofilm-electrodes is crucial for microbial fuel cell
   current production because optimal performance is often associated with
   thick biofilms. However, the influence of the electrode structure and
   morphology on biofilm formation is only beginning to be investigated.
   This study provides insight on how changing the electrode morphology
   affects current production of a pure culture of anode-respiring
   bacteria. Specifically, an analysis of the effects of carbon fiber
   electrodes with drastically different morphologies on biofilm formation
   and anode respiration by a pure culture (Shewanella oneidensis MR-1)
   were examined. Results showed that carbon nanofiber mats had \~{}10 fold
   higher current than plain carbon microfiber paper and that the increase
   was not due to an increase in electrode surface area, conductivity, or
   the size of the constituent material. Cyclic voltammograms reveal that
   electron transfer from the carbon nanofiber mats was biofilm-based
   suggesting that decreasing the diameter of the constituent carbon
   material from a few microns to a few hundred nanometers is beneficial
   for electricity production solely because the electrode surface creates
   a more relevant mesh for biofilm formation by Shewanella oneidensis
   MR-1.}},

Title = {{The impacts of political cues and practical information on climate
   change decisions}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Adapting to climate change will require people to make measured
   decisions, informed by the science relevant to those choices.
   Communicating that science is complicated by the politicization of the
   topic. In two studies, we ask how political cues, designed to evoke
   individuals' sense of identity as believers or nonbelievers in global
   warming, affect a hypothetical decision: buying a home vulnerable to
   coastal flooding exacerbated by global warming using the Zillow (R) real
   estate website. In both studies, we manipulate participants' frame of
   reference by focusing them on risks due to `elevation', `global
   warming', or both, or mentioning neither. We also examine how immersion
   in practical details affects the power of these cues by manipulating
   whether participants have access to Risk Finder
   (http://sealevel.climatecentral.org), an interactive decision aid. Study
   1 asks about global warming beliefs after their decision; Study 2 asks
   beforehand. Both find that immersion in practical information, using
   Risk Finder, overrode political identity cues. When framed in terms of
   both elevation and global warming and without explicit expression of
   global warming beliefs (Study 1), participants' responses reflected
   their beliefs. The results suggest that communications should
   acknowledge political differences and then focus on practical decisions
   and the science that can inform them.}},

Title = {{Single particle motion in a sheared colloidal dispersion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{429-471}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The motion of a spherical Brownian ``probe{''} particle addressed by an
   external force immersed in shear flow of a colloidal dispersion of
   spherical neutrally buoyant ``bath{''} particles is quantified. The
   steady-state nonequilibrium microstructure of bath particles around the
   probe-induced by the applied force and ambient shear-is calculated to
   first order in the volume fraction of bath particles, phi. The
   distortion to the equilibrium microstructure caused by the moving probe
   is characterized by a Peclet number Pe(f) (a dimensionless pulling
   force), and the distortion due to the shear flow is represented by
   another Peclet number Pe(s) (a dimensionless shear rate). Matched
   asymptotic expansions are employed to quantify the microstructure at
   small Peclet numbers; specifically, within the distinguished limits
   Pe(s)(3/2) << Pe(f) << Pe(s)(1/2) << 1. The nonequilibrium
   microstructure is subsequently utilized to compute the average
   rectilinear velocity of the probe through O(phi Pe(s)(3/2)U(s)), for an
   arbitrary orientation of the external force to the shear flow. Here, U-s
   is the Stokes velocity of the probe in a pure Newtonian fluid. It is
   also shown that to O(phi Pe(s)(3/2)U(s)) the torque-free probe simply
   rotates with the ambient shear; a modification to the angular velocity
   of the probe is at most O(phi Pe(s)Pe(f)U(s)). In particular, a probe
   forced along the flow axis of shear is demonstrated to experience a
   cross-streamline drift velocity of O(phi Pe(s)U(s)) to leading order,
   which acts to propel the particle to streamlines of the ambient shear
   that move in the same direction as the external force. A mathematical
   connection between this result and cross-streamline drift of a particle
   in a Newtonian fluid at small, but nonzero, Reynolds numbers is drawn.
   The magnitude of the cross-streamline drift velocity is found to be
   sensitive to the degree of hydrodynamic interactions between the probe
   and bath particles, which are tuned via an excluded-annulus model. It is
   also demonstrated that a probe forced along the vorticity axis of the
   shear experiences a shear-driven enhancement in rectilinear velocity of
   O(phi Pe(s)(3/2)U(s)) to leading order: This nonanalytic dependence
   originates from the microstructural deformation in the shear dominated
   (outer) region far from the probe. A connection of this finding to
   recent work on particle sedimentation in orthogonal shear flow of
   viscoelastic liquids is discussed. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{Heat protection behaviors and positive affect about heat during the 2013
   heat wave in the United Kingdom}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{282-289}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Heat waves pose serious health risks, and are expected to become more
   frequent, longer lasting, and more intense in the future under a
   changing climate. Yet, people in the UK seem to feel positive when
   thinking about hot weather. According to research on the affect
   heuristic, any positive or negative emotions evoked by potentially risky
   experiences may be used as cues to inform concerns about risk
   protection. If so, then their positive feelings toward hot weather might
   lead UK residents to lower intentions to adopt heat protection
   behaviors. Here, we examine the relationships between heat protection
   behaviors during the July 2013 UK heat wave and self-reports of having
   heard heat protection recommendations, feeling positive affect about
   heat, seeing heat protection measures as effective, and trusting the
   organizations making those recommendations. Responses to a national
   survey revealed that 55.1\% of participants had heard heat protection
   recommendations during the 2013 UK heat wave. Those who reported having
   heard recommendations also indicated having implemented more heat
   protection behaviors, perceiving heat protection behaviors as more
   effective, feeling more positive about heat, and intending to implement
   more protection behaviors in future hot summers. Mediation analyses
   suggested that heat protection recommendations may motivate heat
   protection behaviors by increasing their perceived effectiveness, but
   undermine their implementation by evoking positive affect about hot
   weather. We discuss our findings in the context of the affect heuristic
   and its implications for heat protection communications. (C) 2015 The

Title = {{Nonconvex Equilibrium Prices in Prediction Markets}},
Journal = {{DECISION ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Prediction markets are increasingly being used to estimate probabilities
   of future events, and market equilibrium prices depend on the
   distribution of subjective probabilities of underlying events. When each
   contract requires the payment of a dollar if the underlying event were
   to occur, equilibrium prices are usually used to estimate the mean
   probabilities of the corresponding events. This paper shows that under
   certain conditions, market equilibrium prices of such contracts can lie
   outside the convex hull of potential traders' probability beliefs, and
   where this occurs, market forecasts can induce stochastically dominated
   group decisions. We describe examples of where this could occur and
   generalize these examples to characterize conditions for nonconvex
   prices. A necessary condition for nonconvex prices is that market risk
   premia for complementary contracts have opposite signs. Preference
   functions on the lines of prospect theory have this property.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{487-506}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Data on inventors and assignees of patents are used to analyze the
   mobility of semiconductor inventors. Exploiting data on the origins of
   semiconductor producers with larger sales, we argue that the higher
   mobility of semiconductor inventors in Silicon Valley is in great part
   due to the entry of spinoffs there. Our empirical evidence suggests that
   spinoff entry promoted mobility in Silicon Valley even before the
   industry was clustered there. Agglomeration economies and the ban on
   noncompete covenants may influence spinoff entry, but spinoffs promote
   mobility even in the absence of those conditions. Because most of the
   greater inventor mobility in Silicon Valley corresponds to inventors
   moving from incumbents to recent entrants, the benefits that arise from
   greater mobility rates will be disproportionately reaped by new firms.}},

Abstract = {{This preliminary work documents the effects of test orientation with
   respect to build and beam raster directions on the fracture toughness
   and fatigue crack growth behavior of as-deposited EBM Ti-6Al-4V.
   Although ASTM/ISO standards exist for determining the orientation
   dependence of various mechanical properties in both cast and wrought
   materials, these standards are evolving for materials produced via
   additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. The current work was conducted
   as part of a larger America Makes funded project to begin to examine the
   effects of process variables on the microstructure and fracture and
   fatigue behavior of AM Ti-6Al-4V. In the fatigue crack growth tests, the
   fatigue threshold, Paris law slope, and overload toughness were
   determined at different load ratios, R, whereas fatigue precracked
   samples were tested to determine the fracture toughness. The
   as-deposited material exhibited a fine-scale basket-weave microstructure
   throughout the build, and although fracture surface examination revealed
   the presence of unmelted powders, disbonded regions, and isolated
   porosity, the resulting mechanical properties were in the range of those
   reported for cast and wrought Ti-6Al-4V. Remote access and control of
   testing was also developed at Case Western Reserve University to improve
   efficiency of fatigue crack growth testing.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to measure dose-response effects of
   topical delivery of inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) through
   conjugation to hyaluronic acid in a rat burn model to determine effects
   on inflammatory responses, burn progression, and early stages of
   healing. Monoclonal antibodies against TNF- were conjugated to
   hyaluronic acid and applied topically in a rat partial-thickness burn
   model. Metrics of inflammatory responses and tissue necrosis were
   measured as well as the quantitative analysis of collagen composition
   and organization. The minimum effective conjugated antibody dose was
   found to be 100 g with three applications 48 hours apart. Nonviable
   tissue thicknesses decreased with increasing dose and dose frequency.
   Free antibody retarded macrophage infiltration in the periphery but not
   at the surface, while the conjugated antibody was able to hinder
   macrophage infiltration at both the periphery and the surface.
   Quantification of collagen I and III staining ratios at days 4, 7, and
   14 and quantitative image analysis of collagen organization at day 14
   demonstrated differences between saline and conjugate treatment. This
   correlated with increases in re-epithelialization observed in
   conjugate-treated sites. Reductions in inflammatory markers and
   secondary tissue necrosis under treatment with the conjugates were
   understood in terms of differences in antibody transport compared to
   nonconjugated antibody. Differences in collagen composition and
   organization at Day 14 suggested that the reductions in inflammatory
   responses altered early healing responses. These results indicate
   anti-TNF- conjugated to hyaluronic acid can be an effective treatment
   for reducing secondary necrosis and improving healing outcomes in burns.}},

Title = {{Assessing regional differences in lighting heat replacement effects in

Abstract = {{Lighting accounts for 19\% of total U.S. electricity consumption and 6\%
   of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions. Existing technologies,
   such as compact fluorescent lamps and light emitting diodes, can
   substitute low-efficiency technologies such as incandescent lamps, while
   saving energy and reducing energy bills to consumers. For that reason,
   lighting efficiency goals have been emphasized in U.S. energy efficiency
   policies. However, incandescent bulbs release up to 95\% of input energy
   as heat, impacting the overall building energy consumption: replacing
   them increases demands for heating service that needs to be provided by
   the heating systems and decreases demands for cooling service that needs
   to be provided by the cooling systems. This work investigates the net
   energy consumption, CO(2)e emissions, and savings in energy bills for
   single-family detached houses across the U.S. as one adopts more
   efficient lighting systems. In some regions, these heating and cooling
   effects from more efficient lighting can undermine up to 40\% of
   originally intended primary energy savings, erode anticipated carbon
   savings completely, or lead to 30\% less household monetary savings than
   intended. The size of the effect depends on regional factors such as
   climate, technologies used for heating and cooling, electricity fuel
   mix, emissions factors, and electricity prices. However, we also find
   that for moderate lighting efficiency interventions, the overall effect
   is small in magnitude, corresponding at most to 1\% of either total
   emissions or of energy consumption by a house. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a new method for fabricating two-dimensional ZnO
   nanorod patterns. A water soluble mixture of poly(vinyl

   (PVA-Sbq) and zinc acetate (ZnA) was used as a negative photoresist to
   produce the desired patterns using conventional photolithography.
   Hydrothermally-grown ZnO nanorods were grown selectively on the calcined
   PVA-Sbq/ZnA patterns. The appropriate concentration of PVA-Sbq and ZnA
   that can produce the desirable seed layer pattern was determined
   experimentally. Furthermore, the effects of the calcination time on the
   morphology and vertical alignment of ZnO nanorods were investigated. The
   vertically-aligned ZnO nanorods were generated by sufficient calcination
   of the patterned seed layer. On the other hand, the aspect ratio of ZnO
   nanorods decreased slightly with increasing calcination time. This new
   approach provides a simple and cost-effective method for fabricating ZnO
   nanorod patterns which can be beneficial in various solid-state devices
   and optoelectronic applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper studies the convergence of the estimation error process and
   the characterization of the corresponding invariant measure in
   distributed Kalman filtering for potentially unstable and large linear
   dynamic systems. A gossip network protocol termed modified gossip
   interactive Kalman filtering ( M-GIKF) is proposed, where sensors
   exchange their filtered states ( estimates and error covariances) and
   propagate their observations via intersensor communications of rate.
   (gamma) over bar; (gamma) over bar is defined as the averaged number of
   intersensor message passages per signal evolution epoch. The filtered
   states are interpreted as stochastic particles swapped through local
   interaction. This paper shows that the conditional estimation error
   covariance sequence at each sensor under M-GIKF evolves as a random
   Riccati equation ( RRE) with Markov modulated switching. By formulating
   the RRE as a random dynamical system, it is shown that the network
   achieves weak consensus, i. e., the conditional estimation error
   covariance at a randomly selected sensor converges weakly ( in
   distribution) to a unique invariant measure. Further, it is proved that
   as.(gamma) over bar -> infinity this invariant measure satisfies the
   large deviation ( LD) upper and lower bounds, implying that this measure
   converges exponentially fast ( in probability) to the Dirac measure
   delta P{*}, where P{*} is the stable error covariance of the centralized
   ( Kalman) filtering setup. The LD results answer a fundamental question
   on how to quantify the rate at which the distributed scheme approaches
   the centralized performance as the intersensor communication rate
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed the CHIMP (CMU Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform)
   robot as a platform for executing complex tasks in dangerous, degraded,
   human-engineered environments. CHIMP has a near-human form factor,
   work-envelope, strength, and dexterity to work effectively in these
   environments. It avoids the need for complex control by maintaining
   static rather than dynamic stability. Utilizing various sensors embedded
   in the robot's head, CHIMP generates full three-dimensional
   representations of its environment and transmits these models to a human
   operator to achieve latency-free situational awareness. This awareness
   is used to visualize the robot within its environment and preview
   candidate free-space motions. Operators using CHIMP are able to select
   between task, workspace, and joint space control modes to trade between
   speed and generality. Thus, they are able to perform remote tasks
   quickly, confidently, and reliably, due to the overall design of the
   robot and software. CHIMP's hardware was designed, built, and tested
   over 15months leading up to the DARPA Robotics Challenge. The software
   was developed in parallel using surrogate hardware and simulation tools.
   Over a six-week span prior to the DRC Trials, the software was ported to
   the robot, the system was debugged, and the tasks were practiced
   continuously. Given the aggressive schedule leading to the DRC Trials,
   development of CHIMP focused primarily on manipulation tasks.
   Nonetheless, our team finished 3(rd) out of 16. With an upcoming year to
   develop new software for CHIMP, we look forward to improving the robot's
   capability and increasing its speed to compete in the DRC Finals.}},

Title = {{Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 Augments Calvarial Defect Healing and
   Promotes Suture Regeneration}},

Abstract = {{Background: Repair of complex cranial defects is hindered by a paucity
   of appropriate donor tissue. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and
   transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) have been shown
   separately to induce bone formation through physiologically distinct
   mechanisms and potentially improve surgical outcome for cranial defect
   repair by obviating the need for donor tissue. We hypothesize that a
   combination of BMP2 and TGF beta 1 would improve calvarial defect
   healing by augmenting physiologic osteogenic mechanisms.
   Methods/Results: Coronal suturectomies (3x15 mm) were performed in
   10-day-old New Zealand White rabbits. DermaMatrix (TM) (3x15mm)
   patterned with four treatments (vehicle, 350 ng BMP2, 200 ng TGF beta 1,
   or 350 ng BMP2+200 ng TGF beta 1) was placed in suturectomy sites and
   rabbits were euthanized at 6 weeks of age. Two-dimensional (2D) defect
   healing, bone volume, and bone density were quantified by computed
   tomography. Regenerated bone was qualitatively assessed histologically.
   One-way analysis of variance revealed significant group main effects for
   all bone quantity measures. Analysis revealed significant differences in
   2D defect healing, bone volume, and bone density between the control
   group and all treatment groups, but no significant differences were
   detected among the three growth factor treatment groups. Qualitatively,
   TGF beta 1 treatment produced bone with morphology most similar to
   native bone. TGF beta 1-regenerated bone contained a suture-like tissue,
   growing from the lateral edge of the defect margin toward the midline.
   Unique to the BMP2 treatment group, regenerated bone contained lacunae
   with chondrocytes, demonstrating the presence of endochondral
   ossification.
   Conclusions/Significance: Total healing in BMP2 and TGF beta 1 treatment
   groups is not significantly different. The combination of BMP2+TGF beta
   1 did not significantly increase bone healing compared with treatment
   with BMP2 or TGF beta 1 alone postoperatively at 4 weeks. We highlight
   the potential use of TGF beta 1 to regenerate calvarial bone and cranial
   sutures. TGF beta 1 therapy significantly augmented bony defect healing
   at an earlier time point when compared with control, regenerated bone
   along the native intramembranous ossification pathway, and (unlike BMP2
   alone or in combination with TGF beta 1) permitted normal suture
   reformation. We propose a novel method of craniofacial bone regeneration
   using low-dose, spatially controlled growth factor therapies to minimize
   potentially harmful effects while maximizing local bioavailability and
   regenerating native tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Poor physical access to health facilities has been
   identified as an important contributor to reduced uptake of preventive
   health services and is likely to be most critical in low-income
   settings. However, the relation among physical access, travel behavior,
   and the uptake of healthcare is difficult to quantify.
   Methods: Using anonymized mobile phone data from 2008 to 2009, we
   analyze individual and spatially aggregated travel patterns of
   14,816,521 subscribers across Kenya and compare these measures to (1)
   estimated travel times to health facilities and (2) data on the uptake
   of 2 preventive healthcare interventions in an area of western Kenya:
   childhood immunizations and antenatal care.
   Results: We document that long travel times to health facilities are
   strongly correlated with increased mobility in geographically isolated
   areas. Furthermore, we found that in areas with equal physical access to
   healthcare, mobile phone-derived measures of mobility predict which
   regions are lacking preventive care.
   Conclusions: Routinely collected mobile phone data provide a simple and
   low-cost approach to mapping the uptake of preventive healthcare in
   low-income settings.}},

Abstract = {{Bright-Field (BF) electron tomography (ET) has been widely used in the
   life sciences for 3-D imaging of biological specimens. However, while
   BF-ET is popular in the life sciences, 3-D BF-ET imaging has been
   avoided in the physical sciences due to measurement anomalies from
   crystalline samples caused by dynamical diffraction effects such as
   Bragg scatter. In practice, these measurement anomalies cause
   undesirable artifacts in 3-D reconstructions computed using filtered
   back-projection (FBP). Alternatively, model-based iterative
   reconstruction (MBIR) is a powerful framework for tomographic
   reconstruction that combines a forward model for the measurement system
   and a prior model for the object to obtain reconstructions by minimizing
   a single cost function. In this paper, we present an MBIR algorithm for
   BF-ET reconstruction from crystalline materials that can account for the
   presence of anomalous measurements. We propose a new forward model for
   the acquisition system which accounts for the presence of anomalous
   measurements and combine it with a prior model for the object to obtain
   the MBIR cost function. We then propose a fast algorithm based on
   majorization-minimization to find a minimum of the corresponding cost
   function. Results on simulated as well as real data show that our method
   can dramatically improve reconstruction quality as compared to FBP and
   conventional MBIR without anomaly modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation synthetic bone graft therapies will most likely be
   composed of resorbable polymers in combination with bioactive
   components. In this article, we continue our exploration of E1001(1k), a
   tyrosine-derived polycarbonate, as an orthopedic implant material.
   Specifically, we use E1001(1k), which is degradable, nontoxic, and
   osteoconductive, to fabricate porous bone regeneration scaffolds that
   were enhanced by two different types of calcium phosphate (CP) coatings:
   in one case, pure dicalcium phosphate dihydrate was precipitated on the
   scaffold surface and throughout its porous structure (E1001(1k) + CP).
   In the other case, bone matrix minerals (BMM) such as zinc, manganese
   and fluoride were co-precipitated within the dicalcium phosphate
   dihydrate coating (E1001(1k) + BMM). These scaffold compositions were
   compared against each other and against ChronOS (Synthes USA, West
   Chester, PA, USA), a clinically used bone graft substitute (BGS), which
   served as the positive control in our experimental design. This BGS is
   composed of poly(lactide co-e-caprolactone) and beta-tricalcium
   phosphate. We used the established rabbit calvaria critical-sized defect
   model to determine bone regeneration within the defect for each of the
   three scaffold compositions. New bone formation was determined after 2,
   4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks by micro-computerized tomography (mCT) and
   histology. The experimental tyrosine-derived polycarbonate, enhanced
   with dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, E1001(1k) + CP, supported
   significant bone formation within the defects and was superior to the
   same scaffold containing a mix of BMM, E1001(1k) + BMM. The comparison
   with the commercially available BGS was complicated by the large
   variability in bone formation observed for the laboratory preparations
   of E1001(1k) scaffolds. At all time points, there was a trend for
   E1001(1k) + CP to be superior to the commercial BGS. However, only at
   the 6-week time point did this trend reach statistical significance.
   Detailed analysis of the mCT data suggested an increase in bone
   formation from 2 through 12 weeks in implant sites treated with
   E1001(1k) + CP. At 2 and 4 weeks post-implantation, bone formation
   occurred at the interface where the E1001(1k) + CP scaffold was in
   contact with the bone borders of the implant site. Thereafter, during
   weeks 6, 8 and 12 bone formation progressed throughout the E1001(1k) +
   CP test implants. This trend was not observed with E1001(1k) + BMM
   scaffolds or the clinically used BGS. Our results suggest that E1001(1k)
   + CP should be tested further for osteoregenerative applications.}},

   Sigma 3 grain boundaries in a series of six nanocrystalline Cu thin

   to 315 nm. The films were annealed at the same temperature (600 degrees
   C) for the same length of time (30 min), have random texture, and vary
   only in grain size and film thickness. A strong grain size dependence of
   Sigma 3 (coherent and incoherent) and coherent Sigma 3 boundary fraction
   was observed. The experimental results are quantitatively compared with
   three physical models for the formation of annealing twins developed for
   microscale materials. The experimental results for the nanoscale Cu

   Modeling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Mechanotransduction has been divided into mechanotransmission,
   mechanosensing, and mechanoresponse, although how a cell performs all
   three functions using the same set of structural components is still
   highly debated. Here, we bridge the gap between emerging molecular and
   systems-level understandings of mechanotransduction through a multiscale
   model linking these three phases. Our model incorporates a discrete
   network of actin filaments and associated proteins that responds to
   stretching through geometric relaxation. We assess three potential
   activating mechanisms at mechanosensitive crosslinks as inputs to a
   mixture model of molecular release and benchmark each using experimental
   data of mechanically-induced Rho GTPase FilGAP release from
   actin-filamin crosslinks. Our results suggest that filamin-FilGAP
   mechanotransduction response is best explained by a bandpass mechanism
   favoring release when crosslinking angles fall outside of a specific
   range. Our model further investigates the difference between ordered
   versus disordered networks and finds that a more disordered actin
   network may allow a cell to more finely tune control of molecular
   release enabling a more robust response.}},

   often unaccounted for in current mechanical stimulation studies. To
   address this we developed a novel technique to induce dual integrated
   force inputs, uniaxial stretch and fluid shear stress and present here
   for the first time a vector logic-gate framework to characterize
   cellular response as a function of cytoskeletal reorganization. Using
   this framework we found that under fluid shear stress and uniaxial
   stretch NIH 3T3 fibroblasts responded by the Stretch OR Shear vector
   logic-gate and HUVECs responded by the NOT Stretch OR Shear vector
   logic-gate. We further developed a parsimonious model of cellular
   response to multiple mechanical stimuli, which provides a unifying model
   that captured the experimental response of both cell types. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) utilize enzymes to convert chemical
   energy present in renewable biofuels into electrical energy and have
   shown much promise in the continuous powering of implantable devices.
   Currently, however, EBFCs are greatly limited in terms of power and
   operational stability with a majority of reported improvements requiring
   the inclusion of potentially toxic and unstable electron transfer
   mediators or multicompartment systems separated by a semipermeable
   membrane resulting in complicated setups. We report on the development
   of a simple, membrane/mediator-free EBFC utilizing novel electrodes of
   graphene and single-wall carbon nanotube cogel. These cogel electrodes
   had large surface area (similar to 800 m(2) g(-1)) that enabled high
   enzyme loading, large porosity for unhindered glucose transport and
   moderate electrical conductivity (similar to 0.2 S cm(-1)) for efficient
   charge collection. Glucose oxidase and bilirubin oxidase were physically
   adsorbed onto these electrodes to form anodes and cathodes,
   respectively, and the EBFC produced power densities up to 0.19 mW cm(-2)
   that correlated to 0.65 mW mL(-1) or 140 mW g(-1) of GOX with an open
   circuit voltage of 0.61 V. Further, the electrodes were rejuvenated by a
   simple wash and reloading procedure. We postulate these porous and
   ultrahigh surface area electrodes will be useful for biosensing
   applications, and will allow reuse of EBFCs.}},

Title = {{The influence of push-off timing in a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis on
   the energetics and mechanics of walking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Robotic ankle-foot prostheses that provide net positive
   push-off work can reduce the metabolic rate of walking for individuals
   with amputation, but benefits might be sensitive to push-off timing.
   Simple walking models suggest that preemptive push-off reduces
   center-of-mass work, possibly reducing metabolic rate. Studies with
   bilateral exoskeletons have found that push-off beginning before leading
   leg contact minimizes metabolic rate, but timing was not varied
   independently from push-off work, and the effects of push-off timing on
   biomechanics were not measured. Most lower-limb amputations are
   unilateral, which could also affect optimal timing. The goal of this
   study was to vary the timing of positive prosthesis push-off work in
   isolation and measure the effects on energetics, mechanics and muscle
   activity.
   Methods: We tested 10 able-bodied participants walking on a treadmill at
   1.25 m.s(-1). Participants wore a tethered ankle-foot prosthesis
   emulator on one leg using a rigid boot adapter. We programmed the
   prosthesis to apply torque bursts that began between 46\% and 56\% of
   stride in different conditions. We iteratively adjusted torque magnitude
   to maintain constant net positive push-off work.
   Results: When push-off began at or after leading leg contact, metabolic
   rate was about 10\% lower than in a condition with Spring-like
   prosthesis behavior. When push-off began before leading leg contact,
   metabolic rate was not different from the Spring-like condition. Early
   push-off led to increased prosthesis-side vastus medialis and biceps
   femoris activity during push-off and increased variability in step
   length and prosthesis loading during push-off. Prosthesis push-off
   timing had no influence on intact-side leg center-of-mass collision
   work.
   Conclusions: Prosthesis push-off timing, isolated from push-off work,
   strongly affected metabolic rate, with optimal timing at or after
   intact-side heel contact. Increased thigh muscle activation and
   increased human variability appear to have caused the lack of reduction
   in metabolic rate when push-off was provided too early. Optimal timing
   with respect to opposite heel contact was not different from normal
   walking, but the trends in metabolic rate and center-of-mass mechanics
   were not consistent with simple model predictions. Optimal push-off
   timing should also be characterized for individuals with amputation,
   since meaningful benefits might be realized with improved timing.}},

Abstract = {{Pendent bubble and drop devices are invaluable tools in understanding
   surfactant behavior at fluid-fluid interfaces. The simple
   instrumentation and analysis are used widely to determine adsorption
   isotherms, transport parameters, and interfacial rheology. However, much
   of the analysis performed is developed for planar interfaces. The
   application of a planar analysis to drops and bubbles (curved
   interfaces) can lead to erroneous and unphysical results. We revisit
   this analysis for a well-studied surfactant system at air-water
   interfaces over a wide range of curvatures as applied to both expansion/
   contraction experiments and interfacial elasticity measurements. The
   impact of curvature and transport on measured properties is quantified
   and compared to other scaling relationships in the literature. The
   results provide tools to design interfacial experiments for accurate
   determination of isotherm, transport and elastic properties. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) released into natural environments will
   interact with natural organic matter (NOM) or humic substances, which
   will change their fate and transport behavior. Quantitative predictions
   of the effects of NOM are difficult because of its heterogeneity and
   variability. Here, the effects of six types of NOM and molecular weight
   fractions of each on the aggregation of citrate-stabilized gold NPs are
   investigated. Correlations of NP aggregation rates with electrophoretic
   mobility and the molecular weight distribution and chemical attributes
   of NOM (including UV absorptivity or aromaticity, functional group
   content, and fluorescence) are assessed. In general, the >100 kg/mol
   components provide better stability than lower molecular weight
   components for each type of NOM, and they contribute to the stabilizing
   effect of the unfractionated NOM even in small proportions. In many
   cases, unfractionated NOM provided better stability than its separated
   components, indicating a synergistic effect between the high and low
   molecular weight fractions for NP stabilization. Weight-averaged
   molecular weight was the best single explanatory variable for NP
   aggregation rates across all NOM types and molecular weight fractions.
   NP aggregation showed poorer correlation with UV absorptivity, but the
   exponential slope of the UV-vis absorbance spectrum was a better
   surrogate for molecular weight. Functional group data (including reduced
   sulfur and total nitrogen content) were explored as possible secondary
   parameters to explain the strong stabilizing effect of a low molecular
   weight Pony Lake fulvic acid sample to the gold NPs. These results can
   inform future correlations and measurement requirements to predict NP
   attachment in the presence of NOM.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal operation of large-scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO)
   systems, which include multiple RO plants and storage tanks, are studied
   to reduce the energy cost; and at the same an effective computing method
   was introduced for the purpose of real time optimization. With well
   developed models of the RO process and storage tanks based on the first
   principle, the optimal operation problem is subsequently formulated in
   the form of differential-algebraic optimization problems (DAOPs).
   Simultaneous collocation method was used to transform the problem into a
   large-scale nonlinear programming problem, and then IPOPT solver,
   combined with an efficient initial-value and finite-element meshing
   technique, was used for fast solution. Then the optimal operation
   problem with different variable parameters that significantly affect the
   performance and the energy saving of the SWRO system were investigated
   through case studies. Computational results show that the optimal
   operation problem under different conditions can be solved with high
   efficiency and stability, and significant energy-saving potential can be
   obtained through the optimal operation proposed in this paper. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Correlation filters (CFs) are useful tools for detecting and locating
   signals or objects within a larger signal or scene of interest.
   Typically, these filters are designed during the training stage without
   worrying about how the cross-correlation between a test signal and the
   designed CF template will be carried out during the testing or use
   stage. Because of its computational benefits, the Fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT) algorithm is usually used for performing cross-correlations,
   leading to circular correlations and aliasing in the resulting
   correlation outputs. The aliasing effects can be suppressed by
   zero-padding, but at the expense of using longer FFTs and thus incurring
   more computational complexity. In this paper, we present a new approach
   where CFs are designed to explicitly allow partial aliasing at test time
   (thus allowing the use of shorter FFTs). This approach of allowing
   aliasing in the cross-correlation output and explicitly taking such
   partial aliasing into account when designing the CF is diametrically
   opposite to the conventional CF approaches which try to avoid aliasing
   effects. We demonstrate through numerical results that these new
   partial-aliasing correlation filters (PACFs) achieve better recognition
   performance than conventional CFs when used in block filtering
   architectures that allow aliasing.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a microfluidics-based model to quantify cell-level
   processes modulating the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD).
   This in vitro model enabled quantitative investigations of the kinetics
   of cell sickling, unsickling, and cell rheology. We created short-term
   and long-termhypoxic conditions to simulate normal and retarded transit
   scenarios in microvasculature. Using blood samples from 25 SCD patients
   with sickle hemoglobin (HbS) levels varying from 64 to 90.1\%, we
   investigated how cell biophysical alterations during blood flow
   correlated with hematological parameters, HbS level, and hydroxyurea
   (HU) therapy. From these measurements, we identified two severe cases of
   SCD that were also independently validated as severe from a
   genotype-based disease severity classification. These results point to
   the potential of this method as a diagnostic indicator of disease
   severity. In addition, we investigated the role of cell density in the
   kinetics of cell sickling. We observed an effect of HU therapy mainly in
   relatively dense cell populations, and that the sickled fraction
   increased with cell density. These results lend support to the
   possibility that the microfluidic platform developed here offers a
   unique and quantitative approach to assess the kinetic, rheological, and
   hematological factors involved in vasoocclusive events associated with
   SCD and to develop alternative diagnostic tools for disease severity to
   supplement other methods. Such insights may also lead to a better
   understanding of the pathogenic basis and mechanism of drug response in
   SCD.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{49-63}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{New two-stage-riser fluidized catalytic pyrolysis (TSRFCP) for
   maximizing propylene yield technology is considered as an efficient
   route to moderate the propylene demand/supply gap and to lower the
   propylene price. The possibility of existence of complex nonlinear
   behavior associated with the TSRFCP process puts limitations on the
   supervision of this system. Based on the developed and validated model
   for the TSRFCP process, this paper focuses on the elucidation of
   multiple steady states and relevant (in) stability characteristic over a
   wide range of operating condition. First, graphic analysis of heat
   generation/removal curves demonstrates that the TSRFCP process has at
   least one steady state and a maximum of three output steady states under
   the considered operating conditions and uncertainties such as cooling
   water flow rates and Conradson carbon residue. Then, operating maps
   revealing topologies between important input and output variables can
   disclose detailed nonlinear behavior (input/output multiplicity).
   Moreover, depending on the choice of the input variable and the relevant
   operating/design condition, input multiplicity may exist. In short,
   these results can guide the succeeding control structure selection for
   realistic TSRFCP processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{116-127}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{We address a central theme of empirical model building: the
   incorporation of first-principles information in a data-driven
   model-building process. By enabling modelers to leverage all available
   information, regression models can be constructed using measured data
   along with theory-driven knowledge of response variable bounds,
   thermodynamic limitations, boundary conditions, and other aspects of
   system knowledge.
   We expand the inclusion of regression constraints beyond intra-parameter
   relationships to relationships between combinations of predictors and
   response variables. Since the functional form of these constraints is
   more intuitive, they can be used to reveal hidden relationships between
   regression parameters that are not directly available to the modeler.
   First, we describe classes of a priori modeling constraints. Next, we
   propose a semi-infinite programming approach for the incorporation of
   these novel constraints. Finally, we detail several application areas
   and provide extensive computational results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{E98B}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{267-279}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We show that, in practice, a network adversary can achieve decidedly
   non-negligible advantage in attacking provable key-protection
   properties; e.g., the ``existential key recovery{''} security and
   ``multi-key hiding{''} property of typical nonce-based symmetric
   encryption schemes whenever these schemes are implemented with standard
   block ciphers. We also show that if a probabilistic encryption scheme
   uses certain standard block ciphers (e.g., two-key 3DES), then enforcing
   the security bounds necessary to protect against network adversary
   attacks will render the scheme impractical for network applications that
   share group keys amongst many peers. The attacks presented here have
   three noteworthy implications. First, they help identify key-protection
   properties that separate the notion of indistinguishability from random
   bits (IND\$) from the strictly weaker notion of indistinguishability of
   ciphertexts (IND); also, they help establish new relationships among
   these properties. Second, they show that nonce-based symmetric
   encryption schemes are typically weaker than probabilistic ones. Third,
   they illustrate the need to account for the Internet-level growth of
   adversary capabilities when establishing the useful lifetime of standard
   block-cipher parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, in situ electrical biasing was combined with transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) in order to study the formation and evolution
   of Wadsley defects and Magneli phases during electrical biasing and
   resistive switching in titanium dioxide (TiO2). Resistive switching
   devices were fabricated from single-crystal rutile TiO2 substrates
   through focused ion beam milling and lift-out techniques. Defect
   evolution and phase transformations in rutile TiO2 were monitored by
   diffraction contrast imaging inside the TEM during electrical biasing.
   Reversible bipolar resistive switching behavior was observed in these
   single-crystal TiO2 devices. Biased induced reduction reactions created
   increased oxygen vacancy concentrations to such an extent that shear
   faults (Wadsley defects) and oxygen-deficient phases (Magneli phases)
   formed over large volumes within the TiO2 TEM specimen. Nevertheless,
   the observed reversible formation/dissociation of Wadsley defects does
   not appear to correlate to resistive switching phenomena at these length
   scales. These defect zones were found to reversibly reconfigure in a
   manner consistent with charged oxygen vacancy migration responding to
   the applied bias polarity.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural design spaces of microprocessors are often exponentially
   large with respect to the pending processor parameters. To avoid
   simulating all configurations in the design space, machine learning and
   statistical techniques have been utilized to build regression models for
   characterizing the relationship between architectural configurations and
   responses (e.g., performance or power consumption). However, this
   article shows that the accuracy variability of many learning techniques
   over different design spaces and benchmarks can be significant enough to
   mislead the decision-making. This clearly indicates a high risk of
   applying techniques that work well on previous modeling tasks (each
   involving a design space, benchmark, and design objective) to a new
   task, due to which the powerful tools might be impractical.
   Inspired by ensemble learning in the machine learning domain, we propose
   a robust framework called ELSE to reduce the accuracy variability of
   design space modeling. Rather than employing a single learning technique
   as in previous investigations, ELSE employs distinct learning techniques
   to build multiple base regression models for each modeling task. This is
   not a trivial combination of different techniques (e.g., always trusting
   the regression model with the smallest error). Instead, ELSE carefully
   maintains the diversity of base regression models and constructs a
   metamodel from the base models that can provide accurate predictions
   even when the base models are far from accurate. Consequently, we are
   able to reduce the number of cases in which the final prediction errors
   are unacceptably large. Experimental results validate the robustness of
   ELSE: compared with the widely used artificial neural network over 52
   distinct modeling tasks, ELSE reduces the accuracy variability by about
   62\%. Moreover, ELSE reduces the average prediction error by 27\% and
   85\% for the investigated MIPS and POWER design spaces, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Disasters are dynamic, emergent scenarios involving diverse stakeholders
   in complex decision making and as such, disaster response systems must
   account for these conditions. We suggest that emergency service agencies
   should consider supplementing their traditional command and control
   approaches and common operating pictures (COP), with purposeful
   collaborative approaches. These would facilitate the generation of
   common operating pictures incorporating dynamic and emergent
   characteristics, providing a range of options with which to better
   respond to disasters. Collaborative management and negotiated
   integration of information represent a paradigmatic shift in our
   thinking about disaster response. We have utilized McCann's (1983)
   Social Problem Solving Negotiated Arrangements (SPS-NA) to highlight
   problems with conventional approaches during three disaster scenarios.
   As a result of lessons learned from this analysis we suggest that
   developing supplementary repertoires of collaboration would have a
   positive impact on improved COP for effective disaster response
   outcomes.}},

Title = {{Gravity driven current during the coalescence of two sessile drops}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Coalescence of liquid drops is critical in many phenomena such as
   emulsion stability, inkjet printing, and coating applications. For
   sessile drops on a solid surface, the coalescence process is more
   complicated than the coalescence of drops suspended in a fluid medium as
   a result of the coupling of the contact line motions to the fluid flow.
   In this paper, we use video microscopy to track the evolution of the
   interfaces and contact lines as well as the internal fluid motion within
   a merged sessile droplet. In this study, the fluids in the coalescing
   drops are miscible and have similar surface tensions and drop volumes
   but different viscosities and densities. Coalescence occurs in three
   stages. During the first stage, rapid healing of the bridge between the
   drops occurs just after they touch. In the second stage, slower
   rearrangement of the liquids occurs. We show that these intermediate
   rearrangements are driven by gravity even for density differences of the
   two fluids as small as 1\%. For the systems examined, little to no
   mixing occurs during these first two stages. Finally, in the third
   stage, diffusion leads to mixing of the fluids. Dimensional analysis
   reveals the scaling of the intermediate flow behavior as a function of
   density difference and geometric dimensions of the merged drop; however,
   the scaling with viscosity is more complicated, motivating development
   of a lubrication analysis of the coalescence problem. Numerical
   calculations based on the lubrication analysis capture aspects of the
   experimental observations and reveal the governing forces and time
   scales of the coalescence process. The results reveal that internal
   fluid motions persist over much longer time scales than imaging of the
   external interface alone would reveal. Furthermore, nearly imperceptible
   motions of the external composite drop interface can lead to important
   deviations from the predominant gravity current scaling, where viscous
   resistance of the lighter fluid layer plays a significant role in the
   internal fluid motion. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an IGA collocation method modified by collocating at points
   other than the standard Greville abscissae. The method is related to
   orthogonal collocation used for solving differential equations and to
   the superconvergence theory, therefore we refer to this method as
   ``super-collocation{''} (IGA-SC). By carefully choosing the collocation
   points, it can be seen that the IGA-SC converges in the first derivative
   (energy) norms at rates similar to that of the Galerkin solution. This
   is different from the collocation at Greville abscissae (IGA-C), where
   the convergence in energy norm for odd polynomial degrees is typically
   suboptimal. The method is tested on 1D, 2D and 3D numerical examples, in
   which it is compared to IGA-C and Galerkin's method (IGA-G). The
   comparison includes a detailed cost vs. accuracy analysis, which shows
   an improved efficiency of the proposed method in particular for odd
   polynomial degrees. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   in the CTM PMCAMx to test this hypothesis. The simulation approach
   combines the dynamic calculation of mass transfer to coarse-mode
   particles while maintaining computational efficiency by assuming that
   the fine mode particles are in equilibrium. The resulting model is
   applied to Europe and evaluated for the period of May 2008 against
   ground-based and airborne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements from
   the EUCAARI campaign.
   PMCAMx using the default equilibrium approach to calculate the
   partitioning of semi-volatile PM components between the gas and particle
   phases seriously overpredicts PM1 nitrate levels especially for
   locations in which there were relatively high coarse-mode particle
   concentrations (significant sea-salt or dust concentrations). This
   shortcoming was especially apparent for the Mace Head site in Ireland,
   where a large amount of nitrate was associated with sea-salt. The
   improved simulation of the coarse-mode particle chemistry results in
   significant improvement of the predictions of PM1 nitrate and ammonium.
   Sea-salt emissions in areas with high nitric acid levels reduce the PM1
   nitrate concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although blackbody radiation described by Plancks law is commonly
   regarded as the maximum of thermal radiation, thermal energy transfer in
   the near-field can exceed the blackbody limit due to the contribution
   from evanescent waves. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a broadband
   thermal energy extraction device based on hyperbolic metamaterials that
   can significantly enhance near-field thermal energy transfer. The
   thermal extractor made from hyperbolic metamaterials does not absorb or
   emit any radiation but serves as a transparent pipe guiding the
   radiative energy from the emitter. At the same gap between an emitter
   and an absorber, we observe that near-field thermal energy transfer with
   thermal extraction can be enhanced by around 1 order of magnitude,
   compared to the case without thermal extraction. The novel thermal
   extraction scheme has important practical implications in a variety of
   technologies, e.g., thermophotovoltaic energy conversion, radiative
   cooling, thermal infrared imaging, and heat assisted magnetic recording.}},

   that uses a basis of active sites weighted by a model site probability
   distribution to estimate a bulk-composition-dependent adsorption energy.
   The approach includes segregation under reaction conditions. With this
   method, we can explain the composition-dependent adsorption energy of

   phase may form, which results in deviations from trends on the metallic

Abstract = {{This paper presents a four-element phased-array receiver which achieves
   38\% fractional bandwidth around 55 GHz. Baseband phase-shifting is
   employed to eliminate wideband phase-shifters, power dividers, and
   quadrature splitters operating at millimeter-wave frequencies. Antenna
   weighting and combining are accomplished using a highly digital
   Cartesian phase-shifter and current summation, respectively.
   Transformer-coupling techniques are introduced in the LNA to
   simultaneously achieve wide bandwidth, reduced noise figure, gain
   boosting and neutralization. Cascode-free and folded topologies are used
   throughout to enable operation from a scalable supply voltage. To
   overcome challenges associated with wideband LO distribution, the LO
   network employs multiconductor transmission lines to distribute
   four-phase LO signals. The LO distribution network is absorbed into the
   LO buffers and terminated by distributed LC loads near the I/Q mixers in
   each phased-array element. The phased-array receiver is fabricated in a
   45 nm SO! CMOS process and achieves 26.2 dB (20.2 dB) of element gain
   over 21 GHz (19 GHz) of 3 dB bandwidth with 5.5 dB/9.8 dB (7.7 dB/12 dB)
   minimum/maximum NF while dissipating 30 mW/element (14 mW/element) from
   a 1.1 V (0.6 V) supply voltage. The worst case 1 dB (input) compression
   is 28 dBm at 1.1 V. A worst case coupling of 26 dB (45 dB) is measured
   between adjacent (nonadjacent) elements. The IF bandwidth is 1.2 GHz,
   limited by the wirebond and PCB interface to the chip. The design
   occupies only 0.225 mm(2) per element including LO buffer/distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are being developed to
   assist paralyzed people and amputees by translating neural activity into
   movements of a computer cursor or prosthetic limb. Here we introduce a
   novel BCI task paradigm, intended to help accelerate improvements to BCI
   systems. Through this task, we can push the performance limits of BCI
   systems, we can quantify more accurately how well a BCI system captures
   the user's intent, and we can increase the richness of the BCI movement
   repertoire. Approach. We have implemented an instructed path task,
   wherein the user must drive a cursor along a visible path. The
   instructed path task provides a versatile framework to increase the
   difficulty of the task and thereby push the limits of performance.
   Relative to traditional point-to-point tasks, the instructed path task
   allows more thorough analysis of decoding performance and greater
   richness of movement kinematics. Main results. We demonstrate that
   monkeys are able to perform the instructed path task in a closed-loop
   BCI setting. We further investigate how the performance under BCI
   control compares to native arm control, whether users can decrease their
   movement variability in the face of a more demanding task, and how the
   kinematic richness is enhanced in this task. Significance. The use of
   the instructed path task has the potential to accelerate the development
   of BCI systems and their clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{Just as there are frictional losses associated with moving masses on a
   surface, what if there were frictional losses associated with moving
   information on a substrate? Indeed, many modes of communication suffer
   from such frictional losses. We propose to model these losses as
   proportional to ``bit-meters,{''} i.e., the product of ``mass{''} of
   information (i.e., the number of bits) and the distance of information
   transport. We use this information-friction model to understand the
   fundamental energy requirements on encoding and decoding in
   communication circuitry. First, for communication across a binary input
   additive white Gaussian noise channel, we arrive at fundamental limits
   on bit-meters (and thus energy consumption) for decoding implementations
   that have a predetermined input-independent length of messages. For
   encoding, we relax the fixed-length assumption and derive bounds for
   flexible-message-length implementations. Using these lower bounds, we
   show that the total (transmit + encoding + decoding) energy-per-bit must
   diverge to infinity as the target error probability is lowered to zero.
   Furthermore, the closer the communication rate is maintained to the
   channel capacity (as the target error probability is lowered to zero),
   the fast required decoding energy diverges to infinity.}},

   helps the manufacturer to select suppliers in order to maintain

Abstract = {{Analog layout design has been a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone
   task for decades. To speed up layout design time for a new design,
   analog layout designers prefer referring to legacy designs and layouts
   rather than starting from scratch, or thoroughly applying placement and
   routing tools because legacy layouts contain pretty much design
   expertise. Motivated by such layout design process, this paper presents
   the first knowledge-based physical synthesis methodology to generate new
   layouts by integrating existent design expertise. The proposed approach
   can automatically analyze legacy design data including circuits,
   layouts, and constraints, extract matched sub-circuits between new and
   legacy designs, and generate multiple layouts for the new design by
   utilizing the quality-approved legacy layouts as much as possible.
   Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can achieve high
   layout reusage rate, and hence the designers' layout preference can be
   successfully reserved.}},

Title = {{Empirical Studies of Designer Thinking: Past, Present, and Future}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how designers think is core to advancing design methods,
   tools, and outcomes. Engineering researchers have effectively turned to
   cognitive science approaches to studying the engineering design process.
   Empirical methods used for studying designer thinking have included
   verbal protocols, case studies, and controlled experiments. Studies have
   looked at the role of design methods, strategies, tools, environment,
   experience, and group dynamics. Early empirical studies were casual and
   exploratory with loosely defined objectives and informal analysis
   methods. Current studies have become more formal, factor controlled,
   aiming at hypothesis testing, using statistical design of experiments (
   DOE) and analysis methods such as analysis of variations ( ANOVA).
   Popular pursuits include comparison of experts and novices, identifying
   and overcoming fixation, role of analogies, effectiveness of ideation
   methods, and other various tools. This paper first reviews a snapshot of
   the different approaches to study designers and their processes. Once
   the current basis is established, the paper explores directions for
   future or expanded research in this rich and critical area of designer
   thinking. A variety of data may be collected, and related to both the
   process and the outcome ( designs). But there are still no standards for
   designing, collecting and analyzing data, partly due to the lack of
   cognitive models and theories of designer thinking. Data analysis is
   tedious and the rate of discoveries has been slow. Future studies may
   need to develop computer based data collection and automated analyses,
   which may facilitate collection of massive amounts of data with the
   potential of rapid advancement of the rate of discoveries and
   development of designer thinking cognitive models. The purpose of this
   paper is to provide a roadmap to the vast literature for the benefit of
   new researchers, and also a retrospective for the community.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a linear disjunctivemodel to solve a multistage
   transmission expansion planning problem (MTEP) considering N - 1
   security constraints. The use of a disjunctive linear model guarantees
   finding the optimum solution of the problems using existing classical
   optimizationmethods. For large-scale systems, when finding the optimum
   or even high-quality solutions of the MTEP problem is not possible in
   polynomial time, a search space reduction methodology (SSRM) is
   proposed. By using SSRM, it is possible to obtain very high-quality
   solutions or in most cases the optimum solution of the MTEP problem. The
   N - 1 security constraint indicates that the transmission system must be
   expanded in such a way that, despite the outage of a system line (a
   pre-defined set of contingencies), the system continues to operate
   properly. The model was implemented using a modelling language for
   mathematical programming (AMPL) and solved using the CPLEX, which is a
   commercial solver. The IEEE 24-bus, Colombian 93-bus, and Bolivian
   57-bus systems are used to evaluate and showthe performance of the
   proposed mathematical model and the search space reduction strategy.}},

Abstract = {{We present existence and stability conditions of the meniscus in the

   meniscus is defined by capillarity, we determine analytically the shape
   of the meniscus and an explicit expression for the equilibrium height.
   We then calculate the stability of the feasible curves using a
   variational approach, as well as the conditions under which the meniscus
   remained pinned to the corner of the crucible. We find that the
   single-valued curves describing the menisci are stable with respect to
   weak variations, and that for a given ribbon geometry, the existence of
   the meniscus depends on the use of operating parameters (such as the
   pulling angle and the melt height) that enhances the conditions under
   which the meniscus stays pinned to the corner of the crucible. The
   hydrostatically feasible configurations place a part or the entire
   meniscus above the melt level. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer nanocomposite materials of higher thermal and electrical
   transport properties are important to nanotechnology applications such
   as thermal management, packaging, labelling and the textile industry. In
   this work, thermal and electrical conductivities in nanocomposites of
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP)
   are investigated in terms of MWCNT loading, temperature dependence, and
   anisotropy caused by melt shearing. IPP/MWCNT nanocomposites show a
   significant increase in thermal and electrical conductivity with
   increasing MWCNT loading, reaching 17.5 W/m K and 10(-6) S/m,
   respectively, at a MWCNT 5.0 weight percentage at 40 degrees C. The
   increase in MWCNT/iPP is more than would be expected based on the
   additivity rule, and suggests a reduction of the interfacial thermal
   electrical resistance at nanotube-nanotube junctions and the
   nanotube-matrix interface. The anisotropy in both conductivities was
   observed to be larger at low temperature and to disappear at higher
   temperature due to isotropic electrical and thermal contact in both
   directions. Oriented MWCNT/iPP nanocomposites exhibit higher electrical
   and thermal conductivities, attributed primarily by orientation of
   nanotubes due to the shearing fabrication process.}},

Abstract = {{R- and S-propylene oxide (PO) have been shown to interact
   enantiospecifically with the chiral surfaces of Au nanoparticles (NPs)
   modified with D-or L-cysteine (cys). This enantiospecific interaction
   has been detected using optical polarimetry measurements made on
   solutions of the D- or L-cys modified Au (cys/Au) NPs during addition of
   racemic PO. The selective adsorption of one enantiomer of the PO onto
   the cys/Au NP surfaces results in a net rotation of light during
   addition of the racemic PO to the solution. In order to optimize the
   conditions used for making these measurements and to quantify
   enantiospecific adsorption onto chiral NPs, this work has measured the
   effect of temperature, wavelength and Au NP size on optical rotation by
   solutions containing D- or L-cys/Au NPs and racemic PO. Increasing
   temperature, decreasing wavelength and decreasing NP size result in
   larger optical rotations.}},

Title = {{In Vitro Expansion of Corneal Endothelial Cells on Biomimetic Substrates}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Corneal endothelial (CE) cells do not divide in vivo, leading to edema,
   corneal clouding and vision loss when the density drops below a critical
   level. The endothelium can be replaced by transplanting allogeneic
   tissue; however, access to donated tissue is limited worldwide resulting
   in critical need for new sources of corneal grafts. In vitro expansion
   of CE cells is a potential solution, but is challenging due to limited
   proliferation and loss of phenotype in vitro via endothelial to
   mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and senescence. We hypothesized that a
   bioengineered substrate recapitulating chemo-mechanical properties of
   Descemet's membrane would improve the in vitro expansion of CE cells
   while maintaining phenotype. Results show that bovine CE cells cultured
   on a polydimethylsiloxane surface with elastic modulus of 50 kPa and
   collagen IV coating achieved >3000-fold expansion. Cells grew in
   higher-density monolayers with polygonal morphology and ZO-1
   localization at cell-cell junctions in contrast to control cells on
   polystyrene that lost these phenotypic markers coupled with increased
   alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and fibronectin fibril assembly. In
   total, these results demonstrate that a biomimetic substrate presenting
   native basement membrane ECM proteins and mechanical environment may be
   a key element in bioengineering functional CE layers for potential
   therapeutic applications.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the Benefit of Wellbore Leakage Potential Estimates for

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{This work uses probabilistic methods to simulate a hypothetical geologic
   CO2 storage site in a depleted oil and gas field, where the large number
   of legacy wells would make it cost-prohibitive to sample all wells for
   all measurements as part of the postinjection site care. Deep well
   leakage potential scores were assigned to the wells using a random
   subsample of 100 wells from a detailed study of 826 legacy wells that
   penetrate the basal Cambrian formation on the U.S. side of the
   U.S./Canadian border. Analytical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations
   were used to quantify the statistical power of selecting a leaking well.
   Power curves were developed as a function of (1) the number of leaking
   wells within the Area of Review; (2) the sampling design (random or
   judgmental, choosing first the wells with the highest deep leakage
   potential scores); (3) the number of wells included in the monitoring
   sampling plan; and (4) the relationship between a well's leakage
   potential score and its relative probability of leakage. Cases where the
   deep well leakage potential scores are fully or partially informative of
   the relative leakage probability are compared to a noninformative base
   case in which leakage is equiprobable across all wells in the Area of
   Review. The results show that accurate prior knowledge about the
   probability of well leakage adds measurable value to the ability to
   detect a leaking well during the monitoring program, and that the loss
   in detection ability due to imperfect knowledge of the leakage
   probability can be quantified. This work underscores the importance of a
   data-driven, risk-based monitoring program that incorporates uncertainty
   quantification into long-term monitoring sampling plans at geologic CO2
   storage sites.}},

Title = {{An energy estimation framework for event-based methods in Non-Intrusive
   Load Monitoring}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{488-498}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a set-of techniques used to
   estimate the electricity consumed by individual appliances in a building
   from measurements of the total electrical consumption. Most commonly,
   NILM works by first attributing any significant change in the total
   power consumption (also known as an event) to a specific load and
   subsequently using these attributions (i.e. the labels for the events)
   to estimate energy for each load. For this last step, most published
   work in the field makes simplifying assumptions to make the problem more
   tractable. In this paper, We present a framework for creating appliance
   models based on classification labels and aggregate power measurements
   that can help to relax many of these assumptions. Out framework
   automatically builds models for appliances to perform energy estimation.
   The model relies on feature extraction, clustering via affinity
   propagation, perturbation of extracted states to ensure that they mimic
   appliance behavior, creation of finite state models, correction of any
   errors in classification that might violate the model, and estimation of
   energy based on corrected labels. We evaluate our framework on 3 houses
   from standard datasets in the field and show that the framework can
   learn data-driven models based on event labels and use that to estimate
   energy with lower error margins (e.g., 1.1-42.3\%) than when using the
   heuristic models used by others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   was then functionalized into a difunctional ATRP initiator. Under ATRP
   conditions, outer blocks were polymerized to form the ABA triblock
   copolymer. Six types of samples were prepared based on a poly(ether
   ether ketone) or poly(arylene ether sulfone) center block with either
   poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(pentafluorostyrene), or poly(ionic
   liquid) outer blocks. As polycondensation results in polymers with broad
   molecular weight distribution (MWD), the center of these triblock
   copolymers are disperse, while the outside blocks have narrow MWD due to

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{87-93}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel method is proposed to classify masses as benign
   or malignant in mammograms without segmenting the contour of each mass.
   This method combines the scheme of texton analysis with multiple
   subsampling strategies. Before performing texton-based classification,
   intensity and rotation normalization are applied. Then subsampling
   strategies with either uniform or non-uniform intervals are generated
   and a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier is trained for each
   subsampling strategy. Every subsampling strategy captures one
   discriminating structure. To take advantage of all possible
   discriminating structures, the final classification result is obtained
   by performing majority voting over all subsampling strategies. The
   proposed method is tested on 114 mass regions from Digital Database for
   Screening Mammography (DDSM) database. The classification accuracy rate
   reaches 85.96\%, which is higher than some existing texture-based
   methods.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Title = {{Changing the Renewable Fuel Standard to a Renewable Material Standard:
   Bioethylene Case Study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{93-102}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{The narrow scope of the U.S. renewable fuel standard (RFS2) is a missed
   opportunity to spur a wider range of biomass use. This is especially
   relevant as RFS2 targets are being missed due to demand-side limitations
   for ethanol consumption. This paper examines the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   implications of a more flexible policy based on RFS2, which includes
   credits for chemical use of bioethanol (to produce bioethylene). A Monte
   Carlo simulation is employed to estimate the life-cycle GHG emissions of
   conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE), made from natural gas
   derived ethane (mean: 1.8 kg CO(2)e/kg LDPE). The life-cycle GHG
   emissions from bioethanol and bio-LDPE are examined for three biomass
   feedstocks: U.S. corn (mean: 97g CO(2)e/MJ and 2.6 kg CO(2)e/kg LDPE),
   U.S. switchgrass (mean: -18g CO(2)e/MJ and -2.9 kg CO(2)e/kg LDPE), and
   Brazilian sugar cane (mean: 33g CO(2)e/MJ and -1.3 kg CO(2)e/kg LDPE);
   bioproduct and fossil-product emissions are compared. Results suggest
   that neither corn product (bioethanol or bio-LDPE) can meet regulatory
   GHG targets, while switchgrass and sugar cane ethanol and bio-LDPE
   likely do. For U.S. production, bioethanol achieves slightly greater GHG
   reductions than bio-LDPE. For imported Brazilian products, bio-LDPE
   achieves greater GHG reductions than bioethanol. An expanded policy that
   includes bio-LDPE provides added flexibility without compromising GHG
   targets.}},

   optimization}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{3-20}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Despite the economic benefits of flowsheet optimization, many commercial
   tools suffer from long computational times, limited problem formulation
   flexibility and numerical instabilities. In this study, we address these
   challenges and present a framework for efficient large scale flowsheet
   optimization. This framework couples advanced process optimization
   formulations with state-of-the-art algorithms, and includes several
   notable features such as (1) an optimization-friendly formulation of
   cubic equation of state thermodynamic models; (2) a new model for
   distillation column optimization based on rigorous mass, equilibrium,
   summation and heat (MESH) equations with a variable number of trays that
   avoids integer variables; (3) improvements on the Duran-Grossmann
   formulation for simultaneous heat integration and flowsheet
   optimization; and (4) a systematic initialization procedure based on
   model refinements and a tailored multi-start algorithm to improve
   feasibility and identify high quality local solutions.
   Capabilities of the framework are demonstrated on a cryogenic air
   separation unit synthesis study, including two thermally coupled
   distillation columns and accompanying multistream heat exchangers. A
   superstructure is formulated that includes several common ASU
   configurations in literature. As part of the optimization problem the
   solver selects the best topology in addition to operating conditions
   (temperatures, flowrates, etc.) for coal oxycombustion applications. The
   optimization problem includes up to 16,000 variables and 500 degrees of
   freedom, and predicts specific energy requirement of 0.18 to 0.25 kWh/kg
   of O-2 depending on design assumptions. These results are compared to
   literature and plans to extend the framework to an entire coal
   oxycombustion power plant optimization study are discussed. (C) 2014

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{145-158}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{An integrated chemical site involves a complex network of chemical
   plants. Typically, these plants interact closely, are dependent on each
   other for raw materials and demand for their products, and have the
   provision of intermediate storage tanks to help manage inventory at
   strategic points in the network. Disruptions in the operation of these
   plants can drastically affect flow of material in the site network. As a
   result, the choice of sequence and timing of planned periodic
   turnarounds, which are major disruptions, is important in order to
   minimize effects on profits and production. We investigate a
   discrete-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to perform
   turnaround optimization. The objective is to recommend potential
   schedules in order to minimize losses while satisfying network,
   resource, turnaround, demand, financial and other practical constraints.
   We propose general formulations to tackle this problem and study an
   industrial-size site network under various scenarios over a long-term

Abstract = {{The increased availability of embedded vehicle sensors allows for the
   detection of road features such as potholes. Despite being a promising
   approach, current vehicle embedded sensors operate at low frequencies
   and undersample sensor signals, thus degrading detection accuracy. One
   emerging solution is to crowdsource such undersampled sensor data from
   multiple vehicles to increase the detection accuracy. Aggregating sensor
   data from multiple vehicles, nonetheless, is a challenging task given
   the heterogeneity among vehicles, asynchronous sensor operation, GPS
   error, and sensor noise. Additionally, there may be bandwidth
   restrictions in vehicular networks which limit the amount of data
   available for aggregation. We investigate these issues by focusing on
   the problem of pothole detection. To quantify the detection accuracies
   and effects of real-world limitations, we design and evaluate three
   crowdsourcing pothole detection schemes involving vehicles and the
   Cloud. We also address the issue of lack of extensive model training
   data by demonstrating that a detection model applicable to real-world
   systems can be derived using simulated data. We validate our pothole
   detection methods using 38.1 km of real-world data collected from
   driving on roads in Warren, Michigan.}},

Abstract = {{Video summarization is a fertile topic in multimedia research. While the
   advent of modern video cameras and several social networking and video
   sharing websites (like YouTube, Flickr, Facebook) has led to the
   generation of humongous amounts of redundant video data, video
   summarization has emerged as an effective methodology to automatically
   extract a succinct and condensed representation of a given video. The
   unprecedented increase in the volume of video data necessitates the
   usage of multiple, independent computers for its storage and processing.
   In order to understand the overall essence of a video, it is therefore
   necessary to develop an algorithm which can summarize a video
   distributed across multiple computers. In this paper, we propose a novel
   algorithm for distributed video summarization. Our algorithm requires
   minimal communication among the computers (over which the video is
   stored) and also enjoys nice theoretical properties. Our empirical
   results on several challenging, unconstrained videos corroborate the
   potential of the proposed framework for real-world distributed video
   summarization applications.}},

   difference between the filtered and desirable image outputs. We will
   also relate propagation filtering to belief propagation, and suggest
   techniques if further speedup of the filtering process is necessary. In
   our experiments, we apply our propagation filter to a variety of
   applications such as image denoising, smoothing, fusion, and
   high-dynamic-range (HDR) compression. We will show that improved
   performance over existing image filters can be achieved.}},

   Purpose: We propose a model of global capability advancement, the
   adversarial capability chain (ACC), to fit this need. The model enables
   cyber risk analysis to better understand the costs for an adversary to
   attack a system, which directly influences the cost to defend it.
   Method: The model is based on four historical studies of adversarial
   capabilities: capability to exploit Windows XP, to exploit the Android
   API, to exploit Apache, and to administer compromised industrial control
   systems.
   Result: We propose the ACC with five phases: Discovery, Validation,
   Escalation, Democratization, and Ubiquity. We use the four case studies
   as examples as to how the ACC can be applied and used to predict attack
   likelihood and intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical Centroid Fictitious Play (ECFP) is a generalization of the
   well-known Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm designed for implementation in
   large-scale games. In ECFP, the set of players is subdivided into
   equivalence classes with players in the same class possessing similar
   properties. Players choose a next-stage action by tracking and
   responding to aggregate statistics related to each equivalence class.
   This setup alleviates the difficult task of tracking and responding to
   the statistical behavior of every individual player, as is the case in
   traditional FP.
   Aside from ECFP, many useful modifications have been proposed to
   classical FP, e.g., rules allowing for network-based implementation,
   increased computational efficiency, and stronger forms of learning. Such
   modifications tend to be of great practical value; however, their
   effectiveness relies heavily on two fundamental properties of FP:
   robustness to alterations in the empirical distribution step size
   process, and robustness to best-response perturbations. The main
   contribution of the paper is to show that similar robustness properties
   also hold for the ECFP algorithm. This result serves as a first step in
   enabling practical modifications to ECFP, similar to those already
   developed for FP.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, for linear time-invariant plants, where a collection of
   possible inputs and outputs are known a priori, we address the problem
   of determining the communication between outputs and inputs, i.e.,
   information patterns, such that desired control objectives of the
   closed-loop system (for instance, stabilizability) through static output
   feedback may be ensured.
   We address this problem in the structural system theoretic context. To
   this end, given a specified structural pattern (locations of
   zeros/non-zeros) of the plant matrices, we introduce the concept of
   essential information patterns, i.e., communication patterns between
   outputs and inputs that satisfy the following conditions: (i) ensure
   arbitrary spectrum assignment of the closed-loop system, using static
   output feedback constrained to the information pattern, for almost all
   possible plant instances with the specified structural pattern; and (i
   i) any communication failure precludes the resulting information pattern
   from attaining the pole placement objective in (i).
   Subsequently, we study the problem of determining essential information
   patterns. First, we provide several necessary and sufficient conditions
   to verify whether a specified information pattern is essential or not.
   Further, we show that such conditions can be verified by resorting to
   algorithms with polynomial complexity (in the dimensions of the state,
   input and output). Although such verification can be performed
   efficiently, it is shown that the problem of determining essential
   information patterns is in general NP-hard. The main results of the
   paper are illustrated through examples.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining the security of control systems in the presence of integrity
   attacks is a significant challenge. In literature, several possible
   attacks against control systems have been formulated including replay,
   false data injection, and zero dynamics attacks. The detection and
   prevention of these attacks require the defender to possess a particular
   subset of trusted communication channels. Alternatively, these attacks
   can be prevented by keeping the system model secret from the adversary.
   In this paper, we consider an adversary who has the ability to modify
   and read all sensor and actuator channels. To thwart this adversary, we
   introduce external states dependent on the state of the control system,
   with linear time-varying dynamics unknown to the adversary. We also
   include sensors to measure these states. The presence of unknown
   time-varying dynamics is leveraged to detect an adversary who
   simultaneously aims to identify the system and inject stealthy outputs.
   Potential attack strategies and bounds on the attacker's performance are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Many complex application services are deployed in virtualized Cloud
   environments. Cloud applications consist of multiple components and the
   data flow among these components tends to be highly complex and
   unpredictable. The complexity and heterogeneity make anomaly detection
   challenging. We propose FlowBox, a distributed anomaly detection system
   for Cloud applications. FlowBox considers each server component as a
   black box and detects performance anomalies using the flow analysis. The
   black box model addresses the challenge of accurately describing the
   complex system model. The flow analysis is based on a simple
   relationship of data flow in any given component of Cloud applications.
   Between any two components, the number of requests should always be
   equal to the number of responses within a given time interval during
   normal operations. FlowBox monitors traffic flow in each component and
   continually builds flow signatures in order to describe the normal
   application behavior. Using the flow signatures, FlowBox detects
   performance anomalies in Cloud applications. We evaluate FlowBox with
   several different kinds of Cloud applications in our data center.
   Experimental results show that FlowBox achieves 96.02\% detection
   precision, 3.98\% false positive, and 3.5\% false negative in detecting
   various kinds of anomalies.}},

Abstract = {{In order to support a multi-standard platform, a reconfigurable RF
   front-end needs an optimal configuration that adapts to a dynamic
   communication condition. To find an optimal configuration efficiently,
   we previously proposed the Environment-Adaptable Fast (EAF) optimization
   in terms of the RF impairments of gain, nonlinearity and noise figure.
   However, this preliminary study did not include the important impairment
   of phase noise. In this paper, we extend the EAF optimization algorithm
   to phase noise impairment in a reconfigurable RF front-end. In this
   study, we will propose a novel statistical estimation tool for obtaining
   phase noise spectrum information with the Interpolated FIR (IFIR) model
   and the least mean squares (LMS) adaptive algorithm. We formulate the
   calculation of the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) which
   hastens the optimization process. Phase noise is included in the SINR
   calculation. We demonstrate the efficient performance of the EAF
   optimization method even with phase noise impairment. This study shows
   that while finding an optimal configuration, the EAF optimization
   significantly reduces simulation time compared to the other four
   conventional optimization methods.}},

Abstract = {{As VoD systems migrate to the Cloud, new challenges emerge in managing
   user Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The complexity of the cloud system due
   to virtualization and resource sharing complicates the QoE management.
   Operational failures in the Cloud could be challenging for QoE as well.
   We believe that end users have the best perception of system performance
   in terms of their QoE. We propose a QoE based adaptive control system
   for VoD in the Cloud. The system learns server performance from the user
   QoE and then adaptively selects servers for users accordingly. We deploy
   our proposed system in Google Cloud and evaluate it with hundreds of
   clients deployed all over the world. Results show that given the same
   amount of resources, our system provides 9\% to 30\% more users with QoE
   above the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ``good{''} level than the existing
   measurement based server selection systems. The system guarantees a
   better QoE (above 6\% better) for 90\% users. Additionally, our system
   discovers operational failures by monitoring QoE and prevents streaming
   session crashes. A computational overhead analysis shows that our system
   can easily scale to large VoD systems containing thousands of
   servers(1).}},

   optimal for the fastest error decay with vanishing noise. Although
   suboptimal for non-negligible noise, through simulation, we demonstrate

Abstract = {{A gap in manpower and expertise exists in cybersecurity network defense
   teams. Little is known about how to compose these defense teams with
   maximum capability to address a wide variety of hard problems. Team
   selection can involve a wide array of human factors. We targeted a
   subset of interpersonal personality traits that in other disciplines,
   were related to short-and long-term team performance in dyad work teams
   as well as therapeutic group success. Eight novice cybersecurity teams
   completed the Interpersonal Adjective Scale-Revised (IAS-R) inventory
   {[}31] prior to participating in a 2-day cybersecurity exercise on a
   simulated network. Teams were rank ordered from 1 to 8 based on their
   overall team score tracked in a jeopardy-style score board embedded in
   the exercise. We explored the relationship between team performance and
   interpersonal style complementarity as well as the degree of
   interpersonal maladjustment (vector length). First, we tallied the
   number of complementary interpersonal styles for the top-four and
   bottom-four performing teams using four theories of complementarity
   ({[}7] {[}9] {[}26] {[}27]). No trends emerged to support a possible
   relationship between the number of complementary interpersonal styles on
   a given team and respective team performance. Second, we evaluated the
   mean interpersonal style vector lengths and found that our top
   performing teams had the highest mean style vector lengths; long style
   vector lengths is an indicator of potential interpersonal maladjustment.
   Third, we explored which octant-level traits were predominant in the
   top-and bottom-performing teams. The top-performing teams tended to have
   higher counts of extreme expressions of hostile traits and
   bottom-performing teams tended to have higher counts of moderate
   expressions of friendly traits. Thus, maladjustment in the hostile
   quadrants of traits was trending in our top performing teams
   comparatively. However, small sample sizes and uncontrolled research
   settings make it difficult to interpret these findings with any
   certainty. We aimed to provide results using well-established social
   science theory of interpersonal styles and respective psychometrics for
   future cybersecurity researchers to build from. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) is a technique for processing
   signals from multiple antenna elements over multiple time periods for
   target detection. As STAP algorithms are typical run on airborne
   platforms, they need to be both high performance and energy-efficient.
   Due to the high rate of processing required, many existing algorithms
   focus on reducing the dimensionality of the data, or exploiting
   structure in the underlying mathematical formulation in order to reduce
   the total number of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and consequently,
   the time for computation. While such algorithms target the
   FLOPs-intensive operations within the STAP algorithm, a significant
   portion of the compute time for most STAP algorithms is actually spent
   in low-FLOPs, memory-bounded operations. In this paper, we address the
   computation of these memory-bounded operations within the STAP algorithm
   using a 3D stacked Logic-in-Memory system. The imminent arrival of 3D
   stacked memory makes avail high memory bandwidth, which opens up a new
   and orthogonal dimension for optimizing STAP algorithms. We show that
   more than 11x improvement in time, and 77x improvement in energy
   efficiency can be expected when a 3D stack is used together with
   memory-side accelerators to target the memory-bounded operations within
   STAP.}},

   predicting the speed and gear position of a moving vehicle from the

   application to vehicle sounds is rare. Therefore, we investigate
   predicting the state of a vehicle using audio features in a
   classification task. We improve the classification results using
   correlation matrices, calculated from signals correlating with the
   audio. In an experiment, the sound of a moving vehicle is classified
   into discretized speed intervals and gear positions. The experiment
   shows that the system is capable of predicting the vehicle speed and
   gear position with near-perfect accuracy over 99\%. These results show
   that this system could be a valuable addition to vehicle anomaly

Abstract = {{Contemporary audio declipping algorithms often ignore the possibility of
   the presence of additive channel noise. If and when noise is present,
   however, the efficacy of any declipping algorithm is critically
   dependent on the accuracy with which clipped portions of the signal can
   be detected. This paper introduces an effective technique for inferring
   the amplitude and percentile values of the clipping threshold, and
   develops a statistically-optimal classification algorithm for accurately
   differentiating between clipped and unclipped samples in a noisy speech
   signal. The overall effectiveness of the clipped sample estimation
   algorithm is evaluated by the degree to which automatic speech
   recognition performance is improved when decoding clipped speech that
   has been declipped with state-of-the-art declipping algorithms paired
   with the clipped sample estimation algorithm. Up to 35\% relative
   improvements in word error rate have been observed. Beyond the accuracy
   of the developed techniques, this paper generally underscores the
   necessity of robust parameter estimation methods for declipping in
   noise.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of developing unsupervised learning methods has received
   significant attention in recent years. An important application is
   whether one can train a high quality speaker verification model given
   large quantities of unlabeled speech data. Unsupervised learning methods
   such as data clustering often play a central role since they are able to
   analyze the underlying latent patterns without any supervision
   information. In this paper, we focus on developing an effective
   clustering method for speech data. We propose the locality constrained
   transitive distance, a distance measure which better models speech data
   with arbitrarily shaped clusters. We also propose a robust top-down
   clustering framework on top of the distance measure to generate accurate
   cluster labels. Experimental results show the good performance of the
   proposed method.}},

   by LNCC is 33\%. The use of LNCC in combination with spectral
   subtraction provides a reduction in EER averaging 18\% when compared to
   MFCC features also with spectral subtraction. In addition, sub-band LNCC
   is proposed to improve the estimation of noise energy and hence the
   effectiveness of spectral subtraction. When compared with MFCC features,
   the use of sub-band LNCC led to greater reductions in EER than LNCC with
   non-stationary noise.}},

Abstract = {{Deep Neural Network (DNN) acoustic models have yielded many
   state-of-the-art results in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks.
   More recently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models have been shown to
   outperform DNNs counterparts. However, state-of-the-art DNN and RNN
   models tend to be impractical to deploy on embedded systems with limited
   computational capacity. Traditionally, the approach for embedded
   platforms is to either train a small DNN directly, or to train a small
   DNN that learns the output distribution of a large DNN. In this paper,
   we utilize a state-of-the-art RNN to transfer knowledge to small DNN. We
   use the RNN model to generate soft alignments and minimize the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence against the small DNN. The small DNN trained
   on the soft RNN alignments achieved a 3.9 WER on the Wall Street Journal
   (WSJ) eval92 task compared to a baseline 4.6 WER or more than 13\%
   relative improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Self-adaptive systems overcome many of the limitations of human
   supervision in complex software-intensive systems by endowing them with
   the ability to automatically adapt their structure and behavior in the
   presence of runtime changes. However, adaptation in some classes of
   systems (e.g., safety-critical) can benefit by receiving information
   from humans (e.g., acting as sophisticated sensors, decision-makers), or
   by involving them as system-level effectors to execute adaptations
   (e.g., when automation is not possible, or as a fallback mechanism).
   However, human participants are influenced by factors external to the
   system (e.g., training level, fatigue) that affect the likelihood of
   success when they perform a task, its duration, or even if they are
   willing to perform it in the first place. Without careful consideration
   of these factors, it is unclear how to decide when to involve humans in
   adaptation, and in which way. In this paper, we investigate how the
   explicit modeling of human participants can provide a better insight
   into the trade-offs of involving humans in adaptation. We contribute a
   formal framework to reason about human involvement in self-adaptation,
   focusing on the role of human participants as actors (i.e., effectors)
   during the execution stage of adaptation. The approach consists of: (i)
   a language to express adaptation models that capture factors affecting
   human behavior and its interactions with the system, and (ii) a
   formalization of these adaptation models as stochastic multiplayer games
   (SMGs) that can be used to analyze human-system-environment
   interactions. We illustrate our approach in an adaptive industrial
   middleware used to monitor and manage sensor networks in renewable
   energy production plants.}},

Abstract = {{Self-adaptive systems tend to be reactive and myopic, adapting in
   response to changes without anticipating what the subsequent adaptation
   needs will be. Adapting reactively can result in inefficiencies due to
   the system performing a suboptimal sequence of adaptations. Furthermore,
   when adaptations have latency, and take some time to produce their
   effect, they have to be started with sufficient lead time so that they
   complete by the time their effect is needed. Proactive latency-aware
   adaptation addresses these issues by making adaptation decisions with a
   look-ahead horizon and taking adaptation latency into account. In this
   paper we present an approach for proactive latency-aware adaptation
   under uncertainty that uses probabilistic model checking for adaptation
   decisions. The key idea is to use a formal model of the adaptive system
   in which the adaptation decision is left underspecified through
   nondeterminism, and have the model checker resolve the nondeterministic
   choices so that the accumulated utility over the horizon is maximized.
   The adaptation decision is optimal over the horizon, and takes into
   account the inherent uncertainty of the environment predictions needed
   for looking ahead. Our results show that the decision based on a
   look-ahead horizon, and the factoring of both tactic latency and
   environment uncertainty, considerably improve the effectiveness of
   adaptation decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The technical debt metaphor is widely used to encapsulate numerous
   software quality problems. The metaphor is attractive to practitioners
   as it communicates to both technical and nontechnical audiences that if
   quality problems are not addressed, things may get worse. However, it is
   unclear whether there are practices that move this metaphor beyond a
   mere communication mechanism. Existing studies of technical debt have
   largely focused on code metrics and small surveys of developers. In this
   paper, we report on our survey of 1,831 participants, primarily software
   engineers and architects working in long-lived, software-intensive
   projects from three large organizations, and follow-up interviews of
   seven software engineers. We analyzed our data using both nonparametric
   statistics and qualitative text analysis. We found that architectural
   decisions are the most important source of technical debt. Furthermore,
   while respondents believe the metaphor is itself important for
   communication, existing tools are not currently helpful in managing the
   details. We use our results to motivate a technical debt timeline to
   focus management and tooling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We provide the first constructions of a new family of error-correcting
   codes called ``energy-adaptive codes.{''} These codes are designed to
   enable adaptive circuit implementations that minimize the total
   system-level energy based on varying distances and target error
   probabilities. Recent work has explored fundamental limits and practical
   strategies for minimizing total (transmit + circuit) power, considering
   both power consumed in computational nodes as well as wires in the
   circuit. It is now established that to minimize total power, code choice
   and circuit-design should change with communication distances and/or
   target error probability. Motivated by circuit area constraints, the
   energy-adaptive codes adapt energy consumption as distances and/or
   target error probability change. These codes shrink and expand the
   wiring area they occupy as demands on the system change, adjusting the
   hardware by turning on and off non-local wires in the circuit. The code
   constructions are hierarchical, and use QC-LDPC codes as the basis. We
   estimate the decoding power savings attained by use of these codes
   through simulation results. Such codes can be of increasing utility as
   we enter the era of 1000 devices per person where designing the skilled
   labor for obtaining optimized designs for each system will simply be
   unavailable. While our first constructions are admittedly simplistic,
   the goal of the paper is to bring this new problem to the attention of
   the coding-theory community.}},

   in a tree network. We examine two cases: (i) data aggregation (only one
   sink node computes) and (ii) consensus (all nodes compute the same
   function). By quantifying the information dissipation in distributed
   computing, we obtain fundamental limits on network computation rate as a
   function of incremental distortions (and hence incremental information
   dissipation) along the edges of the network, and not just the overall
   distortions used classically. Combining this observation with an
   inequality on the dominance of mean-square measures over
   relative-entropy measures, we obtain lower bounds on the rate-distortion
   function that are tighter than classical cut-set bounds by a difference
   which can be arbitrarily large in both data aggregation and consensus.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes two novel methods for distributed simulation of
   nonlinear power system dynamics, which are named two-level integration
   and interaction-level integration. An underlying assumption is that the
   simulation of dynamic response is distributed spatially, i.e. each power
   system component and/or each group of components perform numerical
   integration of their own states while occasionally communicating
   relevant information with their neighbors. The novelty of the proposed
   methods is in exploiting the structure of dynamic equations of typical
   power system components to shorten the total simulation time in this
   distributed setting. The proposed methods consist of a number of state
   transformations on the dynamical power system model which bring this
   model into a form favored for distributed numerical integration. These
   transformations, proposed first in {[}1] and {[}2] for control design,
   separate internal component dynamics from dynamics of its interactions
   with neighboring components. It is further shown on a simple example
   that it is sufficient to exchange the information between components at
   a rate determined by the dynamics of the interaction variables to
   successfully perform numerical integration of the entire power system
   model with a significant improvement in simulation time. Since the
   proposed methods are based on the state transformation of the power
   system model, this approach could be used together with other numerical
   and machine-level programming optimization techniques to further enhance
   performance of the power system dynamics simulator.}},
