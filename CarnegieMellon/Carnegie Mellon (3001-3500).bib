Abstract = {{Filamentary conduction via dislocations has been considered to be a
   mechanism driving resistive switching in SrTiO3 single-crystals. This
   possible mechanism is further investigated by fabricating Pt-SrTiO3-Pt
   lateral devices on high dislocation density areas as well as
   dislocation-free areas of single-crystal SrTiO3, and using electron
   channeling contrast imaging and dislocation-selective wet chemical
   etching to track pre-existing dislocations and dislocations nucleated
   during electrical biasing. Device size, compliance levels, and vacancy
   concentration were observed to impact dislocation formation. The
   susceptibility of SrTiO3 to dislocation formation and strategies to
   avoid it by reducing power dissipation are discussed. The presence of
   dislocations is found to have a negligible effect on the device
   resistive switching behavior. Dislocation-free resistive switching
   devices are demonstrated for reduced single-crystalline SrTiO3. (C) 2013

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Bio-inspired studies of micro-objects in microfluidics demand
   quantitative microflow visualization tools to evaluate their
   three-dimensional (3D) fluid dynamic performance. Experimental fluid
   dynamic measurements of bio-hybrid systems are employed when
   non-traditional small-scales, magnetohydrodynamic coupling and nonlinear
   material properties are involved. In this study a stereoscopic
   micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (mu PIV) system was developed to
   characterize instantaneous flow fields induced by (1) a micro-robot (280
   x 200 x 150 mu m(3)) and (2) self-assembled magnetically actuated
   artificial cilia (similar to 50 mu m in diameter and 500 mu m in depth).
   A custom built micro jet flow microchannel was tested to provide the
   quantitative evidence of measurement accuracy with 14\% error compared
   to theoretical solutions in the out-of-plane velocity component.
   Followed by these verification experiments, instantaneous in-plane
   spinning motion was analyzed in conjunction with translational movement
   and out-of-plane rotational movements of the micro-robot to obtain the
   induced 2D-3C (two-dimension, three-component) fluid velocity data. The
   second test case investigated the microscale vortical flow structures
   that were generated by self-assembled magnetically driven artificial
   cilia. The strength of this 3D micro vortex structure was computed based
   on the 3D flow measurements. In combination with the asymmetric cyclic
   motion of the magnetically actuated artificial cilia, it is expected
   that these structures can generate transverse flow efficiently in 3D,
   and thus provide a potential alternative for mixing in low Reynolds
   number flows, analogous to a micromixer. The acquired 3D microflow
   field, along with the validation tests, further extends the capability
   of using stereoscopic mu PIV technique to evaluate the performance of
   noninvasive microflow manipulators.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli attachment to a surface initiates a complex series of
   interconnected signaling and regulation pathways that promote biofilm
   formation and maturation. The present work investigates the effect of
   deposited cell density on E. coli cell physiology, metabolic activity,
   and gene expression in the initial stages of biofilm development.
   Deposited cell density is controlled by exploiting the relationship
   between ionic strength and bacterial attachment efficiency in a packed
   bed column. Distinct differences in cell transcriptome are analyzed by
   comparing sessile cultures at two different cell surface densities and
   differentiating ionic strength effects by analyzing planktonic cultures
   in parallel. Our results indicate that operons regulating trypotophan
   production and the galactitol phosphotransferase system (including
   dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthesis) are strongly affected by cell
   density on the surface. Additional transcriptome and metabolomic impacts
   of cell density on succinate, proline, and pyroglutamic acid systems are
   also reported. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   surface cell density plays a major role in sessile cell physiology,
   commencing with the first stage of biofilm formation. These findings
   improve our understanding of biofilm formation in natural and engineered
   environmental systems and will contribute to future work ranging from
   pathogen migration in the environment to control of biofouling on
   engineered surfaces.}},

Title = {{Optimal use of hybrid feedstock, switchgrass and shale gas for the
   simultaneous production of hydrogen and liquid fuels}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{378-391}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a superstructure optimization approach for the
   integration of the simultaneous production of liquid fuels and hydrogen
   from switchgrass and shale gas. The process is based on Fischer-Tropsch
   technology in which the shale gas is reformed with steam, while the
   switchgrass is gasified and reformed (with steam or partial oxidation).
   The raw gas is cleaned up and its composition may be adjusted (using
   either water gas shift reaction or pressure swift adsorption). Next, the
   sour gases are removed before the liquid fuels are produced using an FT
   reactor. The heavy liquids are upgraded using hydrocracking to increase
   the yield towards FT-diesel. A sensitivity study on the raw material
   prices reveals that production costs for the biomass-shale gas facility
   are below \$1/gal as long as biomass price is below \$100/t and the
   price of the shale gas is not higher than \$11.5/MMBTU. Furthermore,
   hydrogen is produced as long as the demand for liquid fuels can be met
   and there is enough shale gas available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Heterostructured photocatalysts comprised of microcrystalline (mc-)

   (A = Bi, La, Y) catalysts to degrade methylene blue in visible light
   (lambda > 420 nm) was compared. The catalysts with the titanate cores
   had enhanced photocatalytic activities for methylene blue degradation
   compared to their components alone, whereas the catalysts with ferrite
   cores did not The temperature at which the ns-titania shell is
   crystallized influences the photocatalytic dye degradation.
   mc-FeTiO3/ns-TiO2 annealed at 500 degrees C shows the highest reaction
   rate. Fe-doped TiO2, which absorbs visible light, did not show enhanced
   photocatalytic activity for methylene blue degradation. This result
   indicates that iron contamination is not a decisive factor in the
   reduced reactivity of the titania coated ferrite catalysts The higher
   reactivity of materials with the titanate cores suggests that
   photogenerated charge carriers are more easily transported across the
   ferrite-titanate interface and this provides guidance for materials
   selection in composite catalyst design.}},

Abstract = {{Analysts and decision makers frequently want estimates of the cost of
   technologies that have yet to be developed or deployed. Small modular
   reactors (SMRs), which could become part of a portfolio of carbon-free
   energy sources, are one such technology. Existing estimates of likely
   SMR costs rely on problematic top-down approaches or bottom-up
   assessments that are proprietary. When done properly, expert
   elicitations can complement these approaches. We developed detailed
   technical descriptions of two SMR designs and then conduced elicitation
   interviews in which we obtained probabilistic judgments from 16 experts
   who are involved in, or have access to, engineering-economic assessments
   of SMR projects. Here, we report estimates of the overnight cost and
   construction duration for five reactor-deployment scenarios that involve
   a large reactor and two light water SMRs. Consistent with the
   uncertainty introduced by past cost overruns and construction delays,
   median estimates of the cost of new large plants vary by more than a
   factor of 2.5. Expert judgments about likely SMR costs display an even
   wider range. Median estimates for a 45 megawatts-electric (MWe) SMR
   range from \$4,000 to \$16,300/kW(e) and from \$ 3,200 to \$ 7,100/kW(e)
   for a 225-MWe SMR. Sources of disagreement are highlighted, exposing the
   thought processes of experts involved with SMR design. There was
   consensus that SMRs could be built and brought online about 2 y faster
   than large reactors. Experts identify more affordable unit cost, factory
   fabrication, and shorter construction schedules as factors that may make
   light water SMRs economically viable.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new generalized multiperiod scheduling
   version of the pooling problem to represent time varying blending
   systems. A general nonconvex MINLP formulation of the problem is
   presented. The primary difficulties in solving this optimization problem
   are the presence of bilinear terms, as well as binary decision variables
   required to impose operational constraints. An illustrative example is
   presented to provide unique insight into the difficulties faced by
   conventional MINLP approaches to this problem, specifically in finding
   feasible solutions. Based on recent work, a new radix-based
   discretization scheme is developed with which the problem can be
   reformulated approximately as an MILP, which is incorporated in a
   heuristic procedure and in two rigorous global optimization methods, and
   requires much less computational time than existing global optimization
   solvers. Detailed computational results of each approach are presented
   on a set of examples, including a comparison with other global
   optimization solvers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heterostructured powders composed of microcrystalline (mc-) BaTiO3 and
   SrTiO3 cores coated with nanostructured (ns-) TiO2 shells were prepared
   using a sol-gel method. The influences of annealing temperature, coating
   thickness, cocatalyst loading, and core size on photocatalytic hydrogen
   production were experimentally determined. The amount of hydrogen
   produced depends on the annealing temperature, which influences the
   interface, phase composition, light absorption, crystallinity,
   mesoporosity, and surface area. The heterostructured powders produced
   more hydrogen than ns-TiO2 alone when annealed between 500 degrees C and
   800 degrees C. The amount of hydrogen produced by heterostructures with
   100-150 nm thick nanostructured titania coatings was greater than for
   thicker or thinner coatings. The optimum Pt loading was determined to be
   1\% by weight. Heterostructured powders consisting of mc-BaTiO3/ns-TiO2
   produce more hydrogen than those with nano-sized BaTiO3 cores,
   suggesting a size effect that is counter to the conventional
   relationship between catalytic activity and particle size. Copyright (c)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Thickness dependent thermal conductivity measurements were made on
   aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films grown by two methods on the (0001)
   surfaces of silicon carbide (SiC) and sapphire substrates with differing
   surface roughness. We find that the AlN itself makes a small
   contribution to the overall thermal resistance. Instead, the thermal
   boundary resistance (TBR) of 5.1 +/- 2.8 m(2)K/GW between the AlN and
   substrate is equivalent to 240 nm of highly dislocated AlN or 1450 nm of
   single crystal AlN. An order-of-magnitude larger TBR was measured
   between AlN films and SiC substrates with increased surface roughness
   (1.2 nm vs. 0.2 nm RMS). Atomic resolution TEM images reveal
   near-interface planar defects in the AlN films grown on the rough SiC
   that we hypothesize are the source of increased TBR. (C) 2013 AIP

Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{The shear failure and friction mechanisms of bioinspired adhesives
   consisting of elastomer arrays of microfibres terminated by
   mushroom-shaped tips are investigated in contact with a rigid lens. In
   order to reveal the interplay between the vertical and lateral loading
   directions, experiments are carried out using a custom friction set-up
   in which normal stiffness can be made either high or low when compared
   with the stiffness of the contact between the fibrillar adhesive and the
   lens. Using in situ contact imaging, the shear failure of the adhesive
   is found to involve two successive mechanisms: (i) cavitation and
   peeling at the contact interface between the mushroom-shaped fibre tip
   endings and the lens; and (ii) side re-adhesion of the fibre's stem to
   the lens. The extent of these mechanisms and their implications
   regarding static friction forces is found to depend on the crosstalk
   between the normal and lateral loading directions that can result in
   contact instabilities associated with fibre buckling. In addition, the
   effects of the viscoelastic behaviour of the polyurethane material on
   the rate dependence of the shear response of the adhesive are accounted
   for.}},

Abstract = {{High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is widely used as the main material in
   the film, pipe, and container industries. To meet the different market
   requirements, a process is expected to be capable of producing a number
   of grades of HDPE products using the same equipment. Given that
   molecular weight distribution process operating conditions with
   different specifications on MWD is highly significant. The current study
   develops an approach for the optimization of an industrial HDPE slurry
   process with target MWD. To exploit fully the advantages of nonlinear
   programming (NLP) algorithms, a complete equation-oriented (EO) model
   including rigorous kinetic mechanism, thermodynamics, and MWD
   calculation is first established. Model validation is conducted with
   real plant data to show the good accuracy of calculated MWD. The good
   performance of the EO model in convergence is also demonstrated through
   simulations. On the basis of the EO model, productivity optimization
   with a specified MWD as a constraint is proposed and solved by using an
   efficient simultaneous approach. Case studies of biomodal and unimodal
   MWD curves for the process with two reactors in a series are presented.
   Further study shows that the optimization also works for a different
   process configuration wit h reactors in parallel. This systematic method
   shows good potential to optimize the productivity for different product
   quality demands.}},

Abstract = {{Pristine silver nanopartides (AgNPs) are not chemically stable in the
   environment and react strongly with inorganic ligands such as sulfide
   and chloride once the silver is oxidized. Understanding the
   environmental transformations of AgNPs in the presence of specific
   inorganic ligands is crucial to determining their fate and toxicity in
   the environment. Chloride (Cl-) is a ubiquitous ligand with a strong
   affinity for oxidized silver and is often Present in natural waters and
   in bacterial growth media. Though chloride can strongly affect toxicity
   results for AgNPs, their interaction is rarely considered and is
   challenging to study because of the numerous soluble and solid Ag-Cl
   species that can form depending on the Cl/Ag ratio. Consequently, little
   is known about the stability and dissolution kinetics of AgNPs in the
   presence of chloride ions. Our study focuses on the dissolution behavior
   Of AgNPs in chloride-containing systems and also investigates the effect
   of chloride on the growth inhibition of E.coli (ATCC strain 33876)
   caused by Ag toxicity. Our results suggest that the kinetics of
   dissolution are strongly dependent on the Cl/Ag ratio and can be
   interpreted using the thermodynamically expected speciation of Ag in the
   presence of chloride. We also show that the toxicity of AgNPs to E.coli
   at;various Cl- concentrations is governed by the amount, of dissolved
   AgClx(x-1)- species suggesting an ion effect rather than a nanoparticle
   effect.}},

Title = {{Design of Complex Biologically Based Nanoscale Systems Using Multi-Agent
   Simulations and Structure-Behavior-Function Representations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The process of designing integrated biological systems across scales is
   difficult, with challenges arising from the modeling, understanding, and
   search of complex system design spaces. This paper explores these
   challenges through consideration of how stochastic nanoscale phenomenon
   relate to higher level systems functioning across many scales. A
   domain-independent methodology is introduced which uses multi-agent
   simulations to predict emergent system behavior and
   structure-behavior-function (SBF) representations to facilitate design
   space navigation. The methodology is validated through a nanoscale
   design application of synthetic myosin motor systems. In the multi-agent
   simulation, myosins are independent computational agents with varied
   structural inputs that enable differently tuned mechanochemical
   behaviors. Four synthetic myosins were designed and replicated as agent
   populations, and their simulated behavior was consistent with empirical
   studies of individual myosins and the macroscopic performance of
   myosin-powered muscle contractions. However, in order to configure high
   performance technologies, designers must effectively reason about
   simulation inputs and outputs; we find that counter-intuitive relations
   arise when linking system performance to individual myosin structures.
   For instance, one myosin population had a lower system force even though
   more myosins contributed to system-level force. This relationship is
   elucidated with SBF by considering the distribution of structural states
   and behaviors in agent populations. For the lower system force
   population, it is found that although more myosins are producing force,
   a greater percentage of the population produces negative force. The
   success of employing SBF for understanding system interactions
   demonstrates how the methodology may aid designers in complex systems
   embodiment. The methodology's domain-independence promotes its
   extendibility to similar complex systems, and in the myosin test case
   the approach enabled the reduction of a complex physical phenomenon to a
   design space consisting of only a few critical parameters. The
   methodology is particularly suited for complex systems with many parts
   operating stochastically across scales, and should prove invaluable for
   engineers facing the challenges of biological nanoscale design, where
   designs with unique properties require novel approaches or useful
   configurations in nature await discovery.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{324-332}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that treated municipal wastewater can be a
   reliable cooling water alternative to fresh water. However, elevated
   nutrient concentration and microbial population in wastewater lead to
   aggressive biological proliferation in the cooling system. Three
   chlorine-based biocides were evaluated for the control of biological
   growth in cooling systems using tertiary treated wastewater as makeup,
   based on their biocidal efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Optimal
   chemical regimens for achieving successful biological growth control
   were elucidated based on batch-, bench-, and pilot-scale experiments.
   Biocide usage and biological activity in planktonic and sessile phases
   were carefully monitored to understand biological growth potential and
   biocidal efficiency of the three disinfectants in this particular
   environment. Water parameters, such as temperature, cycles of
   concentration, and ammonia concentration in recirculating water,
   critically affected the biocide performance in recirculating cooling
   systems. Bench-scale recirculating tests were shown to adequately
   predict the biocide residual required for a pilot-scale cooling system.
   Optimal residuals needed for proper biological growth control were 1,
   2-3, and 0.5-1 mg/L as Cl-2 for NaOCl, preformed NH2Cl, and ClO2,
   respectively. Pilot-scale tests also revealed that Legionella
   pneumophila was absent from these cooling systems when using the
   disinfectants evaluated in this study. Cost analysis showed that NaOCl
   is the most cost-effective for controlling biological growth in power
   plant recirculating cooling systems using tertiary-treated wastewater as
   makeup.}},

Abstract = {{This letter proposes a novel scheme for grouping of radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) tags, based on strongly selective families (SSFs).
   Grouping of RFID tags allows verifying the integrity of groups of
   objects without external systems such as databases or verifiers, and can
   be extended to identify missing objects. The existing scheme is based on
   Gallager's low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and, as such, it cannot
   easily achieve designated decoding guarantees due to its pseudo-random
   nature. Motivated by the strongly selective property of SSFs, this study
   proposes grouping of RFID tags via SSFs, such that designated decoding
   guarantees are more easily achieved. Simulation and theoretical results
   are presented, demonstrating that the proposed scheme can greatly
   improve the performance of the existing one.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the instrumentation for broadband frequency domain
   thermoreflectance (BB-FDTR), a novel, continuous wave laser technique
   for measuring the thermal conductivity accumulation function. The
   thermal conductivity accumulation function describes cumulative
   contributions to the bulk thermal conductivity of a material from energy
   carriers with different mean free paths. It can be used to map
   reductions in thermal conductivity in nano-devices, which arise when the
   dimensions of the device are commensurate to the mean free path of
   energy carriers. BB-FDTR uses high frequency surface temperature
   modulation to generate non-diffusive phonon transport realized through a
   reduction in the perceived thermal conductivity. By controlling the
   modulation frequency it is possible to reconstruct the thermal
   conductivity accumulation function. A unique heterodyning technique is
   used to down-convert the signal, therein improving our signal to noise
   ratio and enabling results over a broader range of modulation
   frequencies (200 kHz-200 MHz) and hence mean free paths. (C) 2013 AIP

   study we distinguish two methodologies that are used in strategic
   management of R\&D/technology: planning methodology and evolutionary
   learning methodology. We mainly focus on defining and describing the
   origins, nature, and characteristics of the latter. We propose a
   framework for methodology selection by investigating context, content,
   and process factors. Using this framework, we provide supportive
   evidence for appropriateness of evolutionary learning methodology to
   develop a robust R\&D strategy for Iran's power industry. We then
   describe the details of operationalizing the methodology for the Iranian
   power industry. This study is particularly focused on delineating how
   evolutionary learning methodology can be applied as an effective
   framework to improve the formation method and content of R\&D strategy.
   We conclude that methodological knowledge can provide a powerful lens
   with which to understand performance of methods, and we suggest that
   evolutionary learning methodology is particularly appropriate for the
   following situations: when the environment is uncertain or fast
   changing, when there exist many stakeholders with conflicting interests,
   and when a method needs to be applied in a context other than the one
   for which it was initially developed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The attachment of inert polymers, such as polyethylene glycol, to
   proteins has driven the emergence of a multibillion dollar biotechnology
   industry. In all cases, proteins have been stabilized or altered by
   covalently coupling the pre-existing polymer to the surface of the
   protein. This approach is inherently limited by a lack of exquisite
   control of polymer architecture, site and density of attachment. Using a
   novel water-soluble atom transfer radical polymerization initiator, we
   have grown temperature- and pH-responsive polymers from the surface of a
   model protein, the enzyme chymotrypsin. Poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl
   methacrylate) changes in conformation with altered temperature and pH.
   Growing the polymer from the surface of chymotrypsin we were able to
   demonstrate that changes in temperature or pH can change predictably the
   conformation of the polymer surrounding the enzyme, which in turn
   enabled the rational tailoring of enzyme activity and stability. Using
   what we now term ``Polymer-Based Protein Engineering{''}, we have
   increased the activity and stability of chymotrypsin by an order of
   magnitude at pHs where the enzyme is usually inactive or unstable.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Contraceptives are among the most commonly prescribed
   medications used by women of reproductive age, but little is known about
   women's information-seeking behavior after receiving prescriptions for
   medication.
   Study Design: All reproductive-age women who visited one of four primary
   care clinics in Western Pennsylvania between October 2008 and April 2010
   were invited to complete a follow-up survey after their visit which
   included questions regarding medications prescribed, information-seeking
   after their visit and their perceptions of the quality of the
   information they found.
   Results: Of the 218 women prescribed contraceptives, 49\% sought
   additional information after their visit. In models adjusted for
   sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics of the respondents,
   women who received a contraceptive prescription were twice as likely to
   seek additional information about their medication as women who received
   noncontraceptive prescriptions {[}odds ratio (OR)=2.06, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.47-2.90]. Women who received a contraceptive
   prescription were more likely to seek information from the Internet
   (OR=1.84, 95\% CI 1.26-2.70) and from the package insert (OR=1.55, 95\%
   CI 1.02-2.36) than women who received noncontraceptive prescriptions.
   Conclusions: Women frequently sought additional information on
   contraceptive prescriptions. Efforts are needed to increase the quantity
   and improve the quality of contraceptive counseling provided by primary
   care providers and the quality of the inforthation provided by package
   inserts and the Internet. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Optimal scheduling of industrial combined heat and power plants under
   time-sensitive electricity prices}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{194-211}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are widely used in industrial
   applications. In the aftermath of the recession, many of the associated
   production processes are under-utilized, which challenges the
   competitiveness of chemical companies. However, under-utilization can be
   a chance for tighter interaction with the power grid, which is in
   transition to the so-called smart grid, if the CHP plant can dynamically
   react to time-sensitive electricity prices.
   In this paper, we describe a generalized mode model on a component basis
   that addresses the operational optimization of industrial CHP plants.
   The mode formulation tracks the state of each plant component in a
   detailed manner and can account for different operating modes, e.g.
   fuel-switching for boilers and supplementary firing for gas turbines,
   and transitional behavior. Transitional behavior such as warm and cold
   start-ups, shutdowns and pre-computed start-up trajectories is modeled
   with modes as well. The feasible region of operation for each component
   is described based on input-output relationships that are
   thermodynamically sound, such as the Willans line for steam turbines.
   Furthermore, we emphasize the use of mathematically efficient logic
   constraints that allow solving the large-scale models fast. We provide
   an industrial case study and study the impact of different scenarios for
   under-utilization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Intralipid}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles are useful as
   contrast agents for anatomical, functional and cellular MRI, drug
   delivery agents, and diagnostic biosensors. Nanoparticles are generally
   cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), in particular taken up
   by Kupffer cells in the liver, limiting particle bioavailability and
   in-vivo applications. Strategies that decrease the RES clearance and
   prolong the circulation residence time of particles can improve the
   in-vivo targeting efficiency.
   Methods: Intralipid 20.0\%, an FDA approved nutritional supplement, was
   intravenously administered in rats at the clinical dose (2 g/kg) 1 h
   before intravenous injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron-oxide
   (USPIO) or micron-sized paramagnetic iron-oxide (MPIO) particles. Blood
   half-life, monocyte labeling efficiency, and particle biodistribution
   were assessed by magnetic resonance relaxometry, flow cytometry,
   inductively-coupled plasma MS, and histology.
   Results: Pre-treatment with Intralipid resulted in a 3.1-fold increase
   in USPIO blood half-life and a 2-fold increase in USPIO-labeled
   monocytes. A 2.5-fold increase in MPIO blood half-life and a 5-fold
   increase in MPIO-labeled monocytes were observed following Intralipid
   pre-treatment, with a 3.2-fold increase in mean iron content up to 2.60
   pg Fe/monocyte. With Intralipid, there was a 49.2\% and 45.1\% reduction
   in liver uptake vs. untreated controls at 48 h for USPIO and MPIO,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Intralipid pre-treatment significantly decreases initial
   RES uptake and increases in-vivo circulation and blood monocyte labeling
   efficiency for nano- and micron-sized superparamagnetic iron-oxide
   particles.
   General significance: Our findings can have broad applications for
   imaging and drug delivery applications, increasing the bioavailability
   of nano- and micron-sized particles for target sites other than the
   liver. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve a tight integration of design and analysis, conformal solid
   T-spline construction with the input boundary spline representation
   preserved is desirable. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is
   still an open problem. In this paper, we provide its first solution. The
   input boundary T-spline surface has genus-zero topology and only
   contains eight extraordinary nodes, with an isoparametric line
   connecting each pair. One cube is adopted as the parametric domain for
   the solid T-spline. Starting from the cube with all the nodes on the
   input surface as T-junctions, we adaptively subdivide the domain based
   on the octree structure until each face or edge contains at most one
   face T-junction or one edge T-junction. Next, we insert two boundary
   layers between the input T-spline surface and the boundary of the
   subdivision result. Finally, knot intervals are calculated from the
   T-mesh and the solid T-spline is constructed. The obtained T-spline is
   conformal to the input T-spline surface with exactly the same boundary
   representation and continuity. For the interior region, the continuity
   is C-2 everywhere except for the local region surrounding irregular
   nodes. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of
   the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of large-area active devices that can operate under
   large tensile strains is essential for advancing the technological
   applications of flexible and stretchable electronics. Here we describe a
   strain relief mechanism to preserve the performance of organic thin film
   transistors that operate under strains up to 12\%. The scalable
   fabrication strategy utilizes sinusoidal topographic structures that are
   directly integrated into elastomeric substrates through controlled
   buckling. Organic thin film transistors are then prepared onto the
   prefabricated topographic substrates by conformal coating methods. The
   stretchability of devices fabricated on substrates with strain relief
   features is demonstrated by characterizing the strain-dependent
   performance of transistors in multiple deformation configurations.
   Devices fabricated on topographic substrates exhibit stabilized
   operation as measured by maintaining high mobilities and on-off ratios
   compared to the devices fabricated on flat substrates without strain
   relief features. The overall utility of topographic substrates is
   derived from the ability to embed intrinsic stretchability into arrays
   of active devices in large-area formats in a highly scalable manner. (C)

   form in manganese-containing steel, yet previous workers reported
   finding copper sulfide in transmission electron microscope samples which
   had been prepared by electropolishing. It is proposed that copper
   sulfide can form during electrolytic dissolution because of the much
   greater stability of copper sulfide relative to manganese sulfide in
   contact with an electrolyte containing copper and manganese cations.
   This mechanism has been demonstrated with aluminum-killed steel samples.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing environments provide on-demand resource provisioning,
   allowing applications to elastically scale. However, application
   benchmarks currently being used to test cloud management systems are not
   designed for this purpose. This results in resource underprovisioning
   and quality-of-service (QoS) violations when systems tested using these
   benchmarks are deployed in production environments. We present C-MART, a
   benchmark designed to emulate a modern web application running in a
   cloud computing environment. It is designed using the cloud computing
   paradigm of elastic scalability at every application tier and utilizes
   modern web-based technologies such as HTML5, AJAX, jQuery, and SQLite.
   C-MART consists of a web application, client emulator, deployment
   server, and scaling API. The deployment server automatically deploys and
   configures the test environment in orders of magnitude less time than
   current benchmarks. The scaling API allows users to define and provision
   their own customized datacenter. The client emulator generates the web
   workload for the application by emulating complex and varied client
   behaviors, including decisions based on page content and prior history.
   We show that C-MART can detect problems in management systems that
   previous benchmarks fail to identify, such as an increase from 4.4 to 50
   percent error in predicting server CPU utilization and resource
   underprovisioning in 22 percent of QoS measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic flow and microstructure evolution during sub- and supersolvus
   forging and subsequent supersolvus heat treatment of the
   powder-metallurgy superalloy LSHR (low-solvus, high-refractory) were
   investigated to develop an understanding of methods that can be used to
   obtain a moderately coarse gamma grain size under well-controlled
   conditions. To this end, isothermal, hot compression tests were
   conducted over broad ranges of temperature {[}(1144 K to 1450 K) 871 A
   degrees C to 1177 A degrees C] and constant true strain rate (0.0005 to
   10 s(-1)). At low temperatures, deformation was generally characterized
   by flow softening and dynamic recrystallization that led to a decrease
   in grain size. At high subsolvus temperatures and low strain rates,
   steady-state flow or flow hardening was observed. These latter behaviors
   were ascribed to superplastic deformation and microstructure evolution
   characterized by a constant grain size or concomitant dynamic grain
   growth, respectively. During supersolvus heat treatment following
   subsolvus deformation, increases in grain size whose magnitude was a
   function of the prior deformation conditions were noted. A transition in
   flow behavior from superplastic to nonsuperplastic and the development
   during forging at a high subsolvus temperature of a wide (possibly bi-
   or multimodal) gamma-grain-size distribution having some large grains
   led to a substantially coarser grain size during supersolvus annealing
   in comparison to that produced under all other forging conditions.}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{At 300 degrees C, when dynamic strain ageing takes place, the fatigue
   life of AISI 316L for lower strain amplitudes is lower than under
   equivalent conditions at 20 degrees C. Exhaustive examination of the
   changes in: (1) apparent elastic modulus, (2) microstructural condition,
   and (3) fractographic features has been performed to reveal the reason
   for the life reduction. The analysis of apparent elastic modulus
   variations and the results of fractographic observations show that the
   propagation rates for fatigue cracks at 20 degrees C are faster than for
   300 degrees C. Crack initiation however occurs earlier at 300 degrees C,
   in particular for lower strain amplitude tests, due to the activity of
   localised deformation bands as a consequence of cyclic loading. In
   addition to persistent slip bands, a form of ladder-free deformation
   bands is also present at 300 degrees C, in particular at low strain
   amplitudes. When the fatigue life is rather short, the influence of the
   ladder-free deformation bands on cyclic endurance is negligible. The
   ladder-free type of localised bands have a strong influence on crack
   initiation once the material endurance increases with lowering strain
   amplitude, leading to the relative life reduction at the elevated
   temperature. In addition, the incidence of secondary cyclic hardening
   for lower strain amplitude tests at 300 degrees C partly contributes to
   the more evident life reduction. The influence of dislocation walls on
   the propagation of microstructurally short fatigue cracks is also
   examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   various optimized design choices to fit image processing and hardware

Abstract = {{This article is the first in a series of papers, describing
   reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) in the presence of
   metallic copper. The aim of these papers is to determine the proportions
   and roles of Cu-0, (CuBr)-Br-I/L, and (CuBr2)-Br-II/L, and the overall
   reaction mechanism. This paper is focused on the comproportionation and
   disproportionation equilibrium between Cu-0, (CuBr)-Br-I/L and
   (CuBr2)-Br-II/L in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for various surface areas
   of Cu-0 and different ligand concentrations, in both the absence and
   presence of methyl acrylate (MA). Comproportionation dominated
   disproportionation when there was enough ligand present in the reaction
   medium to stabilize all soluble copper species. The relative amount of
   Cu-I at comproportionation/disproportionation equilibrium increased with
   ligand concentration. Cu-I represents approximately 99.95\% of all
   soluble Cu species in MA/DMSO = 2/1 (v/v) at the ratio {[}Me6TREN](0)
   :{[}(CuBr2)-Br-II]0 = 6:1. Under typical polymerization conditions,
   there is essentially no disproportionation, since the ratio
   {[}Me6TREN]:{[}Cu-II] is very large, starting from infinity and
   decreasing down to 6.7, for similar to 3\% terminated chains under the
   initial conditions {[}MA](0) :{[}MBrP](0):{[}Me6TREN](0) = 222:1:0.1, in
   33.3\% (v/v) DMSO, with excess Cu-0. The kinetics of comproportionation
   and disproportionation were both slow, requiring hours to reach
   equilibrium The apparent rate coefficients for comproportionation and
   disproportionation were calculated as k(comp)(app) = 9.0 X 10(-4) cm
   s(-1) and k(disp)(app) = 2.0 X 10(-5) cm s(-1) in DMSO, as well as 3.5 x
   10(-3) cm s(-1) and 3.1 X 10(-6) cm s(-1) in MA/DMSO = 2/1 (v/v),
   respectively. The results of this study invalidate the assumption of
   instantaneous and complete disproportionation, proposed in single
   electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP). These
   findings agree with Cu-0 acting as a supplemental activator and reducing
   agent in atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA ATRP).}},

Abstract = {{The rate coefficients for activation (k(a0)(app)) of two alkyl halides,
   methyl 2-bromopropionate, MBrP, and Br-capped poly(methyl acrylate), by
   Cu-0 were determined under various conditions. The value of k(a0)(app)
   was studied in two solvents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile
   (MeCN), and their mixtures with methyl acrylate (MA), using
   tris{[}2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine (Me6TREN) and
   tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) as ligands. The experiments showed
   that the rate of activation increased with the surface area of Cu-0 but
   was typically not affected by the ratio of ligand to initiator, if a
   sufficient amount of ligand was present. The choice of solvent and
   presence of monomer/polymer had a small influence on k(a0)(app). The
   activation rate coefficient of MBrP was k(a0)(app). 1.8 X 10(-4) cm
   s(-1) with Me6TREN as the ligand in DMSO at 25 degrees C while the
   activation rate coefficient of Br-capped poly(methyl acrylate) by Cu was
   slightly lower, k(a0)(app) = 1.0 X 10(-4) cm s(-1), as measured in a
   polymerization of MA in MA/DMSO = 1/1 (v/v) with Me6TREN. On the basis
   of the measured rate coefficients, the activation rate of MBrP by 1 mM
   (CuBr)-Br-I/Me6TREN (k(a1)(app) = 3.2 X 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) is similar to
   the activation rate by 2 km Cu-0 wire with diameter of 025 mm in 7 mL of
   DMSO. Thus, under typical conditions, conducted in the presence of ca. 1
   cm Cu-0 wire, alkyl halides are predominantly activated by Cu-I species.
   Consequently, Cu-0 acts as a supplemental activator and also as a
   reducing agent (SARA) because cornproportionation dominates
   disproportionation, for the polymerization of MA in DMSO. These results
   support the SARA ATRP mechanism rather than the proposed single electron
   transfer-living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) process, which requires
   exclusive activation by Cu-0 and instantaneous disproportionation of
   Cu-I.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of methyl acrylate
   in DMSO in the presence of Cu-0 was studied by kinetic simulations
   Kinetic simulations give access to the rates and contributions of all
   reactions, including those of activation of alkyl halides by Cu-I and
   Cu-0 species, disproportionation of Cu-I species, and comproportionation
   between Cu-II and Cu-0. Every relevant reaction was quantified by
   experimentally measured rate coefficients. The rates and contributions
   allow the exact roles of Cu-0 and Cu-I species to be evaluated. These
   simulations show that the control over the polymerization is due to the
   atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) dynamic equilibrium with
   Cu-I as the major activator and Cu-II as the major deactivator. The ATRP
   equilibrium is maintained throughout the entire process The simulations
   confirmed earlier experimental findings that in dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO) with tris{[}2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine (Me6TREN) ligand
   comproportionation between Cu-0 and Cu-II species dominates
   disproportionation of Cu-I species, with both reactions being relatively
   slow. The contribution of Cu-0 activation of alkyl halides to the
   overall reaction is very small, and plays only a supplemental role,
   since alkyl halides are predominantly activated by Cu-I species The
   effect of Cu-0 activity on polymerization rate and livingness were also
   studied by a series of simulations. In all cases, the rate of
   supplemental activation by Cu-0 was similar to the rate of radical
   termination, with both being relatively low in order to preserve the
   livingness of the chains. Cu-0 not only acts as a supplemental activator
   (SA), but also as a reducing agent (RA) and it is able to regenerate
   Cu-I from Cu-II, through comproportionation. Simulations based on
   experimentally measured rate coefficients showed that Cu-0 acts as a
   supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA) and the results of an
   RDRP in the presence of Cu-0 are consistent with the SARA ATRP
   mechanism, and in direct conflict with the single electron transfer
   living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) mechanism The kinetic analysis
   also revealed that the contribution of disproportionation of Cu-I to the
   polymerization kinetics is negligible, and that the Cu-I species are
   predominantly involved in activation reactions The effect of the surface
   area of Cu-0, the effect of initially added Cu-II species, and other
   reaction parameters are discussed in light of SARA ATRP.}},

Abstract = {{The propensity of particle brush materials to form long-ranged ordered
   assembly structures is shown to sensitively depend on the brush
   architecture (i.e., the particle radius as well as molecular weight and
   grafting density of surface bound chains). In the limit of stretched
   chain conformations of surface grafted chains the formation of regular
   particle array structures is observed and interpreted as a consequence
   of hard-sphere-type interactions between polymer grafted particles. As
   the degree of polymerization of surface grafted chains increases beyond
   a threshold value, a reduction of the structural regularity is observed
   that is rationalized with the increased volume occupied by relaxed
   polymer segments. The capacity of polymer grafts to increase or decrease
   order in particle brush assembly structures is interpreted on the basis
   of a mean-field scaling model, and ``design criteria{''} are developed
   to help guide the future synthesis of colloidal systems that are capable
   of forming mechanically robust yet ordered assembly structures.}},

Abstract = {{Suitable design of periodic metal/polymer composite materials is shown
   to facilitate resonant tunneling of light at absorbing wavelengths and
   to provide a means to significantly reduce optical absorption losses in
   polymer-based metallodielectric composite structures. The conditions for
   resonant tunneling are established based on the concept of ``photonic
   band edge alignment{''} in 1D-periodic systems. For the particular case
   of a four-layer gold/polystyrene laminate structure, it is shown that
   the matching of the lower band edge of the 1D-periodic structure with
   the plasma frequency of the metal component facilitates the increase of
   optical transmission by about 500\% as compared to monolithic film
   structures of equal total thickness. The effect of sheet thickness on
   the optical properties of thin metal films is determined and shown to be
   an important prerequisite for the reliable prediction of resonant
   metallodielectric structures. The resonant 1D-periodic metal/polymer
   heterostructures are shown to retain the flexural stability of the
   polymer matrix and thus could find application as flexible transparent
   conductors in areas such as ``plastic electronics{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Rate constants of activation (k(act)) for the reactions of tertiary
   alkyl halides with the ATRP catalyst
   (CuBr)-Br-I/1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylenetetramine (HMTE-TA) have
   been determined in 14 different solvents. The measurements have been
   performed at 25 degrees C by spectrophotometrically following the
   time-dependent absorbances of the Cu-II species. A large excess of
   2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO), which quantitatively
   trapped the alkyl radicals, ensured the irreversible generation of
   Cu-II. The rate constant for the least active solvent butanone is 30
   times smaller than that of the most active solvent DMSO. In addition,
   the effect of increasing amounts of monomer in a solvent on the
   activation rate has been analyzed. A linear correlation of activation
   rate constants with previously determined equilibrium constants (K-ATRP)
   provides a Leffler-Hammond coefficient of 0.45. However, the activation
   rate constants do not correlate with dielectric constants and Dimroth's
   and Reichardt's E-T(30) values. Application of the linear solvation
   energy relationship of Kamlet and Taft revealed that the
   dipolarity/polarizability pi{*} of the solvent, i.e., nonspecific
   solvent-solute interactions, mainly accounts for solvent effects on
   k(act), while the ability to donate a free electron pair is important
   for some solvents. Quantum chemical calculations showed that more polar
   solvents stabilize the Cu-II product complex to a higher degree than the
   Cu-I starting complex.}},

Abstract = {{We study a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) formulation for
   optimizing the operational costs of gas pipeline networks. The major
   operating cost comes from running the compressors, which compensate for
   the frictional pressure loss as gas flows over long distances. We use an
   economic NMPC formulation, which directly considers the compressor
   operating cost as the controller objective. Due to diurnal gas demands,
   the optimal operation is a cyclic steady state. The controller objective
   and terminal constraints are suitably defined to ensure asymptotic
   convergence and closed-loop stability of the cyclic steady state. It is
   shown through simulations that the performance of the economic NMPC
   formulation is better than a tracking NMPC. The inherent robustness of
   the formulation also ensures convergence to a region around the cyclic
   steady state when demand forecasts are inaccurate. The large scale NLP
   is also solved within a reasonable CPU time making it practical for
   online application. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Military base closures have left 600,000 acres of U.S. land contaminated
   with unexploded ordnance (UXO). Recent research has demonstrated a
   method for quantifying the probability of residual UXO harming future
   land users. Here, we explore how a community neighboring a closed,
   UXO-contaminated military base responds to the probabilistic risk
   information this method produces. We explore how probabilistic
   information affects their risk understanding, risk management
   preferences, risk perceptions, and worry. We test eight different
   communication formats employing varying combinations of textual risk
   descriptions, comparative risk information, stacked bar graphs
   illustrating the proportion of future land users at risk, and textual
   summaries and/or graphical histograms presenting uncertainty. We find
   that stacked bar graphs double the odds of correctly reporting the
   probability of harm and decrease the perceived risk, compared to textual
   descriptions. Providing histograms or summary uncertainty information
   decreases the odds of correctly reporting the probability of harm by
   about one-half, compared to communications without uncertainty
   information. We also find that risk communication formats do not alter
   risk management preferences. We recommend that as EPA reevaluates its
   UXO risk management policies in the coming year, the agency shift to
   quantitative rather than its current qualitative approach to assessing
   and communicating UXO risks.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity of natural organic matter (NOM) motivates determination
   of how specific components in a NOM mixture interact with and affect
   nanoparticle (NP) behavior. The effects of two Suwannee River NOM
   fractions (separated by a 100,000 g/mol ultrafiltration membrane) on
   gold NP aggregation are compared. The weight average molecular weight,
   M-w, for the unfractionated NOM was 23,300 g/mol, determined by size
   exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering. The NOM was
   comprised of similar to 1.8 wt\% of >100,000 g/mol retentate NOMr,(.)
   M-w = 691,000 g/mol) and 98 wt \% of filtrate (NOMf, M-w = 12,800
   g/mol). Ten ppm of NOMr provided significantly better NP stability
   against aggregation than 10 ppm of NOMf in 100 mM NaCl due to steric
   effects. In the unfractionated NOM, the relative importance of the two
   components was concentration-dependent For a low concentration of
   unfractionated NOM (10 ppm), both fractions contributed to the NOM
   effects; for a high concentration (560 ppm), NP stability was controlled
   by the small amount (10 ppm) of NOM, present, rather than the higher
   amount (550 ppm) of NOMf. Therefore, large humic aggregates in a
   heterogeneous NOM sample can have disproportionately strong effects, and
   characterization of M-w distributions (rather than average M-w) may be
   required to explain NOM effects on NP behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The equimolar alloy FeCoCrNi, a high-entropy alloy, forms in the
   face-centered-cubic crystal structure and has a ferromagnetic Curie
   temperature of 130 K. In this study, we explore the effects of Cr
   concentration, cold-rolling, and subsequent heat treatments on the
   magnetic properties of FeCoCrxNi alloys. Cr reductions result in an
   increase of the Curie temperature, and may be used to tune the T-C over
   a very large temperature range. The magnetic entropy change for a change
   in applied field of 2T is Delta S-m = -0.35 J/(kg K) for cold-rolled
   FeCoCrNi. Cold-rolling results in a broadening of Delta S-m, where
   subsequent heat treatment at 1073 K sharpens the magnetic entropy curve.
   In all of the alloys, we find that upon heating (after cold-rolling)
   there is a re-entrant magnetic moment near 730 K. This feature is much
   less pronounced in the as-cast samples (without cold-rolling) and in the
   Cr-rich samples, and is no longer observed after annealing at 1073 K.
   Possible origins of this behavior are discussed. (C) 2013 American

   We prepared SAC solder-FeCo magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) composite
   paste with different MNP concentration and used AC magnetic fields
   localized heating to cause their reflow. Differential scanning
   calorimetry results show a reduced undercooling of the composite paste
   with the addition of MNPs. Transmission electron microscope prove that
   the FeCo MNPs are distributed in Sn matrix of the reflowed solder
   composites. Optical micrographs show a decrease in the amount of primary
   Ag3Sn and beta-Sn dendrites, and an increase in the amount of eutectic
   microconstituents with increasing MNPs. The addition of FeCo MNPs is
   considered to promote the solidification of beta-Sn by providing more
   heterogeneous nucleation sites at a relatively low undercooling, which
   results in the microstructural refinement in the as-prepared solder

Title = {{Assessment of the Holland model for silicon phonon-phonon relaxation
   times using lattice dynamics calculations}},

Abstract = {{We assess the ability of the Holland model to accurately predict
   phonon-phonon relaxation times from bulk thermal conductivity values.
   First, lattice dynamics calculations are used to obtain phonon-phonon
   relaxation times and thermal conductivities for temperatures ranging
   from 10K to 1000K for Stillinger-Weber silicon. The Holland model is
   then fitted to these thermal conductivities and used to predict
   relaxation times, which are compared to the relaxation times obtained by
   lattice dynamics calculations. We find that fitting the Holland model to
   both total and mode-dependent thermal conductivities does not result in
   accurate mode-dependent phonon-phonon relaxation times. Introduction of
   Umklapp scattering for longitudinal modes resulted in improved
   prediction of mode-dependent relative contributions to thermal
   conductivity, especially at high temperatures. However, assumptions made
   by Holland regarding the frequency-dependence of phonon scattering
   mechanisms are found to be inconsistent with lattice dynamics data.
   Instead, we introduce a simple method based on using cumulative thermal
   conductivity functions to obtain better predictions of the
   frequency-dependence of relaxation times. (C) 2013 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new agent-based electricity market model is presented
   in which participants correspond to generation plants as well as storage
   power plants. In contrast to agent-based models where agents use
   learning heuristics and trial-and-error approaches to maximize their
   profits, the proposed model predictive bidding uses multi-step
   optimization to find bidding curves which maximize the expected
   discounted profit over a time horizon in the future. The profit is
   calculated based on an hourly price forward curve (HPFC), whereby the
   HPFC is constructed taking several factors into account. In addition, a
   price adjuster is used in these calculations which allows the
   participant to take into account his market power. The resulting
   optimization problem for each agent is solved using dynamic programming.
   A case study is carried out in which the proposed agent-based market
   model is applied to the four countries Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and
   France to study the effects of constrained cross-border capacities. The
   simulations show that the transmission system operators as well as the
   power generating units have no incentive to build additional
   cross-border capacity, since it lowers their profits.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a technique for measuring ultra-low power oscillator
   signals using an adaptive drift cancellation method. We demonstrate this
   technique through spectrum measurements of a sub-pW nano-magnet spin
   torque oscillator (STO). We first present a detailed noise analysis of
   the standard STO characterization apparatus to estimate the background
   noise level, then compare these results to the noise level of three
   measurement configurations. The first and second share the standard
   configuration but use different spectrum analyzers (SA), an older model
   and a state-of-the-art model, respectively. The third is the technique
   proposed in this work using the same old SA as for the first. Our
   results show that the first and second configurations suffer from a
   large drift that requires similar to 30 min to stabilize each time the
   SA changes the frequency band, even though the SA has been powered on
   for longer than 24 h. The third configuration introduced in this work,
   however, shows absolutely no drift as the SA changes frequency band, and
   nearly the same noise performance as with a state-of-the-art SA, thus
   providing a reliable method for measuring very low power signals for a
   wide variety of applications. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   (Alq(3)) thin films have been investigated as electron-injecting
   materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Electron-only
   devices consisting of glass/tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)/Rb2CO3-doped
   Alq(3) (10 nm)/aluminum (Al) showed an electron-ohmic contact property
   between the electrode and the organic layer at the doping concentration
   of 10\% and higher. The electron-injecting ability of these contacts was
   largely enhanced by the n-doping effect of Rb2CO3 into the Alq(3) layer.
   The ultraviolet photoemission spectra revealed that when the doping
   concentration was increased, the n-doping effect reduced the
   carrier-injecting barrier height by lowering the work function at the
   Rb2CO3-doped Alq(3) interfaces. Also, the x-ray photoemission spectra

Abstract = {{Prior research on self-other differences involving risk have found that
   individuals make riskier decisions for others than for the self in
   situations where risk taking is valued. We expand this research by
   examining whether the direction of self-other differences reverses when
   risk aversion is valued, as predicted by social values theory (Stone \&
   Allgaier, 2008). Two studies tested for self-other differences in
   physical safety scenarios, a domain where risk aversion is valued. In
   Study 1, participants read physical safety and romantic relationship
   scenarios and selected what they would decide for themselves, what they
   would decide for a friend, or what they would predict their friend would
   decide. In Study 2, participants read public health scenarios and either
   decided or predicted for themselves and for a friend. In keeping with
   social values theory, participants made more risk-averse decisions for
   others than for themselves in situations where risk aversion is valued
   (physical safety scenarios) but more risk-taking decisions for others
   than for themselves in situations where risk taking is valued
   (relationship scenarios). Further, we show that these self-other
   differences in decision making do not arise from incorrectly predicting
   others' behaviors, as participants predicted that others' decisions
   regarding physical safety scenarios would be either similar (Experiment
   1) or more risk taking (Experiment 2) than their own decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel and hybridized electric
   gasoline (HEV) vehicles provide higher fuel economy, but have higher
   manufacturing costs and sell at higher prices than conventional gasoline
   vehicles. All other attributes being equal, rational consumers expect to
   recover this price premium in fuel savings over the vehicle lifetime.
   Since many owners sell their vehicle after three to five years, resale
   prices should also reflect fuel savings. Here, we employ data from used
   vehicle auctions in 2008-2009 for paired alternative and conventional
   vehicles to compare the difference in resale prices to the expected fuel
   savings and the five-year cost of ownership expressed as the net present
   value (NPV). To estimate resale prices,we group the auction data by
   season and by year. We then correct for accumulated odometer mileage,
   which accounts for most of the variability in prices. At five years,
   higher fuel economy vehicles retain a higher proportion of their initial
   price than conventional options. The ratio of the resale value to the
   initial purchase price increases at higher fuel prices. For the paired
   HEV - conventional passenger vehicles, the difference in resale prices
   approximates the expected future fuel savings. The price difference for
   TDI diesel-gasoline pairs exceeds the fuel savings; other attributes
   such as performance or prestige may account for this difference.
   Regardless of the mechanism, the fuel savings and higher resale values
   compensate for the price premium for the TDI diesel and HEV options. (C)

   increases vertebral bone mineral density in geriatric female baboons}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB
   (rhPDGF-BB) homodimer is a chemotactic, mitogenic, and angiogenic factor
   expressed by platelets. This biological triad is profoundly important in
   the bone regenerative cascade. Therefore, the expectation was that
   rhPDGF-BB locally administered to designated lumbar vertebrae in a
   soluble Type I bovine collagen/beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP)
   injectable paste would have an osteoanabolic effect.
   PURPOSE: The study objective focused on safety and efficacy of the
   rhPDGF-BB and soluble Type I bovine collagen/beta-TCP to increase bone
   density when injected directly into specific lumbar vertebral bodies in
   elderly (17- to 18-year-old) female baboons.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The study was designed to determine whether
   vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) in aged female baboons could be
   increased by locally administering recombinant rhPDGF-BB combined in a
   soluble Type I bovine collagen/beta-TCP paste formulation.
   METHODS: A total of six baboons were divided equally into two groups.
   Group 1 received 1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB in 20 mM sodium acetate plus
   soluble Type I bovine collagen/beta-TCP. Group 2 was treated with 20 mM
   sodium acetate plus soluble Type I bovine collagen/beta-TCP. Baboons in
   each group also received a sham surgery. Surgery was conducted using a
   percutaneous, fluoroscopically guided approach, and quantitative
   computed tomography (qCT) and radiographs were done at dedicated time
   periods. The qCT was used to determine volumetric BMD (vBMD). At
   euthanasia (36-week posttreatment), lumbar vertebrae were recovered and
   analyzed by qCT scans and histology. Funds were received to support this
   work from BioMimetic Therapeutics, Inc. The device that is the subject
   of this manuscript is not Food Drug Administration approved for this
   indication and is not commercially available in the United States.
   RESULTS: The qCT and histopathological data suggested that vBMD and bone
   morphology increased significantly in the lumbar vertebrae treated with
   the rhPDGF-BB-containing composition.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bone mineral density and bone morphology quality of lumbar
   vertebrae in aged female baboons were improved by direct injection of
   rhPDGF-BB in a soluble Type I bovine collagen/beta-TCP paste. Throughout
   the course of the study, there were neither local nor systemic adverse
   effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Guided waves in plates, known as Lamb waves, are characterized by
   complex, multimodal, and frequency dispersive wave propagation, which
   distort signals and make their analysis difficult. Estimating these
   multimodal and dispersive characteristics from experimental data becomes
   a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. To accurately and robustly
   recover these multimodal and dispersive properties, this paper presents
   a methodology referred to as sparse wavenumber analysis based on sparse
   recovery methods. By utilizing a general model for Lamb waves, waves
   propagating in a plate structure, and robust l(1) optimization
   strategies, sparse wavenumber analysis accurately recovers the Lamb
   wave's frequency-wavenumber representation with a limited number of
   surface mounted transducers. This is demonstrated with both simulated
   and experimental data in the presence of multipath reflections. With
   accurate frequency-wavenumber representations, sparse wavenumber
   synthesis is then used to accurately remove multipath interference in
   each measurement and predict the responses between arbitrary points on a
   plate. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{The reduction in fiber push-out stress by transformation plasticity in
   xenotime rare-earth orthophosphate fibermatrix interphases was
   demonstrated. Processing methods for transformable xenotime coatings
   were explored. For conversion to xenotime during processing,
   (GdxDy1x)PO4 solid solutions had to be more Dy-rich than those for
   pellets. Single-crystal alumina fibers were coated with 1020m of
   (Gd0.4Dy0.6)PO4 xenotime and incorporated into polycrystalline alumina
   matrices. Coated fiber push-out stresses were between 10 and 80MPa,
   significantly lower than those for fibers with other rare-earth
   orthophosphates coatings. Phase transformations and deformation
   mechanisms were characterized by SEM and TEM in fiber coatings after
   push out. Bands of deformed coating several micrometers in width formed
   during fiber push out. Cataclastic flow with fracture, granulation,
   translation, rotation, and intense plastic deformation of coating grains
   was observed. Three phase transformations may occur in heavily deformed
   particles in the deformation band: xenotime monazite, xenotime
   anhydrite, and anhydrite monazite. Anhydrite was abundant as a fine
   lamellar phase on (100) planes in xenotime. Selected area electron
   diffraction and high-resolution TEM confirmed formation of monazite in a
   variety of heavily deformed particles. Issues for use of rare-earth
   orthophosphate transformation plasticity to lower fiber pull-out stress
   in ceramic matrix composites are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We find the exact rate for convergence in probability of products of
   independent, identically distributed symmetric, stochastic matrices. It
   is well-known that if the matrices have positive diagonals almost surely
   and the support graph of the mean or expected value of the random
   matrices is connected, the products of the matrices converge almost
   surely to the average consensus matrix, and thus in probability. In this
   paper, we show that the convergence in probability is exponentially
   fast, and we explicitly characterize the exponential rate of this
   convergence. Our analysis reveals that the exponential rate of
   convergence in probability depends only on the statistics of the support
   graphs of the random matrices. Further, we show how to compute this rate
   for commonly used random models: gossip and link failure. With these
   models, the rate is found by solving a min-cut problem, and hence it is
   easily computable. Finally, as an illustration, we apply our results to
   solving power allocation among networked sensors in a
   consensus+innovations distributed detection problem.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed algorithm, named Distributed Alternating
   Direction Method of Multipliers (D-ADMM), for solving separable
   optimization problems in networks of interconnected nodes or agents. In
   a separable optimization problem there is a private cost function and a
   private constraint set at each node. The goal is to minimize the sum of
   all the cost functions, constraining the solution to be in the
   intersection of all the constraint sets. D-ADMM is proven to converge
   when the network is bipartite or when all the functions are strongly
   convex, although in practice, convergence is observed even when these
   conditions are not met. We use D-ADMM to solve the following problems
   from signal processing and control: average consensus, compressed
   sensing, and support vector machines. Our simulations show that D-ADMM
   requires less communications than state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve
   a given accuracy level. Algorithms with low communication requirements
   are important, for example, in sensor networks, where sensors are
   typically battery-operated and communicating is the most energy

Abstract = {{After an intentional release of chlorine in an office district, public
   responses such as sheltering-in-place could save many lives if rapid
   enough. However, previous work does not estimate how fast and effective
   such responses would be for several possible investments in attack
   detection, public alert, and building ventilation, nor whether such
   measures would be cost effective. We estimate public response times with
   investment options in place, and resulting changes in fatalities as well
   as system costs, including false alarm costs, and cost effectiveness in
   terms of cost per net death avoided. The measures do have life-saving
   potential, especially if all response times are at or near the lower
   limits of the ranges assumed in this article. However, due to
   uncertainties, it is not clear that responses would be rapid enough to
   save many people. In some cases total fatalities would increase, since
   sheltering after chlorine vapor has already entered buildings can
   increase occupants' chlorine exposure. None of the options considered
   have median cost per statistical life saved meeting a cost-effectiveness
   threshold of \$6.5 million across all of the chlorine exposure
   dose-response and ingress-delay models considered here, even if there
   were one attack per year in the area covered by the system. Given these
   and other issues discussed in this article, at this point investments to
   improve sheltering-in-place capability appear not to be robust
   strategies for reducing fatalities from chlorine attack in an office
   district.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new supervised learning-based template matching approach
   for segmenting cell nuclei from microscopy images. The method uses
   examples selected by a user for building a statistical model that
   captures the texture and shape variations of the nuclear structures from
   a given dataset to be segmented. Segmentation of subsequent, unlabeled,
   images is then performed by finding the model instance that best matches
   (in the normalized cross correlation sense) local neighborhood in the
   input image. We demonstrate the application of our method to segmenting
   nuclei from a variety of imaging modalities, and quantitatively compare
   our results to several other methods. Quantitative results using both
   simulated and real image data show that, while certain methods may work
   well for certain imaging modalities, our software is able to obtain high
   accuracy across several imaging modalities studied. Results also
   demonstrate that, relative to several existing methods, the
   template-based method we propose presents increased robustness in the
   sense of better handling variations in illumination, variations in
   texture from different imaging modalities, providing more smooth and
   accurate segmentation borders, as well as handling better cluttered
   nuclei. (c) 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{41-50}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Policies formulated to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as a
   low-carbon fuel standard, frequently rely on life-cycle assessment (LCA)
   to estimate emissions, but LCA results are often highly uncertain. This
   study develops life-cycle models that quantitatively and qualitatively
   describe the uncertainty and variability in GHG emissions for both
   fossil fuels and ethanol and examines mechanisms to reduce those
   uncertainties in the policy process. Uncertainty regarding emissions
   from gasoline is non-negligible, with an estimated 90\% confidence
   interval ranging from 84 to 100 g CO(2)e/MJ. Emissions from biofuels
   have greater uncertainty. The widths of the 90\% confidence intervals
   for corn and switchgrass ethanol are estimated to be on the order of 100
   g CO(2)e/MJ, and removing emissions from indirect land use change still
   leaves significant remaining uncertainty. Though an opt-in policy
   mechanism can reduce some uncertainty by incentivizing producers to
   self-report fuel production parameters, some important parameters, such
   as land use change emissions and nitrogen volatilization, cannot be
   accurately measured and self-reported. Low-carbon fuel policies should
   explicitly acknowledge, quantify, and incorporate uncertainty in life
   cycle emissions in order to more effectively achieve emissions
   reductions. Two complementary ways to incorporate this uncertainty in
   low carbon fuel policy design are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Arrays of ligand-stabilized colloidal nanocrystals with size-tunable
   electronic structure are promising alternatives to single-crystal
   semiconductors in electronic, optoelectronic and energy-related
   applications(1-5). Hard/soft interfaces in these nanocrystal arrays
   (NCAs) create a complex and uncharted vibrational landscape for thermal
   energy transport that will influence their technological feasibility.
   Here, we present thermal conductivity measurements of NCAs (CdSe, PbS,
   PbSe, PbTe, Fe3O4 and Au) and reveal that energy transport is mediated
   by the density and chemistry of the organic/inorganic interfaces, and
   the volume fractions of nanocrystal cores and surface ligands. NCA
   thermal conductivities are controllable within the range 0.1-0.3 W m(-1)
   K-1, and only weakly depend on the thermal conductivity of the inorganic
   core material. This range is 1,000 times lower than the thermal
   conductivity of silicon, presenting challenges for heat dissipation in
   NCA-based electronics and photonics. It is, however, 10 times smaller
   than that of Bi2Te3, which is advantageous for NCA-based thermoelectric
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a family of soft-matter capacitors and inductors composed

   embedded in a soft silicone elastomer (Ecoflex (R) 00-30). In contrast
   to conventional (rigid) electronics, these circuit elements remain
   electronically functional even when stretched to several times their
   natural length. As the surrounding elastomer stretches, the capacitance
   and inductance of the embedded liquid channels change monotonically.
   Using a custom-built loading apparatus, we experimentally measure
   relative changes in capacitance and inductance as a function of stretch
   in three directions. These experimental relationships are consistent
   with theoretical predictions that we derive with finite elasticity

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the biomechanical implications of excessive stent
   protrusion into the aortic arch in relation to thoracic aortic stent
   graft (TASG) collapse by simulating the structural load and quantifying
   the fluid dynamics on the TASG wall protrusion extended into a model
   arch.
   Methods: One-way coupled fluid-solid interaction analyses were performed
   to investigate the flow-induced hemodynamic and structural loads exerted
   on the proximal protrusion of the TASG and aortic wall reconstructed
   from a patient who underwent traumatic thoracic aortic injury repair.
   Mechanical properties of a Gore TAG thoracic endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore
   and Assoc, Flagstaff, Ariz) were assessed via experimental radial
   compression testing and incorporated into the computational modeling.
   The TASG wall protrusion geometry was characterized by the protrusion
   extension (PE) and by the angle (theta) between the TASG and the lesser
   curvature of the aorta. The effect of theta was explored with the
   following four models with PE fixed at 1.1 cm: theta = 10 degrees, 20
   degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees. The effect of PE was evaluated with
   the following four models with theta fixed at 10 degrees: PE = 1.1 cm,
   1.4 cm, 1.7 cm and 2.0 cm.
   Results: The presence of TASG wall protrusion into the aortic arch
   resulted in the formation of swirling, complex flow regions in the
   proximal luminal surface of the endograft. High PE values (PE = 2.0 cm)
   led to a markedly reduced left subclavian flow rate (0.27 L/min), low
   systolic perfusion pressure (98 mm Hg), and peak systolic TASG diameter
   reduction (2 mm). The transmural pressure load across the TASG was
   maximum for the model with the highest PE and theta, 15.2 mm Hg for the
   model with PE = 2.0 cm and theta = 10 degrees, and 11.6 mm Hg for PE =
   1.1 cm and theta = 40 degrees.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that increased PE
   imparts an apparent risk of distal end-organ malperfusion and proximal
   hypertension and that both increased PE and theta lead to a markedly
   increased transmural pressure across the TASG wall, a load that would
   portend TASG collapse. Patient-specific computational modeling may allow
   for identification of patients with high risk of TASG collapse and guide
   preventive intervention. (J Vasc Surg 2013;57:1353-61.)}},

Abstract = {{The inner environment of the cell is highly dynamic and heterogeneous
   yet exquisitely organized. Successful completion of cellular processes
   within this environment depends on the right molecules or molecular
   complexes to function at the right place at the right time.
   Understanding spatiotemporal behaviors of cellular processes is
   therefore essential to understanding their molecular mechanisms at the
   systems level. These behaviors are usually visualized and recorded using
   imaging techniques. However, to infer from them systems-level molecular
   mechanisms, computational analysis and understanding of recorded image
   data is crucial, not only for acquiring quantitative behavior
   measurements but also for comprehending complex interactions among the
   molecules or molecular complexes involved. The technology of
   computational analysis and understanding of biological images is often
   referred to simply as bioimage informatics. This article introduces
   fundamentals of bioimage informatics for understanding spatiotemporal
   dynamics of cellular processes and reviews recent advances on this
   topic. Basic bioimage informatics concepts and techniques for
   characterizing spatiotemporal cell dynamics are introduced first.
   Studies on specific cellular processes such as cell migration and signal
   transduction are then used as examples to analyze and summarize recent
   advances, with the focus on transforming quantitative measurements of
   spatiotemporal cellular behaviors into knowledge of underlying molecular
   mechanisms. Despite the advances made, substantial technological
   challenges remain, especially in representation of spatiotemporal
   cellular behaviors and inference of systems-level molecular mechanisms.
   These challenges are briefly discussed. Overall, understanding
   spatiotemporal cell dynamics will provide critical insights into how
   specific cellular processes as well as the entire inner cellular
   environment are dynamically organized and regulated. WIREs Syst Biol Med

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the performance of the Projected Gradient Descent
   (PGD) algorithm for l(p)-constrained least squares problems that arise
   in the framework of compressed sensing. Relying on the restricted
   isometry property, we provide convergence guarantees for this algorithm
   for the entire range of 0 <= p <= 1, that include and generalize the
   existing results for the iterative hard thresholding algorithm and
   provide a. new accuracy guarantee for the iterative soft thresholding
   algorithm as special cases. Our results suggest that in this group of
   algorithms, as p increases from zero to one, conditions required to
   guarantee accuracy become stricter and robustness to noise deteriorates.

Abstract = {{The local histogram transform of an image is a data cube that consists
   of the histograms of the pixel values that lie within a fixed
   neighborhood of any given pixel location. Such transforms are useful in
   image processing applications such as classification and segmentation,
   especially when dealing with textures that can be distinguished by the
   distributions of their pixel intensities and colors. We, in particular,
   use them to identify and delineate biological tissues found in histology
   images obtained via digital microscopy. In this paper, we introduce a
   mathematical formalism that rigorously justifies the use of local
   histograms for such purposes. We begin by discussing how local
   histograms can be computed as systems of convolutions. We then introduce
   probabilistic image models that can emulate textures one routinely
   encounters in histology images. These models are rooted in the concept
   of image occlusion. A simple model may, for example, generate textures
   by randomly speckling opaque blobs of one color on top of blobs of
   another. Under certain conditions, we show that, on average, the local
   histograms of such model-generated-textures are convex combinations of
   more basic distributions. We further provide several methods for
   creating models that meet these conditions; the textures generated by
   some of these models resemble those found in histology images. Taken
   together, these results suggest that histology textures can be analyzed
   by decomposing their local histograms into more basic components. We
   conclude with a proof-of-concept segmentation-and-classification
   algorithm based on these ideas, supported by numerical experimentation.

Title = {{Automatic creation of semantically rich 3D building models from laser
   scanner data}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{325-337}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) domain,
   semantically rich 3D information models are increasingly used throughout
   a facility's life cycle for diverse applications, such as planning
   renovations, space usage planning, and managing building maintenance.
   These models, which are known as building information models (BIMs), are
   often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point measurements
   obtained from laser scanners. Laser scanners can rapidly capture the
   ``as-is{''} conditions of a facility, which may differ significantly
   from the design drawings. Currently, the conversion from laser scan data
   to BIM is primarily a manual operation, and it is labor-intensive and
   can be error-prone. This paper presents a method to automatically
   convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at
   multiple locations throughout a facility into a compact, semantically
   rich information model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and
   modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment
   (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of
   significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural
   indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from
   a voxelized version of the input point cloud. The algorithm learns the
   unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual
   relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically
   label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed
   analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings, such as windows
   and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse
   measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded
   regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to
   intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even
   when partially occluded. Finally, occluded surface regions are filled in
   using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large,
   highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms. (C)

Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{The microstructure of TiO2 functional layers in nanoscale resistive
   switching devices was analyzed using Scanning Electron and Transmission
   Electron Microscopies (SEM and TEM). The TiO2 layers in as-fabricated
   devices were amorphous with very weak lattice fringes in High Resolution
   TEM. After electroformation with low power dissipation (P-DIS < 0.4 mW),
   the microstructural changes in the TiO2 layer were limited to an area
   approximately 75 similar to 100 nm in radius indicating that the current
   path and Joule heating were localized. Since the reset power
   (approximate to 2.4 mW) was greater than the electroformation power,
   switching cycles resulted in an increased area of the TiO2 affected zone
   and more morphological changes to the Pt electrodes and functional
   layers. Electroformation under large power dissipation (15 mW) led to
   massive redistribution of Pt, including shorting of electrodes through
   the oxide layer. Modeling temperature distribution in the devices found
   maximum temperature to be strongly dependent on the power dissipation.
   Computational estimates of the temperature exceed 323 degrees C at
   electroformation (0.4 mW), 819 degrees C at reset (2.4 mW), and the
   melting point of Pt electrode at large power (15 mW) dissipation. The
   microstructural changes appear to be caused by Joule heating during
   device operation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Autocatalytic reaction mechanisms are observed in a range of important
   chemical processes including catalysis, radical-mediated explosions, and
   biosynthesis. Because of their complexity, the microscopic details of
   autocatalytic reaction mechanisms have been difficult to study on
   surfaces and heterogeneous catalysts. Autocatalytic decomposition
   reactions of S,S- and R,R-tartaric acid (TA) adsorbed on Cu(110) offer
   molecular-level insight into aspects of these processes, which until
   now, were largely a matter of speculation. The decomposition of
   TA/Cu(110) is initiated by a slow, irreversible process that forms
   vacancies in the adsorbed TA layer, followed by a vacancy-mediated,
   explosive decomposition process that yields CO2 and small hydrocarbon
   products. Initiation of the explosive decomposition of TA/Cu(110) has
   been studied by measurement of the reaction kinetics, time-resolved low
   energy electron diffraction (LEED), and time-resolved scanning tunneling
   microscopy (STM). Initiation results in a decrease in the local coverage
   of TA and a concomitant increase in the areal vacancy concentration.
   Observations of explosive TA decomposition on the Cu(651)(S) surface
   suggest that initiation does not occur at structural defects in the
   surface, as has been suggested in the past. Once the vacancy
   concentration reaches a critical value, the explosive, autocatalytic
   decomposition step dominates the TA decomposition rate. The onset of the
   explosive decomposition of TA on Cu(110) is accompanied by the
   extraction of Cu atoms from the surface to form a (+/- 6,7; -/+ 2,1)
   overlayer that is readily observable using LEED and STM. The explosive
   decomposition step is second-order in vacancy concentration and
   accelerates with increasing extent of reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol manufactured from cellulosic residues has the potential to
   become one of the alternative energy sources in the portfolio of
   renewable energies. Before reaching that status some technological
   problems must be resolved. Among them are the availability of reliable
   mathematical models for simulation, design, optimization, and control
   purposes as one the major hurdles that remains to be tackled. Another
   challenge refers to process design and operation when several
   conflicting and/or contradictory goals must be met. In this work we use
   corn cob, a widely available cellulosic residue, for ethanol
   manufacturing. Among all the steps that must be carried out for ethanol
   manufacturing we concentrate on the pretreatment process. Hence, the
   corn cob thermo-chemical pretreatment step was studied in order to model
   plant cell wall degradation and the release of polymers and monomeric
   sugars. During the pretreatment step xylose, xylan and some unwanted
   products are attained. We are mostly interested in maximizing the
   concentration of xylose while simultaneously minimizing the amount of
   xylan and undesired side products. However, increasing the amount of
   xylose will also increase the amount of xylan and side products.
   Therefore, both goals cannot be achieved simultaneously, and a trade-off
   solution must be sought. In this work trade-off solutions are computed
   as the point on the Pareto front that features minimum distance to the
   Utopia region. To verify the goodness of the trade-off solutions such a
   theoretical trade-off solution was implemented on experimental
   facilities. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that maximum
   xylose yield, and a minimum amount of xylan and side products can be
   obtained by using multiobjective optimization techniques especially when
   compared against similar results obtained from linear design of
   experimental techniques.}},

Title = {{Minimizing the Health and Climate Impacts of Emissions from Heavy-Duty
   Public Transportation Bus Fleets through Operational Optimization}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to capital control strategies (i.e., investments in new
   technology), the potential of operational control strategies (e.g.,
   vehicle scheduling optimization) to reduce the health and climate
   impacts of the emissions from public transportation bus fleets has not
   been widely considered. This case study demonstrates that heterogeneity
   in the emission levels of different bus technologies and the exposure
   potential of bus routes can be exploited though optimization (e.g., how
   vehicles are assigned to routes) to minimize these impacts as well as
   operating costs. The magnitude of the benefits of the optimization
   depend on the specific transit system and region. Health impacts were
   found to be particularly sensitive to different vehicle assignments and
   ranged from worst to best case assignment by more than a factor of 2,
   suggesting there is significant potential to reduce health impacts.
   Trade-offs between climate, health, and cost objectives were also found.
   Transit agencies that do not consider these objectives in an integrated
   framework and, for example, optimize for costs and/or climate impacts
   alone, risk inadvertently increasing health impacts by as much as 49\%.
   Cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate trade-offs between
   objectives, but large uncertainties make identifying an optimal solution
   challenging.}},

Abstract = {{High-pressure atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of n-butyl
   acrylate (BA) is performed in acetonitrile (MeCN) with CuIBr/TPMA
   {[}TPMA: tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-amine] as the catalyst up to 5 kbar.
   Increasing either pressure or temperature significantly enhances the
   rate of polymerization, while retaining control over the polymerization.
   The polymerizations under high pressure could be efficiently performed
   with very low levels of Cu catalyst in the absence of any reducing
   agents. For example, 100 ppm Cu is sufficient to catalyze the
   polymerization of BA with targeted degree of polymerization (DPT) =
   1000. The conversion reached 79\% in 3.0 h at 80 degrees C providing PBA
   with Mn = 112 000, Mw/Mn = 1.12. Since the initial CuI-to-initiator
   molar ratio is 0.05:1, the molar percentage of terminated chains should
   remain <5\%. For DPT = 10 000 using only 50 ppm Cu catalyst, a polymer
   with molecular weight Mn = 612 000 (DP = 4800) was obtained at 67\%
   conversion.}},

   three-dimensional motion of 5 mu m diameter polystyrene beads driven by
   attached Serratia marcescens bacteria. Away from walls the beads trace
   out helical trajectories, demonstrating kinematics produced by
   near-constant forces and torques. Near-wall motion is observed to be
   more stochastic. The motion of beads driven by single bacteria is
   analyzed in detail, providing an understanding of the forces and torques

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Mobile phone data are increasingly being used to quantify the movements
   of human populations for a wide range of social, scientific and public
   health research. However, making population-level inferences using these
   data is complicated by differential ownership of phones among different
   demographic groups that may exhibit variable mobility. Here, we quantify
   the effects of ownership bias on mobility estimates by coupling two data
   sources from the same country during the same time frame. We analyse
   mobility patterns from one of the largest mobile phone datasets studied,
   representing the daily movements of nearly 15 million individuals in
   Kenya over the course of a year. We couple this analysis with the
   results from a survey of socioeconomic status, mobile phone ownership
   and usage patterns across the country, providing regional estimates of
   population distributions of income, reported airtime expenditure and
   actual airtime expenditure across the country. We match the two data
   sources and show that mobility estimates are surprisingly robust to the
   substantial biases in phone ownership across different geographical and
   socioeconomic groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the theoretical foundation for the modeling,
   analysis and control of integrated chemical process networks, or, in
   short, ``process networks.{''} The dynamics of process networks is
   represented using state-space descriptions derived from classical
   irreversible thermodynamics and constrained by the second law so that
   dissipation is always non-negative. The state descriptions (models)
   derived from this point of view provide exact process representations. A
   unique, quadratic Lyapunov function for stability analysis and control
   design is derived directly from the entropy. The resulting process
   models are complex and simplifications may be needed in practical
   applications. Time-scale decomposition and singular perturbation theory
   provide the basis for exploring the network-level dynamic behavior that
   emerges as a result of tight inventory integration, and developing
   appropriate reduced-order models and a hierarchy of control systems for
   managing inventories and inventory flows. Model-based networked control
   and Lyapunov theory are leveraged to develop an integrated control and
   communication strategy that manages the information flows between the
   network components and explicitly accounts for communication
   constraints. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the widespread availability of model predictive control (MPC),
   nonlinear MPC provides a natural extension to include nonlinear models
   for trajectory tracking and dynamic optimization. NMPC can include first
   principle models developed for off-line dynamic studies as well as
   nonlinear data-driven models, but requires the application of efficient
   large-scale optimization strategies to avoid computational delays and to
   ensure stability, robustness and superior performance. This study
   presents the application of the recently developed advanced step NMPC
   (asNMPC) strategy. This approach solves the detailed optimization
   problem in background and applies a sensitivity-based update on-line.
   Two large-scale process case studies are considered: detailed
   distillation control and multi-stage operation for steam generation in a
   power plant. In both cases, efficient and robust controller performance
   is achieved with nonlinear dynamic optimization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This article investigates the feasibility of using supercritical carbon
   dioxide based metalworking fluids (scCO(2) metalworking fluids (MWFs))
   to improve micromachinability of metals. Specifically, sets of channels
   were fabricated using micromilling on 304 stainless steel and 101 copper
   under varying machining conditions with and without scCO(2) MWF. Burr
   formation, average specific cutting energy, surface roughness, and tool
   wear were analyzed and compared. Compared to dry machining, use of
   scCO(2) MWF reduced burr formation in both materials, reduced surface
   roughness by up to 69\% in 304 stainless steel and up to 33\% in 101
   copper, tool wear by up to 20\% in 101 copper, and specific cutting
   energy by up to 87\% in 304 stainless steel and up to 40\% in 101
   copper. The results demonstrate an improvement in micromachinability of
   the materials under consideration and motivate future investigations of
   scCO(2) MWF-assisted micromachining to reveal underlying mechanisms of
   functionality, as well as to directly compare the performance of scCO(2)
   MWF with alternative MWFs appropriate for micromachining.}},

Abstract = {{We present a scheme of two-dimensional module reconfiguration based on
   interactions between microscale magnetic modules with potential
   applications in micro-robotics, particularly in automatic
   micro-fabrication, non-invasive diagnoses, micro-surgery, and drug
   delivery at unreachable sites. The approach taken is a mixture of a
   top-down engineering approach and a bottom-up self-assembly approach,
   where reconfiguration commands are delivered from outside the workspace
   in the form of a magnetic field, which directs configuration changes in
   the set of modules by changing the strengths of individual magnetic
   moments. The magnetic modules in the study, 750 m in size, are
   constrained to a liquid surface, providing a simplified two degrees of
   freedom translational motion environment, where the laterally
   interacting inter-module magnetic force determines the assembly
   configuration. In this way, the relative distance of the magnets simply
   reflects the strength of the interactions, and thus easily enables the
   design of the system's reconfiguration scenario. Reconfiguration occurs
   when the magnetic attractive forces are changed. To direct the assembly
   morphology in a controlled manner, the modules are addressed
   magnetically by incorporating a different magnetic material into each
   module type, each with different magnetic hysteresis characteristics.
   For addressing different modules' magnetizations, we incorporate three
   different magnetic materials that feature different magnetic
   coercivities. This allows for the independent control of the
   magnetization of each material using applied external fields of varying
   strength, leading to arbitrary configuration change in a three-module
   set and limited control over a four-module set. General cases with more
   than five modules are further discussed.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{614-631}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A major challenge for untethered microscale mobile robotics is the
   control of many agents in the same workspace for distributed operation.
   In this work, we present a new method to independently control multiple
   sub-mm microrobots in three dimensions (3D) using magnetic gradient
   pulling as the 3D motion generation method. Motion differentiation is
   accomplished through the use of geometrically or magnetically distinct
   microrobots which assume different magnetization directions in a
   rotating or oscillating magnetic field. This allows for different
   magnetic forces to be exerted on each, enabling independent motion
   control and path following of multiple microrobots along arbitrary 3D
   trajectories. Path following in 3D with less than 310 m mean error is
   shown for a set of two microrobots of size 350 m and 1500 m, and
   independent motions are shown with three microrobots. It is also shown
   that control of more microrobots could be possible using improved
   magnetic coil hardware. Microrobot diversity is analyzed with regards to
   the effect on independent control. The proposed addressability method
   could be used for the 3D control of a team of microrobots inside
   microfluidic channels or in the human body for localized therapy or
   diagnostics.}},

   systems with large-scale wind penetration}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wind power introduces variability into electric power systems. Due to
   the physical characteristics of wind, most of this variability occurs at
   inter-hour time-scales and coal units are therefore technically capable
   of balancing wind. Operators of coal-fired units have raised concerns
   that additional cycling will be prohibitively costly. Using PJM
   bid-data, we observe that coal operators are likely systematically
   under-bidding their startup costs. We then consider the effects of a
   20\% wind penetration scenario in the coal-heavy PJM West area, both
   when coal units bid business as usual startup costs, and when they bid
   costs accounting for the elevated wear and tear that occurs during
   cycling. We conclude that while 20\% wind leads to increased coal
   cycling and reduced coal capacity factors under business as usual
   startup costs, including full startup costs shifts the burden of
   balancing wind onto more flexible units. This shift has benefits for
   CO2, NOX, and SO2 emissions as well as for the profitability of coal
   plants, as calculated by our dispatch model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a numerical simulation tool for designing passive

   quasi-static model of the piezoelectric actuator bending, transmission
   kinematics, and the small Reynolds number aerodynamic forces governing
   wing dynamics. To validate the developed tool, two single-wing systems
   with distinct resonant frequencies are manufactured and characterized.
   Comparison to experimental results reveals that, although discrepancies
   exist, the simulation is able to predict general trends of wing
   kinematics and lift behavior as functions of frequency, thus, being
   useful as a design tool. Finally, the complex models, ranging from
   actuator deflection to wing aerodynamics presented in this paper, allow
   analysis of the complete system revealing insight into several wing
   trajectory control methodologies, and potentially serving as a design
   and optimization tool for future flapping wing robots.}},

Abstract = {{The design of thermally coupled distillation sequences explicitly
   including the possibility of divided wall columns (DWC) is described. A
   DWC with a single wall can be considered thermodynamically equivalent to
   a fully thermally coupled (FTC) subsystem formed by three separation
   tasks (a Petlyuk configuration in the case of three-component mixtures).
   It is shown how to systematically identify all the sequences of
   separation tasks that can produce configurations that include at least a
   DWC. Feasible sequences that explicitly include DWCs are enforced
   through a set of logical relationships in terms of Boolean variables.
   These logical relationships include as feasible alternatives from
   conventional columns (each column must have a condenser and a reboiler)
   to FTC systems (only one reboiler and one condenser in the entire
   system). A comprehensive disjunctive programming formulation for finding
   the optimal solution is presented. The model is based on the Fenske,
   Underwood Gilliland equations. However, the disjunctive formulation
   allows easily the use of any other shortcut, aggregated or even rigorous
   model without modifying much the structure of the model. Two
   illustrative examples illustrate the procedure. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{In social settings, individuals interact through webs of relationships.
   Each individual is a node in a complex network (or graph) of

   graph. The resulting signals (data indexed by the nodes) are far removed

   elegant, and efficient methodology to describe, represent, transform,
   analyze, process, or synthesize these well ordered time or image
   signals. This paper extends to signals on graphs DSP and its basic
   tenets, including filters, convolution, z-transform, impulse response,
   spectral representation, Fourier transform, frequency response, and
   illustrates DSP on graphs by classifying blogs, linear predicting and

   and by collaborating through mutual information exchange over a sparse

   differently (depending on their instantaneous one-stage random costs) to
   a global controlled state and the control actions of a remote
   controller. When each agent is aware only of its local online cost data
   and the interagent communication network is weakly connected, we prove

Abstract = {{Motivated by applications such as gecko-inspired adhesives and

   increase in interest in the deformed shapes of elastic rods adhering to
   rigid surfaces. A central issue in analyses of the rod-based models for
   these systems is the stability of the predicted equilibrium
   configurations. Such analyses can be complicated by the presence of
   intrinsic curvatures induced by fabrication processes. The results in
   the present paper are used to show how this curvature can lead to
   shear-induced bifurcations and instabilities. To characterize potential
   instabilities, a new set of necessary conditions for stability are
   employed which cater to the possible combinations of buckling and

Abstract = {{Wastewater effluent and sewage sludge are predicted to be important
   release pathways for nanomaterials used in many consumer products. The
   uncertainty and variability of potential nanomaterial inputs,
   nanomaterial properties, and the operation of the wastewater treatment
   plant contribute to the difficulty of predicting sludge and effluent
   nanomaterial concentration. With a model parsimony approach, we
   developed a mass-balance representation of engineered nanomaterial (ENM)
   behavior based on a minimal number of input variables to describe
   release quantities to the environment. Our simulations show that
   significant differences in the removal of silver nanoparticles (nano-Ag)
   can be expected based on the type of engineered coatings used to
   stabilize these materials in suspension. At current production
   estimates, 95\% of the estimated effluent concentrations of the nano-Ag
   considered to be least well-removed by the average wastewater treatment
   plant are calculated to fall below 0.12 mu g/L, while 95\% of the
   estimated sludge concentrations of nano-Ag with coatings that increase
   their likelihood of being present in biosolids, fall below 0.35 mu g/L.

Abstract = {{We describe a 100-channel microreactor array capable of spatially
   resolved measurement of catalytic activity across the surface of a flat
   substrate. When used in conjunction with a composition spread alloy film
   (CSAF, e.g., PdxCuyAu1-x-y) across which component concentrations vary
   smoothly, such measurements permit high-throughput analysis of catalytic
   activity and selectivity as a function of catalyst composition. In the
   reported implementation, the system achieves spatial resolution of 1
   mm(2) over a 10 x 10 mm(2) area. During operation, the reactant gases
   are delivered at constant flow rate to 100 points of differing
   composition on the CSAF surface by means of a 100-channel microfluidic
   device. After coming into contact with the CSAF catalyst surface, the
   product gas mixture from each of the 100 points is withdrawn separately
   through a set of 100 isolated channels for analysis using a mass
   spectrometer. We demonstrate the operation of the device on a
   PdxCuyAu1-x-y CSAF catalyzing the H-2-D-2 exchange reaction at 333 K. In
   essentially a single experiment, we measured the catalytic activity over
   a broad swathe of concentrations from the ternary composition space of
   the PdxCuyAu1-x-y alloy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The oceans moderate the rate and severity of climate change by absorbing
   massive amounts of anthropogenic CO2 but this results in large-scale
   changes in seawater chemistry, which are collectively referred to as
   anthropogenic ocean acidification. Despite its potentially widespread
   consequences, the problem of ocean acidification has been largely absent
   from most policy discussions of CO2 emissions, both because the science
   is relatively new and because the research community has yet to deliver
   a clear message to decision makers regarding its impacts. Here we report
   the results of the first expert survey in the field of ocean
   acidification. Fifty-three experts, who had previously participated in
   an IPCC workshop, were asked to assess 22 declarative statements about
   ocean acidification and its consequences. We find a relatively strong
   consensus on most issues related to past, present and future chemical
   aspects of ocean acidification: non-anthropogenic ocean acidification
   events have occurred in the geological past, anthropogenic CO2 emissions
   are the main (but not the only) mechanism generating the current ocean
   acidification event, and anthropogenic ocean acidification that has
   occurred due to historical fossil fuel emissions will be felt for
   centuries. Experts generally agreed that there will be impacts on
   biological and ecological processes and biogeochemical feedbacks but
   levels of agreement were lower, with more variability across responses.
   Levels of agreement were higher for statements regarding calcification,
   primary production and nitrogen fixation than for those about impacts on
   foodwebs. The levels of agreement for statements pertaining to
   socio-economic impacts, such as impacts on food security, and to more
   normative policy issues, were relatively low.}},

Abstract = {{Educational Badges are touted as an alternative assessment that can
   increase learner motivation. We considered two distinct models for
   educational badges; merit badges and videogame achievements. To begin
   unpacking the relationship between badges and motivation, we conducted a
   study using badges within an intelligent-tutor system for teaching
   applied mathematics to middle-school students. Our findings indicate
   that badge earning could be driven by learner motivations and that
   systems with badges could have a positive effect on critical learner
   motivations. However, badge acquisition patterns were different across
   learners with different levels of prior knowledge. Different badge types
   also affected different learners motivation. Additionally, we believe
   that our findings are compatible with the research finding that
   extrinsic motivators have a negative influence on learning. The
   implication for educational badge designers is that they must consider
   the ability and motivations of learners when choosing what badges to
   include in their curricula. We believe our findings exist as one piece
   of the large research base needed to understand educational badges.}},

Abstract = {{Multithreaded programs coordinate their interaction through

   managed by an OS-provided resource manager. We propose algorithms for
   the automatic construction of code-aware resource managers for
   multithreaded embedded applications. Such managers use knowledge about
   the structure and resource usage (mutex and semaphore usage) of the
   threads to guarantee deadlock freedom and progress while managing
   resources in an efficient way. Our algorithms compute managers as
   winning strategies in certain infinite games, and produce a compact code
   description of these strategies. We have implemented the algorithms in
   the tool Cynthesis. Given a multithreaded program in C, the tool
   produces C code implementing a code-aware resource manager. We show in
   experiments that Cynthesis produces compact resource managers within a
   few minutes on a set of embedded benchmarks with up to 6 threads.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel 2-refinement algorithm for adaptive
   all-hexahedral mesh generation based on two tree structures: octree or
   rhombic dodecahedral tree. Given a smooth boundary surface, we first use
   a pre-defined error function to detect the main surface features, and
   build a strongly-balanced octree. Then a novel 2-refinement algorithm is
   developed to eliminate all hanging nodes in the octree, which is robust
   for any unstructured meshes and induces a smooth transition with very
   little propagation. Later, all elements outside and around the boundary
   are removed to create the octree core mesh and a buffer zone. The
   boundary points on the core mesh are projected onto the surface and form
   the final mesh. Motivated from nature, a new tree structure based on
   rhombic dodecahedron is introduced. Sharp features are also detected and
   preserved during mesh generation. Finally, pillowing, geometric flow and
   optimization-based smoothing are applied to improve quality of the
   constructed meshes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the use of a periodic heat source, instead of a constant
   heat source, can improve the conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric
   power generator (TPG). A periodic heat source drives a periodic
   temperature difference across the thermoelectric with an amplitude Delta
   T. While the time average of Delta T is identical to the temperature
   difference under a constant heat source with equivalent energy input,
   the time average of (Delta T)(2) is larger, resulting in improved
   conversion efficiency. Here we present experimental measurements on a
   commercial thermoelectric device (bismuth telluride based) to validate
   analytical and numerical models. These models show that maximum
   efficiency is achieved when the period of the heat source is much larger
   than the thermal time constant of the TPG. Under this quasi-steady
   condition, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT is still the relevant
   parameter for material optimization. A conventional thermoelectric
   material with ZT 1, operated with sinusoidal and square-wave heat
   sources (Delta T 100 K, T-Cold 300 K), can achieve 140\% and 180\% of
   the constant heat source efficiency; or otherwise stated, can perform
   like advanced materials with ZT of 1.6 and 2.8. Even greater
   improvement, inaccessible through materials-based ZT enhancements, can
   be achieved with low duty cycle heat sources.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss recent progress in the full-waveform-based imaging of probed
   soils, with geotechnical site characterization applications in mind. The
   primary goal is the reconstruction of the material profile of
   near-surface, arbitrarily heterogeneous formations, in terms of the
   formation's spatially distributed elastic properties, using elastic
   waves as the probing agent.
   We describe first the formulation and numerical resolution of the
   underlying time-dependent inverse medium problem; we report briefly on
   numerical experiments using synthetic data and artificial target soil
   profiles. These demonstrate robust reconstruction. We then report
   extensively on the details of a field experiment, whose records we
   subsequently used to drive the inversion algorithms in order to
   characterize the site where the field experiment took place. Lastly, we
   compare the inverted site profile with profiles obtained using the
   Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method, in an attempt to
   compare our methodology against a widely used concurrent inversion
   approach. We also compare the inverted profile at select locations with
   the results of independently performed CPT tests.
   Overall, whether exercised by synthetic or by physical data, the full
   waveform inversion method we discuss herein appears quite promising for
   the robust subsurface imaging of near-surface deposits in support of
   geotechnical site characterization investigations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Detailed quantitative measurements of biological filament networks
   represent a crucial step in understanding architecture and structure of
   cells and tissues, which in turn explain important biological events
   such as wound healing and cancer metastases. Confocal microscope images
   of biological specimens marked for different structural proteins
   constitute an important source for observing and measuring meaningful
   parameters of biological networks. Unfortunately, current efforts at
   quantitative estimation of architecture and orientation of biological
   filament networks from microscopy images are predominantly limited to
   visual estimation and indirect experimental inference. Here we describe
   a new method for localizing and extracting filament distributions from
   2D confocal microscopy images. The method combines a filter-based
   detection of pixels likely to contain a filament with a constrained
   reverse diffusion-based approach for localizing the filaments
   centrelines. We show with qualitative and quantitative experiments,
   using both simulated and real data, that the new method can provide more
   accurate centreline estimates of filament in comparison to other
   approaches currently available. In addition, we show the algorithm is
   more robust with respect to variations in the initial filter-based
   filament detection step often used. We demonstrate the application of
   the method in extracting quantitative parameters from an experiment that
   seeks to quantify the effects of carbon nanotubes on actin cytoskeleton
   in live HeLa cells. We show that their presence can disrupt the overall
   actin cytoskeletal organization in such cells.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the role of horizontal grid resolution on the
   performance of the regional three dimensional chemical transport model
   (CTM) PMCAMx. Two cases were investigated. First, the model was applied
   over the Northeastern United States with grid resolutions of 36 and 12
   km during both a summer and a winter period. In this case the emission
   inventory was simply interpolated from the low resolution version. In
   the second case a multi-scale 36/4 km grid resolution is used over
   Western Europe with high resolution (4 x 4 km) emissions. The
   improvement in model predictions with the fine grid is modest during the
   summer and more significant during wintertime at both domains. Major
   differences are predicted mostly for primary (organics and black carbon
   (BC)) rather than secondary (e.g. sulfate) species. The use of high grid
   resolution decreases the bias for BC concentration by more than 30\% in
   the Northeastern US during wintertime. In the Megacity of Paris, using
   high resolution emissions and a 4-km grid decreases the fractional bias
   for organic aerosol (OA) from 80\% to 60\% in the city center and
   produces much larger spatial concentration gradients in the domain as
   compared to the emissions being interpolated. These results suggest that
   future work should combine high grid resolution with high resolution
   emissions, taking into consideration, though, that the grid resolution
   is not currently the major source of the discrepancies between model
   predictions and observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Iris masks play an important role in iris recognition. They indicate
   which part of the iris texture map is useful and which part is occluded
   or contaminated by noisy image artifacts such as eyelashes, eyelids,
   eyeglasses frames, and specular reflections. The accuracy of the iris
   mask is extremely important. The performance of the iris recognition
   system will decrease dramatically when the iris mask is inaccurate, even
   when the best recognition algorithm is used. Traditionally, people used
   the rule-based algorithms to estimate iris masks from iris images.
   However, the accuracy of the iris masks generated this way is
   questionable. In this work, we propose to use Figueiredo and Jain's
   Gaussian Mixture Models (FJ-GMMs) to model the underlying probabilistic
   distributions of both valid and invalid regions on iris images. We also
   explored possible features and found that Gabor Filter Bank (GFB)
   provides the most discriminative information for our goal. Finally, we
   applied Simulated Annealing (SA) technique to optimize the parameters of
   GFB in order to achieve the best recognition rate. Experimental results
   show that the masks generated by the proposed algorithm increase the
   iris recognition rate on both ICE2 and UBIRIS dataset, verifying the
   effectiveness and importance of our proposed method for iris occlusion
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{The orientation relationships (ORs) of copper crystals on a sapphire
   substrate equilibrated at 1253 K are presented. They barely depend on
   the procedures used in sample preparation, i.e. dewetting of a copper
   film in the liquid state or in the solid state. The most frequent OR
   found is Cu(111) || Al2O3 and Cu within few degrees from Al2O3{[}0001].
   A secondary, lower frequency OR is also observed: Cu(001) || Al2O3 with
   Cu within a few degrees from either Al2O3 or Al2O3{[}0001]. These ORs do
   not follow the Fecht and Gleiter model which proposes that dense
   directions of the metal should align with dense directions of the oxide.
   On annealing, even at a temperature about half of the melting point of
   sapphire, fast diffusion of sapphire at the copper/sapphire interface is
   observed: the copper particles tend to achieve their interfacial
   equilibrium shapes by sinking into the substrate, and sapphire ridges
   form at the triple line. Finally, it is shown that the Cu(111) || Al2O3
   interface remains flat at the atomic scale, and is therefore part of the
   copper/sapphire equilibrium interfacial shape.}},

Abstract = {{Multiarm star copolymers with approximately 460 poly(ethylene oxide)
   (PEO) arms that have a degree of polymerization N = 45 were synthesized
   via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of PEO-methacrylate
   macro-monomers in the presence of divinyl benzene cross-linkers. These
   are an example of molecular or nanoparticulate brushes that are of
   interest as steric stabilizers or boundary lubrication agents when
   adsorbed from solution to a solid/aqueous interface. We use ellipsometry
   to measure adsorption isotherms at the silica/aqueous interface for PEO
   star polymers and linear PEO chains having molecular weights comparable
   either to the star polymer or to the individual arms. The compactness of
   the PEO star polymers (molecular weight 1.2 x 10(6)) yields a saturation
   surface excess concentration that is approximately 3.5 times greater
   than that of the high molecular weight (1 X 10(6)) linear PEO.
   Adsorption of low molecular weight (6000) linear PEO was below the
   detection limit. Competitive adsorption experiments were conducted with
   ellipsometry, complemented by independent quartz crystal microbalance
   with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements. Linear PEO (high molecular
   weight) displaced preadsorbed PEO star polymers over the course of
   approximately 1.5 h, to form a mixed adsorbed layer having not only a
   significantly lower overall polymer surface excess concentration, but
   also a significantly greater amount of hydrodynamically entrapped water.
   Challenging a preadsorbed linear PEO (high molecular weight) layer with
   PEO star polymers produced no measurable change in the overall polymer
   surface excess concentration, but changes in the QCM-D energy
   dissipation and resonance frequency suggested that the introduction of
   PEO star polymers caused a slight swelling of the layer with a
   correspondingly small increase in entrapped water content.}},

Abstract = {{The recent finding of large electrocaloric effect in several
   ferroelectric polymers creates unique opportunity for developing compact
   size solid state cooling cycles beyond the traditional mechanical vapor
   compression cycles. Here, we show that, by employing regeneration
   process with solid state regenerators, a chip scale Electrocaloric
   Oscillatory Refrigeration (ECOR) can be realized. A prototype ECOR is
   fabricated and characterized. More than 6 K temperature span is obtained
   near room temperature between the hot and cold sides of a 2 cm long
   device. Finite volume simulation validates the test results and shows
   the potential high performance of the ECOR. (C) 2013 American Institute

Title = {{Critical Transitions in Early Embryonic Aortic Arch Patterning and
   Hemodynamics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Transformation from the bilaterally symmetric embryonic aortic arches to
   the mature great vessels is a complex morphogenetic process, requiring
   both vasculogenic and angiogenic mechanisms. Early aortic arch
   development occurs simultaneously with rapid changes in pulsatile blood
   flow, ventricular function, and downstream impedance in both
   invertebrate and vertebrate species. These dynamic biomechanical
   environmental landscapes provide critical epigenetic cues for vascular
   growth and remodeling. In our previous work, we examined hemodynamic
   loading and aortic arch growth in the chick embryo at Hamburger-Hamilton
   stages 18 and 24. We provided the first quantitative correlation between
   wall shear stress (WSS) and aortic arch diameter in the developing
   embryo, and observed that these two stages contained different aortic
   arch patterns with no inter-embryo variation. In the present study, we
   investigate these biomechanical events in the intermediate stage 21 to
   determine insights into this critical transition. We performed
   fluorescent dye microinjections to identify aortic arch patterns and
   measured diameters using both injection recordings and high-resolution
   optical coherence tomography. Flow and WSS were quantified with 3D
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Dye injections revealed that the
   transition in aortic arch pattern is not a uniform process and multiple
   configurations were documented at stage 21. CFD analysis showed that WSS
   is substantially elevated compared to both the previous (stage 18) and
   subsequent (stage 24) developmental time-points. These results
   demonstrate that acute increases in WSS are followed by a period of
   vascular remodeling to restore normative hemodynamic loading.
   Fluctuations in blood flow are one possible mechanism that impacts the
   timing of events such as aortic arch regression and generation, leading
   to the variable configurations at stage 21. Aortic arch variations noted
   during normal rapid vascular remodeling at stage 21 identify a temporal
   window of increased vulnerability to aberrant aortic arch morphogenesis
   with the potential for profound effects on subsequent cardiovascular
   morphogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{In the integrated oxy-fuel combustion and the turbine power generation
   system, turbine alloys are exposed to high temperature and an atmosphere
   comprised of steam, CO2 and O-2. While surface and internal oxidation of
   the alloy takes place, the microstructure in the subsurface region also
   changes due to oxidation that results in the loss of the strengthening
   precipitates. In an earlier study of the oxidation of Inconel 939
   Ni-based superalloy exposed to oxy-fuel combustion environment for up to
   1000 h, a high-temperature-oxidation-induced phase transformation in the
   sub-surface region was noticed and a two-phase region formed at the
   expense of strengthening gamma' phase. While one of the two phases was
   identified as the Ni-matrix gamma solid solution, face-center-cubic)
   phase, the other product phase remained unidentified. In this study, the
   crystal structure of the unknown phase and its orientation relationship
   with the parent Ni-matrix phase was investigated through electron
   diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was
   determined that the crystal structure of the unknown phase could be
   modeled as a ternary derivative of the ordered eta-Ni3Ti phase (D0(24))
   structure with lattice parameters of a=.5092 nm and c=.8336 nm, alpha=90

Abstract = {{Fifteen of the United States and several nations require a portion of
   their electricity come from solar energy. We perform an
   engineering-economic analysis of hybridizing concentrating solar thermal
   power with fossil fuel in an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC)
   generator. We construct a thermodynamic model of an ISCC plant in order
   to examine how much solar and fossil electricity is produced and how
   such a power plant would operate, given hourly solar resource data and
   hourly electricity prices. We find that the solar portion of an ISCC
   power plant has a lower levelized cost of electricity than stand-alone
   solar power plants given strong solar resource in the US southwest and
   market conditions that allow the capacity factor of the solar portion of
   the power plant to be above 21\%. From a local government perspective,
   current federal subsidies distort the levelized cost of electricity such
   that photovoltaic electricity is slightly less expensive than the solar
   electricity produced by the ISCC. However, if the cost of variability
   and additional transmission lines needed for stand-alone solar power
   plants are taken into account, the solar portion of an ISCC power plant
   may be more cost-effective.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in reducing energy use and emissions of carbon
   dioxide from the residential sector by deploying cost-effectiveness
   energy efficiency measures. However, there is still large uncertainty
   about the magnitude of the reductions that could be achieved by pursuing
   different energy efficiency measures across the nation. Using detailed
   estimates of the current inventory and performance of major appliances
   in U.S. homes, we model the cost, energy, and CO2 emissions reduction if
   they were replaced with alternatives that consume less energy or emit
   less CO2. We explore trade-offs between reducing CO2, reducing primary
   or final energy, or electricity consumption. We explore switching
   between electricity and direct fuel use, and among fuels. The trade-offs
   between different energy efficiency policy goals, as well as the
   environmental metrics used, are important but have been largely
   unexplored by previous energy modelers and policy-makers. We find that
   overnight replacement of the full stock of major residential appliances
   sets an upper bound of just over 710 X 10(6) tonnes/year of CO2 or a
   56\% reduction from baseline residential emissions. However, a policy
   designed instead to minimize primary energy consumption instead of CO2
   emissions will achieve a 48\% reduction in annual carbon dioxide
   emissions from the nine largest energy consuming residential end-uses.
   Thus, we explore the uncertainty regarding the main assumptions and
   different policy goals in a detailed sensitivity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental transformations of nanoparticles (NPs) affect their
   properties and toxicity potential. Sulfidation is an important
   transformation process affecting the fate of NPs containing metal
   cations with an affinity for sulfide. Here, the extent and mechanism of
   sulfidation of ZnO NPs were investigated, and the properties of
   resulting products were carefully characterized. Synchrotron X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis reveal that
   transformation of ZnO to ZnS occurs readily at ambient temperature in
   the presence of inorganic sulfide. The extent of sulfidation depends on
   sulfide concentration, and close to 100\% conversion can be obtained in
   5 days given sufficient addition of sulfide. X-ray diffraction and
   transmission electron microscopy showed formation of primarily ZnS NPs
   smaller than 5 nm, indicating that sulfidation of ZnO NPs occurs by a
   dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism. The solubility of partially
   sulfidized ZnO NPs is controlled by the remaining ZnO core and not
   quenched by a ZnS shell formed as was observed for partially sulfidized
   Ag NPs. Sulfidation also led to NP aggregation and a decrease of surface
   charge. These changes suggest that sulfidation of ZnO NPs alters the
   behavior, fate, and toxicity of ZnO NPs in the environment. The
   reactivity and fate of the resulting <5 nm ZnS particles remains to be
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential increase in fossil energy production from Devonian-age
   shale in the Northeastern United States has highlighted the management
   challenges for produced waters from hydraulically fractured wells.
   Confounding these challenges is a scant availability of critical water
   quality parameters for this wastewater. Chemical analyses of 160
   flowback and produced water samples collected from hydraulically
   fractured Marcellus Shale gas wells in Pennsylvania were correlated with
   spatial and temporal information to reveal underlying trends. Chloride
   was used as a reference for the comparison as its concentration varies
   with time of contact with the shale. Most major cations (i.e., Ca, Mg,
   Sr) were well-correlated with chloride concentration while barium
   exhibited strong influence of geographic location (i.e., higher levels
   in the northeast than in southwest). Comparisons against brines from
   adjacent formations provide insight into the origin of salinity in
   produced waters from Marcellus Shale. Major cations exhibited variations
   that cannot be explained by simple dilution of existing formation brine
   with the fracturing fluid, especially during the early flowback water
   production when the composition of the fracturing fluid and solid liquid
   interactions influence the quality of the produced water. Water quality
   analysis in this study may help guide water management strategies for
   development of unconventional gas resources.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the feasibility of polymer membrane systems for
   postcombustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture at coal-fired power plants.
   Using newly developed performance and cost models, our analysis shows
   that membrane systems configured with multiple stages or steps are
   capable of meeting capture targets of 90\% CO2 removal efficiency and
   95+\% product purity. A combined driving force design using both
   compressors and vacuum pumps is most effective for reducing the cost of
   CO2 avoided. Further reductions in the overall system energy penalty and
   cost can be obtained by recycling a portion of CO2 via a two-stage,
   two-step membrane configuration with air sweep to increase the CO2
   partial pressure of feed flue gas. For a typical plant with carbon
   capture and storage, this yielded a 15\% lower cost per metric ton of
   CO2 avoided compared to a plant using a current amine-based capture
   system. A series of parametric analyses also is undertaken to identify
   paths for enhancing the viability of membrane-based capture technology.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene oxide) star polymers (PEO stars) were prepared by atom
   transfer radical polymerization of 2000 molecular weight PEO
   methacrylate macromonomer with divinylbenzene as a crosslinking
   co-monomer. With an average of 460 arms per star, these PEO stars had a
   12 nm radius of gyration that is consistent with a dense polymer core
   surrounded by an extended PEO corona. The PEO stars were extremely
   efficient emulsifiers, stabilizing cyclohexane-in-water or
   xylene-in-water emulsions against coalescence for several months at
   aqueous phase concentrations as low as 0.008 wt\% or 0.01 wt\%,
   respectively. Consistent with their emulsifying performance, PEO star
   adsorption decreased interfacial tension by approximately 22 mN/m and
   imparted significant dilatational elasticity to the xylene/water
   interface. PEO stars were thermally responsive, displaying a cloud point
   upon heating in water that was tuned by addition of kosmotropic
   electrolytes, and they in turn produced xylene-in-water emulsions that
   were thermally responsive in terms of the dispersion state of the
   emulsion droplets and the emulsion rheology. Emulsions prepared at room
   temperature mainly had non-flocculated droplets. Heating such an
   emulsion above the cloud point temperature triggered droplet
   flocculation, but not coalescence, that in turn was associated with
   increased viscous and elastic moduli of the emulsion measured after
   cooling back to room temperature. Emulsions that initially were
   homogenized above the cloud point temperature and then cooled showed
   neither droplet flocculation nor rheological thickening relative to
   emulsions that were prepared and held at room temperature. A mechanism
   based on the bridging behavior of PEO stars adsorbed at the
   droplet/water interface is postulated to explain this thermal response
   of the emulsion microstructure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Electrolyte dependence of particle motion near an electrode during ac
   polarization}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{The phase angle between the imposed ac electric field and the
   oscillations in particle height is the key parameter governing the sign
   of interparticle force during two-dimensional directed assembly. The
   phase angle depends on a number of experimental parameters, including
   the frequency of the electric field and dispersing electrolytes. The
   origin of electrolyte dependence in this phase angle has been a mystery
   for a decade. Electrolyte dependence arises from polarization of the
   particle's diffuse layer, which affects the dynamic electrophoretic
   mobility of the particle. A full description of the magnitude and phase
   angle of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility was incorporated into a
   nonlinear integro-differential equation of motion for a 5.7 mu m
   diameter particle suspended in 0.15 mM KOH, KCl, NaHCO3, NH4OH, and NaOH
   at frequencies between 5 and 1000 Hz. Integration of the equation
   revealed that the phase angles for a particle in KOH, NH4OH, and NaOH
   were smaller than the phase angles calculated for a particle in KCl and
   NaHCO3, which is consistent with previously published experiments.
   Although the phase angles for each electrolyte are spread over only
   similar to 1 degrees, the results cluster around 90 degrees, which is
   the crucial boundary between particle aggregation (>90 degrees) and
   separation (<90 degrees). A family of curves of the oscillation in
   particle height collapsed to a master curve when the amplitude of motion
   was scaled with the product of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility and
   electric field strength. These results constitute the first a priori
   prediction of electrolyte-dependent motion of a particle near an
   electrode during ac polarization. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.032302}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3121-3132}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, surrogate models are built iteratively using polynomial
   chaos expansion (PCE) and detailed numerical simulations of a carbon
   sequestration system. Output variables from a numerical simulator are
   approximated as polynomial functions of uncertain parameters. Once
   generated, PCE representations can be used in place of the numerical
   simulator and often decrease simulation times by several orders of
   magnitude. However, PCE models are expensive to derive unless the number
   of terms in the expansion is moderate, which requires a relatively small
   number of uncertain variables and a low degree of expansion. To cope
   with this limitation, instead of using a classical full expansion at
   each step of an iterative PCE construction method, we introduce a
   mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation to identify the best subset
   of basis terms in the expansion. This approach makes it possible to keep
   the number of terms small in the expansion. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
   is then performed by substituting the values of the uncertain parameters
   into the closed-form polynomial functions. On the basis of the results
   of MC simulation, the uncertainties of injecting CO2 underground are
   quantified for a saline aquifer. Moreover, based on the PCE model, we
   formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal CO2 injection
   rate so as to maximize the gas saturation (residual trapping) during
   injection, and thereby minimize the chance of leakage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to perform simultaneous optimization of
   heat and water integration for a process flowsheet. As opposed to the
   sequential integration approach where heat and water integration are
   performed for flowsheets with fixed operating conditions, the
   simultaneous optimization method allows for variable stream qualities
   (e.g., flowrates, pressures, and temperatures) to account for potential
   trade-offs among raw material, investment cost, and utility and water
   consumption. Since detailed heat-exchange network and water network
   designs are generally formulated as nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming and nonconvex nonlinear programming models, respectively,
   reducing constraint complexities for these two networks is of utmost
   priority. To this end, simultaneous handling of process flowsheet with
   heat integration has already been demonstrated by Duran and Grossmann
   {[}AlChE J. 1986, 32, 123-138]. In order to reduce the computational
   requirement for water integration, we have developed a novel LP
   targeting model for minimizing freshwater consumption of
   multicontaminant systems. This water targeting model, which is either
   exact or else predicts tight upper bounds, is incorporated along with
   the available heat targeting model into flowsheet optimization process
   to achieve the best operating conditions through the proposed
   simultaneous framework in this work. Several examples are presented to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the simultaneous approach in improving
   both the quality and computational effort of the solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a set of models that describe the principal

   between the pulling rate and the thickness of the silicon film. A
   crystallization model is developed to find the concentration
   distribution of impurities aluminum in this case in the melt and in the
   ribbon. We find that, because of low growth velocities, there is no
   formation of a solute-enriched boundary layer and that a 50-fold
   reduction of aluminum impurities can be expected. Finally, we use the
   Mullins-Sekerka stability theory to show that aluminum impurities at the

   the Lagrangean multiplier set based on the combination of cutting-plane,
   subgradient and trust-region strategies. Numerical results suggest that
   different formulations of the non-anticipativity conditions have a

Abstract = {{The paper presents stability and stabilizability analysis for plant-wide

   key problems that we address in the paper is how to determine

   network. The results in the paper extend the dissipativity analysis
   based on thermodynamics for individual processes to dissipativity-based
   conditions (storage functions and supply rates) suitable for process
   network analysis. The new storage and supply functions are based on
   balance equations represented in terms of temperatures and compositions
   rather than internal energy and chemical potentials. This makes the
   theory easier to apply to typical chemical process model systems. A
   simple example is provided to illustrate the application of the theory.

   J(0) depends strongly on silicon thickness (D). Excluding the
   contribution from tunneling and image-charge barrier lowering, the
   remaining J(0) (attributed to thermionic emission) increases
   exponentially as D decreases. This is likely due to less scattering in

Abstract = {{In the near field, radiative heat transfer can exceed the prediction
   from Planck's law by several orders of magnitude, when the interacting
   materials support surface polaritons in the infrared range. However, if
   the emitter and absorber are made from two different materials, which
   support surface polariton resonances at different frequencies, the
   mismatch between surface polariton resonance frequencies will
   drastically reduce near-field radiative heat transfer. Here, we present
   a broadband near-field thermal emitter/absorber based on hyperbolic
   metamaterials, which can significantly enhance near-field radiative heat
   transfer with infrared surface-polariton-resonance materials and
   maintain the monochromatic characteristic of heat transfer. Instead of
   using an effective medium approximation, we perform a direct numerical
   simulation to accurately investigate the heat transfer mechanisms of
   metamaterials based on the Wiener chaos expansion method. DOI:

   Based Mapping}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a methodology for discovering structure in design
   repository databases, toward the ultimate goal of stimulating designers
   through design-by-analogy. Using a Bayesian model combined with latent
   semantic analysis (LSA) for discovering structural form in data, an
   exploration of inherent structural forms, based on the content and
   similarity of design data, is undertaken to gain useful insights into
   the nature of the design space. In this work, the approach is applied to
   uncover structure in the U.S. patent database. More specifically, the
   functional content and surface content of the patents are processed and
   mapped separately, yielding structures that have the potential to
   develop a better understanding of the functional and surface similarity
   of patents. Structures created with this methodology yield spaces of
   patents that are meaningfully arranged into labeled clusters, and
   labeled regions, based on their functional similarity or surface content
   similarity. Examples show that cross-domain associations and transfer of
   knowledge based on functional similarity can be extracted from the
   function based structures, and even from the surface content based
   structures as well. The comparison of different structural form types is
   shown to yield different insights into the arrangement of the space, the
   interrelationships between the patents, and the information within the
   patents that is attended to-enabling multiple representations of the
   same space to be easily accessible for design inspiration purposes. In
   addition, the placement of a design problem in the space effectively
   points to the most relevant cluster of patents in the space as an
   effective starting point of stimulation. These results provide a basis
   for automated discovery of cross-domain analogy, among other
   implications for creating a computational design stimulation tool.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an information-theoretic approach to address the
   phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problemin electric power
   systems. Different from the conventional `topological observability'
   based approaches, this paper advocates a much more refined,
   information-theoretic criterion, namely the mutual information (MI)
   between PMU measurements and power system states. The proposed MI
   criterion not only includes observability as a special case, but also
   rigorously models the uncertainty reduction on power system states from
   PMU measurements. Thus, it can generate highly informative PMU
   configurations. The MI criterion can also facilitate robust PMU
   placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU outages. We propose a
   greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves an
   approximation ratio of (1 - 1/e) for any PMU placement budget. We
   further show that the performance is the best that one can achieve, in
   the sense that it is NP-hard to achieve any approximation ratio beyond
   (1 - 1/e) Such performance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very
   attractive in the practical scenario of multi-stage installations for
   utilities with limited budgets. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
   near-optimal performance of the proposed PMU placement algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Electroviscous stresses arise as hydrodynamic flows disturb the ionic
   (Debye) clouds that screen charged surfaces in electrolyte solutions.
   The contribution thereof to the effective bulk viscosity (also known as
   the second or volume viscosity) of two-phase suspensions is quantified
   here. Specifically, the bulk viscosity of two model suspensions is
   calculated: (1) a dilute dispersion of rigid charged spherical particles
   immersed in a compressible electrolyte that undergoes uniform dilatation
   and (2) a dilute suspension of charged gas bubbles expanding uniformly
   in an incompressible electrolyte. In both cases, it is assumed that the
   fluid flow only slightly drives the Debye cloud out of equilibrium,
   which formally requires that the ratio of the ion diffusion to flow time
   scales-a Peclet number-is small. For a suspension of rigid particles,
   the electroviscous contribution to the effective bulk viscosity is
   proportional to the particle volume fraction and decreases monotonically
   as the ratio of the particle radius to the Debye length increases.
   Similar behavior is well known for the electroviscous contribution to
   the effective shear viscosity of a dilute hard-sphere suspension; a
   quantitative comparison between the bulk and shear viscosities is made.
   In contrast, the electroviscous contribution to the bulk viscosity of a
   dilute suspension of bubbles is independent of the bubble volume
   fraction and attains a finite value in the limit of vanishing Debye
   length.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Non-metallic crystalline materials conduct heat by the transport of
   quantized atomic lattice vibrations called phonons. Thermal conductivity
   depends on how far phonons travel between scattering events-their mean
   free paths. Due to the breadth of the phonon mean free path spectrum,
   nanostructuring materials can reduce thermal conductivity from bulk by
   scattering long mean free path phonons, whereas short mean free path
   phonons are unaffected. Here we use a breakdown in diffusive phonon
   transport generated by high-frequency surface temperature modulation to
   identify the mean free path-dependent contributions of phonons to
   thermal conductivity in crystalline and amorphous silicon. Our
   measurements probe a broad range of mean free paths in crystalline
   silicon spanning 0.3-8.0 mu m at a temperature of 311 K and show that 40
   +/- 5\% of its thermal conductivity comes from phonons with mean free
   path >1 mu m. In a 500nm thick amorphous silicon film, despite atomic
   disorder, we identify propagating phonon-like modes that contribute >35
   +/- 7\% to thermal conductivity at a temperature of 306 K.}},

Abstract = {{The production of biodiesel from algae is optimized using bioethanol
   following four different transesterification paths: alkali, enzymatic,
   and heterogeneous catalysts and supercritical conditions. The reactors
   are modeled using response surface methodology based on experimental
   results from the literature. These reactor models are implemented
   together with short-cut methods for the other equipment (distillation
   columns, gravity separators, etc.) in order to recover the ethanol,
   separate the polar and nonpolar phases, and purify the glycerol and
   biodiesel produced to formulate the problem as a superstructure of
   alternatives. The aim is to simultaneously optimize and heat integrate
   the production of biodiesel using ethanol in terms of the reaction
   technology and the operating conditions. The optimal conditions in the
   reactors differ from the ones traditionally used because these results
   take the separation stages into account. In terms of the optimal
   process, the alkali catalyzed process is the most profitable, while the
   enzymatic one is also promising due to the lower consumption of energy
   and water, although it requires significant enzyme cost. (C) 2012

Title = {{Greedy Sparsity-Constrained Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{807-841}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Sparsity-constrained optimization has wide applicability in machine
   learning, statistics, and signal processing problems such as feature
   selection and Compressed Sensing. A vast body of work has studied the
   sparsity-constrained optimization from theoretical, algorithmic, and
   application aspects in the context of sparse estimation in linear models
   where the fidelity of the estimate is measured by the squared error. In
   contrast, relatively less effort has been made in the study of
   sparsity-constrained optimization in cases where nonlinear models are
   involved or the cost function is not quadratic. In this paper we propose
   a greedy algorithm, Gradient Support Pursuit (GraSP), to approximate
   sparse minima of cost functions of arbitrary form. Should a cost
   function have a Stable Restricted Hessian (SRH) or a Stable Restricted
   Linearization (SRL), both of which are introduced in this paper, our
   algorithm is guaranteed to produce a sparse vector within a bounded
   distance from the true sparse optimum. Our approach generalizes known
   results for quadratic cost functions that arise in sparse linear
   regression and Compressed Sensing. We also evaluate the performance of
   GraSP through numerical simulations on synthetic and real data, where
   the algorithm is employed for sparse logistic regression with and
   without l(2)-regularization.}},

   order modeling}},
Journal = {{OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-35}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Reduced order models (ROM), such as proper orthogonal decomposition
   (POD), lead to powerful techniques to address computational challenges
   in PDE-constrained optimization. However, when incorporated within
   optimization strategies, ROMs are sufficiently accurate only in a
   restricted zone around the point in decision variable space where they
   are constructed. Consequently, the ROM needs to be updated in a
   systematic manner over the course of the optimization. As an enabling
   strategy, trust-region methods provide an excellent adaptive framework
   for ROM-based optimization. They not only restrict the optimization step
   within the ROM's validity, but also synchronize ROM updates with
   information obtained during the course of optimization, thus providing a
   robust and globally convergent framework. This study extends the
   trust-region framework to constrained optimization problems, using two
   approaches. We first develop an exact penalty-based trust-region
   algorithm with correction schemes to ensure global convergence with
   ROM-based approximate models. Next, we develop a novel filter
   trust-region algorithm which utilizes refinement of the ROM, and a
   feasibility restoration phase. Both algorithms are applied to the
   optimization of a two-bed four-step isothermal pressure swing adsorption
   (PSA) system, for CO2 capture. Although both algorithms converge to the
   same local optimum, the filter approach takes fewer trust-region
   iterations and requires less computational effort.}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability assessment serves to identify vulnerabilities, develop
   responses, and drive the risk-management process. In identifying
   vulnerabilities, it is fundamental to identify and rank critical assets,
   which include vital systems, facilities, processes, and information
   necessary to maintain continuity of service. During emergencies in the
   facility management domain, first responders typically search for
   critical assets, both related to business continuity and value to the
   organization. This paper presents a formalized approach to reason about
   building systems and content to support vulnerability assessment in
   building emergencies caused by failures in building systems (e. g.,
   sprinkler line leak, power outage). The developed reasoning approach
   enables a first responder to perform flexible searches and prioritize
   critical spaces and pieces of equipment that need to be protected in an
   emergency by leveraging existing building and content representations
   found in building information models (BIM). This approach targets
   retrieving and prioritizing vulnerable content using a faceted
   classification-based approach. The faceted-retrieval mechanism was
   tested for precision and recall in retrieving vulnerable content in two
   scenarios with ten experts. Results show increased precision and recall
   (98 and 92\%, respectively) when all facets were used in the search.
   These results demonstrate that the faceted-retrieval mechanism more
   effectively retrieves content that need to be protected in building
   emergencies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000214. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Cardiac diseases, like those related to abnormal heart rate activity,

   present a Cyber Physical System approach to pacemaker design that
   exploits precisely the fractal properties of heart rate activity in
   order to design the pacemaker controller. Towards this end, we solve a
   finite horizon optimal control problem based on the heartbeat time
   series and show that this control problem can be converted into a system
   of linear equations. We also compare and contrast the performance of the
   fractal optimal control problem under six different cost functions.
   Finally, to get an idea of hardware complexity, we implement the fractal
   optimal controller on a Virtex4 FPGA and report some preliminary results

Abstract = {{An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) carries one of the highest mortality
   rates among vascular diseases when it ruptures. To predict the role of
   surface curvature in rupture risk assessment, a discriminatory analysis
   of aneurysm geometry characterization was conducted. Data was obtained
   from 205 patient-specific computed tomography image sets corresponding
   to three AAA population subgroups: patients under surveillance, those
   that underwent elective repair of the aneurysm, and those with an
   emergent repair. Each AAA was reconstructed and their surface curvatures
   estimated using the biquintic Hermite finite element method. Local
   surface curvatures were processed into ten global curvature indices.
   Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the L2-norm of the
   Gaussian and Mean surface curvatures can be utilized as classifiers of
   the three AAA population subgroups. The application of statistical
   machine learning on the curvature features yielded 85.5\% accuracy in
   classifying electively and emergent repaired AAAs, compared to a 68.9\%
   accuracy obtained by using maximum aneurysm diameter alone. Such
   combination of non-invasive geometric quantification and statistical
   machine learning methods can be used in a clinical setting to assess the
   risk of rupture of aneurysms during regular patient follow-ups.}},

   (0, 138.5, 26.7) Euler angle. Measurements of the transducer input
   admittance in reflective delay-line devices yield a value for the
   electromechanical coupling coefficient that is in good agreement with
   the three-dimensional simulations on bare langasite substrate. The input
   admittance measurements also show evidence of excitation of an
   additional wave mode and excess loss resulting from the finger
   resistance. The results of these simulations and measurements will be
   useful in the design of surface acoustic wave gas sensors.}},

Abstract = {{As a part of an ongoing project to develop computerized training tools
   for cryosurgery, the objective of the current study is twofold: to
   compile literature data on the likelihood of cancer tumor growth and its
   effect on the prostate shape and to present a deformation scheme for a
   3D organ template in order to generate clinically relevant prostate
   models. The long-term objective of this study is to develop a database
   of prostate models for computerized training.
   Cryosurgery is typically performed on patients with localized prostate
   cancer found in stage T3 or earlier. The distribution of key geometric
   features likely to be found in the prostate at stage T3 is integrated
   into a 3D prostate template by employing the extended free-form
   deformation (EFFD) method. The applied scheme combines two steps:
   pre-selecting a set of geometric parameter values and manipulating the
   lattice control points until the prostate model meets the desired
   criteria.
   Examples for model generation are displayed, based on two 3D prostate
   templates previously obtained from ultrasound imaging. These examples
   include selected cases with unilateral and bilateral stage T3 tumor
   growth, suitable for incorporation into a training database.
   EFFD is an efficient method for rapid generation of prostate models. The
   compiled criteria for model generation do not lead to a unique shape
   since the contours for template deformation are randomly selected.
   Nevertheless, these criteria do lead to shapes resembling cancer growth,
   as various growth histories can lead to a tumor characterized by the
   same key parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To predict the deposition of nanoparticles in a patient-specific
   arterial tree as a function of the vascular architecture, flow
   conditions, receptor surface density and nanoparticle properties.
   Materials \& methods: The patient-specific vascular geometry is
   reconstructed from computed tomography angiography images. The
   isogeometric analysis framework integrated with a special boundary
   condition for the firm wall adhesion of nanoparticles is implemented. A
   parallel plate flow chamber system is used to validate the computational
   model in vitro. Results: Particle adhesion is dramatically affected by
   changes in patient-specific attributes, such as branching angle and
   receptor density. The adhesion pattern correlates well with the spatial
   and temporal distribution of the wall shear rates. For the case
   considered, the larger (2.0 mu m) particles adhere two-times more in the
   lower branches of the arterial tree, whereas the smaller (0.5 mu m)
   particles deposit more in the upper branches. Conclusion: Our
   computational framework in conjunction with patient-specific attributes
   can be used to rationally select nanoparticle properties to personalize,
   and thus optimize, therapeutic interventions. Original submitted 30

Abstract = {{In many planning problems under uncertainty the uncertainties are
   decision-dependent and resolve gradually depending on the decisions
   made. In this paper, we address a generic non-convex MINLP model for
   such planning problems where the uncertain parameters are assumed to
   follow discrete distributions and the decisions are made on a discrete
   time horizon. In order to account for the decision-dependent
   uncertainties and gradual uncertainty resolution, we propose a
   multistage stochastic programming model in which the non-anticipativity
   constraints in the model are not prespecified but change as a function
   of the decisions made. Furthermore, planning problems consist of several
   scenario subproblems where each subproblem is modeled as a nonconvex
   mixed-integer nonlinear program. We propose a solution strategy that
   combines global optimization and outer-approximation in order to
   optimize the planning decisions. We apply this generic problem structure
   and the proposed solution algorithm to several planning problems to
   illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method with respect to the
   method that uses only global optimization.}},

Title = {{Study on the etching characteristics of amorphous carbon layer in oxygen
   plasma with carbonyl sulfide}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Carbonyl sulfide (COS) was added to oxygen as the additive etch gas for
   etching of amorphous carbon layers (ACL), and its effect on the etching
   characteristics of ACLs as the etch mask for high aspect ratio contact
   SiO2 etching was investigated. When a 50 nm amorphous carbon hole was
   etched in a gas mixture of O-2 + 5\% COS, not only did the etch profile
   of the ACL change more anisotropically but also the top/bottom opening
   ratio of the etch profile was improved by about 37\% compared to those
   etched without COS. The improved ACL etch characteristics were related
   to the sidewall passivation of the amorphous carbon hole by the carbon
   sulfide related layer during the etching of the ACL. The distortion of
   the amorphous carbon hole was also reduced by about 6\% due to the
   uniform deposition of the carbon sulfide related layer on the sidewall
   of the amorphous carbon hole. This uniform deposition improved the etch
   profile and opening ratio of the amorphous carbon hole, ultimately
   resulting in the enhanced contact oxide etching characteristics as
   evidenced by 5\% improvement in the contact oxide opening and 20\%
   improvement in the mask etch selectivity during the etching of an oxide
   having 20:1 high aspect ratio. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{During the drilling process, drill operators constantly adjust drilling
   parameters depending on a number of geo-tribological factors. The
   optimization of these parameters is typically based on trial-and-error
   field data from previous wells. As a step toward elucidating some of the
   underlying physics which affect the drilling process, the current work
   introduces a continuum-discrete approach which has the potential to
   predict rock wear rates. This model predicts how changes in rock
   strength, drilling fluid viscosity, drill bit angular velocity, and
   weight-on-bit affect the rate-of-penetration. Predictions from the model
   show qualitative agreement with experimental findings and field data.

Pages = {{414-423}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a hybrid model that combines
   elements of the Monte Carlo Potts Model with those of the phase field
   model. This hybrid model is introduced as a method to simulate
   microstructural evolution processes that are kinetically controlled by
   long-range diffusion in multi-component systems. The hybrid model uses a
   digitized microstructure with each site characterized by its
   microstructural features and its composition. The total free energy of
   the system is defined by bulk chemical free energy as well as
   interfacial energy. The coupling between the microstructure and
   composition is achieved by using the total free energy to drive the
   evolution in both fields. The kinetics are simulated by a combination of
   Monte Carlo methods and solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. This
   model is applied to several example problems to demonstrate its
   capabilities. These are diffusion in single- and two-phase diffusion
   couples, grain growth in a two-phase system controlled by diffusion and
   diffusion phase transformation by nucleation and growth of a second
   phase. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembled nanoparticle monolayer arrays are used as an etch mask
   for pattern transfer into Si and SiOx substrates. Crack formation within
   the array is prevented by electron beam curing to fix the nanoparticles
   to the substrate, followed by a brief oxygen plasma to remove excess
   carbon. This leaves a dot array of nanoparticle cores with a minimum gap
   of 2 nm. Deposition and liftoff can transform the dot array mask into an
   antidot mask, where the gap is determined by the nanoparticle core
   diameter. Reactive ion etching is used to transfer the dot and antidot
   patterns into the substrate. The effect of the gap size on the etching
   rate is modeled and compared with the experimental results.}},

Title = {{Multi-criteria decision analysis to select metrics for design and
   monitoring of sustainable ecosystem restorations}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The selection of metrics for ecosystem restoration programs is critical
   for improving the quality and utility of design and monitoring programs,
   informing adaptive management actions, and characterizing project
   success. The metrics selection process, that in practice is left to the
   subjective judgment of stakeholders, is often complex and should
   simultaneously take into account monitoring data, environmental models,
   socio-economic considerations, and stakeholder interests. With limited
   funding, it is often very difficult to balance the importance of
   multiple metrics, often competing, intended to measure different
   environmental, social, and economic aspects of the system. To help
   restoration planners and practitioners develop the most useful and
   informative design and monitoring programs, we propose the use of
   multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, broadly defined, to
   select optimal ecosystem restoration metric sets. In this paper, we
   apply and compare two MCDA methods, multi-attribute utility theory
   (MAUT), and probabilistic multi-criteria acceptability analysis
   (ProMAA), for a hypothetical river restoration case study involving
   multiple stakeholders with competing interests. Overall, the MCDA
   results in a systematic, quantitative, and transparent evaluation and
   comparison of potential metrics that provides planners and practitioners
   with a clear basis for selecting the optimal set of metrics to evaluate
   restoration alternatives and to inform restoration design and
   monitoring. In our case study, the two MCDA methods provide comparable
   results in terms of selected metrics. However, because ProMAA can
   consider probability distributions for weights and utility values of
   metrics for each criterion, it is most likely the best option for
   projects with highly uncertain data and significant stakeholder
   involvement. Despite the increase in complexity in the metrics selection
   process, MCDA improves upon the current, commonly-used ad-hoc decision
   practice based on consultations with stakeholders by applying and
   presenting quantitative aggregation of data and judgment, thereby
   increasing the effectiveness of environmental design and monitoring and
   the transparency of decision making in restoration projects. (C) 2012

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Electric fields are commonly used to deposit colloidal particles on
   electrode surfaces and can even be used in directed assembly. The
   electric field beneath each particle changes as the particle approaches
   the wall; the proximity of the wall breaks the fore/aft symmetry and
   drives complicated flows that exert forces on the particle. While two
   limiting cases have been partially analyzed, constant electrode
   potential and uniform current density, the full problem has not been
   explored. Here, the electroosmotic flows in the region between the
   particle and the electrode are analyzed and the forces are computed for
   arbitrary electrode kinetic boundary conditions. Finite element analysis
   is employed to explore the effect of the current distribution beneath a
   particle on the net force acting on it. Previously established
   dimensionless kinetic parameters are used to scale between the two
   limiting cases. The forces on particles are an order of magnitude larger
   than the bulk electrophoretic force and are profoundly sensitive to the
   current distribution beneath the particle as it approaches the
   electrode. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess whether intra-tendon delivery of
   recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) would
   improve Achilles tendon repair in a rat collagenase-induced tendinopathy
   model. Seven days following collagenase induction of tendinopathy, one
   of four intra-tendinous treatments was administered: (i) Vehicle control
   (sodium acetate buffer), (ii) 1.02 mu g rhPDGF-BB, (iii) 10.2 mu g
   rhPDGF-BB, or (iv) 102?mu g rhPDGF-BB. Treated tendons were assessed for
   histopathological (e.g., proliferation, tendon thickness, collagen fiber
   density/orientation) and biomechanical (e.g., maximum load-to-failure
   and stiffness) outcomes. By 7 days post-treatment, there was a
   significant increase in cell proliferation with the 10.2 and 102 mu g
   rhPDGF-BB-treated groups (p?=?0.049 and 0.015, respectively) and in
   thickness at the tendon midsubstance in the 10.2 mu g of rhPDGF-BB group
   (p?=?0.005), compared to controls. All groups had equivalent outcomes by
   Day 21. There was a dose-dependent effect on the maximum
   load-to-failure, with no significant difference in the 1.02 and 102 mu g
   rhPDGF-BB doses but the 10.2 mu g rhPDGF-BB group had a significant
   increase in load-to-failure at 7 (p?=?0.003) and 21 days (p?=?0.019)
   compared to controls. The rhPDGF-BB treatment resulted in a
   dose-dependent, transient increase in cell proliferation and sustained
   improvement in biomechanical properties in a rat Achilles tendinopathy
   model, demonstrating the potential of rhPDGF-BB treatment in a
   tendinopathy application. Consequently, in this model, data suggest that
   rhPDGF-BB treatment is an effective therapy and thus, may be an option
   for clinical applications to treat tendinopathy. (C) 2012 Orthopaedic

Title = {{Low Concentrations of Silver Nanoparticles in Biosolids Cause Adverse
   Ecosystem Responses under Realistic Field Scenario}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{A large fraction of engineered nanomaterials in consumer and commercial
   products will reach natural ecosystems. To date, research on the
   biological impacts of environmental nanomaterial exposures has largely
   focused on high-concentration exposures in mechanistic lab studies with
   single strains of model organisms. These results are difficult to
   extrapolate to ecosystems, where exposures will likely be at
   low-concentrations and which are inhabited by a diversity of organisms.
   Here we show adverse responses of plants and microorganisms in a
   replicated long-term terrestrial mesocosm field experiment following a
   single low dose of silver nanoparticles (0.14 mg Ag kg(-1) soil) applied
   via a likely route of exposure, sewage biosolid application. While total
   aboveground plant biomass did not differ between treatments receiving
   biosolids, one plant species, Microstegium vimeneum, had 32 \% less
   biomass in the Slurry+AgNP treatment relative to the Slurry only
   treatment. Microorganisms were also affected by AgNP treatment, which
   gave a significantly different community composition of bacteria in the
   Slurry+AgNPs as opposed to the Slurry treatment one day after addition
   as analyzed by T-RFLP analysis of 16S-rRNA genes. After eight days, N2O
   flux was 4.5 fold higher in the Slurry+AgNPs treatment than the Slurry
   treatment. After fifty days, community composition and N2O flux of the
   Slurry+AgNPs treatment converged with the Slurry. However, the soil
   microbial extracellular enzymes leucine amino peptidase and phosphatase
   had 52 and 27\% lower activities, respectively, while microbial biomass
   was 35\% lower than the Slurry. We also show that the magnitude of these
   responses was in all cases as large as or larger than the positive
   control, AgNO3, added at 4-fold the Ag concentration of the silver
   nanoparticles.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{In enterprise applications relying on fault-tolerant middleware, it is a
   common engineering practice to establish service-level agreements (SLAs)
   based on the 95th or the 99th percentiles of the latency, to allow a
   margin for unexpected variability. However, the extent of this
   unpredictability has not been studied systematically. We present an
   extensive empirical study of unpredictability in 16 distributed systems,
   ranging from simple transport protocols to fault-tolerant,
   middleware-based enterprise applications, and we show that the inherent
   unpredictability in the systems examined arises from at most 1\% of the
   remote invocations. In the normal, fault-free operating mode most remote
   invocations have a predictable end-to-end latency, but the maximum
   latency follows unpredictable trends and is comparable with the time
   needed to recover from a fault. The maximum latency is not influenced by
   the system's workload, cannot be regulated through configuration
   parameters and is not correlated with the system's resource consumption.
   The high-latency outliers (up to three orders of magnitude higher than
   the average latency) have multiple causes and may originate in any
   component of the system. However, after filtering out 1\% of the
   invocations with the highest recorded response-times, the latency
   becomes bounded with high statistical confidence (p<0.01). We have
   verified this result on different operating systems (Linux 2.4, Linux
   2.6, Linux-rt, TimeSys), middleware platforms (CORBA and EJB),
   programming languages (C, C++ and Java), replication styles (active and
   warm passive) and applications (e-commerce and online gaming). Moreover,
   this phenomenon occurs at all the layers of middleware-based systems,
   from the communication protocols to the business logic. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Hydrophobins are relatively small globular proteins produced by
   filamentous fungi. They display unusual high surface activity and are
   implied as mediators of attachment to surfaces, which has resulted in
   high scientific and technological interest. In this work we focus on
   kinetic and equilibrium aspects of adsorption and desorption properties
   of two representatives of class II hydrophobins, namely HFBI and HFBII,
   at a negatively charged hydrophilic solid/water interface and at the
   air/water interface. The layers formed at the air/liquid interface were
   examined in a Langmuir trough, whereas layers formed at the solid/liquid
   interface were studied using dual polarization interferometry (DPI)
   under different flow conditions. For comparison, another globular
   protein, lysozyme, was also investigated. It was found that both the
   adsorbed amount and the adsorption kinetics were different for HFBI and
   HFBII, and the adsorption behavior of both hydrophobins on the
   negatively charged surface displayed some unusual features. For
   instance, even though the adsorption rate for HFBI was slowed down with
   increasing adsorbed amount as expected from packing constraints at the
   interface, the adsorption kinetics curves for HFBII displayed a region
   indicating adsorption cooperativity. Further, it was found that
   hydrophobin layers formed under flow partly desorbed when the flow was
   stopped, and the desorption rate for HFBII was enhanced in the presence
   of hydrophobins in solution.}},

Title = {{Mechanistic insights into the use of oxide nanoparticles coated
   asymmetric electrodes for capacitive deionization}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{573-581}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging water desalination method,
   which employs high surface area porous electrode materials for
   electro-sorption of ions. We used an asymmetric CDI cell constructed
   with alumina and silica nanoparticle (NP) coated electrodes and KCl as a
   probe electrolyte to gain insights into electro-sorption behavior and
   elucidate underlying process mechanisms. This CDI system is efficient
   for use in desalination and up to 15 to 60 mu mol/g (total electrode)
   sorption capacity was achieved. Higher removal of K+ compared to Cl- was
   obtained attributable to competition between OH- and Cl-. The presence
   of NPs not only creates highly accessible surface area but also
   increases the charge efficiency by shifting the applied potential to a
   high efficiency range due to protonation/deprotonation occurring on
   metal oxide surfaces. Data were described using both mechanistic
   electrical double layer (EDL) based Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) formulation
   and empirical Freundlich equations. Our results suggest that the
   presence of metal oxide NPs can effectively modify the isoelectric
   points and an increase in planar charge efficiency of up to 20\% could
   be achieved. However, global charge efficiency was still severely
   constrained by backward thermal diffusion and mass transfer limitations.
   EDL over-lapping effect plays an important role in determining critical
   pore size for electro-sorption. The GCS model revealed that only BJH
   associated (pore size: 1.5-50 nm) surface area is effective for
   electro-sorption. Though the Freundlich equation adequately described
   the sorption data, we attribute this sorption behavior to reduction in
   micropore overlapping effects and an increase in mass transfer caused by
   higher concentration gradients. Our results are expected to guide the
   design and development of appropriate electrode materials for CDI. (c)

Abstract = {{In the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and subsequent oil spill,
   five million barrels of oil were released into the Gulf over the course
   of several months. Part of the resulting emergency response was the
   unprecedented use of nearly two million gallons of surfactant dispersant
   at both the sea surface and well head, giving rise to previously
   untested conditions of high temperature gradients, high pressures, and
   flow conditions. To better understand the complex interfacial transport
   mechanisms that this dispersant poses, we develop a model
   surfactant-oil-aqueous system of Tween 80 (a primary component in the
   Corexit dispersant used in the Gulf), squalane, and both simulated
   seawater as well as deionized water. We measure surfactant adsorption
   dynamics to the oil-aqueous interface for a range of surfactant
   concentrations. Using techniques developed in our laboratory, we
   investigate the impact of convection, step changes in bulk
   concentration, and interfacial mechanics. We observe dynamic interfacial
   behavior that is consistent with a reorganization of surfactant at the
   interface. We demonstrate irreversible adsorption behavior of Tween 80
   near a critical interfacial tension value, as well as measure the
   dilatational elasticity of equilibrium and irreversibly adsorbed layers
   of surfactant on the oil-aqueous interface. We report high values of the
   surface dilatational elasticity and surface dilatational viscosity, and
   discuss these results in terms of their impact regarding oil spill
   response measures.}},

Abstract = {{The mole percentage of dead chains (T-mol \%) was quantified in a normal
   Cu-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methyl
   acrylate with tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine and
   tris{[}2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine as the ligands in acetonitrile. The
   value for T-mol \% significantly exceeded the values predicted for
   conventional termination between two radicals. The main reason for the
   additional loss of chain-end functionality was identified as a
   Cu-I-induced catalytic radical termination (CRT). The mechanism proposed
   for this CRT involves the formation of highly active R-Cu-II/L and/or
   H-Cu-II/L intermediates which react with radicals to form dead chains
   and regenerate the Cu-I activator. The contribution of CRT to the loss
   of terminal functionality can be significantly decreased by reducing
   {[}Cu-I] to <1 mM, according to recently developed new ATRP processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a framework to generate tight convex
   relaxations for nonconvex generalized disjunctive programs. The proposed
   methodology builds on our recent work on bilinear and concave
   generalized disjunctive programs for which tight linear relaxations can
   be generated, and extends its application to nonlinear relaxations. This
   is particularly important for those cases in which the convex envelopes
   of the nonconvex functions arising in the formulations are nonlinear (e.
   g. linear fractional terms). This extension is now possible by using the
   latest developments in disjunctive convex programming. We test the
   performance of the method in three typical process systems engineering
   problems, namely, the optimization of process networks, reactor networks
   and heat exchanger networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology aims to help individuals with
   disability to control assistive devices and reanimate paralyzed limbs.
   Our study investigated the feasibility of an electrocorticography
   (ECoG)-based BCI system in an individual with tetraplegia caused by C4
   level spinal cord injury. ECoG signals were recorded with a high-density
   32-electrode grid over the hand and arm area of the left sensorimotor
   cortex. The participant was able to voluntarily activate his
   sensorimotor cortex using attempted movements, with distinct cortical
   activity patterns for different segments of the upper limb. Using only
   brain activity, the participant achieved robust control of 3D cursor
   movement. The ECoG grid was explanted 28 days post-implantation with no
   adverse effect. This study demonstrates that ECoG signals recorded from
   the sensorimotor cortex can be used for real-time device control in
   paralyzed individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by a real-world industrial problem, this work deals with the
   integration of planning and scheduling in the operation of a net-work of
   batch plants. The network consists of single-stage, multiproduct batch
   plants located in different sites, which can exchange intermediate
   products in order to blend them to obtain finished products. The time
   horizon is given and divided into multiple time periods, at the end of
   which, the customer demands have to be exactly satisfied. The planning
   model is a simplified and aggregate formulation derived from the
   detailed precedence-based scheduling formulation. Traveling Salesman
   Problem (TSP) constraints are incorporated at the planning level in
   order to predict the sequence-dependent changeovers between groups of
   products, within and across time periods, without requiring the detailed
   timing of operations, which is performed at the scheduling level. In an
   effort to avoid solving the full-space, rigorous scheduling model,
   especially for large problem sizes, two decomposition strategies are
   investigated: Bilevel and Temporal Lagrangean. We demonstrate that
   Bilevel Decomposition is efficient for small to medium problem instances
   and that further decomposition of the planning problem, yielding a
   hybrid decomposition scheme, is advantageous for tackling a large-scale
   industrial test case.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) during subsurface injection was
   examined using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) stabilized nZVI in a very
   large three-dimensional physical model aquifer with detailed monitoring
   using multiple, complementary detection methods. A fluorescein tracer
   test in the aquifer plus laboratory column data suggested that the
   very-aggressive flow conditions necessary to achieve 2.5 m of nZVI
   transport could be obtained using a hydraulically constrained flow path
   between injection and extraction wells. However, total unoxidized nZVI
   was transported only about 1 m and <2\% of the injected nZVI
   concentration reached that distance. The experimental data also
   indicated that groundwater flow changed during injection, likely due to
   hydrogen bubble formation, which diverted the nZVI away from the
   targeted flow path. The leading edge of the iron plume became fully
   oxidized during transport. However, within the plume, oxidation of nZVI
   decreased in a fashion consistent with progressive depletion of aquifer
   ``reductant demand{''}. To directly quantify the extent of nZVI
   transport, a spectrophotometric method was developed, and the results
   indicated that deployment of unoxidized nZVI for groundwater remediation
   will likely be difficult.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we show experimentally that wireless power transfer (WPT)
   using strongly coupled magnetic resonance (SCMR) and traditional
   induction are equivalent. We demonstrate that for a given coil
   separation, and to within 4\%, strongly coupled magnetic resonance and
   traditional induction produce the same theoretical efficiency of
   wireless power transfer versus distance. Moreover, we show that the
   difference between traditional induction and strongly coupled magnetic
   resonance is in the implementation of the impedance matching network
   where strongly coupled magnetic resonance uses the mini-loop impedance
   match. The mini-loop impedance mach provides a low-loss, high-ratio
   impedance transformation that makes it desirable for longer distance
   wireless power transfer, where large impedance transformations are
   needed to maximize power transfer. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is a representative emerging technology in an embryonic
   stage. Due to the continuous support provided by both the public and
   private sectors of many countries, nanotechnologies have increasingly
   been commercialized in a wide array of industries, but also produce many
   commercialization failures. Tackling this problem, we investigate key
   factors affecting the commercialization of nanotechnologies. Identifying
   key factors of nanotechnology commercialization through literature
   review and interview with CEOs, we collected data of 206 Korean
   nanotechnology-based companies, and analyzed the causal relationship
   between key factors and financial performance. Logistic and Tobit
   regression models are used. Overall, companies achieving successful
   commercialization hold some common characteristics including consistent
   exploratory R\&D, governmental funding, and
   nano-instrument/energy/environment-related products. Also, the use of
   potentially toxic materials makes commercialization difficult even if
   the products are not toxic.}},

   collected from ambient outdoor air, indoor air, beneath building slabs,
   and from outside of buildings. Despite the large sample size, the
   considerable variability in compound and sample-specific censoring
   limits inhibited the use of conventional tools for statistical
   interpretation. This paper describes the development and application of
   improved statistical tools to address an unusually high degree of data
   censoring and possible artifacts related to uneven distributions of
   samples across sites and buildings. In addition to methods for
   calculating population percentiles and associated confidence intervals,
   methods for comparing the population of MGP-SVI data with a reference
   population were also developed and evaluated via illustrative
   comparisons with the published 2001 EPA Building Assessment Survey and
   Evaluation (BASE) study of industrial buildings. The focus of this work
   is on the development and evaluation of new statistical methods; a more
   complete summary and evaluation of the full NYS MGP-SVI data set will be
   presented in a companion paper.
   Implications: Data from vapor intrusion and other environmental studies
   are often stratified and/or censored, which complicates comparisons with
   background data or reference populations. In some cases, statistical
   methods for censored data can be modified to support population-based
   inference and reduce biases associated with the presence of repeated
   measurements from multiple sources. Such modifications are particularly
   appropriate for retrospective data mining studies that are not guided by
   a formal experimental design.

Abstract = {{This is the second part of a two-part paper that integrates economic and
   industrial ecology methods to estimate the indirect rebound effect from
   residential energy efficiency investments. We apply the model developed
   in part one to simulate the indirect rebound, given an estimate of the
   direct rebound, using a 2002 environmentally-extended input-output model
   and the 2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey (in 2002\$) for the U.S. We
   find an indirect rebound of 5-15\% in primary energy and CO(2)e
   emissions, assuming a 10\% direct rebound, depending on the fuel saved
   with efficiency and household income. The indirect rebound can be as
   high as 30-40\% in NOx or SO2 emissions for efficiency in natural gas
   services. The substitution effect modeled in part one is small in most
   cases, and we discuss appropriate applications for proportional or
   income elasticity spending assumptions. Large indirect rebound effects
   occur as the U.S. electric grid becomes less-carbon intensive, in
   households with large transportation demands, or as energy prices
   increase. Even in extreme cases, there is limited evidence for backfire,
   or a rebound effect greater than 100\%. Enacting pollution taxes or
   auctioned permits that internalize the externalities of energy use would
   ensure that rebound effects unambiguously increase consumers' welfare.

Abstract = {{This is the first part of a two-part paper providing an analytical model
   of the indirect rebound effect, given a direct rebound estimate, that
   integrates consumer demand theory with the embodied energy of household
   spending from environmentally-extended input-output analysis. The second
   part applies the model developed in part one to simulate the direct and
   indirect rebound for the average U.S. household in terms of primary
   energy, CO(2)e, NOx, and SO2 emissions and for energy efficiency
   investments in electricity, natural gas, or gasoline services. Part one
   provides a critical review of the largely independent economic and
   industrial ecology literatures on the indirect rebound. By studying the
   two-goods case and the n-goods case, we demonstrate that the indirect
   rebound is bounded by the consumer budget constraint, and inversely
   related to the direct rebound. We also compare the common proportional
   spending and income elasticity spending assumptions with our model of
   cross-price elasticities including both substitution and income effects
   for the indirect rebound. By assuming zero incremental capital costs and
   the same embodied energy as conventional technologies for efficient
   appliances, we model an upper bound of the indirect rebound. Future work
   should also consider the increase in consumer welfare possible through
   the rebound effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To address some of the fundamental questions regarding the functions of
   cathodes and anodes (e.g., iron and granular active carbon) and what
   happens when numerous particles (microscopic galvanic cells) are
   combined in the widely used and efficient wastewater treatment of an
   internal microelectrolysis (IME) reactor, we employed a specifically
   designed dual-cell IME reactor with single-couple electrodes and a
   narrow cell IME reactor with multi-couple electrodes. The simultaneous
   removal of 6.36 mg L-1 and 2.93 mg L-1 of 2,4-dichlorophenol within 30
   min from the graphite cathode and the iron anode cells, respectively,
   was observed in the dual-cell reactor. The innovative concept behind
   this phenomenon is that the anode, which is generally believed to be
   oxidative, could probably be reductive in an IME reactor. Thus, it is
   important to understand the unique performance of IME reactors. The
   group effect, which provides a 45\% increase of open-circuit potential
   with just two additional electrode couples in aqueous solution, was
   tested and verified in a multi-couple electrode reactor. It suggests a
   complex potential distribution in the IME reactor and that compounds
   even with high redox potential could possibly be reduced, which was
   generally believed to be difficult to accomplish. Crown Copyright (C)

   material had more than three times the relative area of these boundaries
   compared to the sinter-HIP material. Measurements of the WC/WC and WC/Co

Abstract = {{Shear-coupled grain boundary motion is examined for a large number of
   grain boundaries including 73 < 1 0 0 >, < 1 1 0 > and < 1 1 1 >
   symmetric tilt boundaries. In the present work, the grain boundary
   motion is induced by a synthetic driving force as opposed to prior
   studies of shear coupling induced by applied shear. For those boundaries
   that are observed to undergo shear-coupled motion, the results based on
   the two driving forces agree well, both for experiments and simulations.
   This agreement also confirms the generality of the shear coupling
   mechanism over numerous boundaries and boundary types. The examination
   of boundary structure provides insight into the different trends that
   are observed. Shear coupling according to modes not predicted by the
   Frank-Bilby equation are also demonstrated. The temperature dependence
   of shear coupling is examined, and is consistent with prior work for
   symmetric tilt boundaries. While prior studies have emphasized symmetric
   tilt boundaries, some general grain boundaries exhibit shear coupling as
   well. In these boundaries, it is found that the shear coupling is either
   temperature independent, decreases in magnitude with increasing
   temperature or, in some cases, changes direction with temperature. (C)

   grain boundary planes with the (1 1 1) orientation had the minimum
   energy and the largest relative areas. The most commonly observed
   boundaries were \{1 1 2\} symmetric tilt boundaries with the Sigma 3
   misorientation; this boundary also had a low energy. On average there

Abstract = {{We present a simulation of the 2008 M-w 5.4 Chino Hills earthquake for a
   maximum frequency up to 4 Hz and a minimum shear-wave velocity down to
   200 m/s and perform a validation study comparing data obtained from
   seismic networks with simulation synthetics on more than 300 recording
   stations. The simulation was done using a parallel-computing code for
   earthquake simulations that implements a finite-element solution to
   anelastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media. The source model
   corresponds to that of an independent inversion study, and the material
   model used is a community velocity model (CVM) developed by the Southern
   California Earthquake Center (SCEC). Our results for the goodness-of-fit
   measure of the synthetics indicate that, from a regional perspective,
   the simulation starts to deviate from the data at frequencies above 1
   and 2 Hz. At particular locations or station clusters, however, the
   synthetics yield very good results, even at frequencies between 2 and 4
   Hz. The best results are obtained between 0.1 and 0.25 Hz over the
   entire region and up to 1 Hz within the major basins. These and other
   results from comparisons at boreholes, biases of the peak surface
   response, and the differences in the strong-phase duration of the
   waveforms and the arrival time of P waves suggest a strong sensitivity
   to seismic velocities. In particular, the CVM used seems to misrepresent
   the shallow soil deposits and overestimate seismic velocities in the
   upper layers outside the basins. These observations are helpful in
   identifying regions where the velocity model may need to be revised.
   Overall, this study shows that extending the maximum frequency for
   deterministic earthquake simulations beyond 1 Hz is an effort worth
   pursuing.}},

Abstract = {{Although deviations from standard guidance for land application of
   biosolids occur in practice, their importance is largely unknown. A list
   of such deviations (plausible failure scenarios) were identified at a
   workshop of industry, regulators, and academic professionals. Next, a
   survey of similar professionals was conducted to rank the plausible
   failure scenarios according to their severity, frequency, incentive to
   ignore control measures, gaps in existing control processes, public
   concern, and overall concern. Survey participants rated intentional
   dumping (unpermitted disposal) as the most severe of the failure
   scenarios, lack of worker protection as the most frequent scenario, and
   application of Class A biosolids that have failed to meet treatment
   standards as the scenario for which incentives to ignore control
   measures are highest. Failure of public access restrictions to
   application sites was the scenario for which existing controls were
   judged the weakest; application of biosolids too close to wells was
   ranked highest for public concern and for overall concern. Two scenarios
   for which existing controls were considered weaker, site restriction
   violations and animal contact leading to human exposure, were also rated
   as frequently occurring. Both scenarios are related in that they (1)
   involve inappropriate access to a site before the required time has
   elapsed, and (2) could be addressed through similar biosolids management
   measures. Water Environ. Res., 85, 141 (2013).}},

Abstract = {{Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are popular in many computer
   vision tasks. In most of them, the SVM classifier assumes that the
   object to be classified is centered in the query image, which might not
   always be valid, e.g., when locating and classifying a particular class
   of vehicles in a large scene. In this paper, we introduce a new
   classifier called Maximum Margin Correlation Filter (MMCF), which, while
   exhibiting the good generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers, is
   also capable of localizing objects of interest, thereby avoiding the
   need for image centering as is usually required in SVM classifiers. In
   other words, MMCF can simultaneously localize and classify objects of
   interest. We test the efficacy of the proposed classifier on three
   different tasks: vehicle recognition, eye localization, and face
   classification. We demonstrate that MMCF outperforms SVM classifiers as
   well as well known correlation filters.}},

Title = {{The Meaning of ``Near{''} and ``Far{''}: The Impact of Structuring
   Design Databases and the Effect of Distance of Analogy on Design Output}},

Abstract = {{This work lends insight into the meaning and impact of ``near{''} and
   ``far{''} analogies. A cognitive engineering design study is presented
   that examines the effect of the distance of analogical design stimuli on
   design solution generation, and places those findings in context of
   results from the literature. The work ultimately sheds new light on the
   impact of analogies in the design process and the significance of their
   distance from a design problem. In this work, the design repository from
   which analogical stimuli are chosen is the U.S. patent database, a
   natural choice, as it is one of the largest and easily accessed
   catalogued databases of inventions. The ``near{''} and ``far{''}
   analogical stimuli for this study were chosen based on a structure of
   patents, created using a combination of latent semantic analysis and a
   Bayesian based algorithm for discovering structural form, resulting in
   clusters of patents connected by their relative similarity. The findings
   of this engineering design study are juxtaposed with the findings of a
   previous study by the authors in design by analogy, which appear to be
   contradictory when viewed independently. However, by mapping the
   analogical stimuli used in the earlier work into similar structures
   along with the patents used in the current study, a relationship between
   all of the stimuli and their relative distance from the design problem
   is discovered. The results confirm that ``near{''} and ``far{''} are
   relative terms, and depend on the characteristics of the potential
   stimuli. Further, although the literature has shown that ``far{''}
   analogical stimuli are more likely to lead to the generation of
   innovative solutions with novel characteristics, there is such a thing
   as too far. That is, if the stimuli are too distant, they then can
   become harmful to the design process. Importantly, as well, the data
   mapping approach to identify analogies works, and is able to impact the
   effectiveness of the design process. This work has implications not only
   in the area of finding inspirational designs to use for design by
   analogy processes in practice, but also for synthesis, or perhaps even
   unification, of future studies in the field of design by analogy.

Abstract = {{Due to current technology scaling trends such as shrinking feature sizes
   and decreasing supply voltages, circuit reliability is becoming more
   susceptible to radiation-induced transient faults (soft errors). Soft
   errors, which have been a great concern in memories, are now a main
   factor in reliability degradation of logic circuits as well. In this
   paper, we present a systematic and integrated methodology for circuit
   robustness to soft errors. The proposed soft error rate (SER) reduction
   framework, based on redundancy addition and removal (RAR), aims at
   eliminating those gates with large contribution to the overall SER.
   Several metrics and constraints are introduced to guide the RAR-based
   approach toward SER reduction. Furthermore, we integrate a resizing
   strategy into our framework, as post-RAR additive SER optimization. The
   strategy can identify most critical gates to be upsized and thereby,
   minimize area and power overheads while maintaining a high level of soft
   error robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed RAR-based
   framework can achieve up to 70\% reduction in output failure
   probability. On average, about 23\% SER reduction is obtained with less
   than 4\% area overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Stereological analysis has been coupled with transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) orientation mapping to investigate the grain boundary
   character distribution in nanocrystalline copper thin films. The use of
   the nanosized (<5 nm) beam in the TEM for collecting spot diffraction
   patterns renders an order of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution
   compared to the analysis of electron backscatter diffraction patterns in
   the scanning electron microscope. Electron beam precession is used to
   reduce dynamical effects and increase the reliability of orientation
   solutions. The misorientation distribution function shows a strong
   misorientation texture with a peak at 60 degrees/{[}111], corresponding
   to the Sigma 3 misorientation. The grain boundary plane distribution
   shows \{111\} as the most frequently occurring plane, indicating a
   significant population of coherent twin boundaries. This study
   demonstrates the use of nanoscale orientation mapping in the TEM to
   quantify the five-parameter grain boundary distribution in
   nanocrystalline materials.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{189-197}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A modification of the Potts model for grain growth is presented. We add
   to the site energy a grain size factor that favors growth of large
   grains and whose magnitude has been optimized with respect to various
   aspects. The motivation for such a modification as well as the
   consequences in term of calculation speed are presented. The
   capabilities of this modified model are checked by comparing several
   characteristics of the microstructures obtained after various grain
   growth simulations with experimental data obtained for an IF steel. One
   large EBSD map, made at the end of the primary recrystallization, is
   used directly as the initial image for the calculations. A second EBSD
   map, obtained after grain growth (with a mean diameter of the grains
   about twice the initial value) was used for comparisons between the
   simulations and the experiment. The grain size distribution, the grain
   boundary character distribution and the crystallographic texture are
   reproduced rather well with this modified model using a moderate grain
   size factor effect. Also the speedup of the calculation is quite
   significant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aims to review retrospectively the records of
   patients treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS) to investigate the
   potential correlations between clinical variables, distal protection
   filter (DPF) type and characteristics, and 30-day peri-/postprocedural
   outcomes.
   Methods: This is a multicenter, single-arm, nonrandomized retrospective
   study of patients who underwent filter-protected CAS in the Pittsburgh,
   Pennsylvania, region between July 2000 and May 2011. Analysis of
   peri-/postprocedural complications included myocardial infarction,
   transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, death, and a composition of
   all adverse events (AEs). Filter characteristics for Accunet (Abbott
   Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif; n = 429 {[}58.8\%]), Angioguard (Cordis
   Endovascular, Miami Lakes, Fla; n = 114 {[}15.6\%]), FilterWire (Boston
   Scientific, Natick, Mass; n = 113 {[}15.5\%]), Spider (ev3 Endovascular,
   Plymouth, Minn; n = 45 {[}6.2\%]), and Emboshield (Abbott Vascular; n =
   24 {[}3.3\%]) were previously determined in vitro and were used to find
   correlations with CAS procedural outcomes. Both univariate and
   multivariate analyses were performed, as well as goodness-of-fit tests
   to find multivariate correlations with procedural outcomes.
   Results: In total, 731 CAS procedures using six different DPFs were
   analyzed. Peri-/postprocedural AEs included 19 TIAs (2.6\%), 38 strokes
   (5.2\%), one myocardial infarction (0.1\%), 19 deaths (3.6\%), and a
   total of 61 patients with complications (8.3\%). Univariate analysis for
   filter design characteristics showed that the composite of AE was
   negatively associated with both vascular resistance (P = .01) and
   eccentricity (P = .02) and was positively associated with porosity (P =
   .0007), number of pores (P = .005), and pore density (P = .001).
   Multivariate analysis and the goodness-of-fit test revealed that
   patients with a history of congestive heart failure, stroke, and TIA
   (each with odds ratio >1) led to a good-fit model P value of .72 for
   peri-/postprocedural AEs. Multivariate analysis was inconclusive for all
   filter design characteristics.
   Conclusions: The following filter design characteristics are
   independently significant for minimizing peri-/postprocedural AEs:
   higher vascular resistance, concentric in shape, greater capture
   efficiency, lower porosity, lower number of pores, and lower pore
   density. Lower porosity and smaller wall apposition were also found to
   be independently significant for minimization of peri-/postprocedural
   TIAs. This information can be used when considering the desirable design
   characteristics of future DPFs.) (J Vasc Surg 2013; 57: 309-17.)}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is presented for calculating the parent orientation from
   sets of variants of orientations produced by phase transformation. The
   parent austenite orientation is determined using the orientations of
   bainite variants that transformed from a single parent austenite grain.
   In this approach, the five known orientation relationships are used to
   back transform each observed bainite variant to all their potential
   face-centered-cubic (f.c.c.) parent orientations. A set of potential
   f.c.c. orientations has one representative from each bainite variant,
   and each set is assembled on the basis of minimum mutual misorientation.
   The set of back-transformed orientations with the minimum summation of
   mutual misorientation angle (SMMA) is selected as the most probable
   parent (austenite) orientation. The availability of multiple sets
   permits a confidence index to be calculated from the best and next best
   fits to a parent orientation. The results show good agreement between
   the measured parent austenite orientation and the calculated parent
   orientation having minimum SMMA.}},

Abstract = {{Computational and experimental methodologies are integrated into a novel
   combined technique to define microstructure design criteria and maximize

   Two-dimensional orientation maps obtained using electron backscatter
   diffraction on sequential parallel layers are used to computationally
   reconstruct three-dimensional samples, simulate the local piezoelectric
   grain interactions, and thus demonstrate that superior lead-free
   piezoelectric microstructures can be fabricated by engineering its
   associated crystallographic and polarization texture. Computer-generated
   material representations, based on the experimentally determined
   microstructures, were used to simulate the crystallographic orientation
   of each grain, as function a macroscopic polarization and
   crystallographic texture. Computer-generated material representations,
   based on the experimentally determined microstructures, were used to
   simulate the crystallographic orientation of each grain, as function a
   macroscopic polarization and crystallographic texture. The method takes
   advantage of the anisotropy of the properties of the underlying
   single-crystal phases and delivers a guide to search for material
   anisotropy microstructure parameters that are optimal in piezoelectric

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study of the
   segregation behavior of the ternary alloy CuPdY in vacuum (i.e., the
   clean surface) and in the presence of oxygen. Theoretical prediction
   shows that for clean surface, yttrium will substitute first for Cu and
   then for Pd at the subsurface lattice site before segregating to the
   surface where it substitutes for Cu. XRD characterization of the surface
   of CuPdY indicates the presence of two major phases, B2 CuPd and Pd3Y.
   In the presence of adsorbed oxygen, theory predicts that Y
   preferentially occupies surface sites due to its stronger oxygen
   affinity compared to Cu and Pd. XPS experiments confirm the
   computational results in the adsorbed oxygen case, showing that surface
   segregation of yttrium is induced by the formation of Y-oxides at the
   top-surface of the alloy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A set of six spherically curved Cu single crystals referred to as
   Surface Structure Spread Single Crystals ((SCs)-Cs-4) has been prepared
   in such a way that their exposed surfaces collectively span all possible
   crystallographic surface orientations that can be cleaved from the face
   centered cubic Cu lattice. The method for preparing these (SCs)-Cs-4 and
   for finding the high symmetry pole point is described. Optical
   profilometry has been used to determine the true shapes of the
   (SCs)-Cs-4 and show that over the majority of the surface, the shape is
   extremely close to that of a perfect sphere. The local orientations of
   the surfaces lie within +/- 1 degrees of the orientation expected on the
   basis of the spherical shape; their orientation is as good as that of
   many commercially prepared single crystals. STM imaging has been used to
   characterize the atomic level structure of the Cu(111) +/- 11
   degrees-(SC)-C-4. This has shown that the average step densities and the
   average step orientations match those expected based on the spherical
   shape. In other words, although there is some distribution of step-step
   spacing and step orientations, there is no evidence of large scale
   reconstruction or faceting. The Cu (SCs)-Cs-4 have local structures
   based on the ideal termination of the face centered cubic Cu lattice in
   the direction of termination. The set of Cu (SCs)-Cs-4 will serve as the
   basis for high throughput investigations of structure sensitive surface
   chemistry on Cu. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the preliminary results of a research project that
   investigates the feasibility of continuous monitoring techniques using
   piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) permanently installed on steel pipes.
   The ultrasonic waves generated by PZTs are multimodal and dispersive.
   Therefore, it is difficult to detect changes created by the presence of
   damage, and it is even more difficult to differentiate changes produced
   by damage from benign changes produced by variation in environmental and
   operational conditions. In this paper, the results are reported of
   applying pattern recognition techniques to detect a mass scatterer (a
   proxy for damage) under ambient variations primarily due to varying
   internal pressure of a pipe. Using wavelet methods, 303 features are
   extracted, and adaptive boosting, modified adaptive boosting, and
   support vector machines for damage detection are employed. The
   performances of the three classifiers are evaluated over 41 trials with
   different combinations of training and testing data, resulting in the
   average accuracies of 85, 89, and 94\%, respectively. Finally, the
   effectiveness of wavelet processing and features selected are discussed.

Abstract = {{A comprehensive scheme is described to construct rational trivariate
   solid T-splines from boundary triangulations with arbitrary topology. To
   extract the topology of the input geometry, we first compute a smooth
   harmonic scalar field defined over the mesh, and saddle points are
   extracted to determine the topology. By dealing with the saddle points,
   a polycube whose topology is equivalent to the input geometry is built,
   and it serves as the parametric domain for the trivariate T-spline. A
   polycube mapping is then used to build a one-to-one correspondence
   between the input triangulation and the polycube boundary. After that,
   we choose the deformed octree subdivision of the polycube as the initial
   T-mesh, and make it valid through pillowing, quality improvement and
   applying templates to handle extraordinary nodes and partial
   extraordinary nodes. The T-spline that is obtained is C-2-continuous
   everywhere over the boundary surface except for the local region
   surrounding polycube corner nodes. The efficiency and robustness of the
   presented technique are demonstrated with several applications in
   isogeometric analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an underactuated modular climbing robot with flat
   dry elastomer adhesives. This robot is designed to achieve high speed,
   high payload, and dexterous motions that are typical drawbacks of
   previous climbing robots. Each module is designed as a tread-wheeled
   mechanism to simultaneously realize high speed and high adhesive force.
   Two modules are connected by compliant joints, which induce a positive
   preload on the front wheels resulting in stable climbing and high
   payload capacity. Compliant joints also help the robot to perform
   various transitions. An active tail is adopted to regulate the preload
   of the second module. Force transfer equations are derived and stable
   operating conditions are verified. The stiffness coefficients of the
   compliant joints and the active tail force are determined optimally to
   satisfy the constraints of stable operation. The prototype two-module
   robot achieves 6-cm/s speed and 500-g payload capacity on vertical
   surfaces. The abilities of flat surface locomotion, internal, external,
   and thin-wall transitions, and overcoming various sized obstacles are
   validated through experiment. The principle of joint compliance can be
   adopted in other climbing robots to enhance their stability and
   transition capability.}},

Abstract = {{We extend classical solutions in contact mechanics to examine the
   collapse of channels in a soft elastomer. These channels have triangular
   cross-section and collapse when pressure is applied to the surrounding

   the channel base, we derive an algebraic mapping between pressure and
   cross-sectional area. These theoretical predictions are in strong
   agreement with results that we obtain through finite element analysis

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence to suggest that physical parameters,
   including substrate rigidity, topography, and cell geometry, play an
   important role in cell migration. As there are significant differences
   in cell behavior when cultured in 1D, 2D, or 3D environments, we
   hypothesize that migrating cells are also able to sense the dimension of
   the environment as a guidance cue. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on
   micropatterned substrates where the path of migration alternates between
   1D lines and 2D rectangles. We found that 3T3 cells had a clear
   preference to stay on 2D rather than 1D substrates. Cells on 2D surfaces
   generated stronger traction stress than did those on 1D surfaces, but
   inhibition of myosin II caused cells to lose their sensitivity to
   substrate dimension, suggesting that myosin-II-dependent traction forces
   are the determining factor for dimension sensing. Furthermore,
   oncogene-transformed fibroblasts are defective in mechanosensing while
   generating similar traction forces on 1D and 2D surfaces. Dimension
   sensing may be involved in guiding cell migration for both physiological
   functions and tissue engineering, and for maintaining normal cells in
   their home tissue.}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies,
   we are facing an exponential increase in the amount of genomic sequence
   data. The success of all medical and genetic applications of
   next-generation sequencing critically depends on the existence of
   computational techniques that can process and analyze the enormous
   amount of sequence data quickly and accurately. Unfortunately, the
   current read mapping algorithms have difficulties in coping with the
   massive amounts of data generated by NGS.
   We propose a new algorithm, FastHASH, which drastically improves the
   performance of the seed-and-extend type hash table based read mapping
   algorithms, while maintaining the high sensitivity and comprehensiveness
   of such methods. FastHASH is a generic algorithm compatible with all
   seed-and-extend class read mapping algorithms. It introduces two main
   techniques, namely Adjacency Filtering, and Cheap K-mer Selection. We
   implemented FastHASH and merged it into the codebase of the popular read
   mapping program, mrFAST.
   Depending on the edit distance cutoffs, we observed up to 19-fold
   speedup while still maintaining 100\% sensitivity and high

Abstract = {{Lightweight aerogels with large specific surface area (SSA) have
   numerous applications. Free-standing aerogels are created from
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and their SSA and pore

   extraordinarily high and approaches 1291 m2 g-1 at a density of 7.3 mg
   mL-1, which is close to the theoretical limit (1315 m2 g-1). Mechanical
   characterization shows that these aerogels have open-cell structures and
   their Young's moduli are higher than other aerogels at comparable
   density. The aerogels also enhance heat transfer in a forced convective
   process by 85\%, presumably due to their large porosity and surface

Pages = {{362-372}},

Abstract = {{During pediatric and neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), tiny aortic
   outflow cannulae (2-3 mm inner diameter), with micro-scale blood-wetting
   features transport relatively large blood volumes (0.3 to 1.0 L/min)
   resulting in high blood flow velocities (2 to 5 m/s). These severe flow
   conditions are likely to complement platelet activation, release
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, and further result in vascular and blood
   damage. Hemodynamically efficient aortic outflow cannulae are required
   to provide high blood volume flow rates at low exit force. In addition,
   optimal aortic insertion strategies are necessary in order to alleviate
   hemolytic risk, post-surgical neurological complications and
   developmental defects, by improving cerebral perfusion in the young
   patient. The methodology and results presented in this study serve as a
   baseline for design of superior aortic outflow cannulae. In this study,
   direct numerical simulation (DNS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was
   employed to delineate baseline hemodynamic performance of jet wakes
   emanating from microCT scanned state-of-the-art pediatric cannula tips
   in a cuboidal test rig operating at physiologically relevant laminar and
   turbulent Reynolds numbers (Re: 650-2150, steady inflow). Qualitative
   and quantitative validation of CFD simulated device-specific jet wakes
   was established using time-resolved flow visualization and particle
   image velocimetry (PIV). For the standard end-hole cannula tip design,
   blood damage indices were further numerically assessed in a
   subject-specific cross-clamped neonatal aorta model for different
   cannula insertion configurations. Based on these results, a novel
   diffuser type cannula tip is proposed for improved jet flow-control,
   decreased blood damage and exit force and increased permissible flow
   rates. This study also suggests that surgically relevant cannula
   orientation parameters such as outflow angle and insertion depth may be
   important for improved hemodynamic performance. The jet flow design
   paradigm demonstrated in this study represents a philosophical shift
   towards cannula flow control enabling favorable pressure-drop versus
   outflow rate characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-77}},

Abstract = {{Available bandwidth is usually sensitive to network anomalies such as
   physical link failure, congestion, and DDoS attack. Thus, real-time
   available bandwidth information can be used to detect network anomalies.
   Many schemes have been proposed to estimate the end-to-end available
   bandwidth or end-to-end capacity. However, the problem of estimating the
   available bandwidth for a specific remote link has not been investigated
   in detail yet. We propose a new scheme to estimate the available
   bandwidth ratio of a remote link or remote path segments, a group of
   consecutive links, without deploying our tool at the remote nodes. The
   scheme would be helpful in accurately pinpointing anomalous links. Two
   streams of ICMP timestamp packets are sent to both end nodes of a target
   link according to a Poisson process, and the available bandwidth ratio
   for the target link is estimated based on the measured packet delay.
   Since the proposed scheme needs not incur a short-term congestion,
   unlike conventional end-to-end available bandwidth estimation
   mechanisms, the intrusiveness is low and the proposed scheme overcomes
   the limitation of conventional approaches, inability to probe the links
   beyond the tight link with the minimum available bandwidth. The
   performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by ns-2 simulation. (C)

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results from laboratory emission testing have indicated
   that particulate emission measurements are sensitive to the dilution
   process of exhaust using fabricated dilution systems. In this paper, we
   first categorize the dilution parameters into two groups: (1)
   aerodynamics (e.g., mixing types, mixing enhancers, dilution ratios,
   residence time); and (2) mixture properties (e.g., temperature, relative
   humidity, particle size distributions of both raw exhaust and dilution
   gas). Then we employ the Comprehensive Turbulent Aerosol Dynamics and
   Gas Chemistry (CTAG) model to investigate the effects of those
   parameters on a set of particulate emission measurements comparing two
   dilution tunnels, i.e., a T-mixing lab dilution tunnel and a portable
   field dilution tunnel with a type of coaxial mixing. The turbulent flow
   fields and aerosol dynamics of particles are simulated inside two
   dilution tunnels. Particle size distributions under various dilution
   conditions predicted by CTAG are evaluated against the experimental
   data. It is found that in the area adjacent to the injection of exhaust,
   turbulence plays a crucial role in mixing the exhaust with the dilution
   air, and the strength of nucleation dominates the level of particle
   number concentrations. Further downstream, nucleation terminates and the
   growth of particles by condensation and coagulation continues.
   Sensitivity studies reveal that a potential unifying parameter for
   aerodynamics, i.e., the dilution rate of exhaust, plays an important
   role in new particle formation. The T-mixing lab tunnel tends to favor
   the nucleation due to a larger dilution rate of the exhaust than the
   coaxial mixing field tunnel. Our study indicates that numerical
   simulation tools can be potentially utilized to develop strategies to
   reduce the uncertainties associated with dilution samplings of emission
   sources.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{143-155}},

Abstract = {{The optimum sequence parameters of diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) on
   clinical scanners were investigated previously. However, the scan time
   of approximately 30 min is still too long for patient studies.
   Additionally, relatively large sampling interval in the
   diffusion-encoding space may cause aliasing artifact in the probability
   density function when Fourier transform is undertaken, leading to
   estimation error in fiber orientations. Therefore, this study proposed a
   non-Cartesian sampling scheme, body-centered-cubic (BCC), to avoid the
   aliasing artifact as compared to the conventional Cartesian grid
   sampling scheme (GRID). Furthermore, the accuracy of DSI with the use of
   half-sphere sampling schemes, i.e. GRID102 and BCC91, was investigated
   by comparing to their full-sphere sampling schemes, GRID203 and BCC181,
   respectively. In results, smaller deviation angle and lower angular
   dispersion were obtained by using the BCC sampling scheme. The
   half-sphere sampling schemes yielded angular precision and accuracy
   comparable to the full-sphere sampling schemes. The optimum b(max) was
   approximately 4750 s/mm(2) for GRID and 4500 s/mm(2) for BCC. In
   conclusion, the BCC sampling scheme could be implemented as a useful
   alternative to the GRID sampling scheme. Combination of BCC and
   half-sphere sampling schemes, that is BCC91, may potentially reduce the
   scan time of DSI from 30 min to approximately 14 min while maintaining
   its precision and accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fully-implicit ghost-cell immersed boundary method for simulations of
   flow over complex moving bodies on a Cartesian grid is presented. The
   present immersed boundary method is highly capable of controlling the
   generation of spurious force oscillations on the surface of a moving
   body, thereby producing an accurate and stable solution. Spurious force
   oscillations on the surface of an immersed moving body are reduced by
   alleviating spatial and temporal discontinuities in the pressure and
   velocity fields across non-grid conforming immersed boundaries. A
   sharp-interface ghost-cell immersed-boundary method is coupled with a
   mass source and sink algorithm to improve the conservation of mass
   across non-grid conforming immersed boundaries. To facilitate the
   control for the temporal discontinuity in the flow field due to a motion
   of an immersed body, a fully-implicit time-integration scheme is
   employed. A novel backward time-integration scheme is developed to
   effectively treat multiple layers of fresh cells generated by a motion
   of an immersed body at a high CFL number condition. The present backward
   time-integration scheme allows to impose more accurate and stable
   velocity vectors on fresh cells than those interpolated. The
   effectiveness of the present fully-implicit ghost-cell immersed boundary
   method coupled with a mass source and sink algorithm for reducing
   spurious force oscillations during simulations of moving body problems
   is demonstrated in a number of test cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The transient electroforming process of TiO2-based resistive switching
   devices is investigated using a pulsed voltage method, and the
   electroforming time is found to vary from 10(-8) s to 10(-1) s as
   function of pulse magnitude (3-8 V) and ambient temperature (25-100
   degrees C). Pulsed experiments and thermal simulations reveal that Joule
   self-heating has a significant effect on the electroforming dynamics,
   specially for electroforming voltages above 5.5V where there is little
   dependence on ambient temperature and the electroforming time (10-100
   ns) is much shorter than the device thermal time constant ( approximate
   to 2 mu s). (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{175-186}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{The molecular weight distribution (MWD) is at the core of establishing
   key quality indices for free radical polymerization processes. Due to
   large-scale features of the rigorous model, consisting of a very large
   number of differential and algebraic equations, dynamic simulation of
   MWD is always challenging. A sequential variable decoupling method (SVD)
   has been proposed to calculate the MWD for any reasonably large
   chain-length number. In the current paper, parallel computing methods
   were developed to accelerate the MWD simulation. Both coarse-grained and
   fine-grained parallelism methods have been proposed. A theoretical
   analysis of the proposed methods was conducted to demonstrate its high
   efficiency in parallel computing. Both Intel multi-core-processor-based
   and NVIDIA graphics-processing-unit-based parallel computing platforms
   were implemented, achieving significant speedups in computation for MWD
   simulation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Use of Census Migration Data to Approximate Human Movement Patterns
   across Temporal Scales}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Human movement plays a key role in economies and development, the
   delivery of services, and the spread of infectious diseases. However, it
   remains poorly quantified partly because reliable data are often
   lacking, particularly for low-income countries. The most widely
   available are migration data from human population censuses, which
   provide valuable information on relatively long timescale relocations
   across countries, but do not capture the shorter-scale patterns, trips
   less than a year, that make up the bulk of human movement.
   Census-derived migration data may provide valuable proxies for
   shorter-term movements however, as substantial migration between regions
   can be indicative of well connected places exhibiting high levels of
   movement at finer time scales, but this has never been examined in
   detail. Here, an extensive mobile phone usage data set for Kenya was
   processed to extract movements between counties in 2009 on weekly,
   monthly, and annual time scales and compared to data on change in
   residence from the national census conducted during the same time
   period. We find that the relative ordering across Kenyan counties for
   incoming, outgoing and between-county movements shows strong
   correlations. Moreover, the distributions of trip durations from both
   sources of data are similar, and a spatial interaction model fit to the
   data reveals the relationships of different parameters over a range of
   movement time scales. Significant relationships between census migration
   data and fine temporal scale movement patterns exist, and results
   suggest that census data can be used to approximate certain features of
   movement patterns across multiple temporal scales, extending the utility
   of census-derived migration data.}},

   Copolymers}},
Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of grain size and shape as well as type and frequency of
   grain boundary structures during thermal annealing of lamellar diblock
   copolymer microstructures is established using large area image
   reconstruction and analysis. Grain coarsening is found to proceed via an
   initial transient stage that is characterized by the rapid relaxation of
   unstable ``frozen-in{''} defects such as kink boundaries and the
   subsequent quasi-stationary coarsening that is dominated by the
   continuous relaxation of low-angle symmetric tilt boundaries. The
   particular relevance of low-angle symmetric tilt boundaries to grain
   coarsening is interpreted as the consequence of both the associated
   decrease of boundary energy as well as the availability of favorable
   kinetic pathways-such as grain boundary splitting-to facilitate the
   coarsening process. The inverse relation between grain boundary energy
   and frequency suggests that the reduction of boundary energy is a
   relevant governing parameter for the evolution of grain boundary
   structures-as it is in inorganic materials. The existence of ``inert{''}
   boundary types (such as asymmetric tilt and twist) that-within the
   experimental window-do not participate in the coarsening process is
   expected to have dominant influence on the final morphology that can be
   attained by thermal annealing of the microstructure. The reduction of
   the density of inert boundaries during the film preparation process
   should therefore provide a strategy for increasing the coarsening
   kinetics in block copolymer films during thermal annealing and thus a
   path toward a higher degree of order in block copolymer microstructures.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to supply fresh water are becoming increasingly critical as the
   world population continues to grow. Small-diameter hazardous microbes
   such as viruses (20-100 nm diameter) can be filtered by size exclusion,
   but in this approach the filters are fouled. Thus, in our research, we
   are investigating an approach in which filters will be reusable. When
   exposed to ultraviolet (UV) illumination, titanate materials
   photocatalytically evolve (OH)-O-center dot and O2(center dot-)
   radicals, which attack biological materials. In the proposed approach,
   titanate nanosheets are deposited on a substrate. Viruses adsorb on
   these nanosheets and degrade when exposed to UV light. Using atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), we image adsorbed viruses and demonstrate that
   they are removed by UV illumination in the presence of the nanosheets,
   but not in their absence.}},

Abstract = {{Solid sorbents are believed to be a promising early-stage technology for
   achieving more cost-effective capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from large
   point sources, especially coal-fired power plants. To better assess the
   potential advantages of solid sorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture,
   this paper presents preliminary results of an analysis of two
   representative sorbents in an integrated model for estimating
   plant-level performance and costs for a new, supercritical pulverized
   coal (PC) power plant. A probabilistic comparison is then made between
   two solid sorbents and a commercial amine-based liquid solvent system.
   Our results show that for a 90\% CO2 removal efficiency, the solid
   sorbent provides an expected net plant efficiency of 32\% (higher
   heating value basis) for a metal-organic framework solid and 29\%
   efficiency for a solid amine-based sorbent, versus 28\% net efficiency
   with a liquid amine-based system using the same reference plant
   assumptions. Cost estimates for solid sorbent systems, however, remain
   highly uncertain at this time, mainly because of large uncertainties in
   capital cost estimates. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   However, both the chemical looping processes lead to higher efficiencies
   than a conventional solvent-based pre-combustion CO2 capture. The

   plant were also found to be lower than a conventional pre-combustion

Abstract = {{Membrane systems are under development for cost-effective carbon dioxide
   (CO2) capture. This study is to investigate the effects of adding
   CO2-selective polymeric membrane systems to coal-fired power plants
   using newly developed performance and cost models. Sensitivity analysis
   is further carried out to explore the influences of key parameters and
   factors on the power plant and the membrane-based capture system. The
   results show that adding a two-stage membrane system for 90\% CO2
   capture to a coal-fired power plant nearly doubles the plant cost of
   electricity and incurs a high energy penalty up to about 30\% of the
   gross electrical output; using both compressors and vacuum pumps to
   produce driving force for membrane gas separation is effective with
   reducing the capture cost; and recycling a portion of CO2 via a
   multi-stage/step membrane configuration with air sweep would
   significantly reduce the overall system energy penalty and the cost of
   CO2 avoided by roughly one-third in comparison with the two-stage
   membrane system, which exhibits that membrane capture systems could be a
   viable alternative to current amine-based processes. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Rating and recommendation systems have become a popular application area
   for applying a suite of machine learning techniques. Current approaches
   rely primarily on probabilistic interpretations and extensions of matrix
   factorization, which factorizes a user-item ratings matrix into latent
   user and item vectors. Most of these methods fail to model significant
   variations in item ratings from otherwise similar users, a phenomenon
   known as the ``Napoleon Dynamite{''} effect. Recent efforts have
   addressed this problem by adding a contextual bias term to the rating,
   which captures the mood under which a user rates an item or the context
   in which an item is rated by a user. In this work, we extend this model
   in a nonparametric sense by learning the optimal number of moods or
   contexts from the data, and derive Gibbs sampling inference procedures
   for our model. We evaluate our approach on the Movie Lens 1M dataset,
   and show significant improvements over the optimal parametric baseline,
   more than twice the improvements previously encountered for this task.
   We also extract and evaluate a DBLP dataset, wherein we predict the
   number of papers co-authored by two authors, and present improvements
   over the parametric baseline on this alternative domain as well.}},

   enabled high throughput and high content screening. Beyond image

   potentials (LFPs) have both been suggested as potential control signals
   for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aimed at movement restoration. Some
   studies report that LFP-based decoding is comparable to spiking-based
   decoding, while others offer contradicting evidence. Differences in
   experimental paradigms, tuning models and decoding techniques make it
   hard to directly compare these results. Here, we use regression and
   mutual information analyses to study how MUA and LFP encode various
   kinematic parameters during reaching movements. We find that in addition
   to previously reported directional tuning, MUA also contains prominent
   speed tuning. LFP activity in low-frequency bands (15-40Hz, LFPL) is
   primarily speed tuned, and contains more speed information than both
   high-frequency LFP (100-300Hz, LFPH) and MUA. LFPH contains more
   directional information compared to LFPL, but less information when
   compared with MUA. Our results suggest that a velocity and speed
   encoding model is most appropriate for both MUA and LFPH, whereas a
   speed only encoding model is adequate for LFPL.}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a method by which to design the topology of a
   distributed sensor network that is minimal with respect to a
   communication cost function. In the scenario considered, sensor nodes
   communicate with each other within a graph structure to update their
   data according to linear dynamics using neighbor node data. A subset of
   sensors can also report their state to a central location. One physical
   interpretation of this situation would be a set of spatially distributed
   wireless sensors which can communicate with other sensors within range
   to update data and can possibly connect to a network backbone. The costs
   would then be related to transmission energy. The objective is to
   recover the vector of initial sensor measurements from the backbone
   outputs over time, which requires that the dynamics of the overall
   networked system be observable. The topology of the network is then
   determined by the nonzero elements of the optimal observable dynamics.
   The following text contributes an efficient algorithm for designing the
   optimal observable dynamics and the network topology for a given set of
   sensors and cost function, providing proof of correctness and example
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a network of sensors wherein the state estimates are sent
   from the sensors to the fusion center to generate a global state
   estimate. Conventionally, state estimates are linearly combined to
   produce the global (fused) state estimate, but the use of nonlinear
   fusers in multisensor fusion for target tracking has been fairly
   unexplored. In this work, we compare several learning-based nonlinear
   fusers (namely, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression,
   the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, and the Nearest Neighbor Projective
   Fuser) in system-level simulations under two different scenarios: one
   where the target is a ballistic target in the coast phase, and in the
   other the target is performing a maneuver. Results demonstrate that
   several of these learning-based fusers are able to outperform linear
   fusion. In addition, we propose a modification to one of the nonlinear
   fusers to incorporate additional information that we have about the
   input data, which appears to result in better generalization
   capabilities for the Artificial Neural Network Fuser and superior
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of patterns and correlations hidden in the test data could
   help reduce test time and cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology
   and supporting statistical regression tools that can exploit and utilize
   both spatial and inter-test-item correlations in the test data for test
   time and cost reduction. We first describe a statistical regression
   method, called group lasso, which can identify inter-test-item
   correlations from test data. After learning such correlations, some test
   items can be identified for removal from the test program without
   compromising test quality. An extended version of this method, weighted
   group lasso, allows taking into account the distinct test time/cost of
   each individual test item in the formulation as a weighted optimization
   problem. As a result, its solution would favor more costly test items
   for removal from the test program.
   We further integrate weighted group lasso with another statistical
   regression technique, virtual probe, which can learn spatial
   correlations of test data across a wafer. The integrated method could
   then utilize both spatial and inter-test-item correlations to maximize
   the number of test items whose values can be predicted without
   measurement. Experimental results of a high-volume industrial device
   show that utilizing both spatial and inter-test-item correlations can
   help reduce test time by up to 55\%.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosis is the first step of IC failure analysis. The conventional
   objective of identifying the failure locations has been augmented with
   various physically-aware techniques that are intended to improve both
   diagnostic resolution and accuracy. Despite these advances, it is often
   the case however that resolution, i.e., the number of locations or
   candidates reported by diagnosis, exceeds the number of actual failing
   locations. Imperfect resolution greatly hinders any follow-on,
   information-extraction analyses (e. g., physical failure analysis,
   volume diagnosis, etc.) due to the resulting ambiguity. To address this
   major challenge, a novel, unsupervised learning methodology that uses
   ordinarily-available tester and simulation data is described that
   significantly improves resolution with virtually no negative impact on
   accuracy. Simulation experiments using a variety of fault types (SSL,
   MSL, bridges, opens and cell-level input-pattern faults) reveal that the
   number of failed ICs that have perfect resolution can be more than
   doubled, and overall resolution is improved by 22\%. Application to
   silicon data also demonstrates significant improvement in resolution
   (38\% overall and the number of chips with ideal resolution is nearly
   tripled) and verification using PFA demonstrates that accuracy is
   maintained.}},

   the meniscus is required to prevent downward growth of the ribbon and
   its subsequent attachment to the crucible. Assuming that the existence
   of the meniscus is defined by hydrostatics, ribbon geometry and surface
   tension, we use the governing Young-Laplace equation to solve
   analytically for the shape of the meniscus. We then obtain the possible
   hydrostatically stable shapes that can be achieved in a silicon system,
   and found a strong effect of the melt height on the pinning conditions
   of the meniscus to the crucible. We then perform an experimental
   observation of the meniscus in a prototype prove-of-concept set-up and
   show the main challenges involved in guaranteeing the stability of the

   to explore the possibility of combining texturization and
   anti-reflection coating steps in one-step. It was found that catalytic
   gold nano-particles in presence of HF-H2O2 at very low dilution can
   become an active recipe for surface nano-texturization for all types of
   silicon wafers, mainly Si(111) for industrial application. At very low
   dilution, a minimum reflectance level of 3.7\% has been observed in
   Si(111), and a weighted reflectance level of 7.4\% in the entire
   spectrum range of 300-1200 nm. While for Si(100) at the same dilution, a
   minimum and a weighted average reflectance levels of 5 and 10\% can be
   reached in one-step. This is probably due to the formation of porous,
   surface nano-structures. A minimum of 0.25\% of silicon loss is recorded
   during nano-texturization of silicon surface. A cost comparison between
   the alkaline texturization and the metal-assisted nano-texturization is

Abstract = {{Life cycle costs (LCC) calculated using standard databases and
   first-stage cost estimation methods were used to compare selected
   tertiary treatment processes used to treat secondary treated municipal
   wastewater (MWW) for reuse in thermoelectric power plant cooling
   systems. Use of MWW increases challenges such as scaling, bio-fouling
   and corrosion. Tertiary treatment coupled with chemical inhibitors can
   enable use of MWW in cooling systems. To determine LCC for different
   treatment options, a life cycle conceptual costing (LC3) tool was
   developed to estimate costs within conceptual accuracy range (15-40\%),
   defined by the International Association for the Advancement of Cost
   Engineering. LCC estimation showed that treatment alternatives with
   higher chemical consumption were most expensive. Operational phase of
   tertiary treatment and use of chemical conditioning agents dominates
   annual costs. Of various tertiary treatment alternatives evaluated,
   range of total costs to treat 7.75 million gallon/day (1 gallon 3.79 L)
   - amount of water required by a 550 MW thermoelectric power plant
   recirculating cooling system - was estimated to be \$0.91-1.32/kgal
   (2009 USD) excluding taxes and overhead costs. This range was found to
   lie between rate charged for river water withdrawal with filtration and
   chemical conditioning, i.e. an average of \$0.74/kgal (2009 USD) for
   some areas of the USA, and the national average rate for potable city
   water, i.e. \$2.95/kgal (2009 USD).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a remote state estimation problem where a sensor measures
   the state of a linear discrete-time process in an infinite time horizon
   is considered. We aim to minimize the average estimation error subject
   to a limited sensor-estimator communication rate. We propose a
   stochastic online sensor schedule: whether or not the sensor sends data
   is based on its measurements and a stochastic holding time between the
   present and the most recent sensor-estimator communication instance.
   This decision process is formulated as a generalized geometric
   programming (GGP) optimization problem. It can be solved with a
   tractable computational complexity and provides a better performance
   compared with the optimal offline}},

Abstract = {{``Socially cooperative driving{''} is an integral part of our everyday
   driving, hence requiring special attention to imbue the autonomous
   driving with a more natural driving behavior. In this paper, an
   intention-integrated Prediction-and Cost function-Based algorithm (iPCB)
   framework is proposed to enable an autonomous vehicle to perform
   cooperative social behavior. An intention estimator is developed to
   extract the probability of surrounding agents' intentions in real time.
   Then for each candidate strategy, a prediction engine considering the
   interaction between host and surrounding agents is used to predict
   future scenarios. A cost function-based evaluation is applied to compute
   the cost for each scenario and select the decision corresponding to the
   lowest cost. The algorithm was tested in simulation on an autonomous
   vehicle cooperating with vehicles merging from freeway entrance ramps
   with 10,000 randomly generated scenarios. Compared with approaches that
   do not take social behavior into account, the iPCB algorithm shows a
   41.7\% performance improvement based on the chosen cost functions.}},

Abstract = {{On-road motion planning for autonomous vehicles is in general a
   challenging problem. Past efforts have proposed solutions for urban and
   highway environments individually. We identify the key
   advantages/shortcomings of prior solutions, and propose a novel two-step
   motion planning system that addresses both urban and highway driving in
   a single framework. Reference Trajectory Planning (I) makes use of dense
   lattice sampling and optimization techniques to generate an easy-to-tune
   and human-like reference trajectory accounting for road geometry,
   obstacles and high-level directives. By focused sampling around the
   reference trajectory, Tracking Trajectory Planning (II) generates,
   evaluates and selects parametric trajectories that further satisfy
   kinodynamic constraints for execution. The described method retains most
   of the performance advantages of an exhaustive spatiotemporal planner
   while significantly reducing computation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach to controller design for nonlinear multi
   input/multi output (MIMo) systems is presented based on the Contoured
   Robust Controller Bode (CRCBode) plot. CRCBode plots show level sets of
   a robust metric and identify certain `forbidden regions{''} on the
   controller Bode magnitude and phase plots such that intersections of the
   controller frequency response with these forbidden regions indicate that
   a robust stability and performance criterion is violated. Nonlinear
   system dynamics are included as a structured uncertainty set consisting
   of linearizations about several operating points. To demonstrate this
   approach, we design a controller for a HIM high speed, low tension
   magnetic tape drive memory system. A preliminary approximate inverse
   step is described, followed by several loop shaping design iterations to
   eliminate all intersections with the forbidden regions on the CRCBode
   diagrams. Finally, the CRCBode compensator is compared to one generated
   using an automated II infinity synthesis algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced power generation processes are challenged by needs for
   minimization of CO2 emissions, higher energy efficiency and integration
   of superior processing technologies. These challenges also require the
   development of more effective models and strategies for large-scale
   process optimization. This study considers optimization tools and
   formulations for process synthesis, which highlight equation oriented
   modelling environments, nonsmooth modelling via complementarity
   conditions and fast optimization algorithms. We especially focus on
   novel formulations for process synthesis that take advantage of these
   state of the art optimization algorithms. All of these are formally
   represented as bi-level nonlinear programming (NLP) problems and include
   Gibbs reactor models, vapour-liquid equilibrium with vanishing and
   reappearing phases, and simultaneous heat integration and flowsheet
   optimization. These applications are demonstrated on the process
   synthesis of a coal oxycombustion process for clean electric power
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a soft self-assembling modular matter, which is
   called SoftCubes where serially connected soft cubes can be extremely
   stretched by external tension and has a self-recovery capability to an
   originally designed 3-D shape. The developed soft modular matter has
   three main design features. First, entire modules of the 3-D assembled
   shape are serially connected. Such a structure allows all the modules to
   be disassembled and stretched by external tension. Second, the modules
   are made of soft stretchable elastomer. The soft-body of the modules
   provides a high flexibility and an extreme shape adaptation capability
   with the disassembled modules. Also, if the external tension is removed,
   the original 3-D shape is self-recovered by the elastic restoring force
   of soft-bodied modules. Finally, small permanent magnets are embedded in
   each module. The magnetic attraction between modules makes them
   self-assembled and precisely aligned with the neighbor modules in a
   lattice structure. The paper presents various analyses, simulations, and
   demonstrations about soft modular matter's shape reconfiguration to 1-D
   and self-recovery to 3-D. The designed soft modular matter could enable
   new applications as injectable medical implants and implantable modular
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{In previous work, a proof-of-concept artificial flapper was devised by
   Campolo et al. to demonstrate that DC motors, in concert with compliant
   mechanisms, would be able to directly flap wings at relatively high
   frequencies and large angles without exceeding their operational limits.
   The prototype makes use of a pair of relatively long elastic strings as
   the compliant structures. In this article, we experimentally analyze the
   wing kinematics and efficiency of a more compact prototype, where small
   helical springs are implemented instead of elastic strings. Since the
   proof-of-concept prototype validated the quasi-sinusoidal assumption in
   spite of nonlinear aerodynamic damping, incorporating instantaneous wing
   kinematics into the analysis is not necessary, simplifying experiments
   and data processing. Along with wing kinematics and system efficiency,
   the possibility of controlling the wing pair to flap independently is
   evaluated as well.}},

   lost functionalities. Most control methods for rehabilitative robotics
   do not consider the closed-loop system stability in presence of
   uncertainty of nonlinear dynamics, and conflicting movements between
   patient and robots. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework
   which allows rigorous stability analysis of human-robot interaction in
   rehabilitative robotic system. Position-dependant stiffness and desired
   trajectory are proposed to resolve the possible conflicts in motions
   between patient and robot. The proposed method also realizes the
   assist-as-needed policy and possesses the ability to be customized for
   operations during different stages of patient recovery. In addition, the
   proposed controller handles human-robot interactions in such a way that
   correct movements are encouraged and incorrect ones are suppressed to
   make the training process more effective. Experimental results are
   presented to illustrate the performance of the controller.}},

   assigned the task of discovering a buried object while minimizing

Abstract = {{A major challenge for untethered micro- scale mobile robotics is the
   control of many agents in the same workspace for distributed operation.
   In this work, we present a new method to independently control multiple
   sub-mm microrobots in three dimensions (3D) using magnetic gradient
   based direct pulling as the 3D motion generation method. This is
   accomplished through the use of geometrically or magnetically distinct
   microrobots which assume different magnetization directions in a
   rotating magnetic field. Such diversity in design allows for different
   magnetic forces to be exerted on each, enabling path following with less
   than 370 mu m mean path deviation for a set of two microrobots of size
   350 mu m and 1500 mu m. This addressability method could be used for the
   3D control of a team of microrobots inside microfluidic channels or in
   the human body for localized therapy or diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{To address some of the challenges in modular micro-robotics, we present
   a new heat-activated bonding method for assembly. This bonding method
   quickly forms strong bonds through the use of thermoplastic or solder
   binding sites integrated into each module face, addressing problems of
   assembly strength and electrical conductivity. The strength of the bonds
   for each method are compared for different module styles, bonding
   conditions and breaking conditions in a destructive test. For 800 mu m
   modules, bond strengths of up to 500 m N are observed with thermoplastic
   bonds, which indicates that the assemblies could be potentially used in
   high-force structural applications of programmable matter, microfluidic
   channels or healthcare. By magnetically functionalizing the modules
   using embedded magnetic particles, the modules are moved remotely for
   assembly using a magnetic coil system. In this way, a set of six modules
   are remotely assembled one-by-one into an arbitrary shape capable of
   locomotion to demonstrate the scalability and strength of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Biomechatronic devices show promise for restoring human performance, but
   development has been made inefficient by the need for specialized
   autonomous devices prior to testing benefits of proposed
   functionalities. This has severely limited exploration within and across
   intervention strategies. We have developed a laboratory testbed suitable
   for emulating and rapidly assessing wearable robot designs. The testbed
   is comprised of powerful off-board motor and control hardware, a
   flexible tether, and lightweight instrumented end-effectors worn by a
   person. We performed a series of benchtop tests to gauge mechatronic
   performance, and found significant improvements over prior candidate
   testbed platforms. In particular, this system has an unusual combination
   of low worn mass (less than 1 kg), high closed-loop torque bandwidth (17
   Hz), and high peak torque (175 N.m), key to emulating specialized
   devices. We also performed walking trials to gauge dynamic torque
   control and versatility. Walking trials with a prosthesis end-effector
   demonstrated precise torque tracking (4 N.m RMS error), both in time and
   joint-angle space, and versatile mechanical behavior through systematic
   changes in high-level control law parameters. For example, we widely
   varied net ankle work (from -3 J to 9 J per step) using an impedance law
   relating joint angle and velocity to desired torque. These results
   suggest such testbeds could be used to emulate and evaluate novel
   assistive robot concepts prior to laborious product design.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a soft-matter sensor that measures elastic pressure and
   shear deformation. The sensor is composed of a sheet of elastomer that
   is embedded with fluidic parallel-plate capacitors. When the elastomer
   is pressed or sheared, the electrodes of the embedded capacitors come
   closer together or slide past each other, respectively, leading to a
   change in capacitance. The magnitude and direction of the shear
   deformation is established by comparing the change in capacitance of
   multiple embedded capacitors. We characterize the soft sensor
   theoretically and experimentally. Experiments indicate that 2D shear and
   pressure deformation can be discriminated with approximately 500 mu m
   and 5 kPa sensitivity, respectively. The theoretical predictions and
   experimental results are in reasonable agreement. We also propose
   improvements to the fabrication method in order to facilitate

   transducer are much stronger. Finite element simulations have been used
   to understand the nature of the waves formed when the substrate
   thickness is of the order of the wavelength. With both transducers
   driven, concentration of 6 mu m particles has been observed and the time
   required to align has been measured as a function of drive voltage. We

Abstract = {{PtdIns(4,5)P-2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) is a relatively
   common anionic lipid that regulates cellular functions by multiple
   mechanisms. Hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P-2 by phospholipase C yields
   inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Phosphorylation by
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase yields PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3, which is a potent
   signal for survival and proliferation. Also, PtdIns(4,5)P-2 can bind
   directly to integral and peripheral membrane proteins. As an example of
   regulation by PtdIns(4,5)P-2, we discuss phosphatase and tensin
   homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in detail. PTEN is an
   important tumor suppressor and hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3.
   PtdIns(4,5)P-2 enhances PTEN association with the plasma membrane and
   activates its phosphatase activity. This is a critical regulatory
   mechanism, but a detailed description of this process from a structural
   point of view is lacking. The disordered lipid bilayer environment
   hinders structural determinations of membrane-bound PTEN. A new method

Abstract = {{This experience report builds on an earlier study in which we
   interviewed eight project teams that were using iterative incremental
   lifecycles. In the study, we captured the practices the teams felt
   contributed to rapid delivery. We identified a mix of Agile and
   architecture practices that teams apply to rapidly field software and
   minimize disruption and delay. In this paper, we elaborate one practice
   from the study, prototyping with quality attribute focus. We compared
   two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute
   considerations applied on Scrum projects. We observe through interviews
   that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels:
   feature development/sprint, release planning, and portfolio planning. We
   also observe other factors including rapid trade-off analysis, flexible
   architecture, and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines.
   The analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the
   practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when
   prototype feedback suggests architectural change.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a semantic object segmentation method based on
   cascaded superpixel-wise classification and segment-wise object class
   ranking. Inspired by the overwhelming parsing ability of human's visual
   system in which non-local information are widely taken into
   consideration, our approach refers to higher-order information in case
   of ambiguous classifications. Different from many works on structured
   prediction for scene understanding, our work does not use complicated
   global probabilistic model, but adopts hierarchical cascaded
   classification for different levels of features. Another contribution is
   the confidence propagation through segment-wise object class ranking.
   Unlike many existing works which treat each classification unit equally,
   our method automatically discovers confident classifications and passes
   confidence to uncertain areas within segments obtained by hierarchical
   image segmentation. Such label correction process can significantly
   boost the segmentation accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent trends in System-on-a-Chip show that an increasing number of
   special-purpose processors are being added to improve the efficiency of
   common operations. Unfortunately, the use of these processors may
   introduce suspension delays incurred by communication, synchronization
   and external I/O operations. When these processors are used in real-time
   systems, conventional schedulability analyses incorporate these delays
   in the worst-case execution/response time, hence significantly reducing
   the schedulable utilization.
   In this paper, we provide schedulability analyses and propose
   segment-fixed priority scheduling for self-suspending tasks. We model
   the tasks as segments of execution separated by suspensions. We start
   from providing response-time analyses for self-suspending tasks under
   Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS). While RMS is shown to not be optimal,
   it can be used effectively in some special cases that we have
   identified. We then derive a utilization bound for the cases as a
   function of the ratio of the suspension duration to the period of the
   tasks. For general cases, we develop a segment-fixed priority scheduling
   scheme. Our scheme assigns individual segments different priorities and
   phase offsets that are used for phase enforcement to control the
   unexpected self-suspending nature. With the exact schedulability
   analysis designed for our scheme, our experiments show that the proposed
   scheme provides up to 40 times more schedulable utilization than RMS.}},

Abstract = {{Time synchronization in wireless sensor networks is important for event
   ordering and efficient communication scheduling. In this paper, we
   introduce an external hardware-based clock tuning circuit that can be
   used to improve synchronization and significantly reduce clock drift
   over long periods of time without waking up the host MCU. This is
   accomplished through two main hardware sub-systems. First, we improve
   upon the circuit presented in {[}1] that synchronizes clocks using the
   ambient magnetic fields emitted from power lines. The new circuit uses
   an electric field front-end as opposed to the original magnetic-field
   sensor, which makes the design more compact, lower-power, lower-cost,
   exhibit less jitter and improves robustness to noise generated by nearby
   appliances. Second, we present a low-cost hardware tuning circuit that
   can be used to continuously trim a micro-controller's low-power clock at
   runtime. Most time synchronization approaches require a CPU to
   periodically adjust internal counters to accommodate for clock drift.
   Periodic discrete updates can introduce interpolation errors as compared
   to continuous update approaches and they require the CPU to expend
   energy during these wake up periods. Our hardware-based external clock
   tuning circuit allows the main CPU to remain in a deep-sleep mode for
   extended periods while an external circuit compensates for clock drift.
   We show that our new synchronization circuit consumes 60\% less power
   than the original design and is able to correct clock drift rates to
   within 0.01 ppm without power hungry and expensive precision clocks.}},

Abstract = {{As sensor networks gain traction and begin to scale, we will be
   increasingly faced with challenges associated with managing large-scale
   time-series data. In this paper, we present a cloud-to-edge partitioned
   architecture called Respawn that is capable of serving large amounts of
   time-series data from a continuously updating datastore with access
   latencies low enough to support interactive real-time visualization.
   Respawn targets sensing systems where resource-constrained edge node
   devices may only have limited or intermittent network connections
   linking them to a cloud-backend. The cloud-backend provides aggregate
   storage and transparent dispatching of data queries to edge node
   devices. Data is downsampled as it enters the system creating a
   multi-resolution representation capable of low-latency range-base
   queries. Lower-resolution aggregate data is automatically migrated from
   edge nodes to the cloud-backend both for improved consistency and
   caching. In order to further mask latency from users, edge nodes
   automatically identify and migrate blocks of data that contain
   statistically interesting features. We show through simulation and
   micro-benchmarking that Respawn is able to run on ARM-based edge node
   devices connected to a cloud-backend with the ability to serve thousands
   of clients and terabytes of data with sub-second latencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an analysis of resonant wireless power transfer
   in systems with multiple receivers. We show that maximum power transfer
   can be achieved when the source is impedance matched to the set of
   receivers, i.e. matched to their equivalent impedance as seen by the
   source. The interaction of the receivers, or coupled modes, simply
   represent an interdependence of impedances that can be modeled and
   impedance matched. We explore three methods to achieve impedance
   matching: frequency tuning, impedance transformation and resonant tuning
   and show that the later two can achieve the maximum theoretical power
   transfer for a wide range of coupling between receivers.}},

Abstract = {{Agile projects are showing greater promise in rapid fielding as compared
   to waterfall projects. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding
   what really constitutes and contributes to success. We interviewed
   project teams with incremental development lifecycles, from five
   government and commercial organizations, to gain a better understanding
   of success and failure factors for rapid fielding on their projects. A
   key area we explored involves how Agile projects deal with the pressure
   to rapidly deliver high-value capability, while maintaining project
   speed (delivering functionality to the users quickly) and product
   stability (providing reliable and flexible product architecture). For
   example, due to schedule pressure we often see a pattern of high initial
   velocity for weeks or months, followed by a slowing of velocity due to
   stability issues. Business stakeholders find this to be disruptive as
   the rate of capability delivery slows while the team addresses stability
   problems. We found that experienced practitioners, when faced with these
   challenges, do not apply Agile practices alone. Instead they combine
   practices-Agile, architecture, or other-in creative ways to respond
   quickly to unanticipated stability problems. In this paper, we summarize
   the practices practitioners we interviewed from Agile projects found
   most valuable and provide an overarching scenario that provides insight
   into how and why these practices emerge.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the detection of potential collision for a
   reversing vehicle. The collision detection relies on monitoring the
   surroundings of reversing vehicle by means of on-board cameras mounted
   on the side window and rear side of the vehicle. We first detect the
   stationary vehicle(s) in the region of interest (ROI) using histogram of
   oriented gradients (HOG) features and support vector machine (SVM) based
   classification. This is followed by the use of a Gaussian Mixture Model
   (GMM) to detect dynamic vehicle(s) in the ROI. Trajectories and speeds
   of the dynamic vehicles are predicted through the particular position of
   the detected vehicles in each frame and through their observed
   trajectory and speed patterns. Finally a potential collision is
   predicted based on the trajectories and speeds of both vehicles. The
   experimental results indicate that the proposed framework performs well
   in different traffic scenarios and can contribute to the advancement for
   improving the safety of car driving.}},

   large scale linear time invariant (LTI) systems that ensures structural
   controllability/observability. In particular, for the dedicated actuator
   placement problem (i.e., each actuator can control only one state
   variable or dynamic component), we propose a design methodology that
   provides the optimal placement with minimal cost (with respect to a
   given placement cost functional), under the requirement that the system
   be structurally controllable. In addition of obtaining the global
   solution of the optimization problem, the methodology is shown to be
   implemented by an algorithm with polynomial complexity (in the number of
   state variables), making it suitable for large scale systems. By
   duality, the solution readily extends to the structural design of the
   corresponding sensor placement under cost constraints.}},

   performance evaluation of microsurgical robotics. Previous studies have
   examined the characteristics of physiological tremor under laboratory
   settings as well as different operating conditions. However, different
   test methods make the comparison of results across trials and conditions
   difficult. Two vitroretinal microsurgeons were evaluated while
   performing a pointing task with no entry-point constraint, constrained
   by an artificial eye model, and constrained by a rabbit eye in vivo. For
   the three respective conditions the 3D RMS positioning error was 144 mu
   m, 258 mu m, and 285 mu m, and maximum 3D error was 349 mu m, 647 mu m,
   and 696 mu m. A spectral analysis was also performed, confirming a
   distinct peak near in the 6-12 Hz frequency range, characteristic of
   hand tremor during tasks in all three environments.}},

Abstract = {{Bevel-tipped flexible needles can be robotically steered to reach
   clinical targets along curvilinear paths in 3D. Manual needle insertion
   allows the clinician to control the insertion speed, ensuring patient
   safety. This paper presents a control law for automatic 3D steering of
   manually inserted flexible needles, enabling path-following control. A
   look-ahead proportional controller for position and orientation is
   presented. The look-ahead distance is a linear function of insertion
   speed. Simulations in a 3D brain-like environment demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed controller. Experimental results also show
   the feasibility of this technique in 2D and 3D environments.}},

Abstract = {{Tools available for measuring the modifiability or impact of change of a
   system through its architecture typically use structural metrics. These
   metrics take into account dependencies among the different elements of a
   system. However, they fail to capture the semantics of an architectural
   transformation necessary to control the complexity and cost of making
   changes. To highlight such limitations, this paper presents a study
   where we applied a representative structural metric, called `propagation
   cost', to archetypical architectural transformations known to affect
   system modifiability such as rearchitecting a tightly coupled system to
   a layered pattern. We observe that in its original form the propagation
   cost metric does not provide consistent indications of architecture
   health. Enhancing this metric based on the semantics of the
   architectural pattern and tactics used in the transformation show
   improvements. Our results demonstrate that these enhancements detect
   modifiability properties that are not detectable by the propagation cost
   metric.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding where electricity is being used in buildings is an
   important tool for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) used in building energy
   conservation and efficiency. Current approaches for appliance-level
   energy metering typically require the installation of plug-through power
   meters, which is often difficult and costly for devices with
   inaccessible wires or outlets, or appliances that draw large amounts of
   current. In this paper, we present an energy measurement system that
   estimates the energy consumption of individual appliances using a
   wireless sensor network consisting of contactless electromagnetic field
   (EMF) sensors deployed near each appliance, and a whole-house power
   meter. We present the design of a battery-operated EMF sensor, which can
   detect appliance state transitions within close proximity based on
   magnetic and electric field fluctuations. Each detector wirelessly
   transmits state change events to a circuit-panel energy meter, in a
   time-synchronized fashion, so that the overall power measurements can be
   used to estimate appliance-level energy usage. Our EMF sensors are able
   to detect significant power state changes from a few inches away, thus
   making it possible to externally monitor in-wall wiring to devices. We
   experimentally evaluate our proposed EMF sensor, three-phase power meter
   and communication protocol in a residential building collecting data for
   over a week. The system is able to detect appliance state transitions
   with an accuracy of 95.8\% and estimate the overall energy with an
   accuracy of 98.1\%.}},

   operational constraints in normal operation and contingency cases. The
   formulation of a security index provides a quantitative measure for the
   security in the system and also allows for the determination of the
   impact of generators on security. Hence, in this paper, first two
   different security indices are formulated: a violation-based security
   index and a risk-based security index. These security index formulations
   are used to introduce locational security impact factors which similarly
   to the information that locational marginal prices provide for
   generation economics, give insights into the location dependent impact
   on system security. These impact factors are then integrated into an
   iterative approach for the determination of the optimal generation
   settings given a specific bound on the desired level of system security.}},

Abstract = {{Power flow control is a means to optimize the usage of the existing
   transmission system and to allow for more flexibility in the power grid.
   This is especially of importance when introducing increased amounts of
   variable renewable generation as the grid needs to be able to handle
   varying power flow patterns. The optimal settings for such power flow
   control devices can be determined using a security constrained Optimal
   Power Flow (SCOPF) which incorporates N-1 contingency cases. In this
   paper, we use a risk-based formulation of system security in combination
   with corrective power flow control resulting in a decoupling of the
   contingency cases. Furthermore, we decompose the individual contingency
   cases into subproblems to allow for optimal coordination across control
   areas and improved computational efficiency. Simulation results are

Abstract = {{This paper studies a DC Corrective Security-Constrained OPF (SCOPF) in

   Hence, in the considered SCOPF, the transmission lines' reactance along
   with the generators' output are considered as control variables. The
   objective of this SCOPF model is to obtain minimum generation cost while
   maintaining the system N-1 secure. Benders decomposition is applied to
   solve the discussed DC SCOPF problem. Case studies for the IEEE 30-bus
   test system, the IEEE 39-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test
   system are presented. The performance of Benders decomposition is
   compared to a brute force approach, in which the DC SCOPF is solved as a
   single optimization problem, with respect to run-time and accuracy of
   the results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes that a reliable and efficient integration of
   distributed generators (DGs) needs strategic planning and operation for
   distribution systems. The paper illustrates that today's policies such
   as plug-and-play and those outlined under IEEE standard 1547 cannot
   support a large penetration of DGs sending power to the grid. The paper
   explores possible challenges and potential opportunities in integrating
   a large penetration of DGs. The key point of the paper is designing a
   model-based adaptive policy to link the methods engineers use to policy
   design for achieving efficient and reliable performance. Two strategies
   that could be used to achieve this are outlined and discussed: enhanced
   plug-and-play and third party siting and operating review.}},

Abstract = {{Smart metering systems in distribution networks provide near real-time,
   two-way information exchange between end users and utilities, enabling
   many advanced smart grid technologies. However, the fine grained
   real-time data as well as the various market functionalities also pose
   great risks to customer privacy. In this work we propose a secure
   multi-party computation (SMC) based privacy preserving smart metering
   system. Using the proposed SMC protocol, a utility is able to perform
   advanced market based demand management algorithms without knowing the
   actual values of private end user consumption and configuration data.
   Using homomorphic encryption, billing is secure and verifiable. We
   implemented a demonstration system that includes a graphical user
   interface and simulates real-world network communication of the proposed
   SMC-enabled smart meters. The demonstration shows the feasibility of our
   proposed privacy preserving protocol for advanced smart grid
   technologies which includes load management and retail level electricity
   market support.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology (IT) controls are reusable system requirements
   that IT managers, administrators and developers use to demonstrate
   compliance with international standards, such as ISO 27000 standard. As
   controls are reusable, they tend to cover best practice independently
   from what specific government laws may require. However, because
   considerable effort has already been invested by IT companies in linking
   controls to their existing systems, aligning controls with regulations
   can yield important savings by avoiding noncompliance or unnecessary
   redesign. We report the results of a case study to align legal
   requirements from the U.S. and India that govern healthcare systems with
   three popular control catalogues: the NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 27002:2009
   and the Cloud Security Alliance CCM v1.3. The contributions include a
   repeatable protocol for mapping controls, heuristics to explain the

Abstract = {{Information system developers must ensure that their systems comply with

   can trace from statements in law to their system specifications while

   present an application of the legal requirements specification language
   (LRSL) as a means to encode laws into a machine-readable specification.
   The encoding reduces ambiguity by making relations between requirements
   statements explicit. These relations include refinement, pre- and
   post-conditions, and exceptions that shape the environment in which the
   developer's system must operate and limiting the behavior of the system
   to a set of mandatory and discretionary actions. We illustrate the LRSL
   using a legal excerpt from Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, 164.512(f) governing
   disclosures of protected health information to law enforcement in the

Abstract = {{Applications with Service-oriented Enterprise Architectures in the Cloud

   Enterprise Architecture and Management with Architectures for Services

   Big Data Management, among other Architecture Frameworks and Software
   Engineering Methods. In the present work in progress research, we
   explore Service-oriented Enterprise Architectures and application
   systems in the context of Big Data applications in cloud settings. Using
   a Big Data scenario, we investigate the integration of Services and
   Cloud Computing architectures with new capabilities of Enterprise
   Architectures and Management. The underlying architecture reference
   model can be used to support semantic analysis and program comprehension
   of service-oriented Big Data Applications. Enterprise Services Computing
   is the current trend for powerful large-scale information systems, which
   increasingly converge with Cloud Computing environments. In this paper

Abstract = {{As technology scaling down allows multiple processing components to be
   integrated on a single chip, the modern computing systems led to the
   advent of Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) and Chip Multiprocessor
   (CMP) design. Network-on-Chips (NoCs) have been proposed as a promising
   solution to tackle the complex on-chip communication problems on these
   multicore platforms. In order to optimize the NoC-based multicore system
   design, it is essential to evaluate the NoC performance with respect to
   numerous configurations in a large design space. Taking the traffic
   characteristics into account and using an appropriate latency model
   become crucially important to provide an accurate and fast evaluation.
   In this tutorial, we survey the current progresses in these aspects. We
   first review the NoC workload modeling and traffic analysis techniques.
   Then, we discuss the mathematical formalisms of evaluating the
   performance under a given traffic model, for both the average and
   worst-case latency predictions. Finally, the advantages of combining the
   analytical and simulation-based techniques are discussed and new
   attempts for bridging these two approaches are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately estimating the rare failure rates for nanoscale circuit
   blocks (e. g., SRAM, DFF, etc.) is a challenging task, especially when
   the variation space is high-dimensional. In this paper, we propose a
   novel scaled-sigma sampling (SSS) method to address this technical
   challenge. The key idea of SSS is to generate random samples from a
   distorted distribution for which the standard deviation (i.e., sigma) is
   scaled up. Next, the failure rate is accurately estimated from these
   scaled random samples by using an analytical model derived from the
   theorem of ``soft maximum{''}. Several circuit examples designed in
   nanoscale technologies demonstrate that the proposed SSS method achieves
   superior accuracy over the traditional importance sampling technique
   when the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a few
   hundred.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have proposed an Augmented Linear Discriminant Analysis
   (ALDA) approach to identify identical twins. It learns a common subspace
   that not only can identify from which family the individual comes, but
   also can distinguish between individuals within the same family. We
   evaluate the ALDA against the traditional LDA approach for subspace
   learning on the Notre Dame twin database. We have shown that the
   proposed ALDA method with the aid of facial asymmetry features
   significantly outperforms other well-established facial descriptors
   (LBP, LTP, LTrP), and the ALDA subspace method does a much better job in
   distinguishing identical twins than LDA. We are able to achieve 48.50\%
   VR at 0.1\% FAR for identifying family membership of identical twin
   individuals in the crowd and an averaged 82.58\% VR at 0.1\% FAR for
   verifying identical twin individuals within the same family, a
   significant improvement over traditional descriptors and traditional LDA
   method.}},

Abstract = {{We set out to create an assessment and situational awareness tool for
   incident response. Extracting the risk assessment expertise and creating
   a systemic step-by-step workflow that could be followed by non-experts
   was challenging; however, what proved to be even more difficult was the
   mapping of that workflow to a common, natural language used by
   non-experts while still supporting the incident response. We at the
   Digital Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (DIID) have developed
   a way to maintain the velocity of incident response through the creation
   of a feed-forward decision support system to assist a security responder
   deal with the scale and challenges of assessing risk in critical
   information systems. Unfortunately, many applications fall short of
   expectations because the technology is used inappropriately: the wrong
   tool applied in the wrong way. Taking interaction techniques combined
   with a decision support system and applying them to one particularly
   demanding area security incident response - leads to the conclusion that
   there is a proper and formal way to approach maintaining situational
   awareness in this complex domain.
   The CERT Assessment Tool increases a security incident responder's
   ability to assess risk and identify the incident response plan of
   critical information systems. The interface has four primary affordances
   to the user: (1) digital storage of the collected interview data with
   tagging of the information to create meta data of the objects as well as
   standardize terminology by reusing objects, (2) structured data that
   enables situational awareness of all systems on site and flexibility and
   recursion of system attributes, (3) guidance questions that provide
   runtime support for the system currently being assessed and a general
   direction to better assess each system based on historical data, and (4)
   real-time rules that make recommendations to the user through `push'
   notifications, which enables a user to identify and mitigate risk in
   information systems security affecting the safety of a system or the
   implementation of the security plan. The creation of a security decision
   support system framework to represent a series of steps to view the
   entire space of a security incident allows us to use techniques
   specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three
   identified stages of incident response - pre-incident (perception),
   during the event (comprehension), or after the event (projection). This
   combination of rules based on machine learning and push notifications
   are a first step in how computers will be able to support and advance
   the decision support technologies that are the backbone of this system.}},

Abstract = {{Today's incident response training, architectures, and methodologies are
   all built upon disconnected siloes of domain expertise, but attacks upon
   an organization's critical information systems are not done in a
   disjointed way. Attacks on critical information systems and
   infrastructure are not solely network, or malware, or single disks; they
   are coordinated, large-scale multisite attacks done in an organized
   manner. With the increase in frequency and sophistication of these
   attacks, it is not enough to rely on intrusion detection systems,
   trusted IT staff, or organizational information security divisions. The
   velocity of a cyber attack should be met with an equally coordinated
   response. There is a need to develop a platform that enables responders
   to establish trust and develop an effective collaborative response plan
   and investigation process across multiple organizations and legal bodies
   to track adversaries, mitigate the threat, get critical systems back
   online, and pursue legal action against the offenders. In this work we
   propose such a platform for efficient collaboration. Our work is
   informed by our practices in supporting law enforcement organizations
   dealing with large-scale distributed attacks on critical information
   systems and infrastructure and by an examination of Stuxnet, a computer
   worm discovered in June 2010 that is believed to have been created by
   the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Based
   on these experiences of operational support, the authors propose
   Cerebro, an Extensible Large-Scale Analysis Platform designed to fuse
   structured domain specific information, decision support, and
   collaboration in an automated fashion, to effectively detect and respond
   to such attacks.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing popularity of online stores is reshaping traditional
   commerce models. In particular, brick-and-mortar stores are presently
   facing the challenge of reinventing themselves and their business models
   to offer attractive yet low-cost alternatives to e-commerce. Other
   industries have already introduced new concepts to fight inefficiency
   (i.e., ``Just-in-Time{''} inventory management in Automotive), retail
   stores face a more challenging environment which these models cannot
   accommodate. Stores remain heavily vested in battling the overhead costs
   of personnel management when, instead, a robotic automation scheme with
   retail-oriented behaviors could reduce the detection latency of
   out-of-stock and compliance error phenomena throughout the store. These
   behaviors must be automated, multipurpose, and schedulable; they must
   also ensure that the robot coordinates store nuances to adapt its
   functionality appropriately. In this paper, we present our architecture
   that defines retail robot behaviors as a collection of reusable
   activities, which, when permuted various ways, allows for various
   high-level and application-specific tasks to be accomplished
   effectively. We evaluate this system on our robotic platform by
   scrutinizing the integrity of navigation and machine vision tasks, which
   we perform concurrently in an experimental store setup. Results show the
   feasibility and efficiency of our proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Matched field processing is a powerful tool for accurately localizing
   targets in dispersive media. However, matched field processing requires
   a precise model of the medium under test. In underwater acoustics, where
   matched field processing has been extensively studied, authors often
   resort to extremely detailed numerical models of the propagation medium,
   which are computationally expensive and impractical for many
   applications. As an alternative, this paper uses convex sparse recovery
   techniques to construct, directly from measured data, an accurate model
   of a plate medium based on its dispersion characteristics. From this
   data-driven model, the Green's function between two points can be
   readily predicted. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by
   localizing a source in a dispersive plate medium. The results visually
   illustrate our approach to significantly improve localization accuracy
   and reduce artifacts when compared to a conventional narrowband
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of state estimation of a
   dynamical system in a multi-agent network. The agents are sparsely
   connected and each of them observes a strict subset of the state vector.
   The distributed algorithm that we propose enables each agent to estimate
   any arbitrary linear dynamical system with bounded mean-squared error.
   To achieve this, the ratio of the algebraic connectivity and the largest
   eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian has to be larger than a lower bound
   determined by the spectral radius of the system's dynamics matrix. This
   extends the notion of Network Tracking Capacity introduced by other
   authors in prior work. We accomplish this by introducing a new class of
   estimation algorithm of dynamical systems that, besides a (consensus +
   innovations) term, also includes consensus on the innovations.}},

Abstract = {{Current research is interested in identifying how topology impacts
   epidemics in networks. In this paper, we model SIS
   (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemics as a continuous-time Markov
   process and for which we can obtain a closed form description of the
   equilibrium distribution. Such distribution describes the long-run
   behavior of the epidemics. The adjacency matrix of the network topology
   is reflected explicitly in the formulation of the equilibrium
   distribution. Secondly, we are interested in analyzing the model in the
   regime where the topology dependent infection process opposes the
   topology independent healing process. Specifically, how will network
   topology affect the most probable long-run network state? We show that
   for k-regular graph topologies, the most probable network state
   transitions from the state where everyone is healthy to one where
   everyone is infected at a threshold that depends on k but not on the
   size of the graph.}},

   compute reliable statistics, we have to resort to sampling the network.
   In this paper, we investigate four network sampling methods to estimate
   the network degree distribution and the so-called biased degree
   distribution of a 3.7 million wireless subscriber network. We measure
   the quality of our estimates of the degree distributions by using the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Among all four sampling methods, node
   sampling yields Pareto optimal sample sizes in terms of the
   Kolomogorov-Smirnov statistic for the degree distribution, while
   node-by-edge sampling yields optimal sample sizes for the biased
   distribution. We also find that random walk sampling performs better

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by major needs for accurate online state
   estimation (SE) in the emerging electrical energy systems; accurate
   state and topology are needed to support operator's decisions as system
   conditions vary both during normal conditions for enhanced efficiency
   and during contingency conditions to ensure reliable operations. We
   propose a new SE method which is based on a combined use of informative
   historical data with the extended state space formulation for managing
   the nonlinear nature of AC power flow equations and related numerical
   problems. Specifically, the approach comprises two stages. First, based
   on historical data maximum-likelihood parameter estimation is conducted
   to update model parameters. The second stage utilizes these estimated
   model parameters and on-line measurements to estimate the state. Instead
   of using the extended Kalman Filter we are using a Kalman Filter in a
   model-based physically meaningful kernel feature space. This leads to ax
   two-stage Kalman Filter which can overcome problems created by the
   occasional missing data or data available at different rates (SCADA and
   PMU data); therefore, we claim that its performance is highly robust.
   This claim is confirmed by the simulation results performed for several
   IEEE test systems which show significant improvements over the
   performance of both the static SE with Newton's method and the extended
   Kalman Filter SE approach; once the parameters are learned, the
   computational time is smaller than the currently used SE, making it
   feasible in operations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by major needs for fast and accurate on-line
   state estimation (SE) in the emerging electric energy systems, due to
   recent penetration of distributed green energy, distributed
   intelligence, and plug-in electric vehicles. Different from the
   traditional deterministic approach, this paper uses a probabilistic
   graphical model to account for these new uncertainties by efficient
   distributed state estimation. The proposed graphical model is able to
   discover and analyze unstructured information and it has been
   successfully deployed in statistical physics, computer vision, error
   control coding, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, this paper
   shows how to model the traditional power system state estimation problem
   in a probabilistic manner. Mature graphical model inference tools, such
   as belief propagation and variational belief propagation, are
   subsequently applied. Simulation results demonstrate better performance
   of SE over the traditional deterministic approach in terms of accuracy
   and computational time. Notably, the near-linear computational time of
   the proposed approach enables the scalability of state estimation which
   is crucial in the operation of future large-scale smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{The quality and effectiveness of the load following services provided by
   centralized control of thermostatically controlled loads depend highly
   on the communication requirements and the underlying cyberinfrastructure
   characteristics. Specifically, ensuring end-user comfort while providing
   real-time demand response services depends on the availability of the
   information provided from the thermostatically controlled loads to the
   main controller regarding their operating statuses and internal
   temperatures. State estimation techniques can be used to infer the
   necessary information from the aggregate power consumption of these
   loads, replacing the need for an upstream communication platform
   carrying information from appliances to the main controller in
   real-time. In this paper, we introduce a moving horizon mean squared
   error state estimator with constraints as an alternative to a Kalman
   filter approach, which assumes a linear model without constraints. The
   results show that some improvement is possible for scenarios when loads
   are expected to be toggled frequently.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, there is a direct correlation between the time to resolve an
   incident and the damage sustained by an organization, with faster
   resolution of the incident resulting in less damage to the organization.
   Therefore, improving coordination between organizations experiencing the
   same or related incidents allows faster resolution and hence less damage
   to each organization. Coordination, however, means more than simply
   communicating during an incident effective communication is critical. In
   this paper we explore how effective communication might be improved by
   the development of a mental model internalized by the group's technical
   staff prior to an incident. In this paper, we present the results of an
   exercise we conducted to determine whether an ad-hoc group of incident
   responders share a schema for decision making, and, if not, what some of
   the decision criteria (questions) and types of values (answers) might be
   that would allow the creation of a shared mental model for incident
   response.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at improving the solution efficiency of Mixed Integer
   Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) through parallelism. Unlike most
   conventional parallel implementations of MINLP solvers, which utilize
   multi-threads to share the burden in the serial mode, the proposed
   method combines hybrid algorithms running on different threads. Two
   types of algorithms are designed in a parallel structure. One is the
   Quesada and Grossman's LP/NLP based branch and bound algorithm (QG); the
   other is Tabu Search (TS). The proposed method attempts to minimize the
   search space through continuous communication and exchange of
   intermediate results from each thread. Three kinds of information are
   exchanged between the two threads. First, the best solution in TS, if
   feasible, serves as a valid upper bound for QG. Second, new
   approximations which can further tighten the lower bound of QG can be
   generated at nodes provided by the TS. Third, strong branching in QG may
   fix some integer variables, which can help reduce the search space of
   TS. Both threads can thus benefit from the exchanged information in the
   hybrid method. Numerical results show that solution time can be greatly
   reduced for the tested MINLP. In addition, complexity analysis of the
   parallel approach suggests that the proposed method has the potential
   for superlinear speedup.}},

   LP planning model. A direct method, where the number of weeks since a
   product was produced is tracked, an indirect method, which ensures that
   the total shelf-life of a product is not exceeded, and a hybrid method
   that models the shelf-life on the first storage stage directly and on
   the second stage indirectly. With the direct method solutions with the
   lowest costs were obtained. However, with the hybrid method solutions
   with a cost increase of only 0.010.03\% could be obtained in about 1/5th

Abstract = {{The design of efficient supply chains is a major challenge for companies
   in the process industry. Supply chain performance is subject to
   different sources of uncertainty including reliability of the
   facilities. Facility disruptions are among the most critical events that
   supply chains can experience. In order to reduce the undesirable effects
   of disruptions, these events must be anticipated at the design phase of
   the supply chain. This work addresses the design of supply chains under
   the risk of facility disruptions by simultaneously considering decisions
   on the facility location and the inventory management. The proposed
   formulation is based on a two-stage stochastic programming framework
   where the scenarios are determined by the possible combinations of
   facility disruptions. The first stage decisions include the location of
   distribution centers and their storage capacity. The second stage
   decisions involve assigning customer demands to the distribution centers
   that are available in every scenario. The objective is to minimize the
   sum of investment cost and the expected cost of distribution during a
   finite time horizon. The formulation is implemented and compared with
   the optimal solution of the deterministic design problem though an
   illustrative example. The results show that the proposed formulation
   generates supply chain designs with the capability to adjust to adverse
   scenarios. This flexibility translates into significant savings when
   disruptions occur in the operation of supply chains.}},

   polymerization reactor, for which approximate but practically accurate
   process models were developed. Both a single and multiple product
   formulations are presented. The latter determines the optimal operating
   conditions for a given schedule of products, which includes several
   demands on different product families. By selecting the flowrates of the
   available feedstocks (refinery and chemical grade) with the production
   rates of each product, the proposed method seeks the minimum production
   cost that maximizes the plant throughput. The tradeoff between
   feedstocks costs and production rates is analyzed by solving the model
   with different time horizons, and also an additional ``slack{''} product
   is considered to investigate the implication of having some extra
   production when the schedule finishes earlier. The proposed formulation
   with a user-friendly interface is being deployed to assist with purchase
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave structural health monitoring techniques have grown in
   popularity due to their ability to interrogate large areas at once and
   their sensitivity to damage in structures. However, guided waves are
   inherently complex due to their dispersive and multi-modal
   characteristics. These characteristics also change with variations in
   environmental conditions. As a result, many sophisticated localization
   algorithms, which rely on precise knowledge of the medium, fail to
   successfully locate damage.
   Alternatively, many current localization approaches preprocess data to
   simplify the measurements and reduce the adverse effects of dispersion
   and multiple modes. Often, these approaches only consider the first
   arriving wave mode across a narrow band of frequencies. They also reduce
   the effects of dispersion by analyzing the envelope of the received
   signals rather than the raw data. While these preprocessing steps may
   help to improve localization accuracy, they significantly degrade the
   resulting resolution and image quality. In this paper, we integrate a
   methodology known as sparse wavenumber analysis with current
   localization algorithms to utilize the multiple modes and dispersive
   characteristics of Lamb waves in a plate across a wide band of
   frequencies to localize damage without computing envelopes or performing
   similar preprocessing steps.}},

Abstract = {{Pipe corrosion is a common degradation that can cause leakages, breaks,
   or even explosions. Detecting and monitoring corrosion is necessary to
   ensure to the structural integrity of pipes. Ultrasonic guided wave
   techniques are one promising solution due to their sensitivity to small
   defects and capability to propagate long distance. However, it is
   difficult to interpret pipe guided wave signals directly or to extract
   effective corrosion-sensitive features from them due to their
   multi-path, multimodal, dispersive characteristics. Moreover, pipe
   structures often experience large variations in environmental and
   operational conditions (EOC), which can produce large changes in
   ultrasonic signals and can easily produces false alarms. In previous
   work, we developed a robust damage detection method based on singular
   value decomposition (SVD). In this paper, we further explore, through
   experiments, the capability of our SVD-based method to detect
   degradation. We demonstrate that our method is effective at identifying
   progressive corrosion at the same time that large temperature variations
   are present.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is a renewable energy source that has been growing rapidly
   in recent years. However, wind farms have relatively high cost, of which
   operation and maintenance (O\&M) cost takes up 25-35\%. An optimal
   strategy for O\&M can significantly reduce this cost. Wind turbines are
   subject to fatigue-induced degradation and need periodic inspections and
   repairs. A maintenance strategy for the farm has to be based on the
   prior knowledge on the degradation process, and on data collected
   in-field, by sensors and visual inspections. Traditional methods to
   model the O\&M process, as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and
   Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs), have limitations which do not permit
   them to include properly the knowledge available, and may result in
   non-optimal solutions. Specifically, the conditional probabilities for
   the evolution of the degradation state and the precision of the
   observations are usually affected by epistemic uncertainty. While MPDs
   and POMDPs are formulated for fixed transition and observation
   probabilities, the Bayes-Adaptive POMDP (BA-POMDP) framework treats
   those conditional probabilities as random variables, and is therefore
   suitable for including epistemic uncertainty. In this paper we propose a
   novel method to learn and update the distribution of these variables
   during the management process; and to select the optimal strategy under
   model uncertainty. We validate our approach with synthetic data, and we
   show that the management cost of a wind farm can be significantly less
   than that related to the POMDP approach, as the BA-POMDP framework
   allows finding robust optimal solutions, and learning from the
   environment to adapt the policy depending on the observations collected.}},

Abstract = {{Structural damage diagnosis algorithms often involve analyzing vibration
   responses to extract information about dynamic characteristics closely
   related to integrity. The vibration data are, however, often influenced
   by various environmental effects, which may degrade diagnosis
   performance and result in erroneous decisions. This paper focuses on
   understanding the consequence of significant environmental effects, such
   as trains passing nearby, on building vibration data using event
   detection methods and causal analysis. The event detection methods
   identify significant events using wavelet analysis, which is effective
   for decomposing non-stationary signals. The causal analysis allows us to
   investigate wave propagation patterns in structures by quantifying
   causal dependencies between measurements collected from different
   locations using directed information. These methods are applied to
   acceleration data collected from 40 accelerometers deployed to an
   11-story office building located next to railway. The results show clear
   patterns of causal dependencies among vibration data from different
   locations in the building, and their patterns change under different
   environmental conditions. It provides insights about environmental
   loading effects on building vibration that can be helpful for improving
   the accuracy of damage diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) enables the acquisition and recovery of sparse
   signals and images at sampling rates significantly below the classical
   Nyquist rate. Despite significant progress in the theory and methods of
   CS, little headway has been made in compressive video acquisition and
   recovery. Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamic
   events, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging
   architectures and signal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a
   new framework for video CS for dynamic textured scenes that models the
   evolution of the scene as a linear dynamical system (LDS). This reduces
   the video recovery problem to first estimating the model parameters of
   the LDS from compressive measurements and then reconstructing the image
   frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic parameters (the state
   sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (the observation
   matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement strategy
   that measures only the time-varying parameters at each instant and
   accumulates measurements over time to estimate the time-invariant
   parameters. This enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate
   considerably. We validate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness
   with a range of experiments involving video recovery and scene
   classification.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence live cell imaging is an important experimental technique
   for visualizing and recording dynamic cellular processes under
   physiological conditions. However, a problem commonly encountered during
   imaging is sample drift. Without correction, such drift will cause bias
   or even error in subsequent image analysis of intracellular movement.
   Traditional area-based and feature-based image registration techniques
   often fail to correct such drift because, in addition to whole cell
   drift, intracellular features of interest also undergo separate and
   complex motion. To address this problem, we developed an image
   registration technique based on identifying clusters of features that
   undergo highly correlated motion. Sample drift is determined from
   movement of these features and corrected. Experiments confirmed that
   this technique can effectively remove translational drift with sub-pixel
   accuracy. For drift that also involves rotation, an extension of the
   technique is developed to determine rotation angles both within and out
   of the image plane so that rotational drift can be corrected. The
   technique is general and can be used for drift correction in a broad
   range of biological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Successful completion of dynamic cellular processes ranging from
   intracellular transport to embryonic development depends critically on
   precise spatial and temporal coordination of the molecules and cells
   involved. Understanding spatiotemporal behaviors of these molecules and
   cells is therefore essential to understanding mechanisms of their
   associated cellular processes. Over the past two decades, a wide variety
   of image feature tracking techniques have been developed for recovery of
   spatiotemporal trajectories of molecules and cells from their images.
   From these trajectories, simple descriptors such as velocities or
   diffusion coefficients are often calculated for behavior
   characterization. However, for complex cellular processes, these
   descriptors cannot fully characterize or represent spatiotemporal
   behaviors of the molecules and cells involved. Instead, comprehensive
   computational representations and models become essential. This short
   paper introduces a special session that we organize to invite
   investigators to present their work related to this important emerging
   topic in biological imaging. We illustrate the necessity for
   computational representation and modeling of spatiotemporal cell
   dynamics using a specific example and review briefly some of the key
   technical challenges to be addressed. We conclude with an overview of
   the invited presentations.}},

Abstract = {{Associative memories and neurocomputing systems represent a massively
   parallel computing paradigm. Although extremely efficient for certain
   applications such as pattern recognition and image processing, such
   systems are not efficiently implemented using traditional CMOS design
   technology due to the required circuit complexity and corresponding
   power consumption to perform neural computations and represent
   programmable connections between artificial neurons. In this paper we
   propose to use newly-proposed mCell devices, which act as switchable
   non-volatile resistances, to implement an all-magnetic analog
   associative memory. We describe our building blocks for both artificial
   neurons and synapses using such magnetic devices. We verify the
   functionality of our proposed architecture using circuit simulation
   models of the mCell devices based on the first-order device physics.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we extend the algorithm proposed in {[}1] to solve
   multi-period optimal power flow (MOPF) problems to global optimality.
   The multi-period version of the OPF is time coupled due to the
   integration of storage systems into the network, and ramp constraints on
   the generators. The global optimization algorithm is based on the
   spatial branch and bound framework with lower bounds on the optimal
   objective function value calculated by solving a semidefinite
   programming ( SDP) relaxation of the MOPF. The proposed approach does
   not assume convexity and is more general than the ones presented
   previously for the solution of MOPF. We present a case study of the IEEE
   57 bus instance with a time varying demand profile. The integration of
   storage in the network helps to satisfy loads during high demands and
   the ramp constraints ensure smooth generation profiles. The SDP
   relaxation does not satisfy the rank condition, and our optimization
   algorithm is able to guarantee global optimality within reasonable
   computational time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the actuator/sensor allocation problem for
   linear time invariant (LTI) systems. Given the structure of an
   autonomous linear dynamical system, the goal is to design the structure
   of the input matrix (commonly denoted by B) such that the system is
   structurally controllable with the restriction that each input be
   dedicated, i.e., it can only control directly a single state variable.
   We provide a methodology to determine the minimum number of dedicated
   inputs required to ensure structural controllability, and characterize
   all (when not unique) possible configurations of the minimal input
   matrix B. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solution incurs
   polynomial complexity in the number of state variables. By duality, the
   solution methodology may be readily extended to the structural design of
   the corresponding minimal output matrix (commonly denoted by C) that
   ensures structural observability.}},

Abstract = {{Many antenna design and optimization problems require optimizing
   multimodal, high dimensional, non-convex and inseparable objective
   functions. This has led researchers towards stochastic optimization
   techniques such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) instead of classical
   gradient-based methods for these applications. However, despite many
   past successes, very little is known about which types of EAs map best
   to which types of antenna optimization problems. The goal of this work
   is to investigate this mapping of EAs to applications by comparing the
   performance of three EAs on five benchmark antenna design problems and
   one real-world problem derived from a NASA satellite mission.
   Performance of these algorithms has been compared on the basis of
   success rates and average convergence time over 30 independent runs. Our
   results indicate that age-layered population structure genetic algorithm
   (ALPS-GA) performed best in terms of success rates and convergence
   speed. However, on the NASA antenna design problem differential
   evolution achieved highest success rates, which was marginally better
   than ALPS-GA. We also explored the effect of increasing antenna
   complexity on the antenna gain.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical response of hydrogen sensors based on Al0.30Ga0.70N/GaN
   high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) with Pt catalytic gate
   electrodes was measured in a flowing gaseous stream consisting of
   hydrogen in a pure nitrogen diluent at ambient and elevated
   temperatures. The sensor response was found to monotonically increase
   for a wide range of hydrogen concentrations (500 ppb to 5 vol\%).
   Various models based upon Langmuir adsorption were investigated to
   describe the sensor response in this regime. A simple two-state model
   involving two distinct hydrogen binding states that have previously been
   observed in surface studies was found to adequately describe sensor
   response from 500 ppb to 5 vol\% hydrogen in nitrogen. The relevance of
   other modified Langmuir models to adequately describe the sensor
   response as a function of hydrogen concentration is also discussed. (C)

Pages = {{4534-4541}},
Abstract = {{Microscale tipstreaming is a hydrodynamic phenomenon capable of
   producing submicron sized droplets within a microfluidic device. The
   tipstreaming process results in the drawing of a thin thread from a
   highly curved interface and occurs as a result of interfacial surfactant
   concentration gradients that develop due to elongational flows generated
   within flow focusing geometries. However, in conventional microfluidic
   devices, the thread formation is periodically interrupted by the
   formation of larger primary droplets. This study presents an active
   feedback control loop capable of eliminating the production of primary
   droplets and producing a continuous thread, and therefore a continuous
   droplet stream. A proportional controller is used to successfully
   control the position of the interface and generate a continuous thread.
   A derivative component is incorporated in an attempt to increase
   controller stability, but this component is found to be ineffective.
   Analysis of the tip position as a function of time is performed to
   determine the optimal proportional gain constant and set point value for
   the proportional controller that minimize fluctuations in the produced
   droplet sizes. The generation of a continuous thread facilitates the use
   of tipstreaming in several applications, including nanoparticle
   synthesis, chemical detection, and enzyme activity studies.}},

Abstract = {{Applications consisting of messaging, voice, and video are used to
   provide situational awareness to decision makers and emergency
   responders in high criticality crisis scenarios such as disaster
   management. Here, ad hoc wireless networks are often quickly provisioned
   to provide the necessary connectivity to support these applications.
   Applications ill prepared to deal with the constant fluctuation of
   available bandwidth will stall or fail and contribute to mission
   failure. Our algorithm, D-Q-RAM (Distributed Quality of Service (QoS)
   Resource Allocation Model) allows applications to satisfy their specific
   QoS expectations in dynamically fluctuating networked environments by
   incorporating a distributed optimization heuristic that results in near
   optimal adaptation without the need to know, estimate, or predict
   available bandwidth at any moment in time. This paper describes our
   approach for managing that optimization heuristic in a manner that is
   decentralized, that is network routers are unaware of the semantics of
   the applications, and the applications can arbitrate among competing
   signals from numerous network routers and select an appropriate QoS
   level which results in an improved overall global utility of available
   network bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate to achieve low Packet Error Rate (PER) for
   Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications within the IEEE 802.11p
   standard. We first present the best achievable PER with the assumption
   of perfect channel knowledge. Then we propose to approach the best
   achievable PER with a relaxed assumption of partial channel knowledge,
   i.e., knowing a few separated channels in a packet. In order to obtain
   partial channel knowledge in an 802.11p standard-compliant way, we
   propose a sub-packet decoding processing in which the successful
   decoding of the previous sub-packet will provide partial channel
   knowledge for decoding the following sub-packet. Then we design a double
   decoding scheme to achieve low PER in a standard-compliant way. The
   double decoding scheme utilizes the error detection information provided
   by CRC check in medium-access (MAC) layer and combines two different
   decoding methods in physical (PHY) layer. The results show that
   comparing to previous work, the proposed double decoding can improve PER
   significantly.}},

Title = {{Particle number concentrations over Europe in 2030: the role of
   emissions and new particle formation}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{The aerosol particle number concentration is a key parameter when
   estimating impacts of aerosol particles on climate and human health. We
   use a three-dimensional chemical transport model with detailed
   microphysics, PMCAMx-UF, to simulate particle number concentrations over
   Europe in the year 2030, by applying emission scenarios for trace gases
   and primary aerosols. The scenarios are based on expected changes in
   anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and
   primary aerosol particles with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5)
   focusing on a photochemically active period, and the implications for
   other seasons are discussed.
   For the baseline scenario, which represents a best estimate of the
   evolution of anthropogenic emissions in Europe, PMCAMx-UF predicts that
   the total particle number concentration (N-tot) will decrease by 30-70\%
   between 2008 and 2030. The number concentration of particles larger than
   100 nm (N-100), a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
   concentration, is predicted to decrease by 40-70\% during the same
   period. The predicted decrease in N-tot is mainly a result of reduced
   new particle formation due to the expected reduction in SO2 emissions,
   whereas the predicted decrease in N-100 is a result of both decreasing
   condensational growth and reduced primary aerosol emissions. For larger
   emission reductions, PMCAMx-UF predicts reductions of 60-80\% in both
   N-tot and N-100 over Europe.
   Sensitivity tests reveal that a reduction in SO2 emissions is far more
   efficient than any other emission reduction investigated, in reducing
   N-tot. For N-100, emission reductions of both SO2 and PM2.5 contribute
   significantly to the reduced concentration, even though SO2 plays the
   dominant role once more. The impact of SO2 for both new particle
   formation and growth over Europe may be expected to be somewhat higher
   during the simulated period with high photochemical activity than during
   times of the year with less incoming solar radiation. The predicted
   reductions in both N-tot and N-100 between 2008 and 2030 in this study
   will likely reduce both the aerosol direct and indirect effects, and
   limit the damaging effects of aerosol particles on human health in
   Europe.}},

   layer of elastomer. Circuits produced in this fashion are soft,
   stretchable, and can have complex 3D channel geometries. In contrast,
   current fabrication techniques, including needle injection, mask

Abstract = {{The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) in low-voltage
   networks is expected to increase significantly in the next few years. It
   is known that the large-scale integration of DER in conventional
   low-voltage (LV) networks poses many challenges such as voltage rise. To
   mitigate voltage rise caused by DER, utilities are defining simple
   voltage regulation strategies such as disconnecting DER when phase
   voltages rise above a defined threshold. In this paper, we model LV
   networks as three-phase unbalanced circuits and illustrate that such
   local regulation strategies may cause the cascading of the DER in a
   feeder. We then propose an optimal control approach to avoid cascading
   and optimize DER availability. Local control approaches are discussed in
   the context of global DER availability and their limitations are
   illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of humans based on their biometric signatures is becoming of
   increasing importance because of its applications in access security,
   reliable identification for benefits distribution and homeland security
   among others. Popular biometric modalities include face images,
   fingerprints, iris images, palm prints, gait patterns, voice, etc. Iris
   images are of significant interest because of the excellent recognition
   rates they offer in controlled image acquisition conditions where the
   image quality is expected to be good enough to capture the details of
   the iris. However, in more realistic scenarios, iris images may not be
   of necessary quality because of image distortions and occlusions due to
   eyelids and eyelashes and the recognition rates provided by standard
   approaches may not be sufficient. In this chapter, we discuss how
   Bayesian graphical models can be used to achieve improved iris
   recognition in the presence of image impairments such as nonlinear
   deformations and occlusions. We illustrate the performance of these
   methods on sample iris image data sets.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the influence of morphology and structure on the

   prepared by pulse electrodeposition on Cu substrate and Cu6Sn5-modified
   Sn film was formed with a facile method by post deposition heat

   diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to
   characterize the composition and morphology of Cu6Sn5-modified Sn film.
   The Cu6Sn5-modified Sn film was directly assembled in Li-ion coin cells
   as the anode and studied by charge/discharge and AC impedance. A thick
   Sn film was used as the control to compare its electrochemical
   performances with Cu6Sn5-modified Sn film. The Cu6Sn5-modified Sn anode
   is a multi-layer structure with unique morphology of a surface
   continuous layer and a micron-crystalline layer, and exhibited strong
   correlation between cyclic properties and its structure as well as
   morphology. The Cu6Sn5-modified Sn anode showed increased capacity

Abstract = {{It is an exciting time to be developing robotic prostheses,
   exoskeletons, and gait trainers, with clever new innovations emerging at
   a rapid pace. But are these the droids we're looking for? It is very
   difficult to predict how a human will respond and adapt to forceful
   interactions with an electromechanical device, and many years of
   development are typically required before proposed designs can be tested
   on humans. What if we could test our ideas for device function quickly,
   without the overhead of designing a product-ready prototype? This might
   lead to faster, and more meaningful, understanding of design
   requirements and trade-offs for human users. We will describe a system
   that we have developed for rapid emulation of robotic ankle prostheses
   and orthoses, and present initial results from the high-throughput
   experiments that this technology has enabled. One set of experiments
   provides quantitative insights into the optimal prosthesis motor and
   battery size for a given user, while another set identifies the
   relationships between energy cost, balance, and variability during gait.
   Experiments with an ankle-foot orthosis demonstrate shaping of the human
   energy-cost landscape, revealing that least-effort drives can be
   harnessed to shape self-selected coordination patterns, with
   applications to gait rehabilitation. We think this approach will
   facilitate faster identification of what humans need from wearable
   robots, providing detailed design requirements for engineers and
   resulting in better assistive technologies, sooner.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded sensors capable of operation in extreme environments including
   high temperatures, high pressures, and highly reducing, oxidizing and/or
   corrosive environments can make a significant impact on enhanced
   efficiencies and reduced greenhouse gas emissions of current and future
   fossil-based power generation systems. Relevant technologies can also be
   leveraged in a wide range of other applications with similar needs
   including nuclear power generation, industrial process monitoring and
   control, and aviation/aerospace. Here we describe a novel approach to
   embedded sensing under extreme temperature conditions by integration of
   Au-nanoparticle based plasmonic nanocomposite thin films with optical
   fibers in an evanescent wave absorption spectroscopy configuration. Such
   sensors can potentially enable simultaneous temperature and gas sensing
   at temperatures approaching 9001000 degrees C in a manner compatible
   with embedded and distributed sensing approaches. The approach is
   demonstrated using the Au/SiO2 system deposited on silica-based optical
   fibers. Stability of optical fibers under relevant high temperature
   conditions and interactions with changing ambient gas atmospheres is an
   area requiring additional investigation and development but the
   simplicity of the sensor design makes it potentially cost-effective and
   may offer a potential for widespread deployment.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{8797-8811}},
Abstract = {{Aerosol produced during the burning of olive tree branches was
   characterized with both direct source sampling (using a mobile smog
   chamber) and with ambient measurements during the burning season. The
   fresh particles were composed of 80\% organic matter, 8-10\% black
   carbon (BC), 5\% potassium, 3-4\% sulfate, 2-3\% nitrate and 0.8\%
   chloride. Almost half of the fresh olive tree branches burning organic
   aerosol (otBB-OA) consisted of alkane groups. Their mode diameter was
   close to 70 nm. The oxygen to carbon (O : C) ratio of the fresh otBB-OA
   was 0.29 +/- 0.04. The mass fraction of levoglucosan in PM1 was
   0.034-0.043, relatively low in comparison with most fuel types. This may
   lead to an underestimation of the otBB-OA contribution if levoglucosan
   is being used as a wood burning tracer. Chemical aging was observed
   during smog chamber experiments, as f(44) and O: C ratio increased, due
   to reactions with OH radicals and O-3. The otBB-OA AMS mass spectrum
   differs from the other published biomass burning spectra, with a main
   difference at m/z 60, used as levoglucosan tracer. In addition to
   particles, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as methanol,
   acetonitrile, acrolein, benzene, toluene and xylenes are also emitted.
   Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the ambient organic
   aerosol data and 3 factors could be identified: OOA (oxygenated organic
   aerosol, 55\%), HOA (hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol, 11.3\%) and
   otBB-OA 33.7\%. The fresh chamber otBB-OA AMS spectrum is close to the
   PMF otBB-OA spectrum and resembles the ambient mass spectrum during
   olive tree branches burning periods. We estimated an otBB-OA emission
   factor of 3.5 +/- 0.9 g kg(-1). Assuming that half of the olive tree
   branches pruned is burned in Greece, 2300 +/- 600 tons of otBB-OA are
   emitted every year. This activity is one of the most important fine
   aerosol sources during the winter months in Mediterranean countries.}},

Abstract = {{We fabricated and tested (in a laboratory configuration) a flexible
   insert for wireless strain sensing in an intramedullary tibial nail. The
   nail is a thick-walled titanium tube with an anatomic bend, and our
   flexible insert was designed to be advanced into the hollow of the nail
   by a surgeon during the late stages of the fracture fixation process.
   The flexible insert is a stainless steel rod, 170 mm long, with a
   part-circular section, roughly 4 mm wide and 2 mm deep that is slightly
   smaller than the hollow. A lithium niobate SAW device developed by our
   research team, with an operating frequency of 468 MHz, is bonded to the
   insert and demonstrates wireless strain sensing when the insert is bent.
   We describe the mechanics of the flexible insert, which can be used for
   structural monitoring applications where conventional strain gauge
   installation and wiring would be impractical. Because of its
   flexibility, the insert can be advanced into an irregular channel, such
   as the hollow of a tibial nail, or a narrow access path drilled into a
   solid. The insert will bend elastically into a configuration with at
   least three points of contact with the host body. The insert will be
   prestrained (in bending) during installation and need not be anchored or
   bonded to the host body other than through contact. Bending strain in
   the insert will vary as the host body deforms. We discuss possible
   application questions, and we demonstrate strain sensing in a laboratory
   specimen.}},

Title = {{Representation of nucleation mode microphysics in a global aerosol model
   with sectional microphysics}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1221-1232}},
Abstract = {{In models, nucleation mode (1 nm < D-p < 10 nm) particle microphysics
   can be represented explicitly with aerosol microphysical processes or
   can be parameterized to obtain the growth and survival of nuclei to the
   model's lower size boundary. This study investigates how the
   representation of nucleation mode microphysics impacts aerosol number
   predictions in the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) aerosol
   microphysics model running with the GISS GCM II-prime by varying its
   lowest diameter boundary: 1 nm, 3 nm, and 10 nm. The model with the 1 nm
   boundary simulates the nucleation mode particles with fully resolved
   microphysical processes, while the model with the 10 nm and 3 nm
   boundaries uses a nucleation mode dynamics parameterization to account
   for the growth of nucleated particles to 10 nm and 3 nm, respectively.
   We also investigate the impact of the time step for aerosol
   microphysical processes (a 10 min versus a 1 h time step) to aerosol
   number predictions in the TOMAS models with explicit dynamics for the
   nucleation mode particles (i.e., 3 nm and 1 nm boundary). The model with
   the explicit microphysics (i.e., 1 nm boundary) with the 10 min time
   step is used as a numerical benchmark simulation to estimate biases
   caused by varying the lower size cutoff and the time step. Different
   representations of the nucleation mode have a significant effect on the
   formation rate of particles larger than 10 nm from nucleated particles
   (J(10)) and the burdens and lifetimes of ultrafine-mode (10 nm <= D-p <=
   70 nm) particles but have less impact on the burdens and lifetimes of
   CCN-sized particles. The models using parameterized microphysics (i.e.,
   10 nm and 3 nm boundaries) result in higher J(10) and shorter
   coagulation lifetimes of ultrafine-mode particles than the model with
   explicit dynamics (i.e., 1 nm boundary). The spatial distributions of
   CN10 (D-p >= 10 nm) and CCN(0.2 \%) (i.e., CCN concentrations at 0.2\%
   supersaturation) are moderately affected, especially CN10 predictions
   above similar to 700 hPa where nucleation contributes most strongly to
   CN10 concentrations. The lowermost-layer CN10 is substantially improved
   with the 3 nm boundary (compared to 10 nm) in most areas. The
   overprediction in CN10 with the 3 nm and 10 nm boundaries can be
   explained by the overprediction of J(10) or J(3) with the parameterized
   microphysics, possibly due to the instantaneous growth rate assumption
   in the survival and growth parameterization. The errors in CN10
   predictions are sensitive to the choice of the lower size boundary but
   not to the choice of the time step applied to the microphysical
   processes. The spatial distribution of CCN(0.2 \%) with the 3 nm
   boundary is almost identical to that with the 1 nm boundary, but that
   with the 10 nm boundary can differ more than 10-40\% in some areas. We
   found that the deviation in the 10 nm simulations is partly due to the
   longer time step (i.e., 1 h time step used in the 10 nm simulations
   compared to 10 min time step used in the benchmark simulations), but,
   even with the same time step, the 10 nm cutoff showed noticeably higher
   errors than the 3 nm cutoff. In conclusion, we generally recommend using
   a lower diameter boundary of 3 nm for studies focused on aerosol
   indirect effects but down to 1 nm boundary for studies focused on CN10
   predictions or nucleation.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical properties of biological cells have connections to their
   pathological states. Here we present an electric impedance microflow
   cytometry (EIMC) platform for the characterization of disease states of
   single cells. This platform entails a microfluidic device for a
   label-free and non-invasive cell-counting assay through electric
   impedance sensing. We identified a dimensionless offset parameter delta
   obtained as a linear combination of a normalized phase shift and a
   normalized magnitude shift in electric impedance to differentiate cells
   on the basis of their pathological states. This paper discusses a
   representative case study on red blood cells (RBCs) invaded by the
   malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Invasion by P. falciparum
   induces physical and biochemical changes on the host cells throughout a
   48-h multi-stage life cycle within the RBC. As a consequence, it also
   induces progressive changes in electrical properties of the host cells.
   We demonstrate that the EIMC system in combination with data analysis
   involving the new offset parameter allows differentiation of P.
   falciparum infected RBCs from uninfected RBCs as well as among different
   P. falciparum intraerythrocytic asexual stages including the ring stage.
   The representative results provided here also point to the potential of
   the proposed experimental and analysis platform as a valuable tool for
   non-invasive diagnostics of a wide variety of disease states and for
   cell separation.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave ultrasonics is an attractive technique for structural health
   monitoring, especially on pressurized pipes. However, civil
   infrastructure components, including pipes, are often subject to large
   environmental and operational variations that prevent traditional
   baseline subtraction-based approaches from detecting damage. We collect
   ultrasonic data on a large-scale pipe segment in its normal operating
   conditions and observe large environmental variations. We developed a
   damage detection method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) that
   is robust to those benign variations. We further develop an online
   novelty detection framework based on our SVD method to detect the
   presence of a mass scatterer on the pipe at the same time that we
   collect the data. We examine the framework with both synthetic
   simulations and field experimental data. The results show that the
   framework can effectively detect the presence of a scatterer and is
   robust to large environmental and operational variations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces two forecasting methods for building energy
   consumption data that are recorded from smart meters in high resolution.
   For utility companies, it is important to reliably forecast the
   aggregate consumption profile to determine energy supply for the next
   day and prevent any crisis. The proposed methods involve forecasting
   individual load on the basis of their measurement history and weather
   data without using complicated models of building system. The first
   method is most efficient for a very short-term prediction, such as the
   prediction period of one hour, and uses a simple adaptive time-series
   model. For a longer-term prediction, a nonparametric Gaussian process
   has been applied to forecast the load profiles and their uncertainty
   bounds to predict a day-ahead. These methods are computationally simple
   and adaptive and thus suitable for analyzing a large set of data whose
   pattern changes over the time. These forecasting methods are applied to
   several sets of building energy consumption data for lighting and
   heating-ventilation-air-conditioning (HVAC) systems collected from a
   campus building at Stanford University. The measurements are collected
   every minute, and corresponding weather data are provided hourly. The
   results show that the proposed algorithms can predict those energy
   consumption data with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{To automate video surveillance systems, algorithms must be developed to
   automatically detect and classify basic human actions. Many traditional
   approaches focus on the classification of actions, which usually assumes
   prior detection, tracking, and segmentation of the human figure from the
   original video. On the other hand, action detection is a more desirable
   paradigm, as it is capable of simultaneous localization and
   classification of the action. This means that no prior segmentation or
   tracking is required, and multiple action instances may be detected in
   the same video.
   Correlation filters have been traditionally applied for object detection
   in images. In this paper, we report the results of our investigation
   using correlation filters for human action detection in videos.
   Correlation filters have previously been explored for action
   classification, but this is the first time they are evaluated for the
   more difficult task of action detection. In addition, we investigate
   several practical implementation issues, including parameter selection,
   reducing computational time, and exploring the effects of preprocessing
   and temporal occlusion (i.e., loss of video frames) on performance.}},

Abstract = {{Current hierarchical communication infrastructure in the smart grid is
   not robust for data collection from smart meters during outages. In this
   work, we propose a self-organizing multi-channel wireless communication
   framework to aid in data collection for smart grid health monitoring.
   Our proposed self-organization consists of two stages. First, smart
   meters form local mesh clusters by flattening the provisioned hierarchy.
   Second, the clusters interconnect to provide mesh connectivity from the
   outage region to functioning regions of the grid. We propose to
   construct this mesh-of-meshes hierarchy using a cross-layer strategy.
   The strategy jointly considers medium access limitations and the
   asymmetric traffic flow that becomes more heavy near the edges of the
   outage area. Our design framework allows an operator to plan network
   deployment, spectrum management, and medium access to perform as needed
   during an outage.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Grid State Estimation (SE) aims at providing robust and accurate
   system state estimate for subsequent control operations to accommodate
   the disturbance of highly intermittent components. Conventional SE for
   AC Power Grid formulates the estimation process as a non-convex
   optimization problem, which may reach a local optimal and stop. To
   compensate the drawback, Semidefinite Programming (SDP) was recently
   applied to convexify the non-convex problem with rank one relaxation
   technique, which shows perspectives with approximately globally optimal
   estimate. However, as the SDP approach is essentially a centralized
   algorithm, it is computationally expensive and non-robust to partial
   network failure, bad data. etc. To ameliorate the current SDP SE
   approach, this paper presents a distributed algorithm by employing
   Lagrangian method and graph theory results and particularly by dividing
   power networks in accordance with network `cliques'. Correspondingly,
   significant improvements are illustrated in simulations on IEEE test
   beds.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new mobile system framework, SenSec, which uses passive
   sensory data to ensure the security of applications and data on mobile
   devices. SenSec constantly collects sensory data from accelerometers,
   gyroscopes and magnetometers and constructs the gesture model of how a
   user uses the device. SenSec calculates the sureness that the mobile
   device is being used by its owner. Based on the sureness score, mobile
   devices can dynamically request the user to provide active
   authentication (such as a strong password), or disable certain features
   of the mobile devices to protect user's privacy and information
   security. In this paper, we model such gesture patterns through a
   continuous n-gram language model using a set of features constructed
   from these sensors. We built mobile application prototype based on this
   model and use it to perform both user classification and user
   authentication experiments. User studies show that SenSec can achieve
   75\% accuracy in identifying the users and 71.3\% accuracy in detecting
   the non-owners with only 13.1\% false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible biodegradable electronics have the potential to serve as the
   centerpiece for temporary electronically active medical implants.
   Biodegradable electronics may exhibit many advantages over traditional
   chronic implants. Two important long-term goals for biodegradable
   electronics are (1) supplying sufficient power and (2) reducing the
   invasiveness of device deployment. Edible electronic devices are capable
   of addressing both challenges. Here, we introduce electrochemical
   electronic power sources that are compatible with non-invasive
   deployment strategies and are composed entirely of edible materials and
   naturally occurring precursors that are consumed in common diets. The
   current sources developed herein are powered by onboard sodium ion
   electrochemical cells. Potentials up to 0.6 V and currents in the range
   of 5-20 mu A can be generated routinely. These devices could serve as an
   enabling platform technology for edible electronics used in non-invasive
   sensing and stimulation of tissues within the human body.}},

Title = {{Combinatorial substrate epitaxy: a new approach to growth of complex
   metastable compounds}},
Journal = {{CRYSTENGCOMM}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{5434-5441}},
Abstract = {{A high-throughput processing-characterization method, called
   combinatorial substrate epitaxy (CSE), was developed that enables the
   investigation of epitaxial stabilization of metastable compositions in
   complex structures. To demonstrate the approach, we fabricated RE2Ti2O7
   (RE = Dy, Gd, Sm, La) in a polymorphic structure for which RE = Dy, Gd,
   and Sm are metastable and Dy2Ti2O7 has not been previously observed.
   Dense sintered pellets of Sr2Nb2O7, which adopts the 110-layered
   perovskite (LP) structure, were prepared as substrates, polished flat,
   and characterized locally using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).
   Thin films of RE2Ti2O7 were deposited using pulsed laser deposition and
   were then characterized with EBSD. The EBSD patterns from all
   film-substrate pairs matched in a grain-by-grain fashion, which
   demonstrates that the films are in local epitaxial registry with the
   Sr2Nb2O7 grains over a wide spread of crystallographic orientations for
   the substrate surface. Furthermore, the EBSD patterns demonstrate that
   all RE2Ti2O7 films, whether stable or metastable in the bulk, adopt the
   110-LP structure. Transmission electron microscopy was used to
   investigate more closely the metastable Sm2Ti2O7 films. The
   film-substrate interfaces are atomically smooth with relaxed epitaxial
   registry, indicating that the microcrystalline substrates can be treated
   as local single-crystal substrates and the metastable films are stable
   against back-transformation on strain relaxation. Electron diffraction
   patterns for Sm2Ti2O7 films are consistent with the monoclinic 110-LP
   unit cells. This work demonstrates that CSE allows for the growth of new
   materials that are thermodynamically and kinetically difficult to
   realize otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{The current state-of-the-art of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor
   material technology is reviewed for the manufacturing of
   high-performance and reliable power electronics switching devices. In
   particular, silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) material and
   device technologies are evaluated when compared to conventional silicon
   power switching devices. For commercial applications above 400 volts,
   SiC stands out as a viable near-term commercial opportunity especially
   for single-chip current ratings in excess of 20 amps. For voltage
   ratings below 900 volts and smaller currents (below 20 amps), lateral
   GaN power transistors that utilize two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
   are promising candidates. At the time of this writing, field-reliability
   of WBG power devices is yet to be demonstrated in power converter
   applications. The exact role of high-density of material defects in both
   SiC and GaN semiconductors, primarily in the drift-region of the device,
   is not known from manufacturing and reliability considerations. This
   fundamental understanding is critical in order for WBG power devices to

Abstract = {{The thermal groove technique has been used to measure relative grain
   boundary energies in two 100 ppm Ca-doped yttria samples. The first has
   a normal grain size distribution and the boundaries have a bilayer of
   segregated Ca. In the second sample, there is a combination of large
   grains and small grains. The boundaries around the large grains are
   known to have an intergranular film. The results show that the relative
   energies of boundaries in the sample with normal grain growth and the
   boundaries around small grains far from larger grains in the second
   sample are similar. Also, boundaries surrounding the largest grains and
   small grains immediately adjacent to them have the same and
   significantly lower energies. The results indicate that grain boundaries
   with an intergranular film have a lower energy than those with bilayer
   segregation and that the intergranular film extends beyond the periphery
   of the largest grains, but not throughout the entire sample.}},

Abstract = {{Grain boundary engineered (GBE) materials have improved properties that
   are associated with the high fraction special Sigma 3(n) boundaries in
   the microstructure, where n = 1, 2, or 3. Previous experimental studies
   with high purity nickel before and after GBE thermomechanical processing
   have shown that the fraction of Sigma 3 boundaries increased by at least
   factor of two {[}1]. Electron backscafter diffraction (EBSD) is used to
   characterize the evolution of these special boundaries throughout the
   recrystallization process of a 25\% cold rolled sample annealed at 490
   degrees C. The fractions of the Sigma 3 boundaries and coherent twins
   have been measured over time revealing a steadily increasing population
   throughout the entire microstructure. However, when only the
   recrystallized regions are analyzed, the population of Sigma 3
   boundaries initially increases rapidly and then stagnates over time. The
   evolution of the population of triple junctions containing special
   boundaries was also measured.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in grain size, texture and misorientation distributions have
   been monitored during extensive normal grain growth in 3\%Si steels. The
   boundary misorientation distributions deviate significantly from the
   Mackenzie relationship. Comparisons of correlated and uncorrelated
   distributions show large excesses of low angle boundaries. However,
   these are not a result of low energy boundaries being favoured during
   grain growth since the deviation diminishes as growth proceeds. The
   effect originates in the nucleation of grains in colonies of similar
   orientation during primary recrystallisation. A slight tendency for
   promotion of 60 degrees boundaries may indicate some preference for the
   retention of lower energy twin boundaries during grain growth in silicon
   steel.}},

Abstract = {{For pipe guided wave inspection systems, it can often be difficult to
   achieve accurate localization performance due to the pipe's geometry.
   Many localization techniques focus on the first arrival for processing,
   but this often results in a poor circumferential resolution.
   Furthermore, the pipe's circular geometry generates multipath arrivals
   that make data interpretation difficult. In this paper, however, we
   utilize this multipath behavior by combining the standard delay-and-sum
   localization method with a simple multipath model for a pipe. Using
   experimental data from a transmitting source, we show that our method
   significantly improves circumferential resolution and reduces
   localization artifacts when compared with the standard delay-and-sum
   method.}},

   signals also change dramatically from environmental and operational

   pipe segments in a working hot-water supply system that experiences
   ongoing variations in pressure, temperature, and flow rate. Singular
   value decomposition is applied to differentiate the change caused by
   scatterer from the changes produced by benign variations. We build a

   sensitive to the mass scatterer but insensitive to the changes produced

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of distributed adaptive linear
   parameter estimation in multiagent inference networks. Local sensing
   model information is only partially available at the agents, and
   interagent communication is assumed to be unpredictable. The paper
   develops a generic mixed time-scale stochastic procedure consisting of
   simultaneous distributed learning and estimation, in which the agents
   adaptively assess their relative observation quality over time and fuse
   the innovations accordingly. Under rather weak assumptions on the
   statistical model and the interagent communication, it is shown that, by
   properly tuning the consensus potential with respect to the innovation
   potential, the asymptotic information rate loss incurred in the learning
   process may be made negligible. As such, it is shown that the agent
   estimates are asymptotically efficient, in that their asymptotic
   covariance coincides with that of a centralized estimator (the inverse
   of the centralized Fisher information rate for Gaussian systems) with
   perfect global model information and having access to all observations
   at all times. The proof techniques are mainly based on convergence
   arguments for non-Markovian mixed time-scale stochastic approximation
   procedures. Several approximation results developed in the process are
   of independent interest.}},

   membrane processes, adsorbents, and biofilm-resistant surfaces. This
   study details recent progress towards the development of these proposed
   applications. We explored the use of carbon nanomaterials such as
   fullerene C-60, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and multi-wall
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for a range of new technologies including,
   degradation of a probe organic compound by in situ generation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS), new strategies for microbial
   disinfection, and the inhibition of biofilm development on membrane
   surfaces. The results show that the degradation of 2-chlorophenol by ROS
   produced microbial inactivation, and the mobility of the nanoparticle
   aggregates of the carbon nanomaterials all increased as suspensions were
   fractionated to enrich with smaller aggregates with sonication followed
   by successive membrane filtration.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are
   major contributors to ultrafine particle growth to climatically relevant
   sizes, increasing global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations
   within the continental boundary layer. Many models treat SOA solely as
   semivolatile, which leads to condensation of SOA proportional to the
   aerosol mass distribution; however, recent closure studies with field
   measurements show that a significant fraction of SOA condenses
   proportional to the aerosol surface area, which suggests a very low
   volatility. Additionally, while many global models contain only biogenic
   sources of SOA (with emissions generally 10-30 Tg yr(-1)), recent
   studies have shown a need for an additional source of SOA around 100 Tg
   yr(-1) correlated with anthropogenic carbon monoxide (CO) emissions is
   required to match measurements. Here, we explore the significance of
   these two findings using the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global aerosol microphysics
   model. The percent change in the number of particles of size D-p > 40 nm
   (N40) within the continental boundary layer between the surface-area-and
   mass-distribution condensation schemes, both with the base biogenic SOA
   only, yielded a global increase of 8\% but exceeds 100\% in biogenically
   active regions. The percent change in N40 within the continental
   boundary layer between the base simulation (19 Tg yr(-1)) and the
   additional SOA (100 Tg yr(-1)) both using the surface area condensation
   scheme (very low volatility) yielded a global increase of 14\%, and a
   global decrease in the number of particles of size D-p > 10 nm (N10) of
   32\%. These model simulations were compared to measured data from
   Hyytiala, Finland and other global locations and confirmed a decrease in
   the model-measurement bias. Thus, treating SOA as very low volatile as
   well as including additional SOA correlated with anthropogenic CO
   emissions causes a significant global increase in the number of
   climatically relevant sized particles, and therefore we must continue to
   refine our SOA treatments in aerosol microphysics models.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{9897-9903}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate how the
   orientation of grain boundary (GB) affects the tensile mechanics of
   polycrystalline graphene, where two opposite GB groups, i.e., armchair
   (AC) and zigzag (ZZ)-oriented tilted GBs were considered for the
   anisotropic study. We found very close mechanical similarities between
   the two groups in misorientation angle effect and critical bond length
   effect to determine the tensile strength. Mono-atomic carbon chains
   (MACCs) were commonly generated at tensile failure in both groups, as
   bridged between fractured sections, yielding the considerably higher
   population density and achievable length (4.51 nm(-2) and 1.47 nm,
   maximally) compared to pristine graphene. Notably, we found that
   polycrystalline graphene exhibited distinctly different behaviors in
   this MACC production depending on GB orientation, being 1.2-3.0 times
   denser and 1.6-5.0 times longer for ZZ-oriented GBs. Atomic stress
   analyses indicated that all key reactions emerging before tensile
   failure would not be affected by the GB orientation of polycrystalline
   graphene since the reactions only occurred along GBs, explaining why
   anisotropic mechanical GB response has not been observed so far, in
   contrast to the MACC dynamics occurring after tensile failure.}},

Journal = {{ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{P87-P96}},
Abstract = {{A multitude of models exist to predict the material removal rate (MRR)
   during CMP. Common among many of these models is the prediction of the
   MRR based on the product of the material removal rate per particle
   (MRRPP) and the number of active particles, N-act, actively contributing
   to the material removal. Discrepancies between CMP models and
   experiments are sometimes compensated for by empirical wear coefficients
   that are used as fitting parameters placed on the overall CMP model.
   However, such empirical correlations can obscure deficiencies in the
   prediction of the material removed per particle and the number of active
   particles. A decoupled understanding of both MRRPP and N-act is
   essential for accurate modeling of CMP. This work investigates the
   predictions of several active particle models, decoupled from the
   prediction of the MRR, to assess their agreement. In addition to the
   number of active particles, the models are used to predict the number of
   particles in the interface and the number of particles eligible to
   become active. It is found that although the models differ greatly in
   their assumptions to predict these quantities, there is some similarity
   in their prediction of the number of active particles. (C) 2013 The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{6810-6821}},
Abstract = {{The functionalization of carbon black by grafting of hyperbranched
   polymers from the surface via self-condensing atom transfer radical
   polymerization (SC-ATRP) is reported. The surfaces of the pristine
   carbon black were modified with ATRP initiators using two different
   methods. The first method uses acid oxidation to place COOH groups on
   the carbon black surface, followed by the esterification to give ATRP
   initiators bound to the carbon black surface. Alternatively, ATRP
   initiators bearing both azido and bromine groups were placed directly on
   the carbon black surface by nitrene chemistry. The hyperbranched
   poly(p-chloromethylstyrene) (PCMS) was grafted from the ATRP initiator
   modified carbon black surfaces using the inimer of
   p-chloromethylstyrene, and CuCl/CuCl2/N,N,N',N `',N
   `'-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) as the catalytic system in N,
   N-dimethylformamide (DMF). In addition, a one-pot two-step method was
   developed to graft crosslinked polymers from the carbon black surfaces.
   The polymerization process was well controlled and the fraction of the
   grafted polymers on carbon black could be adjusted by changing the
   polymerization time. The resulting samples were characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The hyperbranched polymers
   on the carbon black surfaces were quaternized to give an ammonium group
   on the polymer, and a chloride counterion was subsequently exchanged to
   give a hydroxide counterion. Under these basic conditions, the ATRP
   initiators should be attached to the surface using nitrene chemistry
   rather than acid oxidation, to avoid the hydrolysis of the ester groups
   that link the grafted polymers to the carbon black surface. The ammonium
   hydroxide functionalized carbon black materials were utilized for the
   reversible absorption and desorption of CO2 from ambient air, providing
   improved absorption/desorption kinetics compared with the commercially
   available Excellion membrane.}},

   control system that consists of an inner-loop position controller and an
   outer-loop pressure controller. We show excellent agreements between

   bandwidth of 10 Hz and duration of 15 hours. We envision that this

Title = {{Response of fine particulate matter concentrations to changes of
   emissions and temperature in Europe}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3423-3443}},
Abstract = {{PMCAMx-2008, a three dimensional chemical transport model (CTM), was
   applied in Europe to quantify the changes in fine particle (PM2.5)
   concentration in response to different emission reductions as well as to
   temperature increase. A summer and a winter simulation period were used,
   to investigate the seasonal dependence of the PM2.5 response to 50\%
   reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides
   (NOx), anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and anthropogenic
   primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions and also to temperature
   increases of 2.5 and 5 K. Reduction of NH3 emissions seems to be the
   most effective control strategy for reducing PM2.5, in both periods,
   resulting in a decrease of PM2.5 up to 5.1 mu g m(-3) and 1.8 mu g m(-3)
   (5.5\% and 4\% on average) during summer and winter respectively, mainly
   due to reduction of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) (20\% on average in both
   periods). The reduction of SO2 emissions decreases PM2.5 in both periods
   having a significant effect over the Balkans (up to 1.6 mu g m(-3))
   during the modeled summer period, mainly due to decrease of sulfate
   (34\% on average over the Balkans). The anthropogenic POA control
   strategy reduces total OA by 15\% during the modeled winter period and
   8\% in the summer period. The reduction of total OA is higher in urban
   areas close to its emissions sources. A slight decrease of OA (8\% in
   the modeled summer period and 4\% in the modeled winter period) is also
   predicted after a 50\% reduction of VOCs emissions due to the decrease
   of anthropogenic SOA. The reduction of NOx emissions reduces PM2.5 (up
   to 3.4 mu g m(-3)) during the summer period, due to a decrease of
   NH4NO3, causing although an increase of ozone concentration in major
   urban areas and over Western Europe. Additionally, the NOx control
   strategy actually increases PM2.5 levels during the winter period, due
   to more oxidants becoming available to react with SO2 and VOCs. The
   increase of temperature results in a decrease of PM2.5 in both periods
   over Central Europe, mainly due to a decrease of NH4NO3 during summer
   (18 \%) and fresh POA during wintertime (35 \%). Significant increases
   of OA are predicted during the summer due mainly to the increase of
   biogenic VOC emissions. On the contrary, OA is predicted to decrease in
   the modeled winter period due to the dominance of fresh POA reduction
   and the small biogenic SOA contribution to OA. The resulting increase of
   oxidant levels from the temperature rise lead to an increase of sulfate
   levels in both periods, mainly over North Europe and the Atlantic Ocean.
   The substantial reduction of PM2.5 components due to emissions
   reductions of their precursors outlines the importance of emissions for
   improving air quality, while the sensitivity of PM2.5 concentrations to
   temperature changes indicate that climate interactions need to be
   considered when predicting future levels of PM, with different net
   effects in different parts of Europe.}},

   noninvasive depth-resolved pulsatile flow profile acquisition}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{In vivo acquisition of endothelial wall shear stress requires
   instantaneous depth-resolved whole-field pulsatile flow profile
   measurements in microcirculation. High-accuracy, quantitative and
   non-invasive velocimetry techniques are essential for emerging real-time
   mechanogenomic investigations. To address these research needs, a novel
   biological flow quantification technique, OCT-mu PIV, was developed
   utilizing high-speed optical coherence tomography (OCT) integrated with
   microscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (mu PIV). This technique offers
   the unique advantage of simultaneously acquiring blood flow profiles and
   vessel anatomy along arbitrarily oriented sagittal planes. The process
   is instantaneous and enables real-time 3D flow reconstruction without
   the need for computationally intensive image processing compared to
   state-of-the-art velocimetry techniques. To evaluate the line-scanning
   direction and speed, four sets of parametric synthetic OCT-mu PIV data
   were generated using an in-house code. Based on this investigation, an
   in vitro experiment was designed at the fastest scan speed while
   preserving the region of interest providing the depth-resolved velocity
   profiles spanning across the width of a micro-fabricated channel.
   High-agreement with the analytical flow profiles was achieved for
   different flow rates and seed particle types and sizes. Finally, by
   employing blood cells as non-invasive seeding particles, in vivo
   embryonic vascular velocity profiles in multiple vessels were measured
   in the early chick embryo. The pulsatile flow frequency and peak
   velocity measurements were also acquired with OCT-mu PIV, which agreed
   well with previous reported values. These results demonstrate the
   potential utility of this technique to conduct practical microfluidic
   and non-invasive in vivo studies for embryonic blood flows.}},

Abstract = {{Human mobility plays an important role in the dissemination of malaria
   parasites between regions of variable transmission intensity.
   Asymptomatic individuals can unknowingly carry parasites to regions
   where mosquito vectors are available, for example, undermining control
   programs and contributing to transmission when they travel.
   Understanding how parasites are imported between regions in this way is
   therefore an important goal for elimination planning and the control of
   transmission, and would enable control programs to target the principal
   sources of malaria. Measuring human mobility has traditionally been
   difficult to do on a population scale, but the widespread adoption of
   mobile phones in low-income settings presents a unique opportunity to
   directly measure human movements that are relevant to the spread of
   malaria. Here, we discuss the opportunities for measuring human mobility
   using data from mobile phones, as well as some of the issues associated
   with combining mobility estimates with malaria infection risk maps to
   meaningfully estimate routes of parasite importation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The seventh U.S.Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena was
   held in Shima, Japan, from December 11 to 14, 2011. The goals of this
   joint seminar were to provide a critical assessment of the state of the
   art and future directions in the field of nanoscale transport phenomena
   and energy conversion processes, to foster U.S.Japan collaborations, and
   to provide international exposure to a new generation of scientists in
   this field. Issues discussed in the joint seminar were organized in 10
   topical sessions, including (1) nanoscale thermophysical measurements;
   (2) optical characterization; (3) thermal and molecular transport; (4)
   phonon transport modeling; (5) energy storage and conversion; (6)
   nanoscale fluidics and phase change phenomena; (7) biological and
   organic systems; (8) interfacial thermal transport; (9) novel
   thermoelectric and thermal management materials; and (10) nanocarbon
   materials and devices. In addition to these topical sessions, the joint
   seminar featured an opening plenary session and a closing plenary
   session as well as an expert panel, where leading experts provided
   critical assessment of the past progress and addressed future directions
   in the field. In addition, an evening poster session provided
   opportunities for graduate and postdoc students to present their latest
   research results. About 35 researchers from Japan and 31 researchers
   from the United States participated in the meeting. The meeting was
   organized by S. Maruyama, K. Fushinobu, L. Shi, and J. Lukes together
   with about 20 other participants who served as session chairs. Summaries
   of different sessions of the seminar were prepared by the session and
   conference chairs and are collected into this report.}},

Title = {{Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome alters nuclear shape and reduces
   cell motility in three dimensional model substrates}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{569-577}},
Abstract = {{Cell migration through tight interstitial spaces in three dimensional
   (3D) environments impacts development, wound healing and cancer
   metastasis and is altered by the aging process. The stiffness of the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) increases with aging and affects the cells
   and cytoskeletal processes involved in cell migration. However, the
   nucleus, which is the largest and densest organelle, has not been widely
   studied during cell migration through the ECM. Additionally, the nucleus
   is stiffened during the aging process through the accumulation of a
   mutant nucleoskeleton protein lamin A, progerin. By using
   microfabricated substrates to mimic the confined environment of
   surrounding tissues, we characterized nuclear movements and deformation
   during cell migration into micropillars where interspacing can be tuned
   to vary nuclear confinement. Cell motility decreased with decreased
   micropillar (mu P) spacing and correlated with increased dysmorphic
   shapes of nuclei. We examined the effects of increased nuclear stiffness
   which correlates with cellular aging by studying Hutchinson-Gilford
   progeria syndrome cells which are known to accumulate progerin. With the
   expression of progerin, cells showed a threshold response to decreased
   mu P spacing. Cells became trapped in the close spacing, possibly from
   visible micro-defects in the nucleoskeleton induced by cell crawling
   through the mP and from reduced force generation, measured
   independently. We suggest that ECM changes during aging could be
   compounded by the increasing stiffness of the nucleus and thus changes
   in cell migration through 3D tissues.}},

   electrochemical function in a neutral pH Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The
   effects of various processing parameters, including precursor ball mill
   time, microwave irradiation parameters, and graphite precursor
   concentration, on the physical and electrochemical properties of the
   synthesized NaTi2(PO4)(3). To further study electrochemical performance,
   a full test cell consisting of NaTi2(PO4)(3)/1 M Na2SO4/Na0.44MnO2 was
   assembled. The highest discharge specific capacity obtained for this
   material was 85 mAh/g. These results indicate that, with an appropriate
   amount of graphite included in the precursor mix, microwave-synthesized
   NaTi2(PO4)(3) is a promising sodium-ion functional anode material that
   can be produced using an extremely appealing low-cost manufacturing

Abstract = {{Recent rapid growth in electronic book sales has raised a critical
   question for publishers and bookstores: do e-books cannibalize or
   increase print sales? In this article, we compare the best-selling
   titles sold on www.Amazon.com in print or electronic Kindle formats
   during the period from November 2007 to July 2010. Using econometric
   methods, we find that the cannibalization of print sales by e-books is
   more likely to occur for superstar titles written by successful authors.
   However, we find that a new segment of successful electronic titles that
   are not best-selling in print format emerge; these books would probably
   have been unpopular without the new Kindle store and therefore this new
   distribution channel has expanded the market. We refer to these titles
   as digital outsiders. The latter are characterized not only by lower
   prices but also by older release dates. They also include titles that
   are only released in electronic format. We then argue that electronic
   books increase the market viability of old print releases. Finally we
   identify a category that we call print-preferred books that are top
   sellers in print but not as e-books for reasons of color, graphics, or
   the need to navigate non-linearly, a style to which the current
   generation of e-book readers are not well adapted. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Fontan procedure is employed as the final-stage palliation in
   single-ventricle congenital heart patients and results in diversion of
   venous blood directly to the pulmonary arteries. Fontan patients have
   been known to suffer from postoperative systemic venous hypertension,
   which in turn is associated with pleural effusions and protein losing
   enteropathy, leading to a decreased duration and quality of life.
   Despite the ongoing debate on its benefits, a circular fenestration hole
   (typically 4?mm) establishing a venous shunt to the common atrium is
   traditionally employed to relieve venous pressure in the Fontan conduit
   and improve early postoperative Fontan hemodynamics. However, these
   improvements come at the cost of reduced oxygen saturation due to
   excessive right-to-left shunting if the fenestration is permanent. The
   ideal selective fenestration would therefore limit or eliminate shunt
   flow at tolerable systemic venous pressures and allow increased flow at
   high pressures. The objective of this study is to introduce new
   fenestration designs that exhibit these desirable pressure-flow
   characteristics. Novel plus-shaped and S-shaped fenestration designs
   with leaflets are introduced as alternatives to the traditional circular
   fenestration, each having identical effective orifice areas at the fully
   open states. In vitro steady leakage flow tests were performed for
   physiological flow-driving pressures in order to obtain pressure-drop
   versus flow-rate characteristics. In addition, the leaflet opening
   kinematics of the plus-shaped fenestration was investigated
   computationally using finite element simulation. Fluid-structure
   interaction analysis was performed to determine leaflet displacements
   and pressure-flow characteristics at low pressures. Further, a lumped
   parameter model of the single-ventricle circuit was created to simulate
   pulsatile flow conditions For the plus-shaped fenestration, the flow
   rate was found to increase nonlinearly with increased driving systemic
   venous pressures at high physiological-pressure drops which did not
   cause the leaflets to fully open, and linearly for low driving
   pressures. These results indicate that leaflets of the plus-shaped
   fenestration design activated passively after a critical systemic venous
   pressure threshold. This feature is ideal for minimizing undesirable
   excessive venous shunting. A large variability in shunting flow rate may
   be obtained by changing the shape, thickness, size, and material of the
   fenestration to suit requirements of the patient, which can further
   limit shunt flow in a controlled manner.}},

Abstract = {{Apicocaval juxtaposition (ACJ) is a rare congenital heart defect
   associated with single ventricle physiology where optimal positioning of
   the Fontan conduit for completion of total cavopulmonary connection
   (TCPC) is still controversial. In ACJ, the cardiac apex is ipsilateral
   with the inferior vena cava (IVC), risking kinking and collapse of the
   Fontan conduit at the apex of the heart. The purpose of this study is to
   evaluate two viable routes for Fontan conduit connection in patients
   with ACJ, using computational fluid dynamics. Internal energy loss
   evaluations were used to determine contribution of conduit curvature to
   the energy efficiency of each cavopulmonary anastomosis configuration.
   This percentage of energy loss contribution was found to be greater in
   the case of a curved extracardiac conduit connection (44\%, 4.1?mW)
   traveling behind the ventricular apex, connecting the IVC to the left
   pulmonary artery, than the straighter lateral tunnel conduit (6\%,
   1.4?mW) installed through the ventricular apex. In contrast, net energy
   loss across the anastomosis was significantly lower with extracardiac
   TCPC (9.3?mW) in comparison with lateral tunnel TCPC (23.2?mW),
   highlighting that a curved Fontan conduit is favorable provided that it
   is traded off for a superior cavopulmonary connection efficiency.
   Therefore, a relatively longer and curved Fontan conduit has been
   demonstrated to be a suitable connection option independent of
   anatomical situations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a new type of microresonators enabled by
   micromachining of ion sliced X-cut LiNbO3 thin films. In operation, the
   device is excited into lateral vibrations, thus allowing the center
   frequency to be determined by the lithographically defined dimensions of
   the excitation electrodes. The demonstrated device has a high
   electromechanical coupling (k(t)(2)) of 11.5\%-the highest attained for
   laterally vibrating microelectromechanical systems resonators. Device
   orientation was also varied to investigate its impact on k(t)(2) and
   experimental data have shown good agreement with theoretical
   predictions. Several key performance parameters, including the quality
   factor (Q), the static capacitance, C-o, the temperature coefficient of
   frequency (TCF), and the power handling, are also characterized and the
   related experimental data are presented. The devices demonstrate Q's up
   to 1800. The measured TCFs range from -55 to -69 ppm/K and can be
   considered sufficiently low for wideband RF filtering. The high
   electromechanical coupling and the high Q of this new class of devices
   show promise for the implementation of multifrequency wideband

Abstract = {{Transportation-based metrics for comparing images have long been applied
   to analyze images, especially where one can interpret the pixel
   intensities (or derived quantities) as a distribution of `mass' that can
   be transported without strict geometric constraints. Here we describe a
   new transportation-based framework for analyzing sets of images. More
   specifically, we describe a new transportation-related distance between
   pairs of images, which we denote as linear optimal transportation (LOT).
   The LOT can be used directly on pixel intensities, and is based on a
   linearized version of the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric (an optimal
   transportation distance, as is the earth mover's distance). The new
   framework is especially well suited for computing all pairwise distances
   for a large database of images efficiently, and thus it can be used for
   pattern recognition in sets of images. In addition, the new LOT
   framework also allows for an isometric linear embedding, greatly
   facilitating the ability to visualize discriminant information in
   different classes of images. We demonstrate the application of the
   framework to several tasks such as discriminating nuclear chromatin
   patterns in cancer cells, decoding differences in facial expressions,
   galaxy morphologies, as well as sub cellular protein distributions.}},

Title = {{Towards optimal aqueous two-phase extraction system flowsheets for

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This work describes a flowsheet optimization framework for
   the development of protein purification operations involving aqueous
   two-phase protein extraction (ATPE). The framework encompasses both the
   flowsheet and thermodynamic calculations and predicts the optimal
   flowsheets for the application of ATPE systems.
   RESULTS: Results presented were generated by applying an optimization
   algorithm to a previous case study with demonstrated feasible
   solutions(1) concerning the recovery of phosphofructokinase from a
   simple model feedstock containing both phosphofructokinase and ovalbumin
   using poly(ethylene glycol)-dextran (PEG6000-DxT500) two-phase systems.
   An optimal flowsheet for a one-stage extraction unit and improved
   flowsheets for two-stage extraction units with and without recycle were
   determined based on the minimum scaled process cost subject to
   attainment of liquid-liquid equilibrium in the ATPE system(s) and
   constraints on product yield, product purity and phase settling rates.
   The cost performance factors of feasible one-stage and two-stage
   flowsheets with and without recycle were improved by 4.7\%, 8.6\% and
   33.1\%, respectively, relative to the prior work.
   CONCLUSION: This flowsheet optimization framework was able to predict
   the optimal flowsheets for protein purification from a two-protein
   mixture using ATPE systems, subject to some limitations. The algorithm
   has the potential to be successfully applied to predict protein
   extraction from complex mixtures upon improvement in its computational
   robustness. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Engineering goals are typically rooted in addressing the functional
   needs of a product. While these engineering goals and specifications can
   be important in consumers' buying decisions, many times the first
   impression of the product comes from judgments of the product's
   aesthetic form. For this reason, this paper set out to study how well
   human judgment of performance based on a car's shape correlates with the
   actual measured performance of the car's shape, and what features of the
   car's shape most influence this judgment. More specifically,
   participants were asked to rate how aerodynamic, sporty, fuel efficient,
   and rugged a computer generated car design appeared to them, and these
   ratings were analyzed against the actual aerodynamics of the vehicle as
   well as key indicators of sportiness and cornering stability such as
   center of gravity and wheel stance. The inter-rater consistency of human
   judgments was also studied. Using this human judgment data, the
   attributes in car design with the greatest effect on participant
   judgment of vehicle performance were identified, and were compared
   against their importance and effect in actual vehicle performance.
   Analysis of this data gives key insights about how car designers can
   create designs that better convey the desired goals of a car to
   consumers while also meeting those performance goals. The results of
   this study provide evidence that consumers are reasonably accurate at
   determining certain functional performance traits, such as aerodynamics,
   but are insensitive to other traits, such as the wheelbase of the
   vehicle design. It was also determined that the stylistic and functional
   performance judgments of the consumers surveyed may have been influenced
   by social norms and conventions learned from past experiences with
   vehicle designs. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007933]}},

Abstract = {{Federal electric vehicle (EV) policies in the United States currently
   include vehicle purchase subsidies linked to EV battery capacity and
   subsidies for installing charging stations. We assess the
   cost-effectiveness of increased battery capacity vs. nondomestic
   charging infrastructure installation for plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles as alternate methods to reduce gasoline consumption for cars,
   trucks, and SUVs in the US. We find across a wide range of scenarios
   that the least-cost solution is for more drivers to switch to
   low-capacity plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (short electric range with
   gasoline backup for long trips) or gasoline-powered hybrid electric
   vehicles. If more gasoline savings are needed per vehicle, nondomestic
   charging infrastructure installation is substantially more expensive
   than increased battery capacity per gallon saved, and both approaches
   have higher costs than US oil premium estimates. Cost effectiveness of
   all subsidies are lower under a binding fuel economy standard.
   Comparison of results to the structure of current federal subsidies
   shows that policy is not aligned with fuel savings potential, and we
   discuss issues and alternatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The grain boundary character distribution in a commercial IF steel has
   been measured as a function of lattice misorientation and boundary plane
   orientation. The grain boundary plane distribution revealed a relatively
   low anisotropy with a tendency for grain boundaries to terminate on low
   index planes having relatively low surface energy and large interplanar
   spacings. Although the most common grain boundary plane orientation was
   (111), grain boundaries terminated on higher index planes were sometimes
   found. For instance, at a misorientation angle of 60 deg about {[}111],
   symmetric \{112\} tilt boundaries were far more populous than {[}111]
   twist boundaries. The current observation revealed an inverse
   relationship between the measured populations and the previously
   reported grain boundary energies. DOI: 10.1007/s11661-012-1393-0 (C) The

Abstract = {{Carbon capture and storage is a promising strategy for mitigating the
   CO2 contribution to global climate change. The large scale
   implementation of the technology mandates better understanding of the
   risks associated with CO2 injection into geologic formations and the
   subsequent interactions with groundwater resources. The injected
   supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) is a nonpolar solvent that can potentially
   mobilize organic compounds that exist at residual saturation in the
   formation. Here, we review the partitioning behavior of selected organic
   compounds typically found in depleted oil reservoirs in the residual
   oil-brine-sc-CO2 system under carbon storage conditions. The solubility
   of pure phase organic compounds in sc-CO2, and partitioning of organic
   compounds between water and sc-CO2 follow trends predicted based on
   thermodynamics. Compounds with high volatility and low aqueous
   solubility have the highest potential to partition to sc-CO2. The
   partitioning of low volatility compounds to sc-CO2 can be enhanced by
   cosolvency due to the presence of higher volatility compounds in the
   sc-CO2. The effect of temperature, pressure, salinity, pH, and
   dissolution of water molecules into sc-CO2 on the partitioning behavior
   of organic compounds in the residual oil-brine-sc-CO2 system is
   discussed. Data gaps and research needs for models to predict the
   partitioning of organic compounds in brines and from complex mixtures of
   oils are presented. Models need to be able to better incorporate the
   effect of salinity and cosolvency, which will require more experimental
   data from key classes of organic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{This work assesses the retrofit potential of existing Portuguese fossil

   technology. The Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) was used
   to provide a systematic techno-economic analysis of the cost of emission
   control equipment, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and other
   key parameters which may change when CCS is implemented at a fossil fuel
   power plant. The results indicate that CCS requires a large capital
   investment and significantly increases the levelized cost of
   electricity. However, the economic viability of CCS increases with
   higher CO2 prices. The breakeven CO2 price for plants with and without
   CCS was estimated at \$85-\$140/t of CO2 depending on the technical

Abstract = {{A design for a passive magnetic bearing system that can stably levitate
   a rotor in all directions is described. The bearing system consists of
   levitation magnets coupled with a Halbach array stabilizer, which
   induces currents in stabilization coils, in order to overcome the
   inherent instability of a system composed only of permanent magnets. The
   levitation magnet system consists of two pairs of annular ring magnets
   which provide an upward magnetic levitation force to counteract the
   downward gravitational force of the rotor. The Halbach array stabilizer
   consists of two stabilization coils shifted in angular position with
   respect to one another and centered in the vertical direction between
   two rotating Halbach arrays. Magnetic fields from permanent magnets are
   calculated using superposition of fields due to patches of magnetization
   charge at surfaces where the magnetization is discontinuous. Induced
   currents in the stabilization coils are calculated by computing the time
   derivative of the magnetic flux through those coils. Magnetic forces on
   the rotor are computed using a superposition of forces on each patch of
   magnetization charge. The entire magnetic bearing system, consisting of
   both the levitation magnets and the Halbach array stabilizer, is stable
   to both vertical and lateral displacements. Results are compared with a
   simpler straightened approximation of the Halbach array stabilizer.}},

Abstract = {{While several laboratories can produce 3D models of microstructure from
   serial sectioning or tomography, the more widespread practice is to
   attempt to infer 3D shapes from 2D sections of different orientations.
   We have developed a forward modeling approach that, given a 3D particle
   shape, produces statistically representative 2D sections whose
   projections are characterized by 2D moment invariants (MI). Since the
   sectioning plane is random, each particle will produce a statistical
   distribution of 2D moments and an ensemble of particles in a
   microstructure will produce its own characteristic distribution of 2D
   moments and can be used as a representation of the microstructure. This
   distribution can be represented as a point in a metric space. We use the
   Hellinger distance as the measure for this space, which allows us to
   quantify the similarity of two microstructures. Example applications
   include: determination of a 3D shape by computing the Hellinger distance
   between MI density maps derived from random 2D section micrographs and
   the density map database; automated detection and quantification of
   rafting in cuboidal microstructures; and quantitative comparison of

Abstract = {{Consider the problem of partitioned scheduling of an implicit-deadline
   sporadic task set on heterogeneous multiprocessors to meet all
   deadlines. Each processor is either of type-1 or type-2. We present a
   new algorithm, FF-3C, for this problem. FF-3C offers low time-complexity
   and provably good performance. Specifically, FF-3C offers (i) a
   time-complexity of O(na <...max(m,logn)+ma <...logm), where n is the
   number of tasks and m is the number of processors and (ii) the guarantee
   that if a task set can be scheduled by an optimal partitioned-scheduling
   algorithm to meet all deadlines then FF-3C meets all deadlines as well
   if given processors at most times as fast (referred to as speed
   competitive ratio) and tasks are scheduled using EDF; where alpha is a
   property of the task set. The parameter alpha is in the range (0,0.5]
   and for each task, it holds that its utilization is no greater than
   alpha or greater than 1-alpha on each processor type. Thus, the speed
   competitive ratio of FF-3C can never exceed 2.
   We also present several extensions to FF-3C; these offer the same
   performance guarantee and time-complexity but with improved average-case
   performance. Via simulations, we compare the performance of our new
   algorithms and two state-of-the-art algorithms (and variations of the
   latter). We evaluate algorithms based on (i) running time and (ii) the
   necessary multiplication factor, i.e., the amount of extra speed of
   processors that the algorithm needs, for a given task set, so as to
   succeed, compared to an optimal task assignment algorithm. Overall, we
   observed that our new algorithms perform significantly better than the
   state-of-the-art. We also observed that our algorithms perform much
   better in practice, i.e., the necessary multiplication factor of the
   algorithms is much smaller than their speed competitive ratio. Finally,
   we also present a clustered version of the new algorithm.}},

   energy is defined in terms of two anisotropic fitting functions that
   approximate the image intensity along the principal directions of
   variation of the intensity. Therefore, the anisotropic fitting functions
   extract intensity information more precisely, which enable our model to
   cope with the boundaries with low-contrast and complicated structures.
   It is incorporated into a variational formula with a total variation
   (TV) regularization term with respect to level set function, from which
   the segmentation process is performed by minimizing this variational
   energy functional. Experiments on the vessel and brain magnetic
   resonance images demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over
   Chan-Vese (CV) active contours and local binary active contours (LBF) in
   terms of both efficiency and accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Therapeutic applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
   require understanding uptake mechanisms in macrophages, which are
   involved with many physiological and pathological processes. However,
   therapeutic applications are limited by poor quantification and
   mechanistic understanding of uptake into macrophages with different
   levels of activation. We find delivery of more than 50 million SWCNTs
   per cell to activated macrophages, which is 10x more than unactivated
   macrophages and 100x more than fibroblasts. Determining the mechanisms
   of SWCNT uptake is important for tuning this specific delivery, but
   standard cellular assays are inapplicable with SWCNTs, which quench
   fluorescence. By modification of surface coatings on the SWCNTs and
   altering macrophage activation, we applied models of macrophage uptake
   of SWCNTs and quantified precise model parameters. With this model, we
   show receptor-mediated processes saturate, and above the saturation
   levels we observe little added delivery as well as a reduction in cell
   proliferation and visibly altered cell morphology. Thus, SWCNTs can be
   preferentially delivered to activated macrophages, and the model of
   uptake suggests delivery is optimized between high extracellular levels
   and receptor saturation.}},

Title = {{Performance, cost and emissions of coal-to-liquids (CTLs) plants using
   low-quality coals under carbon constraints}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{805-813}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Prior studies of coal-to-liquids (CTLs) processes that produce synthetic
   transportation fuels from coal have focused mainly on designs using
   bituminous coal with no or limited constraints on carbon emissions. In
   this study, plant-level techno-economic models are applied to evaluate
   the performance, emissions and costs of CTL plants using low quality
   sub-bituminous coal and lignite as feedstock for both a slurry-feed and
   dry-feed gasification system. The additional cost of carbon dioxide
   capture and storage (CCS) is also studied for two plant configurations-a
   liquids-only plant and a co-production plant that produces both liquids
   and electricity. The effect of uncertainty and variability of key
   parameters on the cost of liquids products is also quantified, as well
   as the effects of a carbon constraint in the form of a price or tax on
   plant-level CO2 emissions. For liquids-only plants, net plant efficiency
   is higher and CO2 emissions and costs are lower when sub-bituminous coal
   is used. For both coals, performance of plants with a dry-feed gasifier
   is better compared to plants with slurry-feed gasifiers, but the costs
   are comparable to each other, with slurry-feed plants having a minor
   advantage. A major concern for CTL plants is the high level of CO2
   emissions, the major greenhouse gas linked to global climate change.
   However, this study shows that for the liquids-only plant most of the
   CO2 emissions can be avoided using CCS, with only a small (<1\%)
   increase in capital cost. Depending on the coal type, gasifier type and
   CO2 constraint (up to \$25/tonne CO2), the nominal cost of liquid
   product ranges from \$75 to \$110/barrel. Parameter uncertainties
   increase this range to \$50-140/barrel (90\% confidence interval). With
   or without CCS, co-production plants are found to have higher capital
   costs than liquids-only plants, but produce cheaper liquid products when
   the electricity is sold at a sufficiently high price (\$50-120/MWh,
   depending on plant design and carbon constraint). For co-production
   plants, net plant efficiency, which depends both on coal consumption as
   well as electricity generation, is higher for plants with a dry-feed
   gasifier while CO2 emissions are lower from plants with a slurry-feed
   gasifier. For both coals, capital cost is lower for plants with dry-feed
   gasifier, with plants using sub-bituminous coal being cheaper than the
   ones using lignite. A CO2 tax of \$25/tonne is not enough to make CCS
   more economical when the electricity price exceeds about \$80/MWh. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of an optimal sigmoidal rate-level
   function that is a part of many models of the peripheral auditory
   system. The optimization makes use of a set of criteria defined on the
   basis of physical attributes of the input sound that are inspired by
   physiological evidence. These criteria attempt to discriminate between a
   degraded speech signal and noise to preserve the maximum information in
   the linear region of the sigmoidal curve, and to minimize the effects of
   distortion in the saturating regions. The performance of the proposed
   approach is validated by text-independent speaker-verification
   experiments with signals corrupted by additive noise at different SNRs.
   Experimental results suggest that the approach presented in combination
   with CVN can lead to relative reductions in EER as great as 30\% when
   compared with the use of baseline MFCC coefficients for some SNRs.}},

   present a model for the dynamics of network diffusion similar to state
   update of a linear time-varying system. Based on this model, we provide
   a sufficient condition for observability of the network, i.e., we
   establish when is the partial information available to us sufficient to
   uniquely localize the source. Also, we connect the problem of finding
   the smallest subset of observed nodes to the problem of metric basis of
   the graph. We then present different methods to perform source
   localization depending on network observability.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional correlation filters are designed and implemented via the
   frequency domain, where the correlation of two signals may be computed
   efficiently. However, when the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of
   length N is used, multiplication in the frequency domain results in an
   N-point circular correlation, rather than a linear correlation. The
   resulting correlation filter output is therefore corrupted by the
   aliasing effects of circular correlation. One solution is to design and
   implement the correlation filter directly in the space domain. However,
   this is more computationally intense. Recent literature has discussed
   ways in which to minimize circular correlation effects, but the effects
   are not completely removed. We propose a new frequency domain method for
   completely eliminating circular correlation effects when designing
   correlation filters. We demonstrate this idea with the well-known
   minimum average correlation energy (MACE) filter and show how the
   reformulated MACE filter in the frequency domain outperforms the
   original formulation of the MACE filter.}},

Abstract = {{In this demonstration, we show an energy measurement system that
   estimates the energy consumption of individual appliances using a
   wireless sensor network consisting of contactless electromagnetic field
   (EMF) sensors deployed near each appliance, and a whole-house power
   meter {[}1]. The EMF sensor can detect appliance state transitions
   within close proximity based on magnetic field fluctuations. Data from
   these sensors are then relayed back to the main meter using a
   low-latency wireless sensor networking protocol, where changes in the
   total power consumption of the house are used to determine the power
   usage of individual appliances. The sensors are low-cost, easy to deploy
   and are able to detect current changes associated with the appliance
   from a few inches away making it possible to externally monitor in-wall
   wiring to devices like overhead lights or heavy machinery that might
   operate on multiple phases of the AC distribution system of the
   building. Appliance-level energy data provide continuous feedback to end
   users about their consumption patterns and provide building managers

Abstract = {{Despite some progress in increasing the numbers of women and minorities
   in engineering over the past 30 years, their full participation in the
   discipline has yet to be achieved, particularly in engineering academia.
   One cause is the ``leaky pipeline{''}; even after women and minorities
   choose to major in engineering, they drop out at rates higher than their
   counterparts along all career stages (undergraduate school, graduate
   school, tenure-track, etc.). Their small numbers creates isolation that
   has the unfortunate risks of struggle, less professional success, less
   sense of personal belonging, and less retention. Our hypothesis is that
   building a community that provides networking and support, opportunities
   for collaboration, and professional development, will lead to greater
   career success, personal fulfillment and professional happiness,
   retention, and greater participation/contribution from women and
   minorities. The authors have been conducting a series of workshops aimed
   at broadening participation of women and other minorities within the
   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Design Engineering
   Division (DED). This paper reports on the activities and results of the
   workshop series. Pre-workshop survey data indicated a clear opportunity
   to address the unmet needs of underrepresented groups in the ASME DED.
   Post-workshop survey data showed success in attendee satisfaction with
   feelings of inclusion and community, professional skill building, and
   the prospect of future workshops held by the committee. A follow-up
   impact assessment survey showed that the workshops have led to greater
   participation in DED activities, new positive connections within the DED
   community, and positive feelings regarding their
   communication/collaboration abilities, self confidence, level of
   comfort, feelings of inclusion, professional goals, leadership
   abilities, and skill sets. While these results are encouraging, the
   committee feels strongly that greater success in broadening the
   participation of underrepresented groups in engineering would be
   possible by sharing our strategies and successes, and learning from
   others with similar experience creating communities within the many
   engineering disciplines represented in ASEE.}},

Abstract = {{Domain names drive the ubiquitous use of the Internet. Criminals and
   adversaries also use domain names for their enterprise. Defenders
   compete to remove or block such malicious domains. This is a complicated
   space on the Internet to measure comprehensively, as the malicious
   actors attempt to hide, the defenders do not like to share data or
   methods, and what data is public is not consistently formatted. This
   paper derives an ad hoc model of this competition on large,
   decentralized networks using a modification of Lanchester's equations
   for combat. The model is applied to what is known of the current state
   of malicious domain activity on the Internet. The model aligns with
   currently published research, and provides a more comprehensive
   description of possible strategies and limitations based on the general
   dynamics of the model.
   When taken with the economic realities and physical laws to which the
   Internet is bound, the model demonstrates that the current approach to
   removing malicious domain names is unsustainable and destined for
   obsolescence. However, there are technical, policy, and legal
   modifications to the current approach that would be effective, such as
   preemptively populating watch lists, limits on a registrant's
   registrations, and international cooperation. The results indicate that
   the defenders should not expect to eliminate or significantly reduce
   malicious domain name usage without employing new digital tactics and
   deploying new rules in the physical world.}},

Abstract = {{Indicator expansion is a process of using one or more data sources to
   obtain more indicators of malicious activity by identifying those
   related to currently known indicators. Due to the many variables in how
   the process is carried out, it quickly becomes difficult to capture the
   process that leads to an expanded set of data. Keeping track of this
   process is important for description to other analysts. A compact
   description of the process is even necessary just for the analysts doing
   the work to keep track of their own process and which paths have been
   investigated, particularly in naming files.
   This paper proposes a method of succinctly capturing the process of
   indicator expansion in a deterministic yet flexible and extensible
   manner. The target audience is analysts and investigators engaged in
   indicator expansion or directly consuming results therefrom.}},

Abstract = {{Current mobile applications treat the end-user device as a ``thin
   client,{''} with all of the heavy computations being offloaded to an
   infrastructure cloud. However, the computational capabilities of mobile
   devices are constantly improving, and it is worthwhile considering
   whether an edge-cloud that consists purely of mobile devices (operating
   effectively as `` thick clients{''}) can perform as well as, or even
   better than, an infrastructure cloud. In this paper, we study the
   trade-offs between offloading computation to an infrastructure cloud
   versus retaining the computation within a mobile edge-cloud. To this
   end, we develop and run two classes of applications on both types of
   clouds, and we analyze the performance of the two clouds in terms of the
   time taken to run the application, along with the total amount of
   battery power consumed in both cases. Our results indicate that there
   are indeed classes of applications where an edge-cloud can outperform an
   infrastructure cloud in terms of both latency and battery power.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile phones are a ubiquitous and preferred communication,
   entertainment, and information access platform. Smartphones may provide
   an opportunity to better assess mood and behavior and to provide
   intervention timely, economical, rapid and effective intervention for
   those with mental disorders. This is an important target because
   behavioral health problems are associated with many of the medical
   disorders most responsible for morbidity and cost. Today, psychiatrists
   seek for various channels of mobile technology that can reduce
   evaluation costs and increase accuracy and also facilitate ubiquitous
   longitudinal monitoring of treatment and outcome measures on patients'
   smartphone. Facial expression recognition is one of the active research
   areas in the field of psychiatry to evaluate a patient's emotional
   health. Smartphone technology for recognizing facial expression of
   emotions is still emerging and offers an open platform for the research
   areas such as ubiquitous intelligence and computing. In this research,
   we present a framework to track user's emotional engagement to videos
   played on a smartphone. The presented framework processes user's video
   recorded from the front-facing camera of a smartphone and tracks facial
   features to detect joyful durations induced by the played videos. We
   also conducted subject studies on healthy individuals to evaluate the
   applied approach of emotional engagement. We believe that the presented
   results are promising and present a valuable insight to build ubiquitous
   intelligent systems that can help various areas of psychiatric research.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke leads to severe mobility impairments for millions of individuals
   each year. Functional outcomes can be improved through manual treadmill
   therapy, but high costs limit patient exposure and, thereby, outcomes.
   Robotic gait training could increase the viable duration and frequency
   of training sessions, but robotic approaches employed thus far have been
   less effective than manual therapy. These shortcomings may relate to
   subconscious energy-minimizing drives, which might cause patients to
   engage less actively in therapy when provided with corrective robotic
   assistance. We have devised a new method for gait rehabilitation that
   harnesses, rather than fights, least-effort tendencies. Therapeutic
   goals, such as increased use of the paretic limb, are made easier than
   the patient's nominal gait through selective assistance from a robotic
   platform. We performed a pilot test on a healthy subject (N = 1) in
   which altered self-selected stride length was induced using a tethered
   robotic ankle-foot orthosis. The subject first walked on a treadmill
   while wearing the orthosis with and without assistance at unaltered and
   voluntarily altered stride length. Voluntarily increasing stride length
   by 5\% increased metabolic energy cost by 4\%. Robotic assistance
   decreased energy cost at both unaltered and voluntarily increased stride
   lengths, by 6\% and 8\% respectively. We then performed a test in which
   the robotic system continually monitored stride length and provided more
   assistance if the subject's stride length approached a target increase.
   This adaptive assistance protocol caused the subject to slowly adjust
   their gait patterns towards the target, leading to a 4\% increase in
   stride length. Metabolic energy consumption was simultaneously reduced
   by 5\%. These results suggest that selective-assistance protocols based
   on targets relevant to rehabilitation might lead patients to selfselect
   desirable gait patterns during robotic gait training sessions, possibly
   facilitating better adherence and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Unilateral, below-knee amputation is associated with an increased risk
   of falls, which may be partially related to a loss of active ankle
   control. If ankle control can contribute significantly to maintaining
   balance, even in the presence of active foot placement, this might
   provide an opportunity to improve balance using robotic ankle-foot
   prostheses. We investigated ankle-and hip-based walking stabilization
   methods in a three-dimensional model of human gait that included ankle
   plantar-flexion, ankle inversion-eversion, hip flexion-extension, and
   hip ad/abduction. We generated discrete feedback control laws (linear
   quadratic regulators) that altered nominal actuation parameters once per
   step. We used ankle push-off, lateral ankle stiffness and damping,
   fore-aft foot placement, lateral foot placement, or all of these as
   control inputs. We modeled environmental disturbances as random,
   bounded, unexpected changes in floor height, and defined balance
   performance as the maximum allowable disturbance value for which the
   model walked 500 steps without falling. Nominal walking motions were
   unstable, but were stabilized by all of the step-to-step control laws we
   tested. Surprisingly, step-by-step modulation of ankle push-off alone
   led to better balance performance (3.2\% leg length) than lateral foot
   placement (1.2\% leg length) for these control laws. These results
   suggest that appropriate control of robotic ankle-foot prosthesis
   push-off could make balancing during walking easier for individuals with
   amputation.}},

Abstract = {{As NAND flash memory continues to scale down to smaller process
   technolop nodes, its reliability and endurance are degrading. One
   important source of reduced reliability is the phenomenon of program
   interference: when a flash cell is programmed to a value, the
   programming operation affects the threshold voltage of not only that
   cell, but also the other cells surrounding it. This interference
   potentially causes a surrounding cell to move to a logical state (i.e.,
   a threshold voltage range) that is different from its original state,
   leading to an error when the cell is read. Understanding,
   characterizing, and modeling of program interference, i.e., how much the
   threshold voltage of a cell shifts when another cell is programmed, can
   enable the design of mechanisms that can effectively and efficiently
   predict and/or tolerate such errors.
   In this paper, we provide the first experimental characterization of and
   a realistic model for program interference in modern MLC NAND flash
   memory. To this end, we utilize the read-retry mechanism present in some
   state-of-the-art 2Y-nm (i.e., 20-24nm) flash chips to measure the
   changes in threshold voltage distributions of cells when a particular
   cell is programmed. Our results show that the amount of program
   interference received by a cell depends on 1) the location of the
   programmed cells, 2) the order in which cells are programmed, and 3) the
   data values of the cell that is being programmed as well as the cells
   surrounding it. Based on our experimental characterization, we develop a
   new model that predicts the amount of program interference as a function
   of threshold voltage values and changes in neighboring cells. We devise
   and evaluate one application of this model that adjusts the read
   reference voltage to the predicted threshold voltage distribution with
   the goal of minimizing erroneous reads. Our analysis shows that this new
   technique can reduce the raw flash bit error rate by 64\% and thereby
   improve flash lifetime by 300\%. We hope that the understanding and
   models developed in this paper lead to other error tolerance mechanisms
   for future flash memories.}},

   where, through introducing a deterministic event-triggering mechanism,
   the Gaussian property of the innovation process is destroyed which
   produces a challenging nonlinear filtering problem that cannot be solved
   unless approximation techniques are adopted. The proposed stochastic
   event-triggered sensor schedules eliminate such approximations. Under
   these two schedules, the MMSE estimator and its estimation error
   covariance matrix at the remote estimator are given in a closed-form.
   Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed schedules have better

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with learning in largescale multi-agent games.
   The empirical centroid fictitious play (ECFP) algorithm is a variant of
   the well-known fictitious play algorithm that is practical and
   computationally tractable in largescale games. ECFP has been shown to be
   an effective tool in learning consensus equilibria (a subset of the Nash
   equilibria) in certain games. However, the behavior of ECFP has only
   been characterized in terms of convergence of the networked-average
   empirical frequencies as opposed to the more traditional notion of
   learning mixed equilibria, namely the notion of convergence of
   individual empirical frequencies. The behavior of ECFP in terms of
   convergence in empirical frequencies is herein studied and the
   equilibrium concept of mean-centric equilibrium (MCE) is introduced. The
   concept of MCE is similar in spirit to that of Nash equilibrium (NE)
   but, in MCE each player is at equilibrium with respect to a centroid
   representing the aggregate behavior, as opposed to NE where players are
   at equilibrium with respect to the strategies of individual opponents.
   The MCE concept is well suited to large scale games where it is
   reflective of the fact that in many large scale games of interest,
   utilities are greatly affected by changes in the aggregate behavior but
   less susceptible to changes in the strategy of a particular opposing
   player. MCE is also well suited to large-scale games in that it can be
   learned using practical, low-information-overhead behavior rules (e.g.
   ECFP).}},

   node in the network has a function, and the goal is to find a vector x
   is an element of R-n that minimizes the sum of all the functions. We
   assume that each function depends on a set of components of x, not
   necessarily on all of them. This creates additional structure in the
   problem, which can be captured by the classification scheme we develop.
   This scheme not only to enables us to design an algorithm that solves
   very general distributed optimization problems, but also allows us to
   categorize prior algorithms and applications. Our general-purpose
   algorithm shows a performance superior to prior algorithms, including
   algorithms that are application-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstructing compressed sensing signals involves solving an
   optimization problem. An example is Basis Pursuit (BP) {[}1], which is
   applicable only in noise- free scenarios. In noisy scenarios, either the
   Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPDN) {[}1] or the Noise- Aware BP (NABP) {[}2]
   can be used. Consider a distributed scenario where the dictionary matrix
   and the vector of observations are spread over the nodes of a network.
   We solve the following open problem: design distributed algorithms that
   solve BPDN with a column partition, i.e., when each node knows only some
   columns of the dictionary matrix, and that solve NABP with a row
   partition, i.e., when each node knows only some rows of the dictionary
   matrix and the corresponding observations. Our approach manipulates
   these problems so that a recent general-purpose algorithm for
   distributed optimization can be applied.}},

   between these two parts. The optimal redundancy allocation will be
   investigated using simulations and the simulation results show that the
   PLBC can significantly reduce the probability of decoding failure in

   probability of decoding failure of PLBC and estimate the optimal
   redundancy allocation using this upper bound. The estimated redundancy
   allocation matches the optimal redundancy allocation well.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrid operation schemes have evolved dramatically because of the
   recent changes in electrical networks. Coupled with Smart Grid concepts,
   microgrids are required to be more intelligent and establish
   communication with its components. In order to support reliable and
   sustainable power delivery amidst rising deployments of Distributed
   Generations (DGs), the existing protection schemes have to be replaced
   with the next generation dynamic ones. At any point in time, microgrid
   may disconnect from the utility grid and continue its operation under
   islanding conditions. Furthermore, some microgrids may have changing
   topology with alternative paths due to time-varying nature of both power
   generation and consumption in the system. To address the above
   challenges, in this paper the authors propose an adaptive microgrid
   protection scheme that utilizes the benefits of bi-directional
   communication capability of the Smart Grid. A wide-area wireless
   communications network based on WiMAX technology has been used as a
   proof of concept for proposed microgrid protection scheme. Simulations
   were conducted using OPNET and the initial results indicate that a WiMAX
   network meets the latency requirement of the proposed microgrid
   protection scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Backscatter radio frequency (RF) tags and radio frequency identification
   (RFID) tags can be used to create wireless sensors that do not require a
   battery by using the tag antenna's electrical load as a transducer. This
   paper presents such a backscatter sensor system operating in the 5.8 GHz
   unlicensed frequency band that wirelessly senses distance (i.e.,
   displacement) between one and five millimeters. The system senses the
   variable impedance of a covered, open-circuit microstrip line and uses
   two fixed antenna load impedances to remove the effects of the radio
   channel. The primary contribution of this paper is a demonstration of
   the wireless sensing system in which the binary position of a human
   finger (e.g., ``bent{''} or ``straight{''}) is measured using a passive
   transducer for wireless human-computer-interaction (HCI) applications.}},

Abstract = {{GPS technology has made outdoor navigation ubiquitous and has led to
   consumers salivating at the idea of importing this capability indoors.
   Unfortunately, GPS is not reliable indoors. This presentation will
   discuss how multiple sensors of different modalities can be combined to
   achieve precise personal navigation over long periods of time. Our
   system is built with inertial sensing at its core as navigation signals
   from such sensors are inherently secure against tampering compared to
   WiFi or cellular radio fingerprinting. To overcome the accuracy
   challenges of inertial navigation, we first expand on a well known
   technique called zero velocity updates during the stance phase of
   walking with a pseudo-measurement that detects small, non-zero
   velocities from statistical analysis of the stance phase. While this
   reduces the time dependence of computed position error from cubic to
   linear, it is not effective in reducing heading gyro drift. So,
   secondly, we introduce the measurements of range between shoes using
   both ultrasonic and radio frequency sensors to enable observability of
   the heading gyro biases. Integrating the data from the velocity sensing,
   range sensing and inertial sensing leads to positioning accuracy of less
   than 3 m after 2 hours of a combination of sitting and walking.}},

Abstract = {{The adequate operation of IPTV distribution networks heavily relies on
   the effective maintenance and management of their underlay DSL
   infrastructure. New hardware and software is required in order to
   improve monitoring capabilities and to directly diagnose anomalies that
   other segments of the DSL network cannot identify. In this work we
   initially compare the accuracy performance of SVM-specific formulations
   for constructing a robust ground truth within our classification
   procedure regarding abnormalities issued at anomaly-aware Digital
   Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) of the DSL infrastructure.
   Moreover, we consider the pragmatic cost of repairing anomalies that
   were misclassified and characterize each classifier according to the
   overall cost that is possible to incur to the network operator. In
   parallel, this work attempts to practically improve the network-wide
   anomaly classification performance by proposing a semi-supervised
   classification scheme that updates the initial supervised scheme by
   testing unlabelled anomalies occurring at anomaly-unaware DSLAMs.}},

Abstract = {{A new technology known as Virtual Traffic Lights (VTL) was recently
   proposed as a self-organizing new paradigm for traffic management. This
   new technology uses the vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) communications as its
   premise. VTL can revolutionize traffic management in urban areas as it
   can substantially reduce commute time of urban workers, increase
   productivity, and lead to a greener environment. In a VTL environment,
   vehicles self-organize to elect a leader which serves as a virtual
   traffic light to decide the right of way at that intersection, thus
   replacing the current physical traffic lights. Implementing VTL
   technology with partial penetration, however, is an outstanding issue
   that needs to be addressed. This paper addresses this issue by proposing
   a co-existence model whereby VTL equipped vehicles can co-exist with
   vehicles that do not have VTL. Simulation results show that the
   transition model proposed here could provide drivers with strong
   incentives to adopt the VTL technology.}},

   implementation of artificial neurons and synapses. We demonstrate and
   elaborate on our building blocks for artificial neurons and synapses

   on a single device enables a compact DAC (digital-to-analog converter)
   for programming artificial synapses and a simple-yet-efficient means for
   implementing artificial neurons. We also show the functionality of our
   proposed circuits using two pattern recognition examples based on
   compact circuit simulation models for ovenized AlN resonators. The
   resonator device models are characterized from measurement data.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its brain-like parallel processing, neurocomputing has been
   regarded as intriguing alternative to traditional von Neumann
   architectures for such applications as image processing, pattern
   recognition, and associative memory. Associative memories based on
   neurocomputing attempt to mimic the human brain via a parallel network
   of coupled artificial neurons. Oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) have
   been proposed for such purposes; however, CMOS-based implementations
   would be inefficient due to the corresponding circuit complexity of
   oscillators and phase-locking mechanisms. In addition, programmability
   of the synaptic weights would require numerous reconfigurable, complex
   analog circuits that represent an impractical power and area overhead.
   In this paper we propose a fully-digital ONN architecture that is
   enabled by non-volatile logic. Using a newly proposed all-magnetic logic
   family, mLogic, we demonstrate the efficacy of digitizing the
   oscillators and phase relationships by exploiting the inherent storage.
   We perform a device-level simulation-based comparison of mLogic and 32nm
   CMOS for a fully-interconnected 60-neuron system, and show approximately
   15x area improvement and 18x power improvement that would be achieved
   for a large system with 100k neurons.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new Laterally Vibrating Resonator (LVR) based on
   Y-cut ion-sliced Lithium Niobate (LN) thin films on silicon dioxide
   (SiO2). In this work, the LN LVR is built on top of a SiO2 layer and
   released from the underlying silicon wafer by dry etching in XeF2. For a
   given sample having a LN layer thickness of 420 nm and SiO2 thickness of
   1600 nm, this first demonstration yielded resonators with temperature
   coefficient of frequency (TCF) of + 17 ppm/degrees C, and + 18
   ppm/degrees C for devices vibrating at 500 MHz, respectively oriented at
   10 degrees and 30 degrees to the x-axis, and TCF of + 24.1 ppm/degrees
   C, and + 27.7 ppm/degrees C for devices vibrating at 750 MHz,
   respectively oriented at 40 degrees and 50 degrees to the x-axis. The
   positive TCF clearly indicates the effect of the SiO2, matches with
   finite element method simulations and non-linear analysis, and offers
   evidence that TCF engineering is possible. Most importantly, these LN
   LVRs still exhibited high values of electromechanical coupling, kt(2),
   around 9\% at 723.7 MHz, and Q in excess of 1,320 in air at 419.3 MHz.
   By optimizing the relative values of the LN and SiO2 thickness it is
   ultimately possible to attain devices with zero first order TCF.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturized, multi-band and high frequency oscillators that are
   compatible with CMOS processes are highly desirable for the synthesis of
   compact, stable, and low power frequency sources for reconfigurable
   radio frequency communication systems and cognitive radios. Aluminum
   nitride (AlN) contour mode MEMS resonators (CMR) are emerging devices
   capable of high Q, low impedance, and multi-frequency operation on a
   single chip. The frequency stability of these AlN MEMS devices is of
   primary importance in delivering oscillators that exhibit low phase
   noise, and low sensitivity to temperature and acceleration. In this
   article we describe how the resonator dynamics impacts oscillator
   performance and present some preliminary demonstrations of
   ultra-high-frequency (UHF) oscillators. An example of an oscillator
   prototype we synthesized with a 586 MHz AlN CMR exhibited phase noise <
   -91 dBc/Hz and -160 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and 10 MHz offsets, temperature
   stability of 2 ppm from -20 to + 85 degrees C, and acceleration

Abstract = {{A secure two-party computation (S2PC) protocol allows two parties to
   compute over their combined private inputs, as if intermediated by a
   trusted third party. In the malicious model, this can be achieved with a
   cut-and-choose of garbled circuits (C\&C-GCs), where some GCs are
   verified for correctness and the remaining are evaluated to determine
   the circuit output. This paper presents a new C\&C-GCs-based S2PC
   protocol, with significant advantages in efficiency and applicability.
   First, in contrast with prior protocols that require a majority of
   evaluated GCs to be correct, the new protocol only requires that at
   least one evaluated GC is correct. In practice this reduces the total
   number of GCs to approximately one third, for the same statistical
   security goal. This is accomplished by augmenting the C\&C with a new
   forge-and-lose technique based on bit commitments with trapdoor. Second,
   the output of the new protocol includes reusable XOR-homomorphic bit
   commitments of all circuit input and output bits, thereby enabling
   efficient linkage of several S2PCs in a reactive manner. The protocol
   has additional interesting characteristics (which may allow new
   comparison tradeoffs), such as needing a low number of exponentiations,
   using a 2-out-of-1 type of oblivious transfer, and using the C\&C
   structure to statistically verify the consistency of input wire keys.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving high reliability across environmental variations and over
   aging in physical unclonable functions (PUFs) remains a challenge for
   PUF designers. The conventional method to improve PUF reliability is to
   use powerful error correction codes (ECC) to correct the errors in the
   raw response from the PUF core. Unfortunately, these ECC blocks
   generally have high VLSI overheads, which scale up quickly with the
   error correction capability. Alternately, researchers have proposed
   techniques to increase the reliability of the PUF core, and thus
   significantly reduce the required strength (and complexity) of the ECC.
   One method of increasing the reliability of the PUF core is to use
   normally detrimental IC aging effects to reinforce the desired (or
   ``golden{''}) response of the PUF by altering the PUF circuit
   characteristics permanently and hence making the PUF more reliable. In
   this work, we present a PUF response reinforcement technique based on
   hot carrier injection (HCI) which can reinforce the PUF golden response
   in short stress times (i.e., tens of seconds), without impacting the
   surrounding circuits, and that has high permanence (i.e., does not
   degrade significantly over aging). We present a self-contained
   HCI-reinforcement-enabled PUF circuit based on sense amplifiers (SA)
   which autonomously self-reinforces with minimal external intervention.
   We have fabricated a custom ASIC testchip in 65nm bulk CMOS with the
   proposed PUF design. Measured results show high reliability across
   environmental variations and accelerated aging, as well as good
   uniqueness and randomness. For example, 1600 SA elements, after being
   HCI stressed for 125s, show 100\% reliability (zero errors) across +/-
   20\% voltage variations a temperature range of -20 degrees C to 85
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{As engineers design ever more complex systems, such as
   bionanotechnology, it is particularly difficult for engineers to
   navigate the influences of parameters to design across multiple scales.
   We introduce a software tool that contains graphical interface modules
   that display multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously in real-time,
   across multiple scales of interest. To assess the utility of real-time
   feedback in the tool, the tool is validated through user studies
   involving counterbalanced sequences of optimization tasks with varying
   complexity and either real-time or delayed feedback. Real-time feedback
   consistently improved a user's ability to find better designs and the
   benefit increased as task complexity grew. Our scientific contribution
   is a greater understanding of how users search and understand complex
   design spaces. Users in the real-time condition were made fewer changes
   to designs each iteration and identifying such strategies could inform
   agent-based algorithms. Findings aid complex systems applications
   including virtual experiments, reverse engineering, and scientific
   discovery.}},

Title = {{Diffusion MRI connectometry automatically reveals affected fiber
   pathways in individuals with chronic stroke}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{912-921}},
Abstract = {{Building a human connectome database has recently attracted the
   attention of many researchers, although its application to individual
   subjects has yet to be explored. In this study, we acquired diffusion
   spectrum imaging of 90 subjects and showed that this dataset can be used
   as a norm to examine pathways with deviant connectivity in individuals.
   This analytical approach, termed diffusion MRI connectometry, was
   realized by reconstructing patient data to a common stereotaxic space
   and calculating the percentile rank of the diffusion quantities with
   respect to those of the norm. The affected tracks were constructed with
   deterministic tractography using the local tract orientations with
   substantially low percentile ranks as seeds. To demonstrate the
   performance of the connectometry, we applied it to 7 patients with
   chronic stroke and compared the results with lesions shown on
   T-2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and
   fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, as well as clinical manifestations. The
   results showed that the affected tracks revealed by the connectometry
   corresponded well with the stroke lesions shown on T-2-weighted images.
   Moreover, while the T-2-weighted images, as well as the ADC and FA maps,
   showed only the stroke lesions, connectometry revealed entire affected
   tracks, a feature that is potentially useful for diagnostic or
   prognostic evaluation. This unique capability may provide personalized
   information regarding the structural connectivity underlying brain
   development, plasticity, or disease in each individual subject. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present a computational model for studying ion transport and reaction
   kinetics within water-filled pores of an ionomer-free, thin film Pt
   cathode inside polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). The model resolves
   the electric double layers (EDLs) at the water vertical bar Pt and
   water| membrane interfaces. We investigate the coupling of the
   distributed electrochemical reactions and the EDL physics, and their
   effect on the overall electrode performance through both the kinetics
   and transport. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is resolved locally along
   the pore wall, where both acidic and alkaline mechanisms are included
   due to a large axial variation in pH along the pore. An important
   finding is the significant contribution of the alkaline mechanism to the
   overall current at high applied potentials and its contribution to the
   ionic conductivity within the water-filled pore.}},

   can have negative effects on fuel cell performance if not properly

   we apply a nonlinear analysis to the PEFC voltage signal. We examine
   scale invariance in the frequency power spectra of the fuel cell voltage
   signal at varying current densities. We also estimate the Hurst exponent
   of the PEFC voltage with a diffusion analysis. We find that both the

   catalyst layer slurry (ink) as the imaged samples were electrochemically
   evaluated in a PEFC. By using the same ink batch in the two imaging
   steps, and in the fuel cell testing and then systematically varying ink
   processing, we have delineated the complex relationships between
   catalyst ink, electrode structure, and PEFC performance. At the higher
   current densities, we found that the electrode comprising smaller

   casting SiO2/Nafion composite ionomer onto a porous polycarbonate
   template. A thin film of Pt was vacuum deposited directly on the surface
   of the nanofibers to form the electrode. Two different electrodes were
   fabricated: one with Pt sputtered onto the template before casting and
   the other with a non-sputtered template. Sputtered template electrode
   outperformed the non-sputtered template electrode. The structural and

Abstract = {{The two important constitutive relations needed for the study of flow

   are ignored, are the stress tensor and the heat flux vector. Massoudi
   {[}1, 2] derived a constitutive model that reflects the dependence of
   the heat flux vector on the temperature gradient, the density gradient
   and the velocity gradient, in an appropriate frame-invariant
   formulation. In this paper we use a simplified version of this model and
   consider the one dimensional fully developed flow of granular materials
   down a heated inclined plane, subject to a constant temperature boundary
   condition. The equations are made dimensionless and a parametric study
   is performed in order to examine the effects of the additional
   parameters on the heat flux vector. The derived governing equations are
   coupled non-linear second order ordinary differential equations which
   are solved numerically and the results are shown for the temperature,

   fluid dynamics technique and a computational structural dynamics
   technique, is employed to design a deformable foil of which kinematics
   is inspired by the propulsive motion of a fin or a tail of fish and
   cetacean. The unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
   using a second-order accurate finite-difference method and an
   immersed-boundary method to effectively impose boundary conditions on
   complex moving boundaries. A finite-element-based structural dynamics
   solver is employed to compute the deformation of the foil due to
   interaction with fluid. A phase angle between pitching and heaving
   motions as well as the flexibility of the foil, which is represented by
   the Youngs modulus are varied to find out how these factors affect the
   propulsion efficiency.}},

Title = {{Nanofiber Biomaterials}},
Booktitle = {{SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{977-1010}},
Abstract = {{Since its inception, the field of tissue engineering has sought to
   rebuild the complexity of normal tissues by seeding cells onto scaffolds
   to support the formation of new tissue. Recently, nanofibers have gained
   increasing attention because these biomaterials have unique properties
   and are able to interface with cells at the same scale as native
   extracellular matrix fibrils. New fabrication technologies provide novel
   ways to control the nanoscale structure and properties of biomaterials,
   which is advantageous in the engineering of tissues for in vitro study
   and in vivo applications in regenerative medicine. This chapter explores
   the properties of nanofiber biomaterials (diameters < 500 nm) and
   examines the specific advantages relative to other scaffold materials.
   This includes nanofibers from biopolymers as well as synthetic polymers,
   with consideration of relative advantages and disadvantages. A range of
   fabrication strategies is discussed that span from fiber spinning
   techniques, to phase separation in bulk, to directed and self-assembly.
   Insight is provided as to how synthetic polymers and biopolymers are
   used to make these nanofibers and the specific molecular structures that
   impart the unique mechanical, electrical, chemical, and biological
   properties. Analysis of these nanofiber biomaterials requires
   characterization techniques that are able to probe at the nanometer,
   micrometer, and macroscales. Examples are provided using optical
   microscopy, electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, mechanical
   characterization, and assessment of biocompatibility and biodegradation.
   Finally, nanofiber biomaterials have wide applications in tissue
   engineering; here we focus on representative examples in cardiac,
   musculoskeletal, ophthalmic, and neural tissue engineering.}},

Journal = {{OPTIMIZATION METHODS \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{364-378}},
Abstract = {{The travelling salesman problem (TSP) with neighbourhoods extends the
   TSP to the case where each vertex of the tour is allowed to move in a
   given region. This NP-hard optimization problem has recently received
   increasing attention in several technical fields such as robotics,
   unmanned aerial vehicles, or utility management. In this paper, the
   problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programme
   (MINLP) having the property that fixing all the integer variables to any
   integer values yield a convex nonlinear programme. This property is used
   to modify the global MINLP optimizer COUENNE, improving by orders of
   magnitude its performance and allowing the exact solution of instances
   large enough to be useful in applications. Computational results are
   presented where neighbourhoods are either polyhedra or ellipsoids in R-2
   or R-3 and with the Euclidean norm as distance metric.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a laser Doppler vibrometry-based methodology for
   measurement of axial and radial error motions when using miniature
   ultra-high-speed (UHS) spindles used for micromachining applications.
   The new methodology measures three-dimensional displacements from the
   surface of a custom-fabricated sphere-on-stem precision artifact using
   three mutually orthogonal laser beams. A precision alignment technique
   is developed to configure the three laser beams mutually orthogonal to
   one another. An infra-red sensor is used to provide a reference for the
   rotational angle of the spindle. The axial and radial motion data
   measured at operational speeds is then post-processed to obtain the
   synchronous and asynchronous components of the error motions in both
   directions. The presented approach enables obtaining error motions along
   both fixed-sensitive and rotating-sensitive directions. The methodology
   is then demonstrated by measuring axial and radial error motions when
   using a miniature ultra-high-speed spindle at four different speeds.
   Analysis of the measured data indicated the significant effect of
   spindle speed on the error motions along both fixed-sensitive and the
   rotating-sensitive directions. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is
   presented to quantify the overall combined uncertainty on the error
   measurements when using the new methodology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Costs and Benefits of Reducing Fuel Burn and Emissions from Taxiing
   Aircraft: Low-Hanging Fruit?}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2400}},
Pages = {{65-77}},
Abstract = {{While taxiing, aircraft are powered by their main engines. This paper
   estimates the potential reductions in costs and emissions that could be
   achieved with tugs or an electric motor embedded in the landing gear to
   propel aircraft on the ground. The use of tugs would result in the
   avoidance of \$20/ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions if the measure
   were adopted for all domestic flights. Estimates of average net savings
   for airlines vary from \$100 per flight at John E Kennedy International
   Airport in New York City to a loss of \$160 per flight in Honolulu,
   Hawaii. Electric taxiing would save between \$30 and \$240/ton of CO2
   emissions avoided. Either approach could reduce CO2 emissions from
   domestic flights in the United States by about 1.5 million tons each
   year, or about 1.1\% of the total emissions in 2006. If the switch were
   limited to large narrow-body aircraft on domestic service at the busiest
   airports in the United States, the total reduction in emissions would be
   0.5 million tons of CO2 annually, accompanied by savings of \$100/ton.
   Air quality benefits associated with lower main engine use were
   monetized by using the air pollution emission experiments and policy
   model and ranged from more than \$500 per Hight in the New York City
   area to just more than \$20 per flight in the Dallas Fort Worth, Texas,
   area. The analysis also demonstrates that emissions reductions from
   different interventions (e.g., single-engine taxiing and the use of
   tugs) are often not independent of each other and therefore cannot be
   combined in a simple way.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular mechanical forces result in changes in gene expression,
   but it is unclear how cells are able to permanently adapt to new
   mechanical environments because chemical signaling pathways are
   short-lived. We visualize force-induced changes in nuclear rheology to
   examine short- and long-time genome organization and movements. Punctate
   labels in the nuclear interior of HeLa, human umbilical vein
   endothelial, and osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells allow tracking of nuclear
   movements in cells under varying levels of shear and compressive force.
   Under adequate shear stress two distinct regimes develop in cells under
   mechanical stimulation: an initial event of increased intranuclear
   movement followed by a regime of intranuclear movements that reflect the
   dose of applied force. At early times there is a nondirectionally
   oriented response with a small increase in nuclear translocations. After
   30 min, there is a significant increase in nuclear movements, which
   scales with the amount of shear or compressive stress. The similarities
   in the nuclear response to shear and compressive stress suggest that the
   nucleus is a mechanosensitive element within the cell. Thus, applied
   extracellular forces stimulate intranuclear movements, resulting in
   repositioning of nuclear bodies and the associated chromatin within the
   nucleus.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of gas-permeated single-walled carbon nanotube
   (SWCNT) aerogel (8 kg m-3 density, 0.0061 volume fraction) is measured
   experimentally and modeled using mesoscale and atomistic simulations.
   Despite the high thermal conductivity of isolated SWCNTs, the thermal
   conductivity of the evacuated aerogel is 0.025 +/- 0.010 W m-1 K-1 at a
   temperature of 300 K. This very low value is a result of the high
   porosity and the low interface thermal conductance at the tubetube
   junctions (estimated as 12 pW K-1). Thermal conductivity measurements
   and analysis of the gas-permeated aerogel (H2, He, Ne, N2, and Ar) show
   that gas molecules transport energy over length scales hundreds of times
   larger than the diameters of the pores in the aerogel. It is
   hypothesized that inefficient energy exchange between gas molecules and
   SWCNTs gives the permeating molecules a memory of their prior
   collisions. Low gas-SWCNT accommodation coefficients predicted by
   molecular dynamics simulations support this hypothesis. Amplified energy
   transport length scales resulting from low gas accommodation are a
   general feature of CNT-based nanoporous materials.}},

   interference between a propagating spin wave and a background
   magnetization with spatially uniform phase. We use a simple closed-form

Title = {{Mode-splitting and quasi-degeneracies in circular plate vibration
   problems: The example of free vibrations of the stator of a traveling
   wave ultrasonic motor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{331}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{5788-5802}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{In systems with rotational symmetry, bending modes occur in
   doubly-degenerate pairs with two independent vibration modes for each
   repeated natural frequency. In circular plates, the standing waves of
   two such degenerate bending modes can be superposed with a 1/4 period
   separation in time to yield a traveling wave response. This is the
   principle of a traveling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUM), in which a
   traveling bending wave in a stator drives the rotor through a friction
   contact. The stator contains teeth to increase the speed at the contact
   region, and these affect the rotational symmetry of the plate. When
   systems with rotational symmetry are modified either in their geometry,
   or by spatially varying their properties or boundary conditions, some
   mode-pairs split into singlet modes having distinct frequencies. In
   addition, coupling between some pairs of distinct unperturbed modes also
   causes quasi-degeneracies in the perturbed modes, which leads their
   frequency curves to approach and veer away in some regions of the
   parameter space. This paper discusses the effects of tooth geometry on
   the behavior of plate modes under free vibration. It investigates mode
   splitting and quasi-degeneracies and derives analytic expressions to
   predict these phenomena, using variational methods and a degenerate
   perturbation scheme for the solution to the plate's discrete eigenvalue
   problem; these expressions are confirmed by solving the discrete
   eigenvalue problem of the plate with teeth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Modulus to Study Cell Mechanobiology in Muscle and Nerve}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Mechanics is an important component in the regulation of cell shape,
   proliferation, migration and differentiation during normal homeostasis
   and disease states. Biomaterials that match the elastic modulus of soft
   tissues have been effective for studying this cell mechanobiology, but
   improvements are needed in order to investigate a wider range of
   physicochemical properties in a controlled manner. We hypothesized that
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blends could be used as the basis of a
   tunable system where the elastic modulus could be adjusted to match most
   types of soft tissue. To test this we formulated blends of two
   commercially available PDMS types, Sylgard 527 and Sylgard 184, which
   enabled us to fabricate substrates with an elastic modulus anywhere from
   5 kPa up to 1.72 MPa. This is a three order-of-magnitude range of
   tunability, exceeding what is possible with other hydrogel and PDMS
   systems. Uniquely, the elastic modulus can be controlled independently
   of other materials properties including surface roughness, surface
   energy and the ability to functionalize the surface by protein
   adsorption and microcontact printing. For biological validation, PC12
   (neuronal inducible-pheochromocytoma cell line) and C2C12 (muscle cell
   line) were used to demonstrate that these PDMS formulations support cell
   attachment and growth and that these substrates can be used to probe the
   mechanosensitivity of various cellular processes including neurite
   extension and muscle differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular bottlebrushes with hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) or
   polystyrene and hydrophilic poly(di(ethylene glycol) ethyl ether
   acrylate)) side chains were successfully synthesized by grafting from a
   poly(2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)ethyl methacrylate) macroinitiator using
   iron-based atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Iron(II)
   bromide, iron(III) bromide, and tetrabutylammonium bromide catalyst was
   employed for an ATRP grafting-from reaction, resulting in brush
   macromolecules with a narrow molecular weight distribution (M-w/M-n =
   1.18-1.28). Molecular weights measured by multiangle laser light
   scattering correlates well with the theoretical values for all
   bottlebrushes. Imaging of individual bottlebrushes by atomic force
   microscopy exhibited a wormlike conformation. Initiation efficiencies
   were calculated by cleaving the side chains by alcoholysis and then
   injecting to gel permeation chromatography. The initiation efficiencies
   were ca. 80-95\%, showing relatively high values for a grafting from
   polymerization with an iron catalyst. These results indicate that
   iron-catalyzed ATRP allows well-controlled polymerization even when
   targeting dense grafting from procedures. The 0.1\% (w/w) of
   water-soluble molecular bottlebrushes with poly(di(ethylene glycol)
   ethyl ether acrylate)) side chains displayed a lower critical solution
   temperature behavior in distilled water, and the average particle size
   started to increase above 8 degrees C due to intermolecular aggregation
   of the bottlebrushes. The slight decrease of the size in highly diluted
   solution (0.005\% w/w) of the bottlebrush was observed as the
   temperature was increased, suggesting that intramolecular collapse of

Abstract = {{We develop a metric to quantify the sub-hourly variability cost of
   individual wind plants and show its use in valuing reductions in wind
   power variability. Our method partitions wind energy into hourly and
   sub-hourly components and uses corresponding market prices to determine
   variability costs. We use publically available 15-min ERCOT data,
   although the method developed can be applied to higher time resolution
   data if available. We do not estimate uncertainty costs though our
   metric can separate integration costs into variability and uncertainty
   components. The mean variability costs arising from 15-min to 1-h
   variations (termed load following) for 20 ERCOT wind plants was \$8.73
   +/- \$1.26 per MWh in 2008 and \$3.90 +/- \$0.52 per MWh in 2009. Load
   following variability costs decrease as capacity factors increase,
   indicating wind plants sited in locations with good wind resources cost
   a system less to integrate. Twenty interconnected wind plants had a
   variability cost of \$4.35 per MWh in 2008. The marginal benefit of
   interconnecting another wind plant diminishes rapidly: it is less than
   \$3.43 per MWh for systems with 2 wind plants already interconnected,
   less than \$0.7 per MWh for 4-7 wind plants, and less than \$0.2 per MWh
   for 8 or more wind plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
   Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Mandatory Reporting Program (GHGRP) is designed to
   collect accurate and timely facility-level emissions data that might be
   used by policy makers to support sound climate policy decisions in the
   future. After reviewing the US Inventory and the expected improvements
   under GHGRP, we find that the benefits of GHGRP are minimal and quite
   possibly zero while the cost of implementation is relatively high, that
   the stated goal of reducing emissions uncertainty is not met by the
   program in its current form, and that the additional emissions data to
   be collected is likely not needed given the ongoing non-committal
   environment of US GHG regulation. Our review also highlights the need
   for EPA to make its US Inventory GHG models accessible to the public,
   which would enable a more thorough review of its assumptions and methods
   by the broader scientific community. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   for Vibration Control}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{A novel vibration control method utilizing magnetically mounted
   piezoelectric elements is described. Piezoelectric elements are bonded
   to permanent magnets, termed here as control mounts, which are attached
   to the surface of a steel beam through their magnetic attraction. The
   magnetic-piezoelectric control mounts are an alternative to traditional
   epoxy attachment methods for piezoelectric elements which allows for
   easy in-the-field reconfiguration. In model and laboratory measurements,
   the beam is driven through base excitation and the resonant shunt
   technique is utilized to demonstrate the attenuation characteristics of
   two magnetic-piezoelectric control mounts. The coupled system is
   discretized using a Galerkin finite element model that incorporates the
   tangential and vertical contact stiffnesses of the beam-magnet
   interface. The vibration reduction provided by the control mounts using
   a single magnet are compared to those designed with a magnetic array
   that alternates the magnetic dipoles along the length of the mount. Even
   though each design uses the same magnet thickness, the alternating
   magnetic configuration's interfacial contact stiffness is over 1.5 and 4
   times larger in the tangential and vertical directions, respectively,
   than that of the single magnet, resulting in increased vibration
   reduction. Measured and simulated results show that the
   magnetic-piezoelectric control mounts reduced the beam's tip velocity by
   as much as 3.0 dB and 3.1 dB, respectively. The design tradeoffs that
   occur when replacing the traditional epoxy layer with a magnet are also
   presented along with some methods that could improve the vibration
   reduction performance of the control mounts. This analysis shows that
   the control mounts attenuate significant vibration despite having an
   imperfect bond with the beam, thus providing a viable and adaptable
   alternative to traditional piezoelectric attachment methods. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We present a new 3D surface modeling approach that enables curve-based
   creation and modification of smooth surfaces by sketching. The key
   feature of the proposed methods is a two-way communication between the
   user-designed curve networks and the generated surfaces. A user-drawn
   curve network serves as a control cage, from which a subdivision surface
   is generated. The subdivision surface is updated to match the curve
   network while minimizing the curvature variation throughout the surface.
   Surface fairness is controlled independently to modify the curve network
   into suitable configurations that guarantee a smooth underlying surface.
   This approach enables a concurrent modeling of the curve network and the
   underlying surface, thus eliminating the need for a laborious, iterative
   adjustment of the curve network for smooth surface creation. We
   demonstrate our approach with example models, and evaluate it with a
   user study. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method to construct solid rational
   T-splines for complex genus-zero geometry from boundary surface
   triangulations. We first build a parametric mapping between the
   triangulation and the boundary of the parametric domain, a unit cube.
   After that we adaptively subdivide the cube using an octree subdivision,
   project the boundary nodes onto the input triangle mesh, and at the same
   time relocate the interior nodes via mesh smoothing. This process
   continues until the surface approximation error is less than a
   pre-defined threshold. T-mesh is then obtained by pillowing the
   subdivision result one layer on the boundary and its quality is
   improved. Templates are implemented to handle extraordinary nodes and
   partial extraordinary nodes in order to get a gap-free T-mesh. The
   obtained solid T-spline is C-2-continuous except for the local region
   around each extraordinary node and partial extraordinary node. The
   boundary surface of the solid T-spline is C-2-continuous everywhere
   except for the local region around the eight nodes corresponding to the
   eight corners of the parametric cube. Finally, a Bezier extraction
   technique is used to facilitate T-spline based isogeometric analysis.
   The obtained Bezier mesh is analysis-suitable with no negative
   Jacobians. Several examples are presented in this paper to show the
   robustness of the algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we build a simple engineering-economic model to
   evaluate the incentives of various network players to deploy distributed
   storage nodes (content stores and caches) to support information-centric
   network (ICN) architectures and the implications of those incentives on
   protocol design, industry structure and other policy issues, such as
   competition and network-neutrality. We find that without some explicit
   monetary compensation from publishers, networks will fail to deploy the
   socially optimal number of caches. We also study the social welfare
   implications of different cache deployment scenarios and identify two
   deployment scenarios that maximize social welfare. Finally, we show that
   ICN architectures provide numerous opportunities for large eyeball
   networks to leverage their terminating access monopoly to extract more
   profits from other network players. Hence, regulators must take steps to
   address issues such as interconnection and the role of caching
   infrastructure in differential quality of service provisioning in an
   ICN-based network architecture, in order to ensure socially desirable
   outcomes from their deployment.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless mesh networks consist of radio nodes organized in a mesh
   topology for serving wireless mesh clients to communicate with one

   communicate with each other either directly or through one or more

   properties with social networks. We first identify the differences and
   similarities between social networks and WMNs, and then use metrics that
   are typically used for social network analysis to assess real WMNs.
   Analyzing real WMN data collected from the University of California at
   Santa Barbara MeshNet and Massachusetts Institue of Technology Roofnet
   testbeds reveals that using SNA metrics are helpful in designing WMNs
   with better performance. We demonstrate the validity of our conclusions

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many international groups study environmental health and safety (EHS)
   concerns surrounding the use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). These
   researchers frequently use the ``Project on Emerging
   Nanotechnologies{''} (PEN) inventory of nano-enabled consumer products
   to prioritize types of ENMs to study because estimates of life-cycle ENM
   releases to the environment can be extrapolated from the database. An
   alternative ``snapshot{''} of nanomaterials likely to enter commerce can
   be determined from the patent literature. The goal of this research was
   to provide an overview of nanotechnology intellectual property trends,
   complementary to the PEN consumer product database, to help identify
   potentially ``risky{''} nanomaterials for study by the nano-EHS
   community. Ten years of nanotechnology patents were examined to
   determine the types of nano-functional materials being patented, the
   chemical compositions of the ENMs, and the products in which they are
   likely to appear. Patenting trends indicated different distributions of
   nano-enabled products and materials compared to the PEN database. Recent
   nanotechnology patenting is dominated by electrical and information
   technology applications rather than the hygienic and anti-fouling
   applications shown by PEN. There is an increasing emphasis on patenting
   of nano-scale layers, coatings, and other surface modifications rather
   than traditional nanoparticles, and there is widespread use of
   nano-functional semiconductor, ceramic, magnetic, and biological
   materials that are currently less studied by EHS professionals. These
   commonly patented products and the nano-functional materials they
   contain may warrant life-cycle evaluations to determine the potential
   for environmental exposure and toxicity. The patent and consumer product
   lists contribute different and complementary insights into the emerging
   nanotechnology industry and its potential for introducing nanomaterials
   into the environment.}},

Title = {{Control of biological growth in recirculating cooling systems using
   treated secondary effluent as makeup water with monochloramine}},

Abstract = {{Secondary-treated municipal wastewater, an abundant and widely
   distributed impaired water source, is a promising alternative water
   source for thermoelectric power plant cooling. However, excessive
   biological growth is a major challenge associated with wastewater reuse
   in cooling systems as it can interfere with normal system operation as
   well as enhance corrosion and scaling problems. Furthermore, possible
   emission of biological aerosols (e.g., Legionella pneumophila) with the
   cooling tower drift can lead to public health concerns within the zone
   of aerosol deposition. In this study, the effectiveness of pre-formed
   and in-situ-formed monochloramine was evaluated for its ability to
   control biological growth in recirculating cooling systems using
   secondary-treated municipal wastewater as the only makeup water source.
   Bench-scale studies were compared with pilot-scale studies for their
   ability to predict system behavior under realistic process conditions.
   Effectiveness of the continuous addition of pre-formed monochloramine
   and monochloramine formed in-situ through the reaction of free chlorine
   with ammonia in the incoming water was evaluated in terms of biocide
   residual and its ability to control both planktonic and sessile
   microbial populations. Results revealed that monochloramine can
   effectively control biofouling in cooling systems employing
   secondary-treated municipal wastewater and has advantages relative to
   use of free chlorine, but that bench-scale studies seriously
   underestimate biocide dose and residual requirements for proper control
   of biological growth in full-scale systems. Pre-formed monochloramine
   offered longer residence time and more reliable performance than
   in-situ-formed monochloramine due to highly variable ammonia
   concentration in the recirculating water caused by ammonia stripping in
   the cooling tower. Pilot-scale tests revealed that much lower dosing
   rate was required to maintain similar total chlorine residual when
   pre-formed monochloramine was used as compared to in-situ-formed
   monochloramine. Adjustment of biocide dose to maintain monochloramine
   residual above 3 mg/L is needed to achieve successful biological growth
   control in recirculating cooling systems using secondary-treated
   municipal effluent as the only source of makeup water. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The potential effectiveness and time scales for monitored natural
   attenuation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated sediments are
   difficult to predict. Little is known about the depth-and time-dependent
   dechlorination of PCBs and the microbial communities that give rise to
   dechlorination processes. The present work describes evaluation of a
   single sediment core from the Grasse River (Massena, New York) using a
   combination of molecular techniques to provide detailed insight of
   dechlorination potential. Primers specific for 16S rRNA genes from the
   bacterial domains, putative dechlorinating organisms in the phylum
   Chloroflexi, the Dehalococcoides genus, and two PCB degrading organism
   strains, o-17 and DF-1, were used to construct phylogenetic microbial
   community profiles using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
   Further, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to
   estimate population numbers of putative PCB-related organisms in the
   sediments along the depth of the core. PCB congener analysis was used in
   conjunction with Molar Dechlorination Product Ratio (MDPR, the sum of
   five PCB end products over total PCBs), chlorine content, chlorine per
   biphenyl (CPB), and PCB composition changes with depth in the core to
   evaluate the extent of dechlorination. All core samples contained
   populations of Chloroflexi, Dehalococcoides, and o-17/DF-1 related
   organisms, representing the first report of putative dechlorinating
   organisms with depth in PCB-contaminated sediment. A clear pattern of
   dechlorination was observed, with deeper (older) sediments showing more
   extensive dechlorination and middle sediments showing less
   dechlorination. The evaluation of putative dechlorinating bacterial
   populations in conjunction with congener shifts resulting from
   dechlorination enables a critical association that may lead to better
   prediction of successful natural attenuation of PCB-contaminated
   sediment. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000595. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{This study presents an experimental investigation of the effects of
   spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of drilling on the temperature
   distribution during drilling of the cortical section of the bovine
   femur. In an effort to reduce measurement uncertainties, a new approach
   for temperature measurements during bone drilling is presented in this
   study. The new approach is based on a setup for precise positioning of
   multiple thermocouples, automated data logging system, and a computer
   numerically controlled (CNC) machining system. A battery of experiments
   that has been performed to assess the uncertainty and repeatability of
   the new approach displayed adequate results. Subsequently, a parametric
   study was conducted to determine the effects of spindle speed, feed
   rate, hole depth, and thermocouple location on the measured bone
   temperature. This study suggests that the exposure time during bone
   drilling far exceeds the commonly accepted threshold for thermal injury,
   which may prevail at significant distances from the drilled hole.
   Results of this study suggest that the correlation of the thermal
   exposure threshold for bone injury and viability should be further
   explored. (C) 2012 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flagellated bacteria have been embraced by the micro-robotics community
   as a highly efficient microscale actuation method, capable of converting
   chemical energy into mechanical actuation for microsystems that require
   a small payload and high rate of actuation. Along with being highly
   motile, Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), our bacterium species of
   interest, is a highly agile biomotor capable of being steered via
   chemotaxis. In this paper, we attached S. marcescens bacteria to
   polystyrene microbeads towards creating biohybrid that can propel
   themselves towards an attractive chemical source. Using a three-channel
   microfluidic device, linear chemical gradients are generated to compare
   the behavior of bacteria-propelled beads in the presence and absence of
   a chemoattractant, L-aspartate. We tested and compared the behavior of
   three different bacteria-attached bead sizes (5, 10 and 20 mu m
   diameter) using a visual particle-tracking algorithm, and noted their
   behavioral differences. The results indicate that in the presence of a
   chemoattractant, the S. marcescens-attached polystyrene beads exhibit a
   clear indication of directionality and steering control through the
   coordination of the bacteria present on each bead. This directionality
   is observed in all bead size cases, suggesting potential for targeted
   payload delivery using such a biohybrid micro-robotic approach.}},

Title = {{Multistable phase regulation for robust steady and transitional legged
   gaits}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{1712-1738}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We develop robust methods that allow the specification, control, and
   transition of a multi-legged robot's stepping pattern, its `gait',
   during active locomotion over natural terrain. Resulting gaits emerge
   through the introduction of controllers that impose appropriately placed
   repellors within the space of gaits, the torus of relative leg phases,
   thereby mitigating against dangerous patterns of leg timing. Moreover,
   these repellors are organized with respect to a natural cellular
   decomposition of gait space and result in limit cycles with associated
   basins that are well characterized by these cells, thus conferring a
   symbolic character upon the overall behavioral repertoire. These ideas
   are particularly applicable to four- and six-legged robots, for which a
   large variety of interesting and useful (and, in many cases, familiar)
   gaits exist, and whose tradeoffs between speed and reliability motivate
   the desire for transitioning between them during active locomotion. We
   provide an empirical instance of this gait regulation scheme by
   application to a climbing hexapod, whose `physical layer'
   sensor-feedback control requires adequate grasp of a climbing surface
   but whose closed-loop control perturbs the robot from its desired gait.
   We document how the regulation scheme secures the desired gait and
   permits operator selection of different gaits as required during active
   climbing on challenging surfaces.}},
