Abstract = {{The bulk thermal conductivity of Lennard-Jones argon and
   Stillinger-Weber silicon is predicted using the Green-Kubo (GK) and
   direct methods in classical molecular dynamics simulations. While
   system-size independent thermal conductivities can be obtained with less
   than 1000 atoms for both materials using the GK method, the linear
   extrapolation procedure {[}Schelling et al. Phys. Rev. B 65, 144306
   (2002)] must be applied to direct method results for multiple system
   sizes. It is found that applying the linear extrapolation procedure in a
   manner consistent with previous researchers can lead to an
   underprediction of the GK thermal conductivity (e.g., by a factor of 2.5
   for Stillinger-Weber silicon at a temperature of 500 K). To understand
   this discrepancy, phonon properties are predicted from lattice dynamics
   calculations, and from these, length-dependent thermal conductivities.
   These results show that the linear extrapolation procedure is only
   accurate when the minimum system size used in the direct method
   simulations is comparable to the largest mean free paths of the phonons
   that dominate the thermal transport. This condition has not typically
   been satisfied in previous works.}},

Abstract = {{Internet chat-based tutorials are being developed for integrating
   computer modeling and design skills into mechanical engineering
   undergraduate and middle school outreach programs. These tutorials help
   students navigate complicated software interfaces while teaching
   fundamental concepts through dynamic dialogues between tutorial agents
   and student user groups. In a typical assignment, students are asked to
   perform a design or modeling task that includes the use of software such
   as a commercial finite element code or specially designed educational
   software. Students work in teams, but team members are distributed
   within a room or between remote sites, linked by a text interface. As
   students collaborate electronically, an intelligent agent monitors their
   interactions and interjects questions or comments in response to the use
   of key phrases, or due to other triggers. This platform is being used to
   help automate collaborative learning experiences and to study how
   students can effectively interact with each other and with the software
   agents. In undergraduate projects, fundamental technical skills and
   intuition in interpreting results are emphasized. In outreach efforts,
   participants are led to consider how their work relates to the broad
   mechanical engineering profession.}},

   inter-agent information exchange being restricted to a preassigned

   information exchange for agent policy update. Under the assumption of
   identical agent utility functions that are permutation invariant, the
   proposed distributed algorithm leads to convergence of the
   networked-averaged empirical play histories to a subset of the Nash
   equilibria, designated as the consensus equilibria. Applications of the
   proposed distributed framework to strategy design problems encountered

Abstract = {{We consider distributed optimization where N agents in a network
   minimize the sum Sigma(N)(i=1)(x) of their individual convex costs. To
   solve the described problem, existing literature proposes distributed
   gradient-like algorithms that are attractive due to computationally
   simple iterations k, but have a drawback of slow convergence ( in k) to
   a solution. We propose a distributed gradient-like algorithm, that we
   build from the ( centralized) Nesterov gradient method. For the convex
   f(i)'s with Lipschitz continuous and bounded gradients, we show that our
   method converges at rate O(log k/k). T he achieved rate significantly
   improves over the convergence rate of existing distributed gradient-like
   methods, while the proposed algorithm maintains the same communication
   cost per k and a very similar computational cost per k. We further show
   that the rate O(log k/k) still holds if the bounded gradients assumption
   is replaced by a certain linear growth assumption. We illustrate the
   gains obtained by our method on two simulation examples: acoustic source
   localization and learning a linear classifier based on l(2)-regularized
   logistic loss.}},

   priori measurements of the Green's function for a pre-defined number of
   grid points to overcome the complex modeling problem of dispersive,
   multi-modal guided waves in this environment. We then compute the ML
   estimate of reflectivity at each pixel given some received signal
   vector. We compare this approach to both backprojection and MUSIC
   imaging for the same set of reference and test data. We show that, for
   synthesized defects in a lab setting, all three approaches successfully
   image the defects. However, in situ measurements taken on an active hot
   water return pipe show that only Maximum Likelihood imaging is

Abstract = {{As transistors continue to become smaller, they become exponentially
   susceptible to permanent wearout faults. Without mitigation, these types
   of faults will render systems useless within unacceptably short time
   periods. Our work presents the design for a runtime task mapping
   subsystem which mitigates these faults using a wear-based heuristic. We
   compare our wear-based heuristic to power- and temperature-based
   heuristics used within the same system framework. Using a wide range of
   synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that our wear-based
   heuristic is able to improve total system lifetime by an average of
   7.1\% over temperature-based heuristics. Additionally, we show that our
   wear-based heuristic can be used to drastically improve the time to the
   first component failure (TTFF) of a system. TTFF is a metric that is of
   interest to designers who wish to avoid the design and verification
   difficulties of systems which are expected to recover after a component
   failure. Our wear-based heuristic improves TTFF by an average of 14.6\%
   over temperature-based heuristics across all of our benchmarks. Our
   observations lead us to conclude that runtime, wear-based task mapping
   must be incorporated into systems for which lifetime is a primary design
   goal.}},

   configuration to experimentally demonstrate a more than 2X enhancement
   of the device k(t)(2). The resonator orientated 30 degrees to + Y in the
   X-cut plane achieved a k(t)(2) of 21.7\%, and a quality factor of 1300,
   effectively corresponding to a figure of merit of 280 - the highest
   demonstrated to date for laterally vibrating resonators.}},

Abstract = {{We derive the convergence rate of a distributed gradient algorithm for
   smooth optimization in networked systems. We assume that each agent in
   the network has a convex cost function fi(x), known only to agent i, and
   the goal is to minimize the sum Sigma(N)(i= 1) fi(x) of all agents'
   costs; such problem formulation arises in various networked
   applications, like, e. g., distributed inference or source localization
   in sensor networks. With the distributed gradient algorithm under study,
   each agent, at each iteration k, performs a weighted average of its own
   and its neighbors' solution estimates, and performs a step in the
   direction of the negative of its local function's gradient. We establish
   a novel result that the distributed gradient algorithm has the
   convergence rate O(1/k(2/3)), in terms of the cost function optimality
   gap, under the assumption of convex fi's with Lipschitz continuous and
   bounded gradients.}},

Abstract = {{We study the products W-k ... W-1 of random stochastic, not necessarily
   symmetric matrices. It is known that, under certain conditions, the
   product W-k ... W-1 converges almost surely (a.s.) to a random rank-one
   matrix; the latter is equivalent to vertical bar gimel(2)(W-k ...
   W-1)|vertical bar -> 0 a.s., where gimel(2)(.) is the second largest (in
   modulus) eigenvalue. In this paper, we show that the probability that
   |gimel(2)(W-k ... W-1)| stays above epsilon is an element of (0, 1] in
   the long run decays to zero exponentially fast similar to e(-k I).
   Furthermore, we explicitly characterize the rate of this convergence I
   and show that it depends only on the underlying graphs that support the
   matrices W-k's. Our results reveal that the rate I is essentially
   determined by the most likely way in which the union (over time) of the
   support graphs fails to form a directed tree.}},

Abstract = {{Granular flows continue to be a complex problem in nature and industrial
   sectors where solid particles exhibit solid, liquid, and gaseous
   behavior in a manner which is often unpredictable locally or globally.
   In tribology, they have also been proposed as lubricants because of
   their liquid-like behavior in sliding contacts, and due to their ability
   to carry loads and accommodate surface velocities. The present work
   attempts to model a granular Couette flow in an annular shear cell using
   a lattice-based cellular automata (CA) computational modeling approach.
   The CA framework has the flexibility to employ rule-based mathematics
   and/or first-principle physics to rapidly model physical processes. The
   model developed in this work incorporates dissipative effects due to
   friction between particles and boundaries, in addition to particle spin.
   This new model also includes a rigorous treatment of boundary-particle
   interactions. Additional work has been done to account for the transfer
   of momentum through particle chains, allowing for the modeling of
   transitional granular flows, which consist of both kinetic and contact
   flow regimes.}},

   help reduce energy usage and Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)
   techniques are a promising approach to obtain estimates of the

   measurements of voltage and/or current in the distribution system. In
   this paper, we discuss event detection algorithms used in the NILM
   literature and propose new metrics for evaluating them. In particular,
   we introduce metrics that incorporate information contained in the power
   signal instead of strict detection rates. We show that this information
   is important for NILM applications with the goal of improving appliance
   energy disaggregation. Our work was carried out on a publicly-available

Abstract = {{We present a new scheme of remote addressable magnetic actuation for
   sub-mm microrobotics which uses the hysteresis characteristics of
   multiple magnetic materials to achieve advanced state control of many
   magnetic actuators sharing the same magnetic control inputs. Using this
   standard approach, remote magnetic actuation of a single magnet has been
   achieved for untethered motion control with a single magnetic control
   input. We propose the simultaneous use of multiple magnetic materials
   with varying hysteresis characteristics to effectively gain multiple
   control inputs as different applied magnetic field strengths. As a first
   experimental implementation of this idea, we present a set of three
   heterogeneous magnetic modules floating on a liquid surface which can be
   remotely reconfigured by application of a field of varying magnitude. As
   a second implementation, we present a team of up to six independently
   actuated walking microrobots made from a composite material whose net
   magnetic moment can be selectively turned on or off by application of a
   large magnetic field pulse. We also demonstrate a team of two
   addressable microrobots performing a task requiring cooperative
   teamwork. The presented concept providing multiple magnetic control
   inputs could be applicable in various areas of milli- or microrobotics
   to address multiple magnetic elements for motion or actuation control.}},

Abstract = {{The gradual penetration of Dedicated Short Range Communications Radio
   (DSRC) technology in the years to come is a formidable problem that
   could adversely affect the implementation of safety and non-safety
   applications. In this paper, we propose a solution that might mitigate
   the negative impact of the partial and gradual penetration problem of
   DSRC technology. The proposed solution is based on a self-organizing
   network paradigm that draws its inspiration from biological systems,
   such as social insect colonies {[}1]. By designing the local rules and a
   distributed algorithm needed to perform this function, it is shown that
   DSRC-equipped cars can indeed serve as RSUs. Results show that the
   message reachability and connectivity in urban vehicular networks can be
   increased substantially in a cost-effective manner as the proposed
   approach does not entail deployment of infrastructure-based RSUs.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically inspired approaches have the potential to solve many of the
   difficult networking problems awaiting practical solutions. The recently
   proposed Virtual Traffic Lights (VTL) is one example (or instance) of
   this powerful approach for solving some fundamental transportation
   problems{[}1], {[}2]. The successful operation of VTL scheme ultimately
   depends on the local rules used by vehicles approaching an intersection
   for electing a leader that manages the traffic at that intersection by
   serving as a virtual traffic light. In this paper, it is shown that by
   using a different set of local rules at intersections, one can support
   priority management of emergency vehicles in a self-organized manner.
   The proposed VTL-Priority Intersection Control (VTL-PIC) protocol can
   detect the presence of an emergency vehicle and assign priority to the
   emergency vehicle at an intersection. Large-scale simulation results
   show that while the travel time of emergency vehicles can be reduced
   significantly, the impact of the proposed algorithm on the travel time
   of other vehicles is negligible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first experimental demonstration of bulk
   acoustic wave (BAW) slanted finger interdigital transducer (SFIT) delay
   line in aluminum nitride (AlN) thin film operating around 1 GHz. The
   SFIT is used to electro-acoustically transduce the Lamb wave S-0 mode.
   The AlN Lamb SFITs were micromachined and experimentally demonstrated to
   have a band-pass response with a maximum insertion loss (IL) of 26 dB,
   fractional bandwidth (6 dB) of 7.9\%, and a shape factor (-30 dB) of
   1.8. This device displays a small form factor of 150 mu m x 421 mu m.
   The transmission response of the measured devices was confirmed to match
   the impulse response model. However, large pass-band ripples were
   observed in the device due to the acoustic reflections within the
   interdigitated fingers. In order to verify the reflection effect, AlN
   lateral field excitation (LFE) SFITs were also microfabricated. Because
   of the absence of the bottom floating electrode and the use of a thicker
   AlN membrane in this configuration, the acoustic mismatch between
   interdigital transducers (IDTs) is reduced and so is the magnitude of
   the associated ripple (from 5 dB to 3.5 dB).}},

Abstract = {{Current spacecraft systems generally have monolithic structures, but a
   ``fractionated{''} architecture is being considered for next generation
   spacecrafts. A fractionated spacecraft system is a cluster of
   independent modules that communicate wirelessly to maintain cluster
   flight formations and realize the functions usually performed by a
   monolithic satellite. The envisioned benefits of the fractionated
   approach include enhanced responsiveness, greater flexibility,
   robustness and co-existence of multiple missions from different sources
   with varying degree of trust. The fractionated architecture, however,
   introduces significant new challenges from the perspective of resource
   allocation and management. The mobile nature of the clusters and the
   modules within the cluster implies that the network topology is highly
   time-varying. A cluster with multiple missions can require messages to
   be transmitted across the network with varying degrees of QoS
   requirements such as timeliness and data delivery reliability. The
   system must determine the appropriate and timely resource allocation for
   these missions. In this paper, we address these resource allocation
   challenges by introducing an abstraction of dynamic graphs, and
   extending the QoS based Resource Allocation Model (Q-RAM) to operate on
   these dynamic graphs. We develop a mechanism to decompose a dynamic
   graph into multiple static sub-graphs using which the resource
   allocation problem is partitioned into multiple sub-problems within each
   of these static sub-graphs. We have experimentally evaluated our
   solution by building a simulation framework called SatSim, which can
   handle a variety of satellite configurations and mobility models. The
   proposed solution is shown to achieve a near-optimal solution for the
   resource allocation problem in time-varying networks, while reducing
   time complexity significantly.}},

Abstract = {{We present a formal technique for verifying the stability of transient
   responses of power systems. The procedure uses reachability analysis to
   compute the complete set of possible transient responses starting from a
   set of initial states, subject to a dynamics specified by
   differential-algebraic equations. The method is constructive and fully
   automatic, two properties that are often hard to achieve with direct
   Lyapunov methods when the differential-algebraic equations are not
   simplified. Reachability analysis is computationally expensive, but this
   work presents new techniques that make it possible to verify the
   stability of a transient response of the IEEE 14-bus benchmark power

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new framework for modeling wheeling loop flows
   across areas not directly involved in bilateral trades. This framework
   decomposes each wheeling loop flow into a linear combination of
   contributions by the individual bilateral trades. It has zooming-in and
   zooming-out capabilities for modeling the level of details of interest.
   The zoomed-in network representations neglect interconnections while
   treating areas fully disconnected from the rest of the network. This
   feature allows to have distributed algorithms with completely
   decentralized decision making. In this framework, we formulate
   distributed algorithms for wheeling loop flow reduction which do not
   require individual areas to reveal their internal generation and load.
   Loop flow minimization is achieved by rescheduling generation within
   areas directly involved in bilateral trades. Since this rescheduling
   leads to a more expensive economic dispatch, we define a new Optimal
   Power Flow (OPF) problem that accounts for wheeling charges and
   generation cost. Simulation results are illustrated on the IEEE 14-bus
   system and the RTS 96-bus system.}},

Abstract = {{An H-infinity-based decentralized robust control approach is proposed in
   this paper to integrate energy storage into primary frequency control
   and to address increased frequency deviations introduced by renewable
   energy sources (RESs). The proposed new primary frequency control design
   is formulated as an H-infinity minimization problem with decentralized
   static output feedback. The three objectives are: 1) to minimize
   frequency deviations; 2) to minimize the use of energy storage devices;
   3) to minimize the ramp rates required from conventional generators. A
   so-called frequency separation objective is achieved, i.e. low frequency
   variations of the RES power fluctuations are balanced by the
   conventional generators while the high frequency variations are
   compensated by the storage device. The detailed derivation of an
   interconnected power system model based on component-level models is
   provided to facilitate the control design. In order to evaluate the
   performance loss due to controller decentralization, a centralized
   counterpart of the proposed approach is presented and tested as well.
   Simulation results on the WECC 9-bus test system illustrate the
   performance of the proposed control.}},

Abstract = {{With the continued scaling of NAND flash and multi-level cell
   technology, flash-based storage has gained widespread use in systems
   ranging from mobile platforms to enterprise servers. However, the
   robustness of NAND flash cells is an increasing concern, especially at
   nanometer-regime process geometries. NAND flash memory bit error rate
   increases exponentially with the number of program/erase cycles.
   Stronger error correcting codes (ECC) can be used to tolerate higher
   error rates, but these have diminishing returns with increasing P/E
   cycles and can have prohibitively high power, area, and latency
   overheads. The goal of this paper is to develop new techniques that can
   tolerate high bit error rates without requiring prohibitively strong
   ECC. Our techniques, called Flash Correct-and-Refresh (FCR) exploit the
   observation that the dominant error source in NAND flash memory is
   retention errors, caused by flash cells losing charge over time. The key
   idea is to periodically read, correct, and reprogram (in-place) or remap
   the stored data before it accumulates more retention errors than can be
   corrected by simple ECC. Detailed simulations of a solid-state drive
   (SSD) storage system driven by measured experimental data from error
   characterization on real flash memory chips show that our techniques
   provide 46x average lifetime improvement on a variety of workloads at no
   additional hardware cost. We also find that our techniques achieve
   lifetime improvements that cannot feasibly be achieved with stronger
   ECC.}},

Abstract = {{One approach for achieving integrated-system robustness centers on
   performing test during run-time, identifying the location of any faults
   (or potential faults), and repairing or avoiding the affected portion of
   the system. Fault dictionaries can be used to locate faults but
   conventional approaches require significant memory storage and are
   therefore limited to simplistic fault types. To overcome these
   limitations, three contributions are made that include: (i) enhancement
   of an unspecified transition fault model (called here the transition-X
   fault model, or TRAX for short) for capturing the misbehaviors expected
   from scaled technologies, (ii) development of a new type of hierarchical
   dictionary that only localizes to the level of repair or fault
   avoidance, and (iii) the design of a scalable architecture for
   retrieving and using the hierarchical dictionary for performing on-chip
   diagnosis. Experiments involving various circuits, including the
   OpenSPARC T2 processor, demonstrate that early-life and wear-out
   failures can be accurately diagnosed with minimum overhead using TRAX
   dictionaries that are up to 2600x smaller than full-response
   dictionaries.}},

   strategies for analysis, high performance design and efficient

   of device-scale and process scale models, which contain distributed and

   integration and optimization of advanced energy models through
   multi-scale optimization strategies. In particular, we consider the
   optimal design of advanced energy processes by merging device-scale
   (e.g., CFD) models with flowsheet simulation models through
   sophisticated model reduction strategies. Recent developments in
   surrogate-based optimization have led to a general decomposition
   framework with multiple scales and convergence guarantees to the overall
   multi-scale optimum. Here, we sketch two trust region-based algorithms,
   one requiring gradients from the detailed model and one that is
   derivative-free; both demonstrate multi-scale optimization of advanced
   energy processes. Motivated by an advanced Integrated Gasification
   Combined Cycle (IGCC) process, we present two case studies that include

Abstract = {{In this work, a two-dimensional model for a conventional packed-bed
   membrane reactor (CPBMR) is developed for the oxidative coupling of
   methane, which uses a nonselective porous membrane to continuously feed
   oxygen to the catalytic bed. The model incorporates radial diffusion and
   thermal conduction and assumes convective transport for the axial
   direction. In addition, two 10cm long cooling segments for the CPBMR
   were implemented based on the idea of a fixed cooling temperature
   outside the reactor shell. The resulting model is discretized using
   two-dimensional orthogonal collocation on finite elements with a
   combination of Hermite polynomials for the radial and Lagrangian
   polynomials for the axial coordinate. The simulation study shows that it
   is necessary to make all transport coefficients dependent on local
   temperatures and compositions. This leads to a simulation with roughly
   130,000 variables, which is then used to generate initial points for the
   optimization of the CPBMR stand-alone operation. In addition, inequality
   constraints and variable bounds are introduced so as to avoid
   potentially hazardous mixtures of methane and oxygen in both shell and
   tube as well as to keep the temperatures below levels stressing reactor
   materials (< 1,100 degrees C). Moreover, membrane thickness, feed
   compositions, temperatures at the reactor inlet and for the cooling
   segments, diameters of tube and shell, and finally the amount of inert
   packing in the reactor are considered as decision variables. The
   optimization procedure uses IPOPT as a solver. Afterwards, the 2D model
   is integrated into a membrane reactor network (MRN) proposed by H.
   Godini et al. in 2010 which is simulated. Finally, attempts are made to
   optimize its operation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a generalized multiperiod version of the
   pooling problem to represent time varying blending systems, and also
   propose novel approaches to solve these problems to global optimality.
   The primary difficulties in solving this optimization problem are the
   presence of bilinear terms inherent in blending operations, as well as
   binary decision variables required to impose the operational constraints
   over multiple time periods. A general nonconvex MINLP formulation is
   presented that is used to globally optimize small systems, but quickly
   becomes intractable as problem size increases. A novel approximation of
   specified precision for the nonconvex bilinear terms is developed (a
   radix-based discretization scheme), with which the problem can be
   reformulated as an MILP. Solving this new formulation requires much less
   computational time than when the MINLP model is solved directly with a
   global optimization solver such as BARON. This then allows for the
   global optimization of larger blending systems. A comparison of the two
   formulations is presented, along with detailed computational results of
   each approach.}},

Abstract = {{Global convergence and fast performance of barrier nonlinear programming
   (NLP) solvers are frequently challenged by linearly dependent
   constraints. Such constraints arise in many process optimization models,
   and they often preclude finding successful NLP solutions. To deal with
   this problem we present a structured regularization strategy for barrier
   methods that identifies and excludes dependent constraints in the KKT
   system while leaving independent constraints unchanged. As a result,
   more accurate Newton directions can be obtained and much faster
   convergence can be expected for the KKT system over the conventional
   regularization approach. Numerical experiments with examples derived
   from the CUTE and COPS test sets as well as two refinery blending
   problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and
   significantly better performance of the NLP solver.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregate models are frequently used for online optimization of
   distillation columns because of their balance of accuracy and
   simplicity. When applied to high-purity distillation columns with large
   numbers of trays in a section, however, traditional group methods cannot
   accurately depict the strongly nonlinear features along the trays. On
   the other hand, absorption/stripping factors of the components along the
   trays were observed as a traveling sigmoidal wave, with the
   absorption/stripping factors at the top and bottom trays hardly changing
   with the reflux ratio. An improved group method based on the wave
   propagation theory is thus proposed to simulate the high-purity
   distillation columns. Applications are also conducted through process
   simulation on an argon sidearm column in a cryogenic air separation
   process. Excellent performance of the proposed method in terms of
   accuracy and converging rate is observed.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology based on the mathematical programming model by
   Ahmetovic and Grossmann (2011) is proposed. It involves optimization in
   two levels: minimize the total flow of fresh water and treatments, and
   minimize total annualized cost including the installation of the new
   treatment plant cost, the wastewater treatment costs and the fresh water
   cost. The results obtained with this methodology provide the minimum
   investment in terms of different technologies for water regeneration and
   bottlenecks presented by the nature of the contaminants. A versatile
   software program has been developed implementing these optimization
   models. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on Windows T is designed
   for data entry while the models are automatically generated and
   interfaced with the mathematical modeling system GAMS T. Selected
   scenarios and technologies can be studied for real size water
   distribution networks from different chemical process industries: Gas
   Processing, Petroleum Refineries and Petrochemical Complexes. An
   illustrative example is presented. From the results we can conclude that
   the total annualized cost is highly sensitive to two main treatment
   units, the demineralization plant and the cooling water blow down
   treatment for regeneration. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of
   the overall effect that different technologies have for treatment plants
   and the limits for environmental standards regulations in Mexico by the
   year 2020.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an alternative model for the simultaneous
   optimization and heat integration in non-isothermal systems with
   variable temperatures. As far as we know, in the literature, only the
   pinch location method proposed by Duran and Grossmann and converted in a
   practical disjunctive model by Grossmann et al is available {[}1, 2].
   This method does not use the classical concept of temperature intervals;
   instead the method calculates the heat exchanged only in those
   temperatures potentially candidates (inlet stream temperatures) to be
   the pinch point. The motivation of this paper is to develop an
   alternative method that maintains the temperature interval concept to
   calculate the pinch point. This strategy is based on the ``transshipment
   model{''} proposed by Papoulias \& Grossmann {[}3].}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the heterogeneous behavior of hematopoietic stem cells
   (HSCs) is required for the expansion of the cells without loss of their
   regenerative capacity. As such, it is essential to establish their
   lineage relationships by tracking the history of individual cells in a
   cell population. However, the quality of lineage relationships is often
   degraded because of undetected or misdetected mitotic events, which lead
   to missed or inaccurate mother-daughter cell relationships. In this
   paper, we present an automated mitosis detection method for HSCs in
   time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy images. Since HSCs are nonadherent,
   i.e., free-floating in the culture medium, the method is distinguished
   from the recent mitosis detection methods developed for adherent cells
   that are attached to the surface of a petri dish. The proposed mitosis
   detection method detects individual cells in each image frame and
   subsequently tracks them over time and in so doing identifies newly
   appeared cells, each of which is considered as a candidate of a newborn
   cell. Each candidate is then examined to determine whether it is indeed
   a newborn cell based on temporal change of cell sizes of potential
   mother and daughter cells. Our method was quantitatively evaluated on 14
   HSC populations, each of which is observed for four days, resulting in a
   precision of 97.4\% and a recall of 96.6\%.}},

   molecular mechanisms, we developed an automated single particle tracking
   method that combines nanometer resolution detection of cargo positions

   precise and complete recovery of cargo trajectories. Experiments
   confirmed that the method can precisely track vesicles in dense axonal
   traffic of Drosophila motor neurons at 10 similar to 20 nm resolution
   and reliably resolve their trajectories in events of crossing, merging,
   and splitting. Recovered cargo trajectories were statistically analyzed
   to identify motion patterns and computationally represented using hidden
   Markov models to characterize behavior changes. Together, these tools
   allowed us to reliably detect and measure subtle changes in dynamics of
   axonal transport and to discover previously unknown axonal transport
   properties.}},

   duty cycle and curvature was observed across all needle materials and

Abstract = {{Internal models have been proposed to explain the brain's ability to
   compensate for sensory feedback delays by predicting the sensory
   consequences of movement commands. Single-neuron studies in the
   oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular systems have provided evidence of
   internal models, as have behavioral studies in the skeletomotor system.
   Here, we present evidence of internal models from simultaneously
   recorded population activity underlying closed-loop brain-computer
   interface (BCI) control. We studied cursor-based BCI control by a
   nonhuman primate implanted with a multi-electrode array in motor cortex.
   Using a novel BCI task, we measured the visual feedback processing delay
   to be about 130 milliseconds. By examining the task-based
   appropriateness of the population activity at different time lags, we
   found evidence that the subject compensates for the feedback delay by
   predicting upcoming cursor positions, suggesting the use of an internal
   forward model. Lastly, we examined the time course of internal model
   adaptation after altering the mapping between population activity and
   cursor movements. This study suggests that closed-loop BCI experiments
   combined with novel statistical analyses can provide insight into the
   neural substrates of feedback motor control and motor learning.}},

Abstract = {{The activity of tens to hundreds of neurons can be succinctly summarized
   by a smaller number of latent variables extracted using dimensionality
   reduction methods. These latent variables define a reduced-dimensional
   space in which we can study how population activity varies over time,
   across trials, and across experimental conditions. Ideally, we would
   like to visualize the population activity directly in the
   reduced-dimensional space, whose optimal dimensionality (as determined
   from the data) is typically greater than 3. However, direct plotting can
   only provide a 2D or 3D view. To address this limitation, we developed a
   Matlab graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to quickly
   navigate through a continuum of different 2D projections of the
   reduced-dimensional space. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of
   this GUI, we applied it to visualize population activity recorded in
   premotor and motor cortices during reaching tasks. Examples include
   single-trial population activity recorded using a multi-electrode array,
   as well as trial-averaged population activity recorded sequentially
   using single electrodes. Because any single 2D projection may provide a
   misleading impression of the data, being able to see a large number of
   2D projections is critical for intuition- and hypothesis-building during
   exploratory data analysis. The GUI includes a suite of additional
   interactive tools, including playing out population activity timecourses
   as a movie and displaying summary statistics, such as covariance
   ellipses and average timecourses. The use of visualization tools like
   the GUI developed here, in tandem with dimensionality reduction methods,
   has the potential to further our understanding of neural population
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems are an emerging class of applications that
   require tightly coupled interaction between the computational and
   physical worlds. These systems are typically realized using
   sensor/actuator interfaces connected with processing backbones. Safety
   is a primary concern in cyber-physical systems since the actuators
   directly influence the physical world. However, unexpected or unusual
   conditions in the physical world can manifest themselves as increased
   workload demands being offered to the computational infrastructure of a
   cyber-physical system. Guaranteeing system safety under overload
   conditions is therefore a prime concern in developing and deploying
   cyber-physical systems. In this work, we study this problem in the
   context of a radar surveillance system, where tasks have different
   levels of criticality or influence on system safety. In the face of
   overloads, we observe that the desirable property in such systems is
   that the more critical tasks continue to meet their timing requirements.
   We capture this mixed-criticality overload requirement using a formal
   overload-tolerance metric called ductility. Using this
   overload-tolerance metric, we first develop our solution in the context
   of uniprocessor systems, where we show that Zero-Slack scheduling (ZS)
   algorithms can be used to improve the overload behavior in
   mixed-criticality cyber-physical systems compared to existing
   fixed-priority scheduling algorithms like Rate-Monotonic Scheduling
   (RMS) and Criticality-As-Priority-Assignment (CAPA). Leveraging these
   results, we then develop a criticality-aware task allocation algorithm
   called Compress-on-Overload Packing (COP) for dealing with
   multiprocessor cyber-physical systems. Evaluation results show that COP
   achieves up to five times better ductility than traditional load
   balancing bin-packing algorithms like Worst-Fit Decreasing (WFD).
   Finally, we apply ZS and COP to the radar surveillance system to
   demonstrate the resulting improvement in system overload behavior. Our
   implementation of the Zero-Slack scheduler is available as a part of the
   Linux/RK project, which provides resource kernel extensions for Linux.}},

   Static performance is measured in terms of success rates and mean hit

   mean solution quality. Among the evaluated algorithms, steady-state GA
   provides the best trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. PSO is

   (and higher) range require high-throughput/highly parallel fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) implementations. These consume a significant amount of
   chip resources; we aim to reduce costs by improving the system's
   accuracy per chip-area. For OFDM signals, we characterize the growth of
   data within the FFT and explore several cost-conscious methods for
   improving the fixed-point format. Using ASIC synthesis and hardware
   accurate simulations, we evaluate the corresponding system error and
   stability of these methods. We introduce Directive Scaling, which
   provides an average increase in overall accuracy without additional
   runtime-adaptive mechanisms. ASIC synthesis results show minimal
   overhead, and we explicitly evaluate and explain the inherent tradeoffs.
   When applied to an 8-bit IFFT design, our technique improves precision
   by approximately two bits with just a 4\% area overhead, as opposed to
   the additional 32\% area overhead required using standard methods.}},

Abstract = {{We are interested in investigating the spread of contagion in a network,
   G, which describes the interactions between the agents in the system.
   The topology of this network is often neglected due to the assumption
   that each agent is connected with every other agents; this means that
   the network topology is a complete graph. While this allows for certain
   simplifications in the analysis, we fail to gain insight on the
   diffusion process for non-complete network topology. In this paper, we
   offer a continuous-time Markov chain infection model that explicitly
   accounts for the network topology, be it complete or non-complete.
   Although we characterize our process using parameters from epidemiology,
   our approach can be applied to many application domains. We will show
   how to generate the infinitesimal matrix that describes the evolution of
   this process for any topology. We also develop a general methodology to
   solve for the equilibrium distribution by considering symmetries in G.
   Our results show that network topologies have dramatic effect on the
   spread of infections.}},

   separable problem, each node has its own private function and its own
   private constraint set. Private means that no other node has access to
   it. The goal is to minimize the sum of all nodes' private functions,
   constraining the solution to be in the intersection of all the private
   sets. Our algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) and requires a coloring of the network to be
   available beforehand. We perform numerical experiments of the algorithm,
   applying it to compressed sensing problems. These show that the proposed

Abstract = {{The paper considers the problem of distributed estimation of an unknown
   deterministic scalar parameter (the target signal) in wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs), in which each sensor receives a single snapshot of the
   field. The observation or sensing mode is only partially known at the
   corresponding nodes, perhaps, due to their limited sensing capabilities
   or other unpredictable physical factors. Specifically, it is assumed
   that the observation process at a node switches stochastically between
   two modes, with mode one corresponding to the desired signal plus noise
   observation mode (a valid observation), and mode two corresponding to
   pure noise with no signal information (an invalid observation). With no
   prior information on the local sensing modes (valid or invalid), the
   paper introduces a learning-based distributed estimation procedure, the
   mixed detection-estimation (MDE) algorithm, based on closed-loop
   interactions between the iterative distributed mode learning and
   estimation. The online learning (or sensing mode detection) step
   re-assesses the validity of the local observations at each iteration,
   thus refining the ongoing estimation update process. The convergence of
   the MDE algorithm is established analytically. Simulation studies show
   that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the MDE estimation
   error converges to that of an ideal (centralized) estimator with perfect
   information about the node sensing modes. This is in contrast with the
   estimation performance of a naive average consensus based distributed
   estimator (with no mode learning), whose estimation error blows up with
   an increasing SNR.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel two-microphone sound source separation
   algorithm, which selects speech from the target speaker while
   suppressing signals from interfering sources. In this algorithm, which
   is refered to as SMAD-CW, we first estimate the direction of sound
   sources for each time-frequency bin using phase differences in the
   spectral domain. For each frame we assume that the angle distribution is
   a mixture of two distributions, one from the target and the other from
   the dominant noise source. For each mixture component we use the von
   Mises distribution, which is a close approximation to the wrapped normal
   distribution. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to
   obtain parameters of this mixture distribution. Using this statistical
   model, we perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis testing in order
   to obtain appropriate binary masks. We demonstrate that the algorithm
   described in this paper provides speech recognition accuracy that is
   significantly better than that obtained using conventional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new algorithm that increases the robustness of
   speech recognition systems by matching the power histograms of the input
   in each frequency band to those obtained over clean training data, and
   then mixing together the processed and unprocessed spectra. Before
   calculating prototype histograms over the training data, the power
   signals in each channel are normalized by the local maximum and minimum
   of the channel. In contrast, histograms calculated over the testing data
   are normalized by the global maximum and minimum of the power spectrum.
   This mode of normalization leads to a significant reduction in noise.
   Following the histogram-based processing, it is shown that taking a
   weighted average between the processed and unprocessed power spectra
   contributes to further gains in recognition accuracy. Results are
   obtained for multiple speech recognition systems, noise types, and
   training conditions illustrating the broad utility of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies (ICT) holds the potential to
   dramatically change the way people drive and their mobility patterns,
   thus potentially reducing GHG emissions, air pollutants and fatalities.
   In this work, we study the potential environmental and the economic
   impacts of implementing ICT measures in personal transportation, for
   three scenarios of ICT applications. In the first application, we seek
   to investigate the effects of limiting driving speed. Non-compliance
   with speed limits accounts for a large part of fatal car accidents in
   Portugal, and therefore understanding the impact of such applications is
   crucial in the context of a national transportation safety policy. In
   this application, stricter speed limits can be obtained either by
   on-board vehicle devices influencing the driver not to exceed certain
   speed limits or on the road network imposing lower speed limits. In the
   second application, the impacts of fostering an eco-driving behavior are
   studied. In that case, we study the impact of a massive adhesion by the
   public to eco-driving using ICT to present the drivers with the results
   of their behavioral changes. The third case study assesses the impacts
   of the implementation of a taxation system based on on-board vehicle
   devices that indicate where and when the vehicle is being driven and
   rewarding or penalizing the driver for it. For this study the Lisbon
   region was addressed. The results show that different ICT applications
   can have considerable impacts in terms of energy consumption reductions:
   Scenario 2 (with main variable being speed limitation) reached a 12\%
   reduction in 2020 compared to the BAU, followed by Scenario 4 (with main
   variable being eco-driving) with a 5.5\% reduction, and the taxation
   Scenario 6 presented a 1.8\% reduction. In terms of CO2 emissions, the
   avoided CO2 emissions from implementing these scenarios varies from 19
   to 276 kton in Scenarios 3 (with main variable being eco-driving) and 2
   respectively. In terms the avoided cost from the fuel not consumed and
   CO2 emissions not emitted, as well as the revenue from the taxation
   scheme, the scenarios results range from 9 to 134 M(sic) for Scenarios 3
   and 2 respectively. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or

   identify parking spots, one needs to detect parked vehicles and
   interpret the parking environment. Our approach uses a supervised
   learning technique to achieve vehicle detection by identifying vehicle
   bumpers from laser range scans. In particular, we use AdaBoost to train
   a classifier based on relevant geometric features of data segments that
   correspond to car bumpers. Using the detected bumpers as landmarks of
   vehicle hypotheses, our algorithm constructs a topological graph
   representing the structure of the parking space. Spatial analysis is
   then performed on the topological graph to identify potential parking
   spots. Algorithm performance is evaluated through a series of
   experimental tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by the recognition that sources of uncertainties
   in the electric power systems are multifold and that they may have
   potentially far-reaching effects. In the past, only system load forecast
   was considered to be the main challenge. More recently, uncertain price
   of electricity and hard-to-predict power produced by the renewable
   resources, such as wind and solar, are making the operating and planning
   environment much more challenging. It is, therefore, becoming very
   important to develop modeling methods for predicting uncertain load and
   wind power, in particular. In this paper we first transform historic
   time-stamped data into their Fourier Transform (FT) representation. The
   frequency domain data representation is used to decompose the wind and
   load power signals and to derive predictive models relevant for
   short-term and long-term predictions. The short-term results are
   interpreted next as a Linear Prediction Coding Model (LPC) and its
   accuracy is analyzed. Next, the Discrete Markov Process (DMP)
   representation is applied to help assess probabilities of most likely
   short-, medium-and long-term states and the related multi-temporal
   risks. Throughout the paper we use publicly available data for the New
   York Control Area (NYCA).}},

Abstract = {{The integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into
   the electric power grid is a coveted yet challenging goal. The
   difficulties arise from the intermittency of the sources, the required
   increase in transmission capacity, and the lack of coordination between
   control entities. In this paper, a method is developed and implemented
   for the optimal coordination between storage and intermittent resources
   in multiple control areas. The problem is formulated as a decomposed
   multi-step optimization problem using the Optimality Condition
   Decomposition method. This allows reducing the computational effort by
   dividing the overall optimization problem into subproblems. Simulation
   results show convergence to the centralized solution and provide an
   indication of the benefits of coordinating control areas.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-core CPUs with multiple levels of parallelism and deep memory
   hierarchies have become the mainstream computing platform. In this paper
   we developed a generally applicable high performance computing framework
   for Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) type applications in distribution
   systems, taking advantage of performance-enhancing features of
   multi-core CPUs. The application in this paper is to solve the
   probabilistic load flow (PLF) in real time, in order to cope with the
   uncertainties caused by the integration of renewable energy resources.
   By applying various performance optimizations and multi-level
   parallelization, the optimized MCS solver is able to achieve more than
   50\% of a CPU's theoretical peak performance and the performance is
   scalable with the hardware parallelism. We tested the MCS solver on the
   IEEE 37-bus test feeder using a new Intel Sandy Bridge multi-core CPU.
   The optimized MCS solver is able to solve millions of load flow cases
   within a second, enabling the real-time Monte Carlo solution of the PLF.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new paradigm for solving AC Power Flow (ACPF)
   and AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) with improved convergence robustness.
   This approach exploits the globally convergent properties of
   continuation methods. Continuation methods achieve robustness by
   generating a sequence of nonlinear problems and repeatedly and
   consistently providing good initial guesses for locally convergent
   nonlinear solvers such as Newton-Raphson. The Homotopy implemented in
   this paper, (referred to as Power Flow Homotopy, PFH), is formulated in
   a way that gradually transforms the ``easy{''} DC into the
   ``difficult{''} AC Power Flow. Successive changes of the homotopy
   parameter modify the system of equations from fully linear and convex DC
   into non-linear and non-convex AC (optimal) power flow. As a result, the
   AC solution is obtained with increased robustness and multiple AC power
   flow solutions can also be detected. Similarly, Optimal Power Flow
   Homotopy (OPFH) is defined for solving AC Optimal Power Flow, by
   gradually transforming the convex DC OPF problem. Simulation results
   provide a comparison between the simple Newton-Raphson method and PFH in
   terms of performance and quality of detected solution. Comparisons are
   also performed between the Interior-Point method and OPFH.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the nature of the power system and market, there always exist
   physical and financial risks both in the long run at the planning stage,
   and in the short run at the operation stage. Many attempts to minimize
   these risks from the demand side so far have failed because of the lack
   of information on the true value of demand resources to the system. In
   this paper, we attempt to tackle these problems by proposing a framework
   where the system, load serving entities, and the end-users exchange the
   right information on the system condition (represented by the price) and
   the energy consumption with respect to it (represented by the demand
   function). This information should be exchanged through different layers
   of the market ranging from the end-users on the bottom to the system
   operator at the top. The information should also be presented in
   different timeframes so that it captures the right signals for different
   purposes, such as long-term planning on energy efficiency and short-term
   energy balance of supply and demand. We present the mathematical
   formulation of this framework as a decision making of each entity.}},

   Intuitively, the proposed approach includes a consensus term which
   achieves convergence to a common incremental cost value and an
   innovation term which ensures that the total generation is equal to the
   load to be supplied. Further, in the proposed approach each network bus
   only needs to be aware of its local cost parameters and the local
   predicted load and the neighborhood communication involves exchanging
   only the locally determined marginal energy price with a few neighbors.
   Robustness of the proposed approach and techniques for convergence rate
   improvement are discussed. Finally, simulation studies on the benchmark
   IEEE 14 bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the problem of regulating frequency in the changing
   electric energy systems with large presence of renewable energy
   resources. We start by observing that currently implemented frequency
   regulation approach, well-known as the Automatic Generation Control
   (AGC), is based on equilibria (steady-state) assumptions. However,
   frequency regulation in systems with fast and persistent fluctuations
   caused by wind and solar power, in particular, can no longer be viewed
   as equilibria problems. In order to better understand and overcome these
   limitations, we formulate the frequency regulation problem by viewing
   the future electric energy systems as a general dynamical system driven
   by disturbances. We derive a dynamical model of the system and further
   utilize its structure to systematically design an Enhanced-AGC (E-AGC).
   System performance is defined to consider tradeoff between quality of
   frequency regulation and its cost. Our proposed E-AGC generally supports
   coordination of several interconnected control areas for achieving the
   best performance at the system level. The proposed E-AGC is illustrated
   by simulating a small two-control area system and a 2000 bus, 15
   generator real-world power system of Sao Miguel Island in the Azores
   Archipelago of Portugal. A comparison with system response of today's
   AGC is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{State Estimation (SE) plays a key role in power system operation and
   management. For AC power system state estimation, SE is usually
   formalized mathematically as a Weighted Least Square or Weighted Least
   Absolute Value problem, and solved by Newton's method. Although
   computationally tractable, Newton's method is highly sensitive to the
   initial point, as it is essentially a local search algorithm. In this
   paper, we propose a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) approach to
   effectively obtain a good initial state to improve the performance of
   the existing Newton's method. Our simulation results not only show that
   the SDP initial guess is much better than the currently used flat start
   on the IEEE standard bus systems, but also demonstrates approximately
   globally optimal results, with a lower bound provided in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{FACTS devices provide the opportunity for fast and flexible power flow
   control and consequently to improve the usage of the existing
   transmission system. Given the desire to increase the amount of wind
   generation, these devices play an important role in efficiently bringing
   the power from these resources to the loads. In this paper, a control
   scheme is proposed to determine the optimal steady-state settings of the
   FACTS devices in order to fully utilize the existing transmission
   infrastructures in the presence of intermittent and variable energy
   resources. The proposed control approach is a two-stage algorithm based
   on regression analysis, which calculates the optimal settings of the
   FACTS devices by only using a limited amount of local information. The
   control approach is implemented for the thyristor-controlled series
   compensator (TCSC) and tested in the IEEE 14-bus system. Simulation
   results are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed
   two-stage control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing related insider threats are often listed as a serious
   concern by security researchers, but to date this threat has not been
   thoroughly explored. We believe the fundamental nature of current
   insider threats will remain relatively unchanged in a cloud environment,
   but the paradigm does reveal new exploit possibilities. The common
   notion of a cloud insider as a rogue administrator of a service provider
   is discussed, but we also present two additional cloud-related insider
   risks: the insider who exploits a cloud-related vulnerability to steal
   information from a cloud system, and the insider who uses cloud systems
   to carry out an attack on an employer's local resources. We also
   characterize a hierarchy of administrators within cloud service
   providers, give examples of attacks from real insider threat cases, and
   show how the nature of cloud systems architectures enables attacks to
   succeed. Finally, we discuss our position on future cloud research.}},

Abstract = {{Multigenerational oxidation chemistry of atmospheric organic compounds
   and its effects on aerosol loadings and chemical composition is
   investigated by implementing the Two-Dimensional Volatility Basis Set
   (2-D-VBS) in a Lagrangian host chemical transport model. Three model
   formulations were chosen to explore the complex interactions between
   functionalization and fragmentation processes during gas-phase oxidation
   of organic compounds by the hydroxyl radical. The base case model
   employs a conservative transformation by assuming a reduction of one
   order of magnitude in effective saturation concentration and an increase
   of oxygen content by one or two oxygen atoms per oxidation generation. A
   second scheme simulates functionalization in more detail using group
   contribution theory to estimate the effects of oxygen addition to the
   carbon backbone on the compound volatility. Finally, a fragmentation
   scheme is added to the detailed functionalization scheme to create a
   functionalization-fragmentation parameterization. Two condensed-phase
   chemistry pathways are also implemented as additional sensitivity tests
   to simulate (1) heterogeneous oxidation via OH uptake to the
   particle-phase and (2) aqueous-phase chemistry of glyoxal and
   methylglyoxal. The model is applied to summer and winter periods at
   three sites where observations of organic aerosol (OA) mass and O:C were
   obtained during the European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate
   and Air Quality Interactions (EUCAARI) campaigns. The base case model
   reproduces observed mass concentrations and O:C well, with fractional
   errors (FE) lower than 55\% and 25 \%, respectively. The detailed
   functionalization scheme tends to overpredict OA concentrations,
   especially in the summertime, and also underpredicts O:C by
   approximately a factor of 2. The detailed functionalization model with
   fragmentation agrees well with the observations for OA concentration,
   but still underpredicts O:C. Both heterogeneous oxidation and
   aqueous-phase processing have small effects on OA levels but
   heterogeneous oxidation, as implemented here, does enhance O:C by about
   0.1. The different schemes result in very different fractional
   attribution for OA between anthropogenic and biogenic sources.}},

   information routing through a stochastic mechanism. Being the problem of
   optimally determining the edge probabilities computationally

Abstract = {{We present an approach to verify the planned maneuvers of an automated
   car. The main idea is to compute the occupancy of the automated car on
   the road using reachable sets, which makes it possible to check if one
   collides with other traffic participants, or leaves the drivable area.
   The specialty of the presented approach is that all possible
   uncertainties in the form of sensor noise, uncertain friction
   coefficient, and uncertain initial states, are considered. Maneuvers are
   periodically verified on-board to account for the variety of possible
   traffic situations, requiring an efficient algorithm. Thus, the
   underlying vehicle model has to be a compromise between accuracy and
   simplicity. The inexactness of the model is compensated by adding
   disturbance to the model such that it contains high-order model
   behavior. This is demonstrated by exploring the state space with
   rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) of a high-order model and check
   whether it leaves the reachable area of the low-order model used for
   verification.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for leveraging the power of theorem
   provers for formal verification to provide sufficient conditions that
   can be checked on embedded control designs. Theorem provers are often
   most efficient when using generic models that abstract away many of the
   controller details, but with these abstract models very general
   conditions can be verified under which desirable properties such as
   safety can be guaranteed for the closed-loop system. We propose an
   approach in which these sufficient conditions are static conditions that
   can be checked for the specific controller design, without having to
   include the dynamics of the plant. We demonstrate this approach using
   the KeYmaera theorem prover for differential dynamic logic for two
   examples: an intelligent cruise controller and a cooperative
   intersection collision avoidance system (CICAS) for left-turn assist. In
   each case, safety of the closed-loop system proved using KeYmaera
   provides static sufficient conditions that are checked for the
   controller design.}},

Abstract = {{Root locus design for integral control using the dominant second order
   poles technique often gives unsatisfactory results for two reasons. The
   first reason is that the zeros of the compensator cause the overshoot to
   be much larger than the overshoot of the model second order system with
   the desired poles. The second, more subtle problem is that poles at the
   origin moving along the negative real axis cannot move left past real
   axis zeros. These ``blocked{''} poles often end up dominating the
   closed-loop response. This paper presents an easy to follow design
   procedure using the Complex Proportional-Integral-Lead (CPIL)
   compensator or Complex Proportional-Integral-Super-Lead (CPISL)
   compensator to address the ``blocked{''} poles issue. The procedure also
   uses the parallel-inner loop form of implementing a controller with
   integral action to address the excess overshoot issue. We illustrate
   this design procedure for a double integrator plant.}},

   Bode magnitude and phase plots. The contours indicate level sets of a

   technique to design a compensator which avoids the areas of the CRCBode
   plot with performance index greater than zero, and we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of this technique for flow-rate control of a dynamic
   nonlinear butterfly valve system. Finally we verify the performance of

   the ML recursion based on infinite time approximation and semidefinite

   that initiates the estimation process. To improve the convergence rate
   of the algorithm, we consider the case where selected nodes collaborate
   with their neighbors. Simulation results are used to characterize the
   performance and energy efficiency of the algorithm. We also illustrate
   estimation accuracy/energy consumption trade-off by varying the

Abstract = {{In this work we focus on the development of the Horizontal Ribbon Growth
   technique to produce highly pure silicon wafers for use in solar cells.
   We divide this preliminary work in two parts: a small scale experiment
   and the development of mathematical models to describe the
   crystallization phenomena. We begin by constructing a laboratory scale
   experiment to demonstrate the HRG concept using water as the working
   fluid. We made use of the fact that ice floats on water just like
   silicon would float on top of its melt. Therefore it is possible to
   conveniently test and analyze the operability of this technique. We find
   that the initial seeding process needs to be carefully controlled in
   order to extract a uniform wafer. Appropriate surface cooling and wall
   heating are necessary to guarantee the continuous formation of an ice
   film. We then develop simple mathematical models to predict the
   crystallization rate and thermal profiles of the system. We state that
   the driving force for crystallization is convective cooling and the film
   grows in one direction (downwards). Finally we propose how to validate
   the model using experimental data and how to extend the work to grow
   silicon ribbons.}},

   octree-based dual contouring method to construct surface and volumetric
   meshes for complicated domains with topology ambiguity resolved.
   However, this method is based on enumeration and cannot handle domains
   with multiple materials. As a follow up, in this study we develop an
   automatic and efficient approach to resolve topology ambiguity for
   multiple-material domains. We first use an indicator variable to
   identify the topology inside each octree leaf cell; whenever one cell is
   ambiguous, we split the cell into 12 tetrahedra. In the following we
   analyze each material-change edge to create triangles or boundary
   tetrahedra with surrounding minimizers. For tetrahedral meshes, in
   addition to material-change edges we need to analyze each interior edge
   to create interior tetrahedra. With the ambiguity-free mesh ready, we
   are able to apply quality improvement techniques to attain good mesh
   quality. Our main contribution lies in resolving topology ambiguity by
   analyzing a hybrid octree with both cubic and tetrahedral leaf cells,
   and this method works for both homogeneous and multiple-material
   domains. We have applied our algorithm to three complicated material
   datasets and obtained good results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Sensor Fly is a novel, low-cost, miniature (29g) controlled-mobile
   aerial sensor networking platform. Mobility permits a network of Sensor
   Fly nodes, unlike fixed networks, to be autonomous in deployment,

   response situations such as fire monitoring or survivor search.
   We demonstrate the ability of the Sensor Fly system to collaboratively
   sense the environment (floor temperature) in a demonstration scenario.
   The Sensor Fly nodes are tasked to explore the area and transmit sensed
   data back to a base station. The system partitions tasks among Sensor
   Fly nodes based on their capabilities (location, sensors, energy) to
   achieve concurrent and faster coverage. The real-time sensor data is
   presented to the user on a display terminal at the base station.}},

   equally bioactive}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{7425-7434}},
Abstract = {{Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been dispersed with proteins
   to increase biocompatibility and specificity, but examinations of
   dispersion parameters on functional cellular uptake are required for
   utilization of SWCNTs in biological applications. Here we correlate
   conditions of SWCNT dispersion with various proteins to uptake these
   SWCNTs in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and J774A. 1 macrophage-like cells. We
   varied protein types (bovine serum albumin - BSA, lysozyme - LSZ, and
   gamma-globulins - gamma G), protein : SWCNT ratio and sonication time.
   Each protein created stable, high yield (similar to 25\%) dispersions in
   water while preserving intrinsic SWCNT fluorescence, but SWCNT-LSZ
   flocculated in media and SWCNT-gamma G formed clusters in both water and
   media, drastically altering cellular internalization. Dispersion quality
   and yield improved with increased protein : SWCNT - without substantial
   effects from depletion attraction, even at 100 : 1 protein : SWCNT - and
   slightly increased internalized SWCNTs for both NIH-3T3 and J774A. 1
   cells. Longer sonication time (12 versus 2 h) improved the dispersion
   yield and quality but caused minor damage to SWCNTs and altered protein
   structure. Cell association of SWCNT-BSA was homogenous and unaltered by
   sonication time. Bulk assay showed that cell association of SWCNT-LSZ
   and SWCNT-gamma G was altered with 12 versus 2 h sonication, but imaging
   of individual cells showed that these differences are likely from
   precipitation of clusters of SWCNT-LSZ and SWCNT-gamma G in media onto
   cells. Hence, the quality of SWCNT-protein dispersions in water does not
   necessarily correlate with bulk cellular uptake, and quantification at
   the level of individual cells is required to determine delivery
   efficacy.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{41}},
Pages = {{10759-10772}},
Abstract = {{The adsorption of particles to fluid-fluid interfaces is a key step in
   the generation of colloidosomes and particle-stabilized emulsions.
   Microfluidic channels are a promising tool for generating
   particle-stabilized drops and bubbles with independent control over the
   bubble size and the concentration of particles adsorbed at the fluid
   interface. In this paper, we present experimental observations of the
   adsorption of a nanoparticle-surfactant suspension to confined bubbles
   translating along a microchannel. Long bubbles exhibit a unique
   two-lobed shape that is linked to the adsorption of surface-active
   particles to the interface at a timescale comparable to the residence
   time in the channel. An accompanying decrease in the bubble velocity
   results from the added viscous drag at the bubble interface. We develop
   a transport model to describe the rate of particle adsorption to the
   interface and find good agreement between the model estimates of bubble
   shape changes and experimental observation. The formation of the
   two-lobed shape is due to a difference in the velocity of the front and
   rear of the bubble, which can promote bubble break-up.}},

   We present an algorithm for continuous, online stereo extrinsic
   re-calibration operating only on sparse stereo correspondences on a

   each frame, with a fixed baseline, making it possible to model
   time-dependent variations. The initial extrinsic estimates are found by
   minimizing epipolar errors, and are refined via a Kalman Filter (KF).
   Observation covariances are derived from the Cramer-Rao lower bound of
   the solution uncertainty. The algorithm operates at frame rate with
   unoptimized Matlab code with over 1000 correspondences per frame. We
   validate its performance using a variety of real stereo datasets and

Abstract = {{While SRAM and DRAM are often assumed to have very small data retention
   times (bits are lost immediately at power-down) and no data remanence
   (stored bits leave no traces even after a prolonged storage period),
   under some conditions these assumptions do not hold. Both retention and
   remanence have been exploited by malicious attackers to compromise
   system data and encryption keys in secure systems. To precisely measure
   retention and remanence in SRAM and DRAM, we implemented specially
   instrumented 6T SRAM and 3T DRAM test structures in 65nm bulk CMOS and
   tested them from -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C and under accelerated
   aging conditions. Results show that the 50\% retention time (i.e., half
   the bits retained data) is 44 ms for the 6T SRAM and 3.8 ms for the 3T
   DRAM at -40 degrees C. Further, the data remanence effects were
   exploited to predict stored bits with over 82\% accuracy for 22\% of a
   4kb SRAM array.}},

Abstract = {{Grain size and texture are very important for controlling the magnetic
   properties in non-oriented electrical steel. Grain size and texture are
   closely related because the texture usually changes during grain growth.
   In this study, texture changes with grain growth in non-oriented
   electrical steel are investigated. Two kinds of materials, Sample A and
   Sample B, were prepared in order to study the differences of the
   texture. Sample A, Fe-0.5wt\%Si, is not annealed before cold rolling.
   Sample B, the same chemical composition as Sample A, is annealed before
   cold rolling. In Sample A, the \{111\} texture component increases
   markedly during grain growth. By contrast, in Sample B, the increase in
   \{111\} is less pronounced. The recrystallized orientations in both
   Samples are analyzed, and computer simulation is used to attempt to
   explain the texture changes during grain growth. In the case of Sample
   A, the simulations reproduce the experimental result well; for Sample B,
   however, the simulations do not agree as well. The microstructures
   before annealing exhibit strong alignment of the orientations, which
   will require a new approach to building the digital microstructures for
   instantiation of the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{During anisotropic curvature driven grain growth, high-energy grain
   boundaries are preferentially eliminated, thus leading to interface
   texture development and a higher population of low energy grain
   boundaries. However, when stress is introduced as an additional driving
   force, the dynamics of grain growth change. To model these effects, a
   three dimensional anisotropic multi-level set model was modified in
   order to account for the effect of stress field on grain growth. For
   this mesoscale study, grain boundaries were treated as dislocation
   structures and their associated net Burgers vectors were calculated
   using the misorientation information and boundary inclinations. Using
   these net Burgers vectors and their associated densities, additional
   forces due to stress field were calculated via the Peach-Koehler
   equation. Qualitative comparisons of 5 parameter grain boundary
   character distribution will be carried out in order to analyze the
   differences in texture evolution during grain growth.}},

Abstract = {{During large-strain plastic deformation, subgrain structures typically
   develop within the grains. At large enough equivalent strains above, say
   0.5, recrystallization occurs via abnormal coarsening of the subgrain
   structure or abnormal (sub-) grain growth (AsGG). The fraction of
   subgrains that develop into new, recrystallized grains has been
   quantified as a function of texture spread (Grain Reference Orientation
   Deviation) using Monte Carlo simulation. When this fraction is combined
   with the known monotonic increase in mean misorientation with strain,
   the recrystallized grain size can be predicted as a function of von
   Mises strain. The prediction is in good agreement with experimental
   results drawn from the literature.}},

   annealing behavior in high purity aluminum. In-situ measurements were
   carried out at Sector 1 of the Advanced Photon Source. The
   microstructure in a small sub-volume of a I mm diameter wire was mapped
   in the as-received state and after two differential anneals. Forward
   modeling analysis reveals three dimensional grain structures and
   internal orientation distributions inside grains. The analysis
   demonstrates increased ordering with annealing as well as persistent low
   angle internal boundaries. Grains that grow from disordered regions are
   resolution limited single crystals. Together with this recovery
   behavior, we observe subtle motions of some grain boundaries due to
   annealing.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit grain growth and the puzzle of its stagnation in thin
   metallic films. We bring together a large body of experimental data that
   includes the size of more than 30,000 grains obtained from 23 thin film
   samples of Al and Cu with thicknesses in the range of 25 to 158 nm. In
   addition to grain size, a broad range of other metrics such as the
   number of sides and the average side class of nearest neighbors is used
   to compare the experimental results with the results of two dimensional
   simulations of grain growth with isotropic boundary energy. In order to
   identify the underlying cause of the differences between these
   simulations and experiments, five factors are examined. These are (i)
   surface energy and elastic strain energy reduction, (ii) anisotropy of
   grain boundary energy, and retarding and pinning forces such as (iii)
   solute drag, (iv) grain boundary grooving and (v) triple junction drag.
   No single factor provides an explanation for the observed experimental
   behavior.}},

   approach is derived from extensive field-reliability data collected on
   state-of-the-art silicon power MOSFETs in compact computer/telecom power
   supplies that clearly suggests that power MOSFET field-failures were
   primarily caused by bulk material defects. A careful survey of power
   switch technologies reported to-date in Silicon Carbide (SiC) and
   Gallium Nitride (GaN) further suggests that excessive bulk material
   defects have predominantly hindered the development and
   commercialization of cost-effective, high-performance, and reliable
   high-power devices. A reliability-driven approach is likely to
   ``unlock{''} the vast potential of SiC (and GaN for moderate power
   levels) power device technology for high-voltage and high-power
   switching electronics in order to impact transfonnative changes.}},

Title = {{Hemifusion of giant unilamellar vesicles with planar hydrophobic
   surfaces: a fluorescence microscopy study}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{42}},
Pages = {{10877-10886}},
Abstract = {{Vesicle adhesion and fusion to interfaces are frequently used for the
   construction of biomimetic surfaces in biosensors and drug delivery.
   Ubiquitous in cell biology, vesicle fusion involves the transformation
   of two separate membranes into one contiguous lipid bilayer. In
   distinction, the deposition of vesicle membranes to hydrophobic surfaces
   requires the transformation of a lipidic bilayer into a monomolecular
   layer - a topologically distinct process termed hemifusion. Here, we
   used hydrophobically terminated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on
   solid surfaces to track the hemifusion of fluorescently labeled giant
   unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) at the single vesicle level with video time
   resolution (approximate to 53 ms). We observed that a dilute monolayer,
   consisting of lipid extracted from the outer GUV leaflet, spreads
   outward across the hydrophobic surface from the vesicle adhesion site.
   Subsequently, bilayer hemifusion occurs by vesicle rupture near the
   hydrophobic surface, followed by spreading of lipid in a dense
   monolayer. GUV lipids thus transfer to the SAM surface in two concentric
   zones: an outer hemifusion zone comprises lipids drawn from the outer
   GUV leaflet and an inner hemifusion zone comprises lipids from both the
   inner and outer GUV leaflets and grows at a rate of approximate to 1000
   mu m(2) s(-1) (dA/dt = 970 +/- 430 mm(2) s(-1) in n = 22 independent
   experiments). This growth rate is quantitatively consistent with the
   assumption that the spreading of the monolayer is entirely driven by the
   difference in surface energies of the hydrophobic and the lipid-covered
   SAM surfaces, which is dissipated by friction of the spreading monolayer
   on the SAM. Lipid transfer between the inner and outer GUV leaflets
   occurs via a hemifusion pore that forms early in the process near the
   membrane contact site. This pore also permits expulsion of water from
   the GUV interior as the vesicle contracts onto the contact site.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting objects in shadows is a challenging task in computer vision.
   For example, in clear path detection application, strong shadows on the
   road confound the detection of the boundary between clear path and
   obstacles, making clear path detection algorithms less robust.
   Shadow removal, relies on the classification of edges as shadow edges or
   non-shadow edges. We present an algorithm to detect strong shadow edges,
   which enables us to remove shadows. By analyzing the patch-based
   characteristics of shadow edges and non-shadow edges (e.g., object
   edges), the proposed detector can discriminate strong shadow edges from
   other edges in images by learning the distinguishing characteristics. In
   addition, spatial smoothing is used to further improve shadow edge
   detection. Numerical experiments show convincing results that shadows on
   the road are either removed or attenuated with few visual artifacts,
   which benefits the clear path detection. In addition, we show that the
   proposed method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms in different
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel filtering technique that uses contact
   detection data and environmental stiffness estimates to register and
   localize a robot with respect to an a priori 3D surface model. The
   algorithm leverages geometric constraints within a Kalman filter
   framework and relies on two distinct update procedures: 1) an equality
   constrained step for when the robot is forcefully contacting the
   environment, and 2) an inequality constrained step for when the robot
   lies in the free-space of the environment. This filtering procedure
   registers the robot by incrementally eliminating probabilistically
   infeasible state space regions until a high likelihood solution emerges.
   In addition to registration and localization, the algorithm can estimate
   the deformation of the surface model and can detect false positives with
   respect to contact estimation. This method is experimentally evaluated
   with an experiment involving a continuum robot interacting with a
   bench-top flexible structure. The presented algorithm produces an
   experimental error in registration (with respect to the end-effector
   position) of 1.1 mm, which is less than 0.8 percent of the robot length.}},

Abstract = {{This study concerns the development of a new device prototype to address
   the unmet need for visualization of physical effects associated with
   large-scale cryopreservation-the preservation of tissues at very low
   temperatures. An early prototype of this device has been presented in
   2005, and was termed the cryomacroscope. The goal in the current study
   is to develop an advanced-stage prototype of the cryomacroscope, with
   the following design objectives: (1) to visualize and record the process
   of cryopreservation in situ, (2) to design the device as an add-on unit
   for commercially available controlled-rate freezers, (3) to enable
   scanning of large samples, (4) to enable identification of physical
   effects such as ice formation and fracturing, and (5) to integrate data
   into a single movie, including time, temperature, and camera position.
   Results of this study demonstrate glass formation, crystallization, and
   fracture formation during a typical cryopreservation protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research is underway to build chips with potentially hundreds
   of cores. In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling periodic
   real-time tasks on multi-core processors. We develop a task partitioning
   algorithm called Period-COMPatible-Allocation and Task-Splitting
   (pCOMPATS) for fixed-priority scheduling of preemptive hard real-time
   tasks where the utilization of each of the tasks is less than 50\%.
   pCOMPATS clusters compatible tasks together with task splitting to
   improve the achievable utilization. We show that as the number of cores
   increases, the least upper bound on schedulable utilization achieved
   using pCOMPATS approaches 100\% per core. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first result that shows that the utilization bound improves
   as the number of processing cores in the system increases. We refer to
   tasks having utilization greater than or equal to 50\% as heavy tasks
   and provide a task-partitioning algorithm called pCOMPATS-HT for
   allocating such tasks. We show that the upper bound on schedulable
   utilization when tasks are scheduled using pCOMPATS-HT is at most 72\%.
   We also evaluate the performance of pCOMPATS and other well-known
   partitioning techniques, and show that using pCOMPATS provides much
   better schedulable utilization in the average case. We characterize the
   overhead of pCOMPATS using measurements on an Intel Core i7 processor
   running Linux/RK. The overheads are seen to be low on the platform,
   making pCOMPATS to be practical. Our results are especially useful in
   the context of future many-core processors with dozens to hundreds of
   cores per processor.}},

Abstract = {{Prevailing VLSI trends point to a growing gap between the scaling of
   on-chip processing throughput and off-chip memory bandwidth. An
   efficient use of memory bandwidth must become a first-class design
   consideration in order to fully utilize the processing capability of
   highly concurrent processing platforms like FPGAs. In this paper, we
   present key aspects of this challenge in developing FPGA-based
   implementations of two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) where
   the large datasets must reside off-chip in DRAM. Our scalable
   implementations address the memory bandwidth bottleneck through both (1)
   algorithm design to enable efficient DRAM access patterns and (2)
   datapath design to extract the maximum compute throughput for a given
   level of memory bandwidth. We present results for double-precision
   2D-FFT up to size 2,048-by-2,048. On an Altera DE4 platform our
   implementation of the 2,048-by-2,048 2D-FFT can achieve over 19.2
   Gflop/s from the 12 GByte/s maximum DRAM bandwidth available. The
   results also show that our FPGA-based implementations of 2D-FFT are more
   efficient than 2D-FFT running on state-of-the-art CPUs and GPUs in terms
   of the bandwidth and power efficiency.}},

   application. A potentially large number of narrowband radars with
   isotropic antennas monitor a two-dimensional area for an unknown number
   of targets. We use techniques from compressive sensing to distribute
   efficient projections of network observations, allowing for
   reconstruction of the target scene using a single snapshot of sensor
   data. We avoid the use of a fusion node, allowing all radars to
   individually estimate target locations after iterative communication
   with neighboring sensors. We study the robustness of the discretization
   of continuous target locations, comparing estimation performance of
   basis pursuit reconstruction methods to a sparse estimator based on a
   model-robust formulation. We test the approach on simulated scenarios,
   showing tradeoffs in the resolution of target localization as well as
   the communication bandwidths required for this inter-radar cooperation

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic solar panels are effective energy sources during periods of
   bright sunlight. Excess energy can be stored for later use at night or
   on cloudy days. The decision to use the stored energy now or later
   depends largely on being able to predict the weather on different
   timescales. Short term prediction of stored energy is challenging due to
   the non-trivial I-V characteristic of the solar cell. The erratic nature
   of the weather makes long term predictive energy management difficult.
   In this paper, we address these issues based on data collected from a
   solar panel, as well as its relationship to observations made of the
   weather. We observe that prediction, based on fuzzy decision trees,
   reduces the energy error by 22\% compared to a constant prediction equal
   to the average on the studied period. Thus, exploiting the fuzzy
   classification provided by a fuzzy decision tree is a good improvement
   compared to the baseline.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional regional chemical transport model (CTM) with
   detailed aerosol microphysics, PMCAMx-UF, was applied to the European
   domain to simulate the contribution of direct emissions and secondary
   formation to total particle number concentrations during May 2008.
   PMCAMx-UF uses the Dynamic Model for Aerosol Nucleation and the
   Two-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) algorithm to track both aerosol
   number and mass concentration using a sectional approach. The model
   predicts nucleation events that occur over scales of hundreds up to
   thousands of kilometers especially over the Balkans and Southeast
   Europe. The model predictions were compared against measurements from 7
   sites across Europe. The model reproduces more than 70\% of the hourly
   concentrations of particles larger than 10 nm (N-10) within a factor of
   2. About half of these particles are predicted to originate from
   nucleation in the lower troposphere. Regional nucleation is predicted to
   increase the total particle number concentration by approximately a
   factor of 3. For particles larger than 100 nm the effect varies from an
   increase of 20\% in the eastern Mediterranean to a decrease of 20\% in
   southern Spain and Portugal resulting in a small average increase of
   around 1\% over the whole domain. Nucleation has a significant effect in
   the predicted N-50 levels (up to a factor of 2 increase) mainly in areas
   where there are condensable vapors to grow the particles to larger
   sizes. A semi-empirical ternary sulfuric acid-ammonia-water
   parameterization performs better than the activation or the kinetic
   parameterizations in reproducing the observations. Reducing emissions of
   ammonia and sulfur dioxide affects certain parts of the number size
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{As proposed in Part I of this paper, the accelerating effect of
   thiocyanate on active dissolution of stainless steel in acid sulfate
   solution occurs by adsorption of sulfur on the steel surface, causing
   accelerated dissolution of chromium from the steel surface. Surface
   analysis (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was performed on pure
   chromium and nickel, a high-purity Fe-20wt\% Cr alloy and Type 430 and
   Type 304 stainless steel to test the proposed mechanism. Surface
   analysis of the Fe-20wt\% Cr alloy and stainless steels (Types 430 and
   304) confirmed that chromium enriched on the metal surface during anodic
   dissolution in thiocyanate-free solution and that the surface enrichment
   of chromium was smaller in thiocyanate-containing solution. Surface
   analysis also confirmed the formation of sulfide or adsorbed sulfur on
   the Fe-20wt\% Cr alloy in thiocyanate-containing solution. Surface
   restructuring of sulfide-covered electrode (Type 304 stainless steel and
   nickel) was the possible reason why increased anodic current density was
   observed immediately following interruption of anodic polarization for
   periods of 5 s to 120 s. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Recently published work investigated the mechanism of the catalytic
   effect of thiocyanate on the active dissolution of ferritic stainless
   steel (Type 430 stainless steel). This work has been extended to Type
   304 stainless steel. Potentiostatic and impedance measurements were
   performed on pure iron, pure chromium, pure nickel and Type 304
   stainless steel in 1 M SO42- solutions at pH = 2.5 and pH = 0. As
   proposed for Type 430 stainless steel, the catalytic effect of
   thiocyanate on anodic dissolution of Type 304 stainless steel also
   appears to be primarily caused by the increased dissolution rate of
   chromium, counteracting the formation of the Cr-O-Cr passivating network
   at ledges. Nickel does contribute to the corrosion resistance of Type
   304 stainless steel in the presence of thiocyanate, but its beneficial
   effect appears to be secondary to that of chromium. (C) 2012 The

Pages = {{20-37}},
Abstract = {{Two new high-order local absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) are
   devised for use on an artificial boundary for time-dependent elastic
   waves in unbounded domains, in two dimensions. The elastic medium in the
   exterior domain is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. The first
   ABC is written directly with respect to the displacement vector field,
   using an operator involving high derivatives. The second ABC is applied
   to the problem written in a first-order conservation form, using
   stresses and velocities as variables, and is formulated as a sequence of
   recursive relations using auxiliary variables. The two ABCs are not
   equivalent but are closely related. In each case, the order of the ABC
   determines its accuracy and can be chosen to be arbitrarily high. Both
   ABCs involve a product of first-order differential operators; all of
   them are of the Higdon type, except one which is of the
   Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer type. The stability of both ABCs is analyzed
   theoretically. The second (stress-velocity) ABC is implemented,
   employing a finite difference discretization scheme in space and time.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the scheme. To the
   best of the authors' knowledge, these are the first existing local
   high-order ABCs for elastodynamics which are long-time stable. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for obtaining in situ,
   through-thickness measurements of potential, current, charging current,
   and charge stored or discharged across capacitor and battery electrodes.
   Here we apply the method to an electrochemical double layer capacitance
   (EDLC) negative electrode for an aqueous sodium hybrid battery. In this
   approach, an electrode scaffold (ES) is used to directly measure the
   electric potential at discrete distances through the electrode under
   charging and discharging conditions. Finite difference methods are used
   to calculated local current and charging/discharging rates. The
   distributions obtained from these measurements are used to show
   non-uniform charging across an ultra-thick electrode intended for high
   area-specific energy storage in grid-scale energy storage applications.
   Using the ES we are able to gain insight into several complex phenomena
   that cannot be directly observed by other methods. For instance, we
   identify the portions of the electrode that are underutilized as well as
   the location of stray, parasitic currents. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Previous work suggests if it were possible to lower sea-surface
   temperature using wind-wave pumps, it would sometime make sense to try
   to reduce the wind speed of a tropical cyclone (TC) that is likely to
   make landfall. While currently there is no plausible strategy to steer a
   TC, suppose that TC landfall location could be altered and subsequent
   damages perhaps reduced. Here, we ask whether and when such a
   modification might be desirable. As a thought experiment, we consider a
   hypothetical TC that will make landfall on the east coast of Florida.
   Using results from previous detailed damage modeling, we examine three
   simplified scenarios of TC modification resulting in altered landfall
   location. Even in these simplified scenarios, and assuming a zero cost
   for modification, we find that unless it becomes possible to steer a
   hurricane to the open ocean with something approaching certainty, it is
   likely that the complexities of the decision will always make it
   undesirable to undertake a modification intended to steer TCs.}},

Title = {{A criterion to assess the impact of confined volumes on surfactant
   transport to liquid-fluid interfaces}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{8917-8925}},
Abstract = {{When dissolved surfactant adsorbs at an interface, the bulk
   concentration decreases. If the initial concentration is low or the
   interfacial area large, the concentration decrease can be significant,
   and the solution depleted. Although depletion is not a new phenomenon,
   properly accounting for it requires a global mass conservation
   constraint in addition to a mass transport model. The emergence of new
   applications involving adsorption in finite volumes and with large
   surface areas, including micro- and nanoscale droplet formation, has
   introduced new scenarios in which depletion can be significant but
   complex to analyze. The purpose of this paper is to develop simple
   criteria to allow practitioners in these applications to rapidly and
   easily assess the potential impact of depletion. We use a global mass
   balance to show that two dimensionless parameters fully describe the
   role of depletion in both equilibrium surface properties and timescales
   to reach equilibrium. The dimensionless parameters represent the
   potential mass lost to the interface, denoted xi, and the surface
   activity of the surfactant, denoted f. Characteristic transport
   timescales are shown to be a function of the finite geometry. A scaling
   analysis is developed for the case of surfactant dissolved inside a
   spherical drop, and compared with that of a finite spherical shell. The
   analyses developed here lead to simple criteria that are useful even
   when the surfactant properties are not well characterized or a full
   transport analysis is difficult. The criteria can be generalized to
   adsorption at solid surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{For mobile robots, the essential units of actuation, computation, and
   sensing must be designed to fit within the body of the robot. Additional
   capabilities will largely depend upon a given activity, and should be
   easily reconfigurable to maximize the diversity of applications and
   experiments. To address this issue, we introduce a modular architecture
   originally developed and tested in the design and implementation of the
   X-RHex hexapod that allows the robot to operate as a mobile laboratory
   on legs. In the present paper we will introduce the specification,
   design and very earliest operational data of Canid, an actively driven
   compliant-spined quadruped whose completely different morphology and
   intended dynamical operating point are nevertheless built around exactly
   the same ``Lab on Legs{''} actuation, computation, and sensing
   infrastructure. We will review as well, more briefly a second RHex
   variation, the XRL platform, built using the same components.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{4613-4623}},
Abstract = {{Tracking cells after therapeutic transplantation is imperative for
   evaluation of implanted cell fate and function. In this study,
   ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO NPs) were
   surface functionalized with water-soluble chitosan, a cationic
   polysaccharide that mediates enhanced endocytic uptake, endosomal escape
   into the cytosol, and subsequent long-term retention of nanoparticles.
   NP surface and chitosan were independently fluorescently labeled. Our
   NPs enable NP trafficking studies and determination of fate beyond
   uptake by fluorescence microscopy as well as tracking of labeled cells
   as localized regions of hypointensity in T-2{*}-weighted magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) images. Adult rat neural stem cells (NSCs) were
   labeled with NPs, and assessment of NSC proliferation rates and
   differentiation potential revealed no significant differences between
   labeled and unlabeled NSCs. Significantly enhanced uptake of chitosan
   NPs in comparison to native NPs was confirmed by transmission electron
   microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and in vitro
   cellular MRI at 11.7 Tesla. While only negligible fractions of native
   NPs enter cells, chitosan NPs appear within membranous vesicles within 2
   hours of exposure. Additionally, chitosan-functionalized NPs escaped
   from membrane-bound vesicles within days, circumventing NP
   endo-lysosomal trafficking and exocytosis and hence enabling long-term
   tracking of labeled cells. Finally, our labeling strategy does not
   contain any NSC-specific reagents. To demonstrate general applicability
   across a variety of primary and immortalized cell types, embryonic mouse
   NSCs, mouse embryonic stem cells, HEK 293 kidney cells, and HeLa
   cervical cancer cells were additionally exposed to chitosan-USPIO NPs
   and exhibited similarly efficient loading as verified by NMR
   relaxometry. Our efficient and versatile labeling technology can support
   cell tracking with close to single cell resolution by MRI in vitro, for
   example, in complex tissue models not optically accessible by confocal
   or multi-photon fluorescence microscopy, and potentially in vivo, for
   example, in animal models of human disease or injury.}},

Abstract = {{The development of optofluidic-based technology has ushered in a new era
   of lab-on-a-chip functionality, including miniaturization of biomedical
   devices, enhanced sensitivity for molecular detection, and multiplexing
   of optical measurements. While having great potential, optofluidic
   devices have only begun to be exploited in many biotechnological
   applications. Here, we highlight the potential of integrating
   optofluidic devices with synthetic biological systems, which is a field
   focusing on creating novel cellular systems by engineering synthetic
   gene and protein networks. First, we review the development of synthetic
   biology at different length scales, ranging from single-molecule,
   single-cell, to cellular population. We emphasize light-sensitive
   synthetic biological systems that would be relevant for the integration
   with optofluidic devices. Next, we propose several areas for potential
   applications of optofluidics in synthetic biology. The integration of
   optofluidics and synthetic biology would have a broad impact on
   point-of-care diagnostics and biotechnology.}},

   chosen due to its invariance to scaling operations and robustness to
   wave velocity. From experimental results, we demonstrate that the Mellin
   transform features can detect a mass on a steel pipe under variable
   internal pressure with an overall average accuracy of 94.00\% while
   equivalent Fourier transform features detect the mass with only a
   67.00\% accuracy.}},

   core-shell particles}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1945-1952}},
Abstract = {{Heterostructured powders composed of microcrystalline PbTiO3 cores
   coated with nanostructured TiO2 shells were prepared by a sol-gel
   method. When exposed to visible light (lambda > 420 nm), the
   heterostructured powder degrades methylene blue at a rate 4.8 times
   greater than PbTiO3, TiO2, or mechanical mixtures of the phases. The
   rate at which the heterostructured powder degrades methylene blue
   depends on the processing temperature; samples annealed at 500 degrees C
   are the most reactive, even though they do not have the highest surface
   area. Enhanced degradation rates were not observed for Pb-doped TiO2,
   indicating that it is the core-shell architecture and not contamination
   by lead that increases the reactivity. The improved reactivity of
   microcrystalline-PbTiO3/nanostructured-TiO2 heterostructures in visible
   light is attributed to visible light absorption in the PbTiO3 core,
   charge separation at the buried interface between the ferroelectric
   PbTiO3 and the dielectric TiO2, and dye degradation on the
   nanostructured TiO2 shell.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a simple one-step process for synthesis of ternary

   of this work was to develop a synthesis for the preparation of
   Cd-containing quantum dots using a Cd precursor with lower toxicity than
   those used in common syntheses. This synthesis makes use of Cd (acac)(2)
   which is significantly less toxic than precursors such as CdO and CdCl2.
   We have studied the effect of solvent boiling point, precursors and
   reaction time on the photoluminescence properties of the ternary quantum
   dots. Ternary quantum dots synthesized from Cd (acac)(2) in low boiling
   point solvents have photoluminescence wavelengths in the blue region,
   while those synthesized in high boiling point solvents have
   photoluminescence wavelengths in the red region.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of interaction forces when probing a silica
   core-polyelectrolyte brush shell nanoparticle, adsorbed on a silica
   substrate and bathed by aqueous electrolyte solution, with an ultrasharp
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip provides a spatially resolved map of
   heterogeneous mechanical properties across the nanoparticle. The
   deformation of the brush is mainly compressive when probed directly
   above the nanoparticle centre and mainly deflective when probed at a
   finite horizontal distance away from the centre. The brush is
   significantly stiffer against compression than against deflection, and
   ionization of the brush has a greater stiffening effect against
   compression than deflection. Whereas a height image of the core-shell
   nanoparticle was unremarkable, showing a monotonic decrease in height
   with increasing horizontal distance from the centre, brush deformation,
   energy dissipation and adhesion displayed local minima over the centre
   and maxima at a finite horizontal distance away from the centre,
   corresponding to a position near the rigid core nanoparticle edge. The
   different response to brush deformation depending on the angle of
   probing is relevant to the interactions of brush-decorated macroscopic
   surfaces with submicrometer roughness and to the interactions of
   brush-decorated nanoparticles with ultrafine structures in their

Abstract = {{This study investigates the reverse-flow phenomena of a polyacrylamide
   solution in a channel referred to as a ``test channel{''} with
   obstruction geometry at the entry placed in another wider
   parallel-walled channel. The influence of various obstruction geometries
   (i.e., shapes and sizes) plays a very important role in controlling
   reverse-flow behavior and is investigated in this study. The obstruction
   geometries used in this research were: flat plate, semicircle, circle,
   triangle, and rectangle with various aspect ratios. Experimental
   investigation and numerical simulations were carried out with a
   non-Newtonian 0.03\% (by weight) polyacrylamide solution that obeys a
   power-law behavior for a fixed Reynolds number of 2000. The
   non-Newtonian fluid results are compared with that of water. The flat
   plate produced the maximum reverse flow at a gap-to-width (g/w) ratio of
   1, whereas the triangle produced minimum reverse flow at a g/w ratio of
   0.5. The circular geometry produced the maximum forward flow, and the
   flat plate produced the minimum forward flow at a g/w ratio of 8. Good
   agreement has been observed between the experimental results and
   numerical simulations.}},

Title = {{Interaction of toroidal focal conic defects with shear flow}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{6698-6705}},
Abstract = {{Toroidal focal conic defects form in smectic liquid crystals due to
   antagonistic surface anchoring conditions. The resulting layer
   structure, defect size, and the formation of ordered patterns of defects
   have been studied in detail. Here, we investigate the effect of shear
   flow on toroidal focal conic defects. The defects are formed and
   subjected to a steady linear Couette flow in a microscale shear cell. In
   situ visualization of the evolution of the polarization texture of
   individual defects reveals the impact of three distinct flow regimes on
   the layer structure. At low Ericksen numbers, individual defects exhibit
   an early time elastic regime in which the optical intensity of the layer
   structure does not change in the presence of the applied shear flow. At
   increasing applied strains, the defect layer structure deforms,
   resulting in a monotonically increasing optical intensity within its
   original footprint. At even larger applied strains, satellite defects
   are emitted from the anchored defect. Cessation of shear flow at
   moderate strains, prior to the formation of satellite defects, leads to
   an exponential decay of the polarization intensity of the defect,
   suggesting that relaxation of the layer structure occurs with a time
   constant that is consistent with that predicted by a permeation flow
   mechanism. This study establishes the relevant length and time scales
   involved in the interaction of shear stresses and elastic stresses in
   smectic liquid crystalline samples whose structure deviates
   significantly from an idealized aligned lamellar configuration.}},

Title = {{Effect of Al2O3/SiO2 Ratio on the Viscosity and Structure of Slags}},
Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{753-758}},
Abstract = {{The present paper investigates how the mass ratio between Al2O3 and SiO2
   (m(Al2O3)/m(SiO2)) in slag compositions influences the structure,
   viscosity and crystallization of the slag melts. The objective is to
   study the variations in viscosity and structure of slags with increasing
   m(Al2O3)/m(SiO2) ratio. In practice the results of the study are
   relevant to the significant changes in slag property caused by the
   changes in chemical composition during continuous casting of steels
   containing high amounts of dissolved aluminum.
   The viscosity was found to decrease slightly with increasing
   m(Al2O3)/m(SiO2) ratio up to 0.56. The degree of polymerization for
   {[}SiO4]-tetrahedra was found to decrease with increasing
   m(Al2O3)/m(SiO2) ratio based on the Fourier Transformation-Infrared
   Spectra (FT-IR) and Raman spectra, which could explain the observed
   decrease in viscosity. Atm(Al2O3)/m(SiO2) ratios above 0.56, the
   viscosity was found to abruptly increase which could be caused by the
   presence of spinel crystals. The activity coefficient was computed and
   it was found that the activity coefficient of alumina presents negative
   deviation when m(Al2O3)/m(SiO2) ratio is less than 0.35, while it shows
   a positive deviation when m(Al2O3)/m(SiO2) ratio exceeds 0.35. This
   phenomenon may be related to the change of the primary phase region
   correlating to the phase diagram to the slag composition.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with economic objective
   attracts growing interest. In our previous work {[}1], nominal stability
   of economically oriented NMPC for cyclic processes was proved by
   introducing a transformed system, and an infinite horizon NMPC
   formulation with discount factors was proposed. Moreover, the nominal
   stability property for economically oriented NMPC was analyzed in {[}2]
   for a class of systems satisfying strong duality. In this study, we
   extend the previous stability analysis in {[}1] to a general infinite
   horizon NMPC formulation with economic objectives. Instead of the strong
   duality assumption, we require the stage cost to be strongly convex,
   which is easier to check for a general nonlinear system. In addition,
   robust stability of this NMPC controller is also analyzed based on the
   Input-to-State Stability (ISS) framework. A simulated nonlinear double
   tank system subject to periodic change in electricity price is presented
   to illustrate the stability property. Finally, an industrial size air
   separation unit case study with periodic electricity cost is presented.

Abstract = {{This work deals with state estimation and process control for nonlinear
   systems, especially when nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is
   integrated with extended Kalman filter (EKF) as the state estimator. In
   particular, we focus on the robust stability of NMPC and EKF in the
   presence of plant-model mismatch. The convergence property of the
   estimation error from the EKE in the presence of non-vanishing
   perturbations is established based on our previous work {[}1]. In
   addition, a so-called one way interaction is shown that the EKE error is
   not influenced by control action from the NMPC. Hence, the EKF analysis
   is still valid in the output-feedback NMPC framework, even though there
   is no separation principle for general nonlinear systems. With this
   result, we study the robust stability of the output-feedback NMPC under
   the impact of the estimation error. It turns out the output-feedback
   NMPC with EKF is Input-to-State practical Stable (ISpS). Finally, two
   offset-free strategies of output-feedback NMPC are presented and
   illustrated through a simulation example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a damage diagnosis algorithm for civil structures
   that uses a sequential change point detection method for the cases where
   the post-damage feature distribution is unknown a priori. This algorithm
   extracts features from structural vibration data using time-series
   analysis and then declares damage using the change point detection
   method. The change point detection method asymptotically minimizes
   detection delay for a given false alarm rate. The conventional method
   uses the known pre- and post-damage feature distributions to perform a
   sequential hypothesis test. In practice, however, the post-damage
   distribution is unlikely to be known a priori. Therefore, our algorithm
   estimates and updates this distribution as data are collected using the
   maximum likelihood and the Bayesian methods. We also applied an
   approximate method to reduce the computation load and memory requirement
   associated with the estimation. The algorithm is validated using
   multiple sets of simulated data and a set of experimental data collected
   from a four-story steel special moment-resisting frame. Our algorithm
   was able to estimate the post-damage distribution consistently and
   resulted in detection delays only a few seconds longer than the delays
   from the conventional method that assumes we know the post-damage
   feature distribution. We confirmed that the Bayesian method is
   particularly efficient in declaring damage with minimal memory
   requirement, but the maximum likelihood method provides an insightful
   heuristic approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the integrity attack on Cyber-Physical
   System(CPS), which is modeled as a discrete linear time-invariant system
   equipped with a Kalman filter, LQG controller and chi(2) failure
   detector. An attacker wishes to disturb the system by injecting external
   control inputs and fake sensor measurements. In order to perform the
   attack without being detected, the adversary will need to carefully
   design its actions to fool the failure detector as abnormal sensor
   measurements will result in an alarm. The adversary's strategy is
   formulated as a constrained control problem. In this paper, we
   characterize the reachable set of the system state and estimation error
   under the attack, which provides a quantitative measure of the
   resilience of the system. To this end, we will provide an ellipsoidal
   algorithm to compute the outer approximation of the reachable set. We
   also prove a necessary condition under which the reachable set is
   unbounded, indicating that the attacker can successfully destabilize the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Today's complex cyber-physical systems are being built increasingly
   using model-based development (MBD), where mathematical models for the
   system behavior are checked against design specifications using analysis
   tools. Different types of models and analysis tools are used to address
   different aspects of the system. While the use of heterogeneous
   formalisms supports a divide-and-conquer approach to complexity and
   allows engineers with different types of expertise to work on various
   aspects of the design, system integration problems can arise due to the
   lack of an underlying unifying formalism. In tins paper, we introduce
   the notion of behavior relations to address the problem of heterogeneity
   and propose constraints over parameters as a mechanism to manage
   inter-model dependencies and ensure consistency. In addition, we present
   structured constructs of nested conjunctive and disjunctive analyses to
   enable multi-model heterogeneous verification. The theoretical concepts
   are illustrated using an example of a cooperative intersection collision
   avoidance system (CICAS).}},

Abstract = {{Although a growing number of dynamical systems studied in various fields
   are hybrid in nature, the verification of properties, such as stability,
   safety, etc., is still a challenging problem. Reachability analysis is
   one of the promising methods for hybrid system verification, which
   together with all other verification techniques faces the challenge of
   making the analysis scale with respect to the number of continuous state
   variables. The bottleneck of many reachability analysis techniques for
   hybrid systems is the geometrically computed intersection with guard
   sets. In this work, we replace the intersection operation by a nonlinear
   mapping onto the guard, which is not only numerically stable, but also
   scalable, making it possible to verify systems which were previously out
   of reach. The approach can be applied to the fairly common class of
   hybrid systems with piecewise continuous solutions, guard sets modeled
   as halfspaces, and urgent semantics, i.e. discrete transitions are
   immediately taken when enabled by guard sets. We demonstrate the
   usefulness of the new approach by a mechanical system with backlash
   which has 101 continuous state variables.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1775-1779}},
Abstract = {{Many physiological systems are regulated by cells that alter their
   behavior in response to changes in their biochemical and mechanical
   environment. These cells experience this dynamic environment through an
   endogenous biomaterial matrix that transmits mechanical force and
   permits chemical exchange with the surrounding tissue. As a result, in
   vitro systems that mimic three-dimensional, in vivo cellular
   environments can enable experiments that reveal the nuanced interplay
   between biomechanics and physiology. Here we report the development of a
   minimal-profile, three-dimensional (MP3D) experimental microdevice that
   confines cells to a single focal plane, while allowing the precise
   application of mechanical displacement to cells and concomitant access
   to the cell membrane for perfusion with biochemical agonists. The MP3D
   device - an ordered microfiber scaffold erected on glass - provides a
   cellular environment that induces physiological cell morphologies. Small
   manipulations of the scaffold's microfibers allow attached cells to be
   mechanically probed. Due to the scaffold's minimal height profile, MP3D
   devices confine cells to a single focal plane, facilitating observation
   with conventional epifluorescent microscopy. When examining fibroblasts
   within MP3D devices, we observed robust cellular calcium responses to
   both a chemical stimulus as well as mechanical displacement of the cell
   membrane. The observed response differed significantly from previously
   reported, mechanically-induced calcium responses in the same cell type.
   Our findings demonstrate a key link between environment, cell
   morphology, mechanics, and intracellular signal transduction. We
   anticipate that this device will broadly impact research in fields
   including biomaterials, tissue engineering, and biophysics.}},

Abstract = {{The Whistler Aerosol and Cloud Study (WACS 2010), included intensive
   measurements of trace gases and particles at two sites on Whistler
   Mountain. Between 6-11 July 2010 there was a sustained high-pressure
   system over the region with cloud-free conditions and the highest
   temperatures of the study. During this period, the organic aerosol
   concentrations rose from < 1 mu g m(-3) to similar to 6 mu g m(-3).
   Precursor gas and aerosol composition measurements show that these
   organics were almost entirely of secondary biogenic nature. Throughout
   6-11 July, the anthropogenic influence was minimal with sulfate
   concentrations < 0.2 mu g m(-3) and SO2 mixing ratios approximate to
   0.05-0.1 ppbv. Thus, this case provides excellent conditions to probe
   the role of biogenic secondary organic aerosol in aerosol microphysics.
   Although SO2 mixing ratios were relatively low, box-model simulations
   show that nucleation and growth may be modeled accurately if J(nuc) = 3
   x 10(-7){[}H2SO4] and the organics are treated as effectively
   non-volatile. Due to the low condensation sink and the fast condensation
   rate of organics, the nucleated particles grew rapidly (2-5 nm h(-1))
   with a 10-25\% probability of growing to CCN sizes (100 nm) in the first
   two days as opposed to being scavenged by coagulation with larger
   particles. The nucleated particles were observed to grow to similar to
   200 nm after three days. Comparisons of size-distribution with CCN data
   show that particle hygroscopicity (kappa) was similar to 0.1 for
   particles larger 150 nm, but for smaller particles near 100 nm the kappa
   value decreased near midway through the period from 0.17 to less than
   0.06. In this environment of little anthropogenic influence and low SO2,
   the rapid growth rates of the regionally nucleated particles - due to
   condensation of biogenic SOA - results in an unusually high efficiency
   of conversion of the nucleated particles to CCN. Consequently, despite
   the low SO2, nucleation/growth appear to be the dominant source of
   particle number.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{3333-3348}},
Abstract = {{We calculate decadal aerosol direct and indirect (warm cloud) radiative
   forcings from US anthropogenic sources over the 1950-2050 period. Past
   and future aerosol distributions are constructed using GEOS-Chem and
   historical emission inventories and future projections from the IPCC A1B
   scenario. Aerosol simulations are evaluated with observed spatial
   distributions and 1980-2010 trends of aerosol concentrations and wet
   deposition in the contiguous US. Direct and indirect radiative forcing
   is calculated using the GISS general circulation model and monthly mean
   aerosol distributions from GEOS-Chem. The radiative forcing from US
   anthropogenic aerosols is strongly localized over the eastern US. We
   find that its magnitude peaked in 1970-1990, with values over the
   eastern US (east of 100A degrees W) of -2.0 W m(-2) for direct forcing
   including contributions from sulfate (-2.0 W m(-2)), nitrate (-0.2 W
   m(-2)), organic carbon (-0.2 W m(-2)), and black carbon (+0.4 W m(-2)).
   The uncertainties in radiative forcing due to aerosol radiative
   properties are estimated to be about 50\%. The aerosol indirect effect
   is estimated to be of comparable magnitude to the direct forcing. We
   find that the magnitude of the forcing declined sharply from 1990 to
   2010 (by 0.8 W m(-2) direct and 1.0 W m(-2) indirect), mainly reflecting
   decreases in SO2 emissions, and project that it will continue declining
   post-2010 but at a much slower rate since US SO2 emissions have already
   declined by almost 60\% from their peak. This suggests that much of the
   warming effect of reducing US anthropogenic aerosol sources has already
   been realized. The small positive radiative forcing from US BC emissions
   (+0.3 W m(-2) over the eastern US in 2010; 5\% of the global forcing
   from anthropogenic BC emissions worldwide) suggests that a US emission
   control strategy focused on BC would have only limited climate benefit.}},

Title = {{Climatic effects of 1950-2050 changes in US anthropogenic aerosols -
   Part 2: Climate response}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the climate response to changing US anthropogenic aerosol
   sources over the 1950-2050 period by using the NASA GISS general
   circulation model (GCM) and comparing to observed US temperature trends.
   Time-dependent aerosol distributions are generated from the GEOS-Chem
   chemical transport model applied to historical emission inventories and
   future projections. Radiative forcing from US anthropogenic aerosols
   peaked in 1970-1990 and has strongly declined since due to air quality
   regulations. We find that the regional radiative forcing from US
   anthropogenic aerosols elicits a strong regional climate response,
   cooling the central and eastern US by 0.5-1.0 A degrees C on average
   during 1970-1990, with the strongest effects on maximum daytime
   temperatures in summer and autumn. Aerosol cooling reflects comparable
   contributions from direct and indirect (cloud-mediated) radiative
   effects. Absorbing aerosol (mainly black carbon) has negligible warming
   effect. Aerosol cooling reduces surface evaporation and thus decreases
   precipitation along the US east coast, but also increases the southerly
   flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico resulting in increased cloud
   cover and precipitation in the central US. Observations over the eastern
   US show a lack of warming in 1960-1980 followed by very rapid warming
   since, which we reproduce in the GCM and attribute to trends in US
   anthropogenic aerosol sources. Present US aerosol concentrations are
   sufficiently low that future air quality improvements are projected to
   cause little further warming in the US (0.1 A degrees C over 2010-2050).
   We find that most of the warming from aerosol source controls in the US
   has already been realized over the 1980-2010 period.}},

Title = {{Dual Contouring for domains with topology ambiguity}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{34-45}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an automatic and robust approach to generate
   quality triangular and tetrahedral meshes for complicated domains with
   topology ambiguity. In previous works, we developed an octree-based Dual
   Contouring (DC) method to construct surface and volumetric meshes for
   complicated domains. However, topology ambiguity exists and causes
   non-conformal meshes. In this study, we discuss all possible topology
   configurations and develop an extension of DC which guarantees the
   correct topology. We first generate one base mesh with the previous DC
   method. Then we analyze all the octree leaf cells and categorize them
   into 31 topology groups. In order to discriminate these cells, we
   compute the values of their face and body saddle points based on a
   tri-linear representation inside the cells. Knowing the correct
   categorization, we are able to modify the base mesh and introduce more
   minimizer points within the same cell. With these minimizer points we
   update the mesh connectivities to preserve the correct topology. This
   method is further extended to 3D tetrahedral mesh generation via an
   advancing front technique. Finally we use a Laplacian smoothing
   technique to improve the mesh quality; for tetrahedral mesh a
   combination of edge-contraction, smoothing and optimization is also
   applied. Our main contribution is the topology categorization and mesh
   modification. We have applied our algorithm to three complicated domains
   and obtained good results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   resonant actuation using temperature gradients induced across two
   frequency-selective directions as a strategy to increase operating speed

   technology and aspect ratio dependent etch modulation. Resonance peaks
   were measured around 6.4 and 44.7 kHz at atmospheric-pressure
   conditions; the power sensitivities (2.8 and 1.6 degrees/W) of the
   device may compromise its performance for low-power, large-angle
   applications. Ultimately, the device is suitable for applications
   requiring a variation from low- to high-stability conditions with

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulation was explored to investigate the change of
   structure of calcium aluminosilicate slags with varying Al2O3/SiO2
   ratios at a fixed CaO content. In practice the results of the study are
   relevant to the significant changes in slag structure caused by the
   changes in chemical composition during continuous casting of steels
   containing high amounts of dissolved aluminum. It was found that Q(4)
   tetrahedral species (tetrahedron with four bridging oxygens) increase
   while NBOs (non-bridging oxygen) decreases with increasing Al2O3/SiO2
   mole ratio, suggesting that a more polymerized network was formed. The
   concentration of oxygen tricluster increased dramatically up to 24\%
   with increasing Al2O3/SiO2 mole ratio, and the coordination number for
   Al (CNAl-O) was also observed to increase from 4.02 for sample CAS1 to
   4.11 for sample CAS11, suggesting that high coordination number of Al
   presents in the slag melt with the substitution of {[}AlO4] for
   {[}SiO4]. NBOs prefer to be coordinated with Si and Al tends to be
   localized in more polymerized environment as network intermediate
   phases. The degree of Al avoidance was calculated and the Al avoidance
   principle is applicable in the SiO2 rich regions.}},

   image data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS)/Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer
   (ASTER) airborne simulator over Monterey Bay, California. One correction
   used local atmospheric profiles of meteorology and trace gases at
   overpass and the other used the 1976 US Standard default atmospheric
   profile in the MODTRAN4 radiative transfer model. We found only minor
   impacts from atmospheric correction in the Fluorescence Line Height
   index of ocean chlorophyll, but substantive differences in retrievals of
   surface temperature and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.
   Improvements in sea surface temperature retrieval were validated by in

   unit of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacry-late). Subsequently, a RAFT
   polymerization procedure was used to synthesize molecular bottlebrushes
   with PNVP side chains with controlled molecular weight and low
   polydispersity by grafting from the PXPEM backbone. The side chains were
   then chain extended with PVOAc, yielding a bottlebrush macromolecule
   with PNVP-b-PVOAc side chains. The comb-like shape of the chain extended
   bottlebrushes was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).}},

Title = {{A Fast and Efficient Version of the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS)
   Global Aerosol Microphysics Model}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{678-689}},
Abstract = {{This study develops more computationally efficient versions of the
   TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics algorithms,
   collectively called ``Fast TOMAS.{''} Several methods for speeding up
   the algorithm were attempted, but only reducing the number of size
   sections was adopted. Fast TOMAS models, coupled to the GISS GCM
   II-prime, require a new coagulation algorithm with less restrictive size
   resolution assumptions but only minor changes in other processes. Fast
   TOMAS models have been evaluated in a box model against analytical
   solutions of coagulation and condensation and in a 3-D model against the
   original TOMAS (TOMAS-30) model. Condensation and coagulation in the
   Fast TOMAS models agree well with the analytical solution but show
   slightly more bias than the TOMAS-30 box model. In the 3-D model, errors
   resulting from decreased size resolution in each process (i.e.,
   emissions, cloud processing/wet deposition, microphysics) are quantified
   in a series of model sensitivity simulations. Errors resulting from
   lower size resolution in condensation and coagulation, defined as the
   microphysics error, affect number and mass concentrations by only a few
   percent. The microphysics error in CN70/CN100 (number concentrations of
   particles larger than 70/100 nm diameter), proxies for cloud
   condensation nuclei, range from -5\% to 5\% in most regions. The largest
   errors are associated with decreasing the size resolution in the cloud
   processing/wet deposition calculations, defined as cloud-processing
   error, and range from -20\% to 15\% in most regions for CN70/CN100
   concentrations. Overall, the Fast TOMAS models increase the
   computational speed by 2 to 3 times with only small numerical errors
   stemming from condensation and coagulation calculations when compared to
   TOMAS-30. The faster versions of the TOMAS model allow for the longer,
   multi-year simulations required to assess aerosol effects on cloud
   lifetime and precipitation.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4072-4082}},
Abstract = {{The effect of polymer-graft modification on the structure formation and
   mechanical characteristics of inorganic (silica) nanoparticle solids is
   evaluated as a function of the degree of polymerization of
   surface-grafted chains. A transition from `hard-sphere-like' to
   `polymer-like' mechanical characteristics of particle solids is observed
   for increasing degree of polymerization of grafted chains. The elastic
   modulus of particle solids increases by about 200\% and levels off at
   intermediate molecular weights of surface-grafted chains, a trend that
   is rationalized as a consequence of the elastic modulus being determined
   by dispersion interactions between the polymeric grafts. A pronounced
   increase (of about one order of magnitude) of the fracture toughness of
   particle solids is observed as the degree of polymerization of grafted
   chains exceeds a threshold value that is similar for both polystyrene
   and poly(methyl methacrylate) grafts. The increased resistance to
   fracture is interpreted as a consequence of the existence of
   entanglements between surface-grafted chains that give rise to energy
   dissipation during fracture through microscopic plastic deformation and
   craze formation. Within the experimental uncertainty the transition to
   polymer-like deformation characteristics is captured by a mean field
   scaling model that interprets the structure of the polymer shell of
   polymer-grafted particles as effective `two-phase' systems consisting of
   a stretched inner region and a relaxed outer region. The model is
   applied to predict the minimum degree of polymerization needed to induce
   polymer-like mechanical characteristics and thus to establish `design
   criteria' for the synthesis of polymer-modified particles that are
   capable of forming mechanically robust and formable particle solid
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{A new equation-oriented process model for multistream heat exchangers
   (MHEX) is presented with a special emphasis on handling phase changes.
   The model internally uses the pinch concept to ensure the minimum
   driving force criteria. Streams capable of phase change are split into
   substreams corresponding to each of the phases. A novel disjunctive
   representation is proposed that identifies the phases traversed by a
   stream during heat exchange and assigns appropriate heat loads and
   temperatures for heat integration. The disjunctive model can be
   reformulated to avoid Boolean (or integer) variables using inner
   minimization and complementarity constraints. The model is suitable for
   optimization studies, particularly when the phases of the streams at the
   entry and exit of the MHEX are not known a priori. The capability of the
   model is illustrated using two case studies based on cryogenic
   applications. (C) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J,

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of mass spectrometric investigations of
   the OH-initiated oxidative aging of alpha-pinene SOA under simulated
   tropospheric conditions at the large aerosol chamber facility AIDA,
   Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. In particular, the OH-initiated
   oxidation of pure pinic and pinonic acid, two well-known oxidation
   products of alpha-pinene, was investigated. Two complementary analytical
   techniques were used, on-line atmospheric pressure chemical
   ionization/mass spectrometry (APCI/MS) and filter sampling followed by
   liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS). The results show
   that 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA), a very low
   volatile alpha-pinene SOA product and a tracer compound for terpene SOA,
   is formed from the oxidation of pinonic acid and that this oxidation
   takes place in the gas phase. This finding is confirmed by
   temperature-dependent aging experiments on whole SOA formed from
   alpha-pinene, in which the yield of MBTCA scales with the pinonic acid
   fraction in the gas phase. Based on the results, several feasible
   gas-phase radical mechanisms are discussed to explain the formation of
   MBTCA from OH-initiated pinonic acid oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Systems consisting of several finite components that communicate via

   is closely related to calculating the set of all possible channel
   contents, that is, the limit language, for each control location. We
   present an algorithm for calculating the limit language of a system with
   a single communication channel. For multichannel systems, we show that
   the limit language is piecewise if the initial language is piecewise.
   Our construction is not effective in general; however, we provide
   algorithms for calculating the limit language of a restricted class of
   multichannel systems in which messages are not passed around in cycles
   through different channels. We show that the worst case complexity of
   our algorithms for single-channel and important subclasses of
   multichannel systems is exponential in the size of the initial content
   of the channels.}},

Title = {{Robust Vacuity for Branching Temporal Logic}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in techniques for detecting whether a logic
   specification is satisfied too easily, or vacuously. For example, the
   specification ``every request is eventually followed by an
   acknowledgment{''} is satisfied vacuously by a system that never
   generates any requests. Vacuous satisfaction misleads users of
   model-checking into thinking that a system is correct. It is a serious
   problem in practice.
   There are several existing definitions of vacuity. Originally, Beer et
   al. {[}1997] formalized vacuity as insensitivity to syntactic
   perturbation (syntactic vacuity). This formulation captures the
   intuition of ``vacuity{''} when applied to a single occurrence of a
   subformula. Armoni et al. argued that vacuity must be robust; not
   affected by semantically invariant changes, such as extending a model
   with additional atomic propositions. They show that syntactic vacuity is
   not robust for subformulas of linear temporal logic, and propose an
   alternative definition; trace vacuity.
   In this article, we continue this line of research. We show that trace
   vacuity is not robust for branching time logic. We further refine the
   notion of vacuity so that it applies uniformly to linear and branching
   time logic and does not suffer from the common pitfalls of prior
   definitions. Our new definition, bisimulation vacuity, is a proper and
   nontrivial extension of both syntactic and trace vacuity. We discuss the
   complexity of detecting bisimulation vacuity, and identify several
   practically-relevant subsets of CTL{*} for which vacuity detection
   problem is reducible to model-checking. We believe that in most
   practical applications, bisimulation vacuity provides both the desired
   theoretical properties and is tractable computationally.}},

Abstract = {{A reliable robust wireless network of connected vehicles is desired to
   enable a number of future telematics and infotainment applications in
   the vehicular domain. To achieve this objective, vehicle-to-vehicle
   (V2V) communication is standardized by the IEEE 802.11p Dedicated Short
   Range Communications (DSRC) standard. Providing reliable communication
   performance in a highly dynamic time-varying V2V channel is a
   challenging task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a dynamic
   equalization scheme, on top of the existing DSRC technology, that
   significantly improves the packet error rate (PER) of data transmissions
   without changing the DSRC standard. We also show a hardware
   implementation of this scheme based on a field-programmable gate array
   (FPGA) to demonstrate its implementation feasibility. Furthermore, we
   extend our improved equalization scheme to various data rate options
   available in the DSRC standard, showing that the proposed scheme is
   sufficiently generic to support different types of V2V communication.
   Finally, we report the results of investigating the dependence of
   wireless communication performance (in terms of PER and throughput) on
   various design parameters such as packet length, payload size, and data
   rate.}},

Title = {{Maximal Scheduling in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks With Hypergraph
   Interference Models}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{297-310}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a hypergraph interference model for the scheduling
   problem in wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed hypergraph model can
   take the sum interference into account and, therefore, is more accurate
   as compared with the traditional binary graph model. Further, different
   from the global signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model,
   the hypergraph model preserves a localized graph-theoretic structure
   and, therefore, allows the existing graph-based efficient scheduling
   algorithms to be extended to the cumulative interference case. Finally,
   by adjusting certain parameters, the hypergraph can achieve a systematic
   tradeoff between the interference approximation accuracy and the user
   node coordination complexity during scheduling. As an application of the
   hypergraph model, we consider the performance of a simple distributed
   scheduling algorithm, i.e., maximal scheduling, in wireless networks. We
   propose a lower bound stability region for any maximal scheduler and
   show that it achieves a fixed fraction of the optimal stability region,
   which depends on the interference degree of the underlying hypergraph.
   We also demonstrate the interference approximation accuracy of
   hypergraphs in random networks and show that hypergraphs with small
   hyperedge sizes can model the interference quite accurately. Finally,
   the analytical performance is verified by simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The specialty of craniofacial surgery is broad and includes trauma,
   aesthetics, reconstruction of congenital deformities, and regeneration
   of tissues. Moreover, craniofacial surgery deals with a diverse range of
   tissues including both ``soft{''} and ``hard{''} tissues. Technological
   advances in materials and biological sciences and improved surgical
   techniques have remarkably improved clinical outcomes. The quest to
   raise the bar for patient care continues to inspire advances for
   predictable biological regeneration of soft and hard tissues. As a
   consequence of this quest for advancement, a wide spectrum of
   biologicals is becoming available to surgeons. Is the use of recombinant
   DNA engineered biologicals daring? Sensible? Logical? Timely? Safe? It
   is crucial for the practicing craniofacial surgeon to take a step back
   periodically and carefully review the biological factors that have the
   potential for dramatically altering the discipline of craniofacial
   surgery. With this emphasis, the coauthors of this article will focus on
   growth factor technology underscoring bone tissue regeneration. As the
   21st-century matures, recombinant human biologicals will have an
   overwhelming impact on the practice of craniofacial surgery.}},

   nuclei concentrations}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-101}},
Abstract = {{This work estimates the primary marine organic aerosol global emission
   source and its impact on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations
   by implementing an organic sea spray source function into a series of
   global aerosol simulations. The source function assumes that a fraction
   of the sea spray emissions, depending on the local chlorophyll
   concentration, is organic matter in place of sea salt. Effect on CCN
   concentrations (at 0.2\% supersaturation) is modeled using the
   Two-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics algorithm coupled to
   the GISS II-prime general circulation model. The presence of organics
   affects CCN activity in competing ways: by reducing the amount of solute
   available in the particle and decreasing surface tension of CCN. To
   model surfactant effects, surface tension depression data from seawater
   samples taken near the Georgia coast were applied as a function of
   carbon concentrations. A global marine organic aerosol emission rate of
   17.7 Tg C yr(-1) is estimated from the simulations. Marine organics
   exert a localized influence on CCN(0.2 \%) concentrations, decreasing
   regional concentrations by no more than 5\% and by less than 0.5\% over
   most of the globe, assuming direct replacement of sea salt aerosol with
   organic aerosol. The decrease in CCN concentrations results from the
   fact that the decrease in particle solute concentration outweighs the
   organic surfactant effects. The low sensitivity of CCN(0.2 \%) to the
   marine organic emissions is likely due to the small compositional
   changes: the mass fraction of OA in accumulation mode aerosol increases
   by only similar to 15\% in a biologically active region of the Southern
   Ocean. To test the sensitivity to uncertainty in the sea spray emissions
   process, we relax the assumption that sea spray aerosol number and mass
   remain fixed and instead can add to sea spray emissions rather than
   replace existing sea salt. In these simulations, we find that marine
   organic aerosol can increase CCN by up to 50\% in the Southern Ocean and
   3.7\% globally during the austral summer. This vast difference in CCN
   impact highlights the need for further observational exploration of the
   sea spray aerosol emission process as well as evaluation and development
   of model parameterizations.}},

Title = {{Frequency-Domain Oversampling for Zero-Padded OFDM in Underwater
   Acoustic Communications}},

Abstract = {{Although time-domain oversampling of the received baseband signal is
   common for single-carrier transmissions, the counterpart of
   frequency-domain oversampling is rarely used for multicarrier
   transmissions. This is because frequency-domain oversampling cannot be
   taken advantage of, when using the commonly used low-complexity receiver
   that assumes orthogonal subcarriers. In this paper, we explore
   frequency-domain oversampling to improve the system performance of
   zero-padded (ZP) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   transmissions over underwater acoustic channels with large Doppler
   spread. In these channels, intercarrier interference (ICI) has to be
   addressed explicitly via frequency-domain equalization, which enables
   inclusion of additional frequency samples at little increased
   complexity. We use a signal design that enables separate sparse channel
   estimation and data detection, reducing equalization complexity. Based
   on both simulation and experimental results, we observe that the
   receiver with frequency-domain oversampling outperforms the conventional
   one considerably, where the gain increases as the Doppler spread
   increases.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{C114-C122}},
Abstract = {{Low concentrations of thiocyanate substantially increase the active
   dissolution rate of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. The
   mechanism of the effect was investigated by potentiostatic and impedance
   measurements on pure iron, pure chromium, and Type 430 stainless steel,
   in 1 M Na2SO4, acidified to pH = 2.5 with H2SO4. Thiocyanate has little
   effect on the anodic dissolution of pure iron, but increases the
   dissolution rate of chromium by approximately one order of magnitude;
   the effect on Type 430 stainless steel is even stronger. In the case of
   pure chromium, impedance measurements show no change in the dissolution
   mechanism in the presence of thiocyanate; the reaction rates are simply
   higher. For Type 430 stainless steel, more prominent crystallographic
   etching in the presence of thiocyanate and the effect of thiocyanate to
   increase the dissolution rate strongly indicate that thiocyanate
   suppresses the passivating effect of Cr-O-Cr networks on crystal ledges.

Abstract = {{We describe a strategy for analyzing axonal transport of cytosolic
   proteins (CPCPs) using photoactivatable GFP-PAGFP-with modifications of
   standard imaging components that can be retroactively fitted to a
   conventional epifluorescence microscope. The photoactivation and
   visualization are nearly simultaneous, allowing studies of proteins with
   rapidly mobile fractions. Cultured hippocampal neurons are transfected
   with PAGFP-tagged constructs, a discrete protein population within axons
   is photoactivated, and then the activated population is tracked by live
   imaging. We show the utility of this method in analyzing axonal
   transport of CPCPs that have inherent diffusible pools and distinguish
   this transport modality from passive diffusion and vesicle transport.
   The analytical tools used to quantify the motion are also described.
   Aside from the time needed for preparation of neuronal
   cultures/transfection, the experiment takes 2-3 h, during which time
   several axons can be imaged and analyzed. These methods should be easy
   to adopt by most laboratories and may also be useful for monitoring CP
   movement in other cell types.}},

Title = {{Compact tool for deposition of composition spread alloy films}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Composition spread alloy films (CSAFs) are combinatorial materials
   libraries that contain broad, continuous composition ranges of binary or
   higher-order alloys on a single, compact substrate. When characterized
   for composition and functional properties using spatially resolved
   methods, CSAF libraries enable rapid determination of
   composition-property relationships across broad continuous regions of
   alloy composition space. In this report, we describe the design and
   operation of a novel offset filament deposition tool for preparation of
   CSAFs. The spatial distribution of individual alloy component fluxes to
   the substrate surface, and thus the film composition across the
   substrate, is controlled by the location and temperature of chemically
   distinct evaporative line sources. The tool can be used for quantitative
   deposition of thin (<= 100 nm) CSAFs with up to four components. The
   authors demonstrate the performance of the tool by applying it to
   preparation of 100 nm thick Pd-Cu CSAFs, with lateral composition
   gradients that span the range Cu(0.05)Pd(0.95) to Cu(0.95)Pd(0.05), on a
   12 mm diameter Mo(110) substrate. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{It is often appealing to assume that existing solutions can be directly
   applied to emerging engineering domains. Unfortunately, careful
   investigation of the unique challenges presented by new domains exposes
   its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions.
   In this paper, we argue that the ``smart{''} grid, replacing its
   incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new
   security challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the
   field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber-physical
   security. The tight coupling between information and communication
   technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns,
   requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods.
   Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable,
   insufficiently scalable, incompatible, or simply inadequate to address
   the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart
   grid. A concerted effort by the entire industry, the research community,
   and the policy makers is required to achieve the vision of a secure
   smart grid infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents data centers from a cyber-physical system (CPS)
   perspective. Current methods for controlling information technology (IT)
   and cooling technology (CT) in data centers are classified according to
   the degree to which they take into account both cyber and physical
   considerations. To evaluate the potential impact of coordinated CPS
   strategies at the data center level, we introduce a control-oriented
   model that represents the data center as two coupled networks: a
   computational network representing the cyber dynamics and a thermal
   network representing the physical dynamics. These networks are coupled
   through the influence of the IT on both networks: servers affect both
   the quality of service (QoS) delivered by the computational network and
   the generation of heat in the thermal network. Using this model, three
   control strategies are evaluated with respect to their energy efficiency
   and computational performance: a baseline strategy that ignores CPS
   considerations, an uncoordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT
   independently, and a coordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT
   together to achieve optimal performance with respect to both QoS and
   energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the benefits to be
   realized from coordinating the control of IT and CT depend on the
   distribution and heterogeneity of the computational and cooling
   resources throughout the data center. A new cyber-physical index (CPI)
   is introduced as a measure of this combined distribution of cyber and
   physical effects in a given data center. We illustrate how the CPI
   indicates the potential impact of using coordinated CPS control
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of electricity cost management for
   Internet service providers with a collection of spatially distributed
   data centers. As the demand on Internet services and cloud computing has
   kept increasing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC
   operations has been uprising significantly. The cyber and physical
   aspects of IDCs interact with each other, and bring unprecedented
   challenges in power management. While most existing research focuses on
   reducing power consumptions of IDCs at one specific location, the
   problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This
   is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the
   present multielectricity-market environment, where the price of
   electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for
   these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS; i.e.,
   service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end
   users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of
   minimizing the total electricity cost geared to QoS constraint as well
   as the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price under
   multiregional electricity markets. We jointly consider both the cyber
   and physical management capabilities of IDCs, and exploit both the
   center-level load balancing and the server-level power control in a
   unified scheme. We model the problem as a constrained mixed integer
   programming based on generalized benders decomposition (GBD) technique.
   Extensive evaluations based on real-life electricity price data for
   multiple IDC locations demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.}},

   Next, solutions to the small signal stability problem, frequency

   based on the concepts which honor the change in system dynamics caused

Abstract = {{We present an approach for customized heartbeat classification of
   electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, based on the construction of one
   general multi-class classifier and one specific two-class classifier.
   The general classifier is trained on a global training dataset,
   containing examples of all possible classes and patterns. On the other
   hand, the individual-specific classifier is built using a small amount
   of individual data, which is a binary one-against-the-rest classifier,
   providing discrimination between normal and abnormal patterns from that
   individual. Such an individual-specific classifier can be a two-class
   classifier or a one-class classifier, depending on the availability of
   abnormal patterns in the individual training dataset. The
   classifications from the two classifiers are fused to obtain a final
   decision. The proposed approach is applied to the study of ECG heartbeat
   classification problem, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
   methods. The proposed method can also be useful in anomaly detection of
   other biomedical signals.}},

Abstract = {{We propose two algorithms for the solution of the Optimal Power Flow
   (OPF) problem to global optimality. The algorithms are based on the
   spatial branch and bound framework with lower bounds on the optimal
   objective function value calculated by solving either the Lagrangian
   dual or the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We show that this
   approach can solve to global optimality the general form of the OPF
   problem including: generation power bounds, apparent and real power line
   limits, voltage limits and thermal loss limits. The approach makes no
   assumption on the topology or resistive connectivity of the network.
   This work also removes some of the restrictive assumptions of the SDP
   approaches {[}1], {[}2], {[}3], {[}4], {[}5]. We present the performance
   of the algorithms on a number of standard IEEE systems, which are known
   to have a zero duality gap. We also make parameter perturbations to the
   test cases that result in solutions that fail to satisfy the SDP rank
   condition and have a non-zero duality gap. The proposed branch and bound
   algorithms are able to solve these cases to global optimality.}},

   As the model for temporal dependencies, we adopt the Markov chain whose

   protocols, where a token is passed among nodes to determine the order of
   processing; and 2) temporally dependent link failures, where the
   temporal dependence is modeled by a Markov chain. We characterize the

   P. Examples further reveal how the temporal correlations (dependencies)

Abstract = {{Increased penetration of renewable generation and the liberalization of
   electricity markets result in increasingly varying power flows in the
   electric power system. This has led to increased occurrences of
   congestions which are mostly resolved by dispatching generation in an
   economically suboptimal way. In this paper, we use power flow control to
   render the system more flexible by providing the capability of rerouting
   power to lines where sufficient capacity is available. The objective is
   to minimize a combination of generation cost and a risk-based security
   index as opposed to formulating a traditional security constrained
   economic dispatch. In addition, corrective actions by the power flow
   control devices are used to allow for a less conservative generation
   dispatch resulting in reduced generation costs while maintaining system
   security in case of a contingency. Simulation results provide insights
   into the benefits provided by corrective power flow control in such a
   trade-off between generation cost and system risk.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the tradeoffs between sensing and communication in a
   consensus+innovations distributed detection problem when the local
   communications among agents are noisy. Intuitively, we can expect that
   the error performance of the distributed detector is affected by both
   the sensing noise and the noise corrupting the communication among
   agents in the network. Too little communication (cooperation) and the
   distributed detector error performance will be dominated by the sensing
   noise. Too much communication and the detector error performance is
   dominated by the communication noise. We make this tradeoff precise
   through a large deviations analysis, i.e., by studying the exponential
   decay rate of the probability of error of the consensus+innovations
   distributed detector at each agent. Under a mild assumption of network
   connectedness, we show: 1) the weight sequences affecting the consensus
   and innovations potentials in the distributed detector need to be
   carefully designed for the error probability at every agent detector to
   decay exponentially fast; 2) the network exhibits a phase transition
   with respect to the communication noise power. Below a threshold on the
   communication noise power, cooperation (communication) among agents
   improves the error detection performance; above threshold, inter-agent
   communication does not enhance the error detection performance.}},

Abstract = {{Project-based courses challenge students by presenting them with
   real-world situations in which they have to constantly balance their
   time and efforts between formulating the problem, exploring and adapting
   concepts to their problem domain, and documenting their progress to
   present to clients and instructors. Although it is widely accepted that
   project-based courses benefit students, the explicit role of project
   milestones in the progress of the project is not well understood. This
   paper addresses the effect of milestones by examining the vocabulary
   used in an inter-disciplinary project-based course in online discussions
   as well as design documentation. Noun phrases, which are surrogates for
   design concepts, vary throughout the three phases in the class. The data
   is then divided into editing/ presentation and design categories and the
   noun phrases used in the two categories are compared. Students must
   allocate their time between designing and documenting and we observe
   that their design activities often peak just after the documentation
   deadlines. The paper concludes that instructors need to be aware of the
   role played by explicit project deadlines in project based courses. A
   delicate balance between externalization and active student
   collaboration is required for effective student learning experience.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional mechanical subsystems in automobiles are being replaced by
   electronically controlled systems, often with no mechanical backup. This
   trend towards ``drive-bywire{''} systems is becoming increasingly
   popular. In these cyber-physical systems, a critical task not meeting
   its timing deadline can lead to a safety violation and damage to life
   and/or property. Classical real-time scheduling techniques such as RMS
   and EDF can be used to guarantee the schedulability of periodic tasks.
   However, certain critical tasks like the engine control task are
   activated by engine events such as pulses generated by sensors at the
   engine crankshaft. The periods of these engine tasks vary continually
   and even dramatically depending on the engine speed. The conventional
   periodic task model is inadequate for handling such tasks in
   cyber-physical systems due to its pessimism when combined with common
   schedulability analyses. In this paper, we define a new task model
   called Rhythmic Tasks for tasks having periods that vary due to external
   physical events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
   that considers continually varying periods for fixed-priority scheduling
   in dynamic operating environments. We formally define the rhythmic task
   model and study its scheduling properties. In the context of rhythmic
   engine control tasks, we offer schedulability tests for determining the
   maximum possible utilization under the steady state, which is related to
   the physical engine speed. We also investigate the range of possible
   engine acceleration and deceleration rates. We show that excessive
   acceleration and deceleration can make the system unschedulable. We
   provide algorithms to find the appropriate ranges for acceleration and
   deceleration rates. We use a specific case study of engine control to
   illustrate our analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Large variations in the execution times of algorithms characterize many
   cyber-physical systems (CPS). For example, variations arise in the case
   of visual object-tracking tasks, whose execution times depend on the
   contents of the current field of view of the camera. In this paper, we
   study such a scenario in a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system
   with a camera that must detect objects in a variety of conditions
   ranging from the simple to the complex. Given resource, weight and size
   constraints, such cyber-physical systems do not have the resources to
   satisfy the hard-real-time requirements of safe flight along with the
   need to process highly variable workloads at the highest quality and
   resolution levels. Hence, tradeoffs have to be made in real-time across
   multiple levels of criticality of running tasks and their operating
   points. Specifically, the utility derived from tracking an increasing
   number of objects may saturate when the mission software can no longer
   perform the required processing on each individual object. In this
   paper, we evaluate a new approach called ZS-QRAM (Zero-Slack QoS-based
   Resource Allocation Model) that maximizes the UAV system utility by
   explicitly taking into account the diminishing returns on tracking an
   increasing number of objects. We perform a detailed evaluation of our
   approach on our UAV system to clearly demonstrate its benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The major subject of this paper is the introduction and testing of a new
   modeling paradigm necessary for enabling sustainable performance of
   electric energy systems. In previous work we have identified major
   challenges to systematically modeling distributed, non-uniform resources
   emerging in power grids. Today's modeling of electric energy systems is
   either entirely based on first principles which suffers significantly
   from the ever-increasing complexity of non-uniform devices, or is purely
   based on computer science data-driven approaches which lose the
   fundamental physical insights of electric power networks. Therefore, it
   is very difficult with today's modeling practices to integrate
   distributed non-uniform resources using both first-principle and
   data-driven approaches in large-scale cyber-physical energy systems. In
   sharp contrast, this paper presents a holistic multi-scale modeling
   approach by combing advances from (1) physics-based modeling of emerging
   distributed resources (e.g. wind generation and storage devices); and
   (2) data-driven modeling of load resources. With both physics-based
   models of distributed resources and data-driven models of flexible
   demands, key parameters are abstracted and identified from the detailed
   dynamical models necessary for the multi-scale power system operations.
   The proposed modeling framework is tested using realistic phasor
   measurement unit data obtained from Electric Reliability Council of
   Texas (ERCOT).}},

   and commonality for logic and memory circuits, new opportunities are

   architectures that exploits the inherent memory address patterns of the
   backprojection algorithm to enable efficient parallel image
   reconstruction at minimum hardware overhead. An end-to-end design
   framework in sub-20nm CMOS technologies was constructed for the physical
   synthesis of smart memories and evaluation of the huge design space. Our

Abstract = {{Many scenarios require that face recognition be performed at conditions
   that are not optimal. Traditional face recognition algorithms are not
   best suited for matching images captured at a low-resolution to a set of
   high-resolution gallery images. To perform matching between images of
   different resolutions, this work proposes a method of learning two sets
   of projections, one for high-resolution images and one for
   low-resolution images, based on local relationships in the data.
   Subsequent matching is done in a common subspace. Experiments show that
   our algorithm yields higher recognition rates than other similar
   methods.}},

Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Forces between a hard/permanent magnet of arbitrary shape and an ideally
   soft magnetic plate in close proximity are derived analytically from the
   image method applied to magnetostatics. We found that the contact force,
   defined as the force required to detach the hard magnet from the plate,
   coincides with that between two identical touching permanent magnets.
   Furthermore, if the hard and the soft magnets are displaced by some
   amount, their attraction equals that between two identical permanent
   magnets displaced by twice that amount. Experimental results are
   presented that validate the theoretical framework and highlight its
   limits of applicability.}},

Title = {{Experimental Study of the Variation in Oscillation Characteristics of
   Point-Contact-Based Spin-Torque Oscillators}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study of the variation in
   oscillation characteristics of circular point-contactbased spin-torque
   oscillators (PC-STOs). We first measured the oscillation behavior of
   multiple, identically fabricated PC-STOs, then made the same
   measurements on a PC-STO and rotated the azimuth angle of the bias field
   phi. Our results show considerable device-to-device variations among
   identical PC-STOs. More striking is large changes within a single PC-STO
   for a small phi rotation, which is totally inconsistent with the
   geometrical symmetry of the device. These results suggest that the giant
   magnetoresistance stack has some form of microstructural inhomogeneity,
   which causes a strong phi dependence of the oscillation behavior,
   eventually resulting in the device-to-device variation. Some possible
   sources of the inhomogeneity are discussed based on these observation
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Medical ultrasound typically deals with the interior of the patient,
   with the exterior left to the original medical imaging modality, direct
   human vision. For the human operator scanning the patient, the view of
   the external anatomy is essential for correctly locating the ultrasound
   probe on the body and making sense of the resulting ultrasound images in
   their proper anatomical context. The operator, after all, is not
   expected to perform the scan with his eyes shut. Over the past decade,
   our laboratory has developed a method of fusing these two information
   streams in the mind of the operator, the Sonic Flashlight, which uses a
   half silvered mirror and miniature display mounted on an ultrasound
   probe to produce a virtual image within the patient at its proper
   location. We are now interested in developing a similar data fusion
   approach within the ultrasound machine itself, by, in effect, giving
   vision to the transducer. Our embodiment of this concept consists of an
   ultrasound probe with two small video cameras mounted on it, with
   software capable of locating the surface of an ultrasound phantom using
   stereo disparity between the two video images. We report its first
   successful operation, demonstrating a 3D rendering of the phantom's
   surface with the ultrasound data superimposed at its correct relative
   location. Eventually, automated analysis of these registered data sets
   may permit the scanner and its associated computational apparatus to
   interpret the ultrasound data within its anatomical context, much as the
   human operator does today.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effects of peer influence and homophily on the
   diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled from a
   large dataset from a major European Mobile carrier in one country. We
   use Stochastic Actor Based Models to capture the co-evolution of the
   social network as well as the dynamics of adoption. This helps to
   separate the roles of homophily and peer influence in the process of
   diffusion. We provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to
   adopt, when she is called upon to make a decision about whether she
   should adopt, increases with the number of friends that have already
   adopted. A one standard deviation increase above the mean in the number
   of friends that had already adopted increases the likelihood odds of
   adoption relative to no adoption by a factor of 2.8. The effect of peer
   influence is robust across a number of different specifications. The
   results for the effect of homophily are less clear. While, on average,
   we find a positive significant effect of adoption on tie formation, in
   many communities this effect is significant and negative and in others
   there is no effect at all.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of social influence in observational data is a difficult
   task. Endogeneity issues such as homophily, correlated unobservables and
   simultaneity raise challenges to the researchers interested in
   establishing causality and in consistently measuring its magnitude. In
   this paper we apply randomization techniques to identify social
   influence in a mobile network setting. Randomization methods consist in
   generating pseudo-samples of the original data by selectively permuting
   the values of some variables among observations, and estimating
   empirical distributions of a parameter of interest under the null
   hypothesis that such permutations are random. We show that randomization
   methods are a viable strategy to identify social influence in contexts
   where all adoption is observed and the date of adoption is available.
   Furthermore, we show that these methods provide a lower bound for the
   magnitude of the effect of peer influence. We use a comprehensive panel
   of data from a large European mobile carrier in one country. The data
   comprise Call Detailed Records for all the subscribers in this carrier
   for a period of 11 months. We also have information on pricing plans,
   adoption of products, promotions and handsets. We estimate the effect of
   peer influence in six of these promotions. We provide evidence for
   negative peer influence in their adoption. Peer influence reduces
   adoption for these promotions between 3\% and 9\%. Peer influence helps
   to share information about new promotions but also signals who has
   already adopted them and, in many cases, such as free calls, having
   neighbors who adopted the promotion is enough to benefit from it.}},

Abstract = {{The Abstract interpretation (AI) is one of the most scalable automated
   approaches to program verification available today. To achieve
   efficiency, many steps of the analysis, e.g., joins and widening, lose
   precision. As a result, AI often produces false alarms, coming from the
   inability to find a safe inductive invariant even when it exists in a
   chosen abstract domain.
   To tackle this problem, we present VINTA, an iterative algorithm that
   uses Craig interpolants to refine and guide AI away from false alarms.
   VINTA is based on a novel refinement strategy that capitalizes on recent
   advances in SMT and interpolation-based verification to (a) find
   counterexamples to justify alarms produced by AI, and (b) to strengthen
   an invariant to exclude alarms that cannot be justified. The refinement
   process continues until either a safe inductive invariant is computed, a
   counterexample is found, or resources are exhausted. This strategy
   allows VINTA to recover precision lost in many AI steps, and even to
   compute inductive invariants that are inexpressible in the chosen
   abstract domain (e.g., by adding disjunctions and new terms).
   We have implemented VINTA and compared it against top verification tools
   from the recent software verification competition. Our results show that
   VINTA outperforms state-of-the-art verification tools.}},

Abstract = {{Current approaches to software model checking can be divided into
   over-approximation-driven (OD) and under-approximationdriven (UD). OD
   approaches maintain an abstraction of the transition relation of a
   program and use abstract reachability to build an inductive invariant
   (or find a counterexample). At the other extreme, UD approaches attempt
   to construct inductive invariants by generalizing from finite paths
   through the control-flow graph of the program.
   In this paper, we present Ufo, an algorithm that unifies OD and UD
   approaches in order to leverage both of their advantages. Ufo is
   parameterized by the degree to which over- and under-approximations
   drive the analysis. At one extreme, UFO is a novel interpolation-based
   (UD) algorithm that generates interpolants to label (refine) multiple
   program paths using a single SMT solver query. At the other extreme, Ufo
   uses an abstract domain to drive the analysis, while using interpolants
   to strengthen the abstraction.
   We have implemented Ufo in LLVM and applied it to programs from the
   Competition on Software Verification. Our experimental results
   demonstrate the utility of our algorithm and the benefits of combining
   UD and OD approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents design and evaluation of a mechanical
   nanomanufacturing system for performing the nanomilling process. The
   nanomilling process uses a nanotool (an atomic force microscope probe
   tip) that is rotated at high speeds to fabricate three-dimensional (3D)
   nano-scale features on a sample surface. After explaining the kinematics
   of the two nanomilling process configurations, the nanomilling system,
   including the 3D piezoelectric actuator that rotates the nanotool, the
   nanopositioning stage that provides the feeding and depth motions, and
   the software program that controls the nanomilling motions are
   described. A measurement system is then constructed to measure the
   dynamic nanomilling motions. A compensation algorithm is developed to
   enable obtaining desired nanotool motions in the presence of frequency
   and amplitude-dependent nonlinearities of the 3D piezoelectric actuator.
   The nanomilling system is then evaluated directly by measuring the
   nanotool motions, and indirectly by assessing the accuracy of the
   fabricated nanoscale features. it was shown that the nanomilling system
   facilitates fabrication of complex nano-scale features with high
   accuracy through the high-stiffness nanotool assembly and high-frequency
   (compensated) nanotool motions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   referred to as the dynamic runout) at the tool tip. The main
   contributors to the tool-tip speed-dependent radial motions are the
   error motions of the spindle, the form accuracy of the cutting tool, the
   alignment of the tool with respect to the axis of rotation, and the
   vibrations resulting from the rotating eccentricity. This paper
   describes a methodology that uses two laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV)
   systems to measure the radial motions at two axial locations of a
   precision cylindrical artifact attached to the spindle, while the
   spindle is rotated at its operational speeds. Measured radial motions
   are then processed to obtain radial and tilt error motions of the UHS
   spindle in the rotating sensitive direction. An alignment procedure is
   developed to ensure the mutual perpendicularity of the two (X and Y)
   laser beams. The methodology is demonstrated on an UHS air-turbine
   driven spindle with aerostatic-bearings. Subsequently, an analysis is
   performed to determine the measurement uncertainty associated with the
   presented methodology. It is concluded that the presented methodology
   can be used to effectively measure radial and tilt error motions of UHS
   spindles. Furthermore, it is shown that the average radial motion,
   synchronous radial error motion value and the standard deviation of the
   asynchronous radial error motion vary significantly with the spindle
   speed due to dynamic effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Steps on GaAs(110) surfaces, with step-normal vectors parallel to
   {[}001], are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.
   Two possible orientations of the steps occur, with outward normal
   vectors of {[}001] or {[}00 - 1], which in simple bulk-terminated form
   have Ga (cations) or As (anions) on their edges, respectively. The
   latter type of step in n-type or undoped material is found to retain its
   bulk-terminated form. A band of states is observed extending out from
   the valence band, associated with the dangling bonds of the terminating
   As atoms. It is argued that compensation of the dangling bonds on the
   step edges is the driving force for the step structure, producing
   reconstruction of the step edges in certain cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents the theory of a novel mechanism of energy absorption
   and induced damping in structural systems and its application to
   aerospace industry. The underlying principles of the physical phenomena
   have been addressed in several earlier publications, which focused on
   prototypical systems of absorbers that consist of a set of
   single-degree-of-freedom resonators. This paper generalizes those
   theoretical developments to the case of a cluster of beams attached to a
   continuous primary structure, to develop predictive methods for the
   expected performance of this new type of absorber, with particular
   emphasis on its optimal design. An embodiment of the conceived device is
   illustrated for an aerospace structure, a satellite, with the purpose of
   reducing the vibration of the electronic components on board during
   lift-off. Experimental results illustrate the feasibility and the
   attractiveness of this new absorption technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   An energy function is developed to study the stability property of

   experimental results. The distribution is stable if the seed particles
   are sufficiently large. A novel discretization scheme solves the
   population balance equations. We demonstrate the equivalence of the
   continuous and discretized population balance. An equivalent stability
   condition for the discretized population balance is derived using
   Tellegen's theorem. Finally we design an inventory control system to
   control the particle size distribution. The zero-dynamics, i.e. the
   dynamics of particle phase, are asymptotically stable if the seed

Title = {{A hierarchy of relaxations for linear generalized disjunctive

Volume = {{216}},

Abstract = {{Generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), originally developed by Raman
   and Grossmann (1994), is an extension of the well-known disjunctive
   programming paradigm developed by Balas in the mid 70s in his seminal
   technical report (Balas, 1974). This mathematical representation of
   discrete-continuous optimization problems, which represents an
   alternative to the mixed-integer program (MIP), led to the development
   of customized algorithms that successfully exploited the underlying
   logical structure of the problem. The underlying theory of these
   methods, however, borrowed only in a limited way from the theories of
   disjunctive programming, and the unique insights from Balas' work have
   not been fully exploited.
   In this paper, we establish new connections between the fields of
   disjunctive programming and generalized disjunctive programming for the
   linear case. We then propose a novel hierarchy of relaxations to the
   original linear GDP model that subsumes known relaxations for this
   model, and show that a subset of these relaxations are tighter than the
   latter. We discuss the usefulness of these relaxations within the
   context of MIP and illustrate these results on the classic strip-packing
   problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
