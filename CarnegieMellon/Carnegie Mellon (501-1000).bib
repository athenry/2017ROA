Title = {{Impacts of Pristine and Transformed Ag and Cu Engineered Nanomaterials
   on Surficial Sediment Microbial Communities Appear Short-Lived}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory-based studies have shown that many soluble metal and metal
   oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENM) exert strong toxic effects on
   microorganisms. However, laboratory-based studies lack the complexity of
   natural systems and often use ``as manufactured{''} ENMs rather than
   more environmentally relevant transformed ENMs, leaving open the
   question of whether natural ligands and seasonal variation will mitigate
   ENM impacts. Because ENMs will accumulate in subaquatic sediments, we
   examined the effects of pristine and transformed Ag and Cu ENMs on
   surficial sediment microbial communities in simulated freshwater
   wetlands. Five identical mesocosms were dosed through the water column
   with either Ag-0, Ag2S, CuO or CuS ENMs (nominal sizes of 4.67 +/- 1.4,
   18.1 +/- 3.2, 31.1 +/- 12, and 12.4 +/- 4.1, respectively) or Cu2+.
   Microbial communities were examined at 0, 7, 30, 90, 180, and 300 d
   using qPCR and high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results suggest
   differential short-term impacts of Ag-0 and Ag2S, similarities between
   CuO and CuS, and differences between Cu ENMs and Cu2+. PICRUSt-predicted
   metagenomes displayed differential effects of Ag treatments on
   photosynthesis and of Cu treatments on methane metabolism. By 300 d, all
   metrics pointed to reconvergence of ENM-dosed mesocosm microbial
   community structure and composition, suggesting that the long-term
   microbial community impacts from a pulse of Ag or Cu ENMs are limited.}},

Abstract = {{This overview highlights some of the key aspects regarding materials
   qualification needs across the additive manufacturing (AM) spectrum. AM
   technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past
   few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical
   applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer,
   especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts,
   fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts
   are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address
   some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas
   that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including
   various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in
   addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific
   components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical
   Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on
   fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical
   properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in
   addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using
   micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping
   studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large
   area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE)
   analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future
   integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials
   Engineering approach to AM. Possible future pathways for materials
   qualification are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Electron beam melting (EBM) is one of the subsets of direct metal
   additive manufacturing (AM), an emerging manufacturing method that
   fabricates metallic parts directly from a three-dimensional (3D)
   computer model by the successive melting of powder layers. This family
   of technologies has seen significant growth in recent years due to its
   potential to manufacture complex components with shorter lead times,
   reduced material waste and minimal post-processing as a
   ``near-net-shape{''} process, making it of particular interest to the
   biomedical and aerospace industries. The popular titanium alloy
   Ti-6Al-4V has been the focus of multiple studies due to its importance
   to these two industries, which can be attributed to its high strength to
   weight ratio and corrosion resistance. While previous research has found
   that most tensile properties of EBM Ti-6Al-4V meet or exceed
   conventional manufacturing standards, fatigue properties have been
   consistently inferior due to a significant presence of porosity. Studies
   have shown that adjusting processing parameters can reduce overall
   porosity; however, they frequently utilize methods that give
   insufficient information to properly characterize the porosity (e.g.,
   Archimedes' method). A more detailed examination of the result of
   process parameter adjustments on the size and spatial distribution of
   gas porosity was performed utilizing synchrotron-based x-ray
   microtomography with a minimum feature resolution of 1.5 A mu m.
   Cross-sectional melt pool area was varied systematically via process
   mapping. Increasing melt pool area through the speed function variable
   was observed to significantly reduce porosity in the part.}},

Journal = {{JOM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{960-966}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rapid movement of the melt pool (at a speed around 1 m/s) in selective
   laser melting of metal powder directly implies rapid solidification. In
   this work, the length scale of the as-built microstructure of parts
   built with the alloy AlSi10Mg was measured and compared with the
   well-known relationship between cell size and cooling rate. Cooling
   rates during solidification were estimated using the Rosenthal equation.
   It was found that the solidification structure is the expected cellular
   combination of silicon with alpha-aluminum. The dependence of measured
   cell spacing on calculated cooling rate follows the well-established
   relationship for aluminum alloys. The implication is that cell spacing
   can be manipulated by changing the heat input. Microscopy of polished
   sections through particles of the metal powder used to build the parts
   showed that the particles have a dendritic-eutectic structure; the
   dendrite arm spacings in metal powder particles of different diameters
   were measured and also agree with literature correlations, showing the
   expected increase in secondary dendrite arm spacing with increasing
   particle diameter.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale platform has been developed to model lithium ion battery
   (LIB) electrodes based on the real microstructure morphology. This
   multiscale framework consists of a microscale level where the electrode
   microstructure architecture is modeled and a macroscale level where
   discharge/charge is simulated. The coupling between two scales are
   performed in real time unlike using common surrogate based models for
   microscale. For microscale geometry 3D microstructure is reconstructed
   based on the nano-scale X-ray computed tomography data replacing typical
   computer generated microstructure. It is shown that this model can
   predict the experimental performance of LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode at
   different discharge rates more accurate than the conventional homogenous
   models. The approach employed in this study provides valuable insight
   into the spatial distribution of lithium -ion inside the real
   microstructure of LIB electrodes. The inhomogenous microstructure of LFP
   causes a wider range of physical and electrochemical properties in
   microscale compared to homogenous models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{On a suspension of nearly spherical colloidal particles under

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{791}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of a dilute, monodisperse suspension of nearly spherical
   particles that undergo Brownian rotations in an oscillatory simple shear
   flow is quantified, as a paradigm for large-amplitude oscillatory shear
   (LAOS) rheology of complex fluids. We focus on the `strongly nonlinear'
   regime of LAOS, defined by beta >> 1 and beta/alpha >> 1, where beta is
   a dimensionless shear rate (or Weissenberg number) and alpha is a
   dimensionless oscillation frequency (or Deborah number). We derive an
   asymptotic solution for the long-time periodic orientation probability
   density function of the particles. Our analysis reveals that the
   orientation dynamics consists of `core' regions of rapid oscillation (on
   the time scale of the inverse of the shear-rate amplitude), separated by
   comparatively short `turning' regions of slow evolution when the imposed
   flow vanishes. Uniformly valid approximations to the shear stress and
   normal stress differences (NSDs) of the suspension are then constructed:
   the non-Newtonian contribution to the shear stress, first NSD and second
   NSD, decays as beta(-3/2), beta(-1) and beta(-1/2), respectively, at
   large beta. These stress scalings originate from the orientation
   dynamics at the turning regions. Therefore, it is the occasions when the
   flow vanishes that dominate the rheology of this paradigmatic complex
   fluid under LAOS.}},

Title = {{One-Dimensional Haptic Rendering Using Audio Speaker with Displacement
   Determined by Inductance}},
Journal = {{MACHINES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We report overall design considerations and preliminary results for a
   new haptic rendering device based on an audio loudspeaker. Our
   application models tissue properties during microsurgery. For example,
   the device could respond to the tip of a tool by simulating a particular
   tissue, displaying a desired compressibility and viscosity, giving way
   as the tissue is disrupted, or exhibiting independent motion, such as
   that caused by pulsations in blood pressure. Although limited to one
   degree of freedom and with a relatively small range of displacement
   compared to other available haptic rendering devices, our design
   exhibits high bandwidth, low friction, low hysteresis, and low mass.
   These features are consistent with modeling interactions with delicate
   tissues during microsurgery. In addition, our haptic rendering device is
   designed to be simple and inexpensive to manufacture, in part through an
   innovative method of measuring displacement by existing variations in
   the speaker's inductance as the voice coil moves over the permanent
   magnet. Low latency and jitter are achieved by running the real-time
   simulation models on a dedicated microprocessor, while maintaining
   bidirectional communication with a standard laptop computer for user
   controls and data logging.}},

Title = {{A continuous linear optimal transport approach for pattern analysis in
   image datasets}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{453-462}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present a new approach to facilitate the application of the optimal
   transport metric to pattern recognition on image databases. The method
   is based on a linearized version of the optimal transport metric, which
   provides a linear embedding for the images. Hence, it enables shape and
   appearance modeling using linear geometric analysis techniques in the
   embedded space. In contrast to previous work, we use Mange's formulation
   of the optimal transport problem, which allows for reasonably fast
   computation of the linearized optimal transport embedding for large
   images. We demonstrate the application of the method to recover and
   visualize meaningful variations in a supervised-learning setting on
   several image datasets, including chromatin distribution in the nuclei
   of cells, galaxy morphologies, facial expressions, and bird species
   identification. We show that the new approach allows for high-resolution
   construction of modes of variations and discrimination and can enhance
   classification accuracy in a variety of image discrimination problems.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{674-684}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{Although polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) offer promise as
   efficient, low emission power sources, the large amount of platinum
   catalyst used for the cathode's oxygen reduction (ORR) results in high
   costs. One approach to using less Pt is to increase the oxygen
   concentration at the catalyst by reducing the oxygen transport
   resistances. An important resistance is that of the diffusion media
   (DM). The DM are highly heterogeneous porous carbon fiber substrates
   with a graded composition of additives across their thickness. In this
   work we use an oxygen microsensor with a micro-positioning system to
   measure the oxygen concentration and presence of liquid water in the
   pores at discrete points across the thickness of a commercial carbon
   felt DM in operating PEFCs. Under conditions with no liquid water, the
   DM accounts for 60\% of the oxygen depletion, with 60-70\% of that
   depletion being due to the thin microporous layer (MPL) on the catalyst
   layer (CL) side. Using concentration gradient data, we quantify the
   non-uniform local transport resistance across the DM and relate it to
   high resolution 3D X-ray computed tomography of the same DM. (C) 2015

Title = {{Coaching or gaming? Implications of strategy choice for home based
   stroke rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: The enduring aging of the world population and prospective
   increase of age-related chronic diseases urge the implementation of new
   models for healthcare delivery. One strategy relies on ICT (Information
   and Communications Technology) home-based solutions allowing clients to
   pursue their treatments without institutionalization. Stroke survivors
   are a particular population that could strongly benefit from such
   solutions, but is not yet clear what the best approach is for bringing
   forth an adequate and sustainable usage of home-based rehabilitation
   systems. Here we explore two possible approaches: coaching and gaming.
   Methods: We performed trials with 20 healthy participants and 5 chronic
   stroke survivors to study and compare execution of an elbow flexion and
   extension task when performed within a coaching mode that provides
   encouragement or within a gaming mode. For each mode we analyzed
   compliance, arm movement kinematics and task scores. In addition, we
   assessed the usability and acceptance of the proposed modes through a
   customized self-report questionnaire.
   Results: In the healthy participants sample, 13/20 preferred the gaming
   mode and rated it as being significantly more fun (p < .05), but the
   feedback delivered by the coaching mode was subjectively perceived as
   being more useful (p < .01). In addition, the activity level (number of
   repetitions and total movement of the end effector) was significantly
   higher (p < .001) during coaching. However, the quality of movements was
   superior in gaming with a trend towards shorter movement duration (p =
   .074), significantly shorter travel distance (p < .001), higher movement
   efficiency (p < .001) and higher performance scores (p < .001). Stroke
   survivors also showed a trend towards higher activity levels in
   coaching, but with more movement quality during gaming. Finally, both
   training modes showed overall high acceptance.
   Conclusions: Gaming led to higher enjoyment and increased quality in
   movement execution in healthy participants. However, we observed that
   game mechanics strongly determined user behavior and limited activity
   levels. In contrast, coaching generated higher activity levels. Hence,
   the purpose of treatment and profile of end-users has to be considered
   when deciding on the most adequate approach for home based stroke
   rehabilitation.}},

   to gain insight into the adhesion values. A single adhesion value is
   then found for a given surface description. However, experiments reveal
   a range of values. Here, implementing a simple beam model to gain
   physical insight, we show that an important contribution to the range
   can be due to the placement of asperities relative to the crack tip. For
   example, tall asperities far from the crack tip resist crack healing if
   they contact the substrate, but promote healing if not in contact with
   it. Due to this effect, the beam model predicts a range of values that
   is significant compared with the observed experiment variation.
   Furthermore, as the crack approaches mechanical equilibrium, the
   resisting action tends to dominate over the healing action, and the beam
   model predicts a lower adhesion value than the parallel plate model.
   These effects will be greatest in the case where the elasticity (Tabor)
   parameter is small.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Crystalline polymers have attracted significant interest in recent years
   due to their enhanced mechanical and thermal properties. As one type of
   organic-inorganic hybrid polymer crystals, polysilsesquioxane can be
   synthesized by large-scale and inexpensive so-gel processes with two
   precursors. In this paper, both octylene-bridged and hexylene-bridged
   PSQ crystals are characterized with infrared spectroscopy and X-ray
   crystallography to reveal their super high crystallinity. To study the
   thermal transport in these unique polymer crystals, we use a suspended
   micro thermal device to examine their thermal properties from 20 K to
   320 K, and demonstrate their tunable thermal conductivity by varying the
   length of alkyl chains. We also conduct non-equilibrium molecular
   dynamics simulations to study the phonon behaviors across the hydrogen
   bond interface. The simulation results demonstrate good agreement with
   the experimental results regarding both the value and trend of the PSQ
   thermal conductivity. Furthermore, from the simulation, we find that the
   anharmonic phonon scattering and interfacial anharmnic coupling effects
   across the hydrogen bond interface may explain the experimentally
   observed thermal properties.}},

Abstract = {{Mode-dependent phonon and electron transport properties in Al, Ag, and
   Au are predicted using density functional theory and lattice dynamics
   calculations. The predicted thermal conductivities, electrical
   conductivities, electron-phonon coupling coefficients, and
   electron-phonon mass enhancement parameters are in agreement with
   experimental measurements. At a temperature of 100 K, the phonon
   contribution to the total thermal conductivity of Al is 5\% in bulk and
   increases to 15\% for a 50 nm thick film. In all three metals, phonons
   with mean free paths between 1 and 10 nm are the dominate contributors
   to the thermal conductivity at a temperature of 300 K, while the
   relevant electron mean free paths are 10-100 nm. Despite similar atomic
   masses, the phonon thermal conductivity of Al is an order of magnitude
   smaller than that of silicon due to a larger three-phonon phase space
   and stronger anharmonicity. These results will impact the interpretation
   of thermoreflectance experiments that can resolve carrier-level

Abstract = {{Storage technology is a key enabler for the integration of renewable
   energy resources into power systems because it provides the required
   flexibility to balance, the net load variability and forms a buffer for
   uncertainties. A solution for sizing of energy storage devices in
   electric power systems is presented. The considered planning problem is
   divided into two time perspectives: hourly and intra-hour intervals. For
   the intra-hour time horizon, the algorithm determines the optimal size
   of the energy storage devices to provide the adequate ramping capability
   for the system. This ramping capability guarantees the system ability to
   follow the load in the intra-hour intervals, as well as to alleviate
   short-term wind generation and load fluctuations. In the hourly time
   scale, the optimal size of the storage is determined with respect to
   having a sufficient generation capacity to support the loads. A 6-bus
   test power system is studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Title = {{Black Carbon Emissions from Associated Natural Gas Flaring}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2075-2081}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Approximately 150 billion cubic meters (BCM) of natural gas is flared
   and vented in the world annually, emitting greenhouse gases and other
   pollutants with no energy benefit. About 7 BCM per year is flared in the
   United States, and half is from North Dakota alone. There are few
   emission measurements from associated gas flares and limited black
   carbon (BC) emission factors have been previously reported from the
   field. Emission plumes from 26 individual flares in the Bakken formation
   in North Dakota were sampled. Methane, carbon dioxide, and BC were
   measured simultaneously, allowing the calculation of BC mass emission
   factors using the carbon balance method. Particle optical absorption was
   measured using a threewavelength particle soot absorption photometer
   (PSAP) and BC particle number and mass concentrations were measured with
   a single particle soot photometer. The BC emission factors varied
   magnitude, with an average and uncertainty range of 0.14 0.12 g/kg
   hydrocarbons in associated gas and a median of 0.07 g/kg which
   represents a lower bound on these measurements. An estimation of the BC
   emission factor derived from PSAP absorption provides an upper bound at
   3.1 g/kg. These results are lower than previous estimations and
   laboratory measurements. The BC mass absorption cross section was 16 12
   m(2)/g BC at 530 nm. The average absorption Angstrom exponent was 1.2
   0.8, suggesting that most of the light absorbing aerosol measured was
   black carbon and the contribution of light absorbing organic carbon was
   small.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2099-2107}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{There is a need for continued assessment of methane (CH4) emissions
   associated with natural gas (NG) production, especially as recent
   advancements in horizontal drilling combined with staged hydraulic
   fracturing technologies have dramatically increased NG production (we
   refer to these wells as ``unconventional{''} NG wells). In this study,
   we measured facility-level CH4 emissions rates from the NG production
   sector in the Marcellus region, and compared CH4 emissions between
   unconventional NG (UNG) well pad sites and the relatively smaller and
   older ``conventional{''} NG (C,NG) sites that consist of wells drilled
   vertically into permeable geologic formations. A top-down tracer-flux
   CH4 measurement approach utilizing mobile downwind intercepts of CH4,
   ethane, and tracer (nitrous oxide and acetylene) plumes was performed at
   18 CNG sites (19 individual wells) and 17 UNG sites (88 individual
   wells). The 17 UNG sites included four sites undergoing completion
   flowback (FB). The mean facility-level CH4 emission rate among UNG well
   pad sites in routine production (18.8 kg/h (95\% confidence interval
   (CI) on the mean of 12.0-26.8 kg/h)) was 23 times greater than the mean
   CH4 emissions from C(v)NG sites. These differences were attributed, in
   part, to the large size (based on number of wells and ancillary NG
   production equipment) and the significantly higher production rate of
   UNG sites. However, C(v)NG sites generally had much higher
   production-normalized CH4 emission rates (median: 11\%; range:
   0.35-91\%) compared to UNG sites (median: 0.13\%, range: 0.01-1.2\%),
   likely resulting from a greater prevalence of avoidable process
   operating conditions (e.g., unresolved equipment maintenance issues). At
   the regional scale, we estimate that total annual CH4 emissions from 88
   500 combined C(v)NG well pads in Pennsylvania and West Virginia (660 Gg
   (95\% CI: 500 to 800 Gg)) exceeded that from 3390 UNG well pads by 170
   Gg, reflecting the large number of C(v)NG wells and the comparably large
   fraction of CH4 lost per unit production. The new emissions data suggest
   that the recently instituted Pennsylvania CH4 emissions inventory
   substantially underestimates measured facility-level CH4 emissions by
   >10-40 times for five UNG sites in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have demonstrated a pH-dependent optical transmission
   of silica based nano-composite thin film enabled evanescent wave
   absorption spectroscopy based fiber optic sensors in aqueous solutions.
   Although the response was observed to linearly correlate with the
   pH-dependent surface charge density of the silica matrix, the
   responsible mechanism was not fully clarified. In this manuscript, an
   optical waveguide model is applied to describe observed responses
   through a modified effective refractive index of the silica matrix layer
   as a function of the solution phase pH. The refractive index dependence
   results from a surface charge dependent ionic adsorption, resulting in
   concentration of ionic species at charged surfaces. The resultant
   effective index modification to porous silica is estimated through
   effective medium theories and applied to an optical waveguide model of a
   multi-mode fiber optic based sensor response capable of reproducing all
   experimental observations reported to date. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have great potential for
   cell-based therapies due to their unique intrinsic optical and physical
   characteristics. Consequently, broad classes of dispersants have been
   identified that individually suspend SWCNTs in water and cell media in
   addition to reducing nanotube toxicity to cells. Unambiguous control and
   verification of the localization and distribution of SWCNTs within
   cells, particularly to the nucleus, is needed to advance subcellular
   technologies utilizing nanotubes. Here we report delivery of SWCNTs to
   the nucleus by noncovalently attaching the tail domain of the nuclear
   protein lamin B1 (LB1), which we engineer from the full-length LMNB1
   cDNA. More than half of this low molecular weight globular protein is
   intrinsically disordered but has an immunoglobulin-fold composed of a
   central hydrophobic core, which is highly suitable for associating with
   SWCNTs, stably suspending SWCNTs in water and cell media. In addition,
   LB1 has an exposed nuclear localization sequence to promote active
   nuclear import of SWCNTs. These SWCNTs-LB1 dispersions in water and cell
   media display near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectra with sharp van Hove
   peaks and an NIR fluorescence spectra, suggesting that LB1 individually
   disperses nanotubes. The dispersing capability of SWCNTs by LB1 is
   similar to that by albumin proteins. The SWCNTs-LB1 dispersions with
   concentrations >= 150 MU g/mL (>= 30 MU g/mL) in water (cell media)
   remain stable for >= 75 days (>= 3 days) at 4 degrees C (37 degrees C).
   Further, molecular dynamics modeling of association of LB1 with SWCNTs
   reveal that the exposure of the nuclear localization sequence is
   independent of LB1 binding conformation. Measurements from confocal
   Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, NIR fluorescence imaging of SWCNTs,
   and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy show that millions of these
   SWCNTs-LB1 complexes enter HeLa cells, localize to the nucleus of cells,
   and interact with DNA. We postulate that the modification of native
   cellular proteins as noncovalent dispersing agents to provide specific
   transport will open new possibilities to utilize both SWCNT and protein
   properties for multifunctional subcellular targeting applications.
   Specifically, nuclear targeting could allow delivery of anticancer
   therapies, genetic treatments, or DNA to the nucleus.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of surface acoustic waves to trap and manipulate
   micrometer-scale particles and biological cells has led to many
   applications involving ``acoustic tweezers{''} in biology, chemistry,
   engineering, and medicine. Here, we present 3D acoustic tweezers, which
   use surface acoustic waves to create 3D trapping nodes for the capture
   and manipulation of microparticles and cells along three mutually
   orthogonal axes. In this method, we use standing-wave phase shifts to
   move particles or cells in-plane, whereas the amplitude of acoustic
   vibrations is used to control particle motion along an orthogonal plane.
   We demonstrate, through controlled experiments guided by simulations,
   how acoustic vibrations result in micromanipulations in a microfluidic
   chamber by invoking physical principles that underlie the formation and
   regulation of complex, volumetric trapping nodes of particles and
   biological cells. We further show how 3D acoustic tweezers can be used
   to pick up, translate, and print single cells and cell assemblies to
   create 2D and 3D structures in a precise, noninvasive, label-free, and
   contact-free manner.}},

Title = {{Scalable linkage-disequilibrium-based selective sweep detection: a
   performance guide}},
Journal = {{GIGASCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Linkage disequilibrium is defined as the non-random
   associations of alleles at different loci, and it occurs when genotypes
   at the two loci depend on each other. The model of genetic hitchhiking
   predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage
   disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in
   specific motifs of correlation between neutral polymorphisms that
   surround the fixed beneficial allele. Increased levels of linkage
   disequilibrium are observed on the same side of a beneficial allele, and
   diminish between sites on different sides of a beneficial mutation. This
   specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when
   positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various
   neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal
   targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a
   genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is
   computationally expensive because allele correlations need to be
   evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets
   efficiently, algorithmic implementations used in modern population
   genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a
   scalable way. However, population genomic datasets come in various types
   and shapes while typically showing SNP density heterogeneity, which
   makes the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms a
   challenging task.
   Findings: Here we present a series of four parallelization strategies
   targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive
   problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past
   adaptation of the species, also referred to as regions that have
   undergone a selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium patterns.
   We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel
   algorithms for computing linkage disequilibrium, and outline the
   benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our
   open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all
   four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of
   neutrality tests.
   Conclusions: The computational demands of selective sweep detection
   algorithms depend greatly on the SNP density heterogeneity and the data
   representation. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis
   can lead to significant processing time reduction and major energy
   savings. However, determining which parallel algorithm will execute more
   efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available
   cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{593-598}},

Abstract = {{The response of individual cells at the micro-scale in cell mechanics is
   important in understanding how they are affected by changing
   environments. To control cell stresses, microfluidics can be implemented
   since there is tremendous control over the geometry of the devices.
   Designing microfluidic devices to induce and manipulate stress levels on
   biological cells can be aided by computational modeling approaches. Such
   approaches serve as an efficient precursor to fabricating various
   microfluidic geometries that induce predictable levels of stress on
   biological cells, based on their mechanical properties. Here, a
   three-dimensional, multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   modeling approach was implemented for soft biological materials. The
   computational model incorporates the physics of the particle dynamics,
   fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, which allows us to study how
   stresses affect the cells. By using an Eulerian Lagrangian approach to
   treat the fluid domain as a continuum in the microfluidics, we are
   conducting studies of the cells' movement and the stresses applied to
   the cell. As a result of our studies, we were able to determine that a
   channel with periodically alternating columns of obstacles was capable
   of stressing cells at the highest rate, and that microfluidic systems
   can be engineered to impose heterogenous cell stresses through geometric
   configuring. We found that when using controlled geometries of the
   microfluidics channels with staggered obstructions, we could increase
   the maximum cell stress by nearly 200 times over cells flowing through
   microfluidic channels with no obstructions. Incorporating computational
   modeling in the design of microfluidic configurations for controllable
   cell stressing could help in the design of microfludic devices for
   stressing cells such as cell homogenizers.}},

Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Sickle-cell anaemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder exhibiting
   heterogeneous cell morphology and abnormal rheology, especially under
   hypoxic conditions. By using a multiscale red blood cell (RBC) model
   with parameters derived from patient-specific data, we present a
   mesoscopic computational study of the haemodynamic and rheological
   characteristics of blood from SCA patients with hydroxyurea (HU)
   treatment (on-HU) and those without HU treatment (off-HU). We determine
   the shear viscosity of blood in health as well as in different states of
   disease. Our results suggest that treatment with HU improves or worsens
   the rheological characteristics of blood in SCA depending on the degree
   of hypoxia. However, on-HU groups always have higher levels of
   haematocrit-to-viscosity ratio (HVR) than off-HU groups, indicating that
   HUcan indeed improve the oxygen transport potential of blood. Our
   patient-specific computational simulations suggest that the HVR level,
   rather than the shear viscosity of sickle RBC suspensions, may be a more
   reliable indicator in assessing the response to HU treatment.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{High throughput screening determines the effects of many conditions on a
   given biological target. Currently, to estimate the effects of those
   conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions
   (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally,
   data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for
   many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We
   have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can
   iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple
   effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid
   handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this
   learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the
   subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29\% of
   all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical
   demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological
   experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in
   advance.}},

Abstract = {{When in port, ships burn marine diesel in on-board generators to produce
   electricity and are significant contributors to poor local and regional
   air quality. Supplying ships with grid electricity can reduce these
   emissions. We use two integrated assessment models to quantify the
   benefits of reducing the emissions of NOx, SOD2, PM2.5, and CO2 that
   would occur if shore power were used. Using historical vessel call data,
   we identify combinations of vessels and berths at U.S. ports that could
   be switched to shore power to yield the largest gains for society. Our
   results indicate that, depending on the social costs of pollution
   assumed, an air quality benefit of \$70-150 million per year could be
   achieved by retrofitting a quarter to two-thirds of all vessels that
   call at U.S. ports. Such a benefit could be produced at no net cost to
   society (health and environmental benefits would be balanced by the cost
   of ship and port retrofit) but would require many ships to be equipped
   to receive shore power, even if doing so would result in a private loss
   for the operator. Policy makers could produce a net societal gain by
   implementing incentives and mandates to encourage a shift toward shore
   power.}},

Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Cap and trade programs have historically been designed to achieve annual
   or seasonal reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur
   dioxide from power plants. Emissions reductions may not be temporally
   coincident with meteorological conditions conducive to the formation of
   peak ozone and fine particulate matter concentrations. Integrated power
   system and air quality modeling methods were developed to evaluate
   time-differentiated emissions price signals on high ozone days in the
   Mid-Atlantic portion of the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland (PJM)
   Interconnection and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grids.
   Sufficient flexibility exists in the two grids with marked differences
   in demand and fuel generation mix to accommodate time-differentiated
   emissions pricing alone or in combination with a season-wide program.
   System-wide emissions reductions and production costs from
   time-differentiated pricing are shown to be competitive with those of a
   season-wide program on high ozone days and would be more cost-effective
   if the primary policy goal was to target emissions reductions on these
   days. Time-differentiated pricing layered as a complement to the
   Cross-State Air Pollution Rule had particularly pronounced benefits for
   the Mid-Atlantic PJM system that relies heavily on coal-fired
   generation. Time-differentiated pricing aimed at reducing ozone
   concentrations had particulate matter reduction co-benefits, but if
   particulate matter reductions are the primary objective, other
   approaches to time-differentiated pricing may lead to greater benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Online cyber threat descriptions are rich, but little research has
   attempted to systematically analyze these descriptions. In this paper,
   we process and analyze two of Symantec's online threat description
   corpora. The Anti-Virus (AV) corpus contains descriptions of more than
   12,400 threats detected by Symantec's AV, and the Intrusion Prevention
   System (IPS) corpus contains descriptions of more than 2,700 attacks
   detected by Symantec's IPS. In our analysis, we quantify the over time
   evolution of threat severity and type in the corpora. We also assess the
   amount of time Symantec takes to release signatures for newly discovered
   threats. Our analysis indicates that a very small minority of threats in
   the AV corpus are high-severity, whereas the majority of attacks in the
   IPS corpus are high-severity. Moreover, we find that the prevalence of
   different threat types such as worms and viruses in the corpora varies
   considerably over time. Finally, we find that Symantec prioritizes
   releasing signatures for fast propagating threats.}},

Abstract = {{We present a game theoretic framework that models strategic interactions
   among humans and things that are assumed to be interconnected by a
   social-technological network, as in an internet of humans and things
   (IOHT). Often a pair of agents in the network interacts in order for an
   informed sender-agent to signal an uninformed receiver-agent to take an
   action that benefits each of the players; the benefits to the pair of
   agents are modeled by two separate utility functions, both depending on
   the sender's private information, the signal exchanged, and the
   receiver's revealed (and also possibly unrevealed) action. In general,
   the two agents' utilities may not be aligned and may encourage deceptive
   behavior. For example, a sender, aware of his/her own private ``state of
   ignorance{''}, may seek useful information from a receiver who owns
   powerful computational resources to search a large corpus of webpages;
   the sender does so by sending a signal to the receiver in the form of a
   keyword. Obvious examples of deceptiveness here range from attempts to
   hide one's intentions to auctioning the keywords on an ad exchange
   through real-time bidding. A rather troublesome situation occurs when
   deceptions are employed to breach the security of the system, thus
   making the entire social-technological network unreliable. Earlier, we
   proposed a signaling-game-theoretic framework to alleviate this problem.
   This paper further enhances that framework by reconfiguring signals to
   possess more complex structures (epistatic signals to represent attack
   and defense options over a given set of vulnerabilities). We explore two
   augmentations to the original evolutionary signaling game by first
   enhancing mutation bias toward strategies performing well in previous
   populations and second allowing the parameters of the utility functions
   to depend on population preferences giving rise to a minority game with
   epistatic signaling. The resulting game systems are empirically studied
   through extensive computer simulation.}},

Title = {{Enhanced performance of microfluidic soft pressure sensors with embedded
   solid microspheres}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The cross-sectional geometry of an embedded microchannel influences the
   electromechanical response of a soft microfluidic sensor to applied
   surface pressure. When a pressure is exerted on the surface of the
   sensor deforming the soft structure, the cross-sectional area of the
   embedded channel filled with a conductive fluid decreases, increasing
   the channel's electrical resistance. This electromechanical coupling can
   be tuned by adding solid microspheres into the channel. In order to
   determine the influence of microspheres, we use both analytic and
   computational methods to predict the pressure responses of soft
   microfluidic sensors with two different channel cross-sections: a square
   and an equilateral triangular. The analytical models were derived from
   contact mechanics in which microspheres were regarded as spherical
   indenters, and finite element analysis (FEA) was used for simulation.
   For experimental validation, sensor samples with the two different
   channel cross-sections were prepared and tested. For comparison, the
   sensor samples were tested both with and without microspheres. All three
   results from the analytical models, the FEA simulations, and the
   experiments showed reasonable agreement confirming that the
   multi-material soft structure significantly improved its pressure
   response in terms of both linearity and sensitivity. The embedded solid
   particles enhanced the performance of soft sensors while maintaining
   their flexible and stretchable mechanical characteristic. We also
   provide analytical and experimental analyses of hysteresis of
   microfluidic soft sensors considering a resistive force to the shape
   recovery of the polymer structure by the embedded viscous fluid.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We perform a consequential life cycle analysis of plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and conventional
   gasoline vehicles in the PJM interconnection using a detailed, normative
   optimization model of the PJM electricity grid that captures the change
   in power plant operations and related emissions due to vehicle charging.
   We estimate and monetize the resulting human health and environmental
   damages from life cycle air emissions for each vehicle technology. We
   model PJM using the most recent data available (2010) as well as
   projections of the PJM grid in 2018 and a hypothetical scenario with
   increased wind penetration. We assess a range of sensitivity cases to
   verify the robustness of our results. We find that PEVs have higher life
   cycle air emissions damages than gasoline HEVs in the recent grid
   scenario, which has a high percentage of coal generation on the margin.
   In particular, battery electric vehicles with large battery capacity can
   produce two to three times as much air emissions damage as gasoline
   HEVs, depending on charge timing. In our future 2018 grid scenarios that
   account for predicted coal plant retirements, PEVs would produce air
   emissions damages comparable to or slightly lower than HEVs.}},

Abstract = {{Urban metabolism provides a framework to understand resource flows into
   cities and waste flows out. Its potential has been hampered by the lack
   of good disaggregated data. This article presents energy-use findings
   for the residential sector for the city of Los Angeles based on
   census-block-level aggregation of address-level electricity use obtained
   from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. City or county
   billing data by customer class over time can enable empirical tracking
   of energy conservation and efficiency programs by different customer
   classes, and matched to census information and county tax assessor data
   about building vintage, size, and type can provide information important
   for rate setting, for example, or energy conservation and efficiency
   program investments. We report on median electricity demand and
   corresponding greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures at three
   geographical aggregations: city council district (15 in total);
   neighborhood (114 in total); and census block group (2,538 in total). We
   find that the ratio of median annual demand between highest- and
   lowest-tier users is 26 at the census-block group level, but only 2.2 at
   the city council district level, demonstrating that spatial aggregation
   significantly masks the degree of variation that may be observed. We
   also show how such data can enable the description of energy to develop
   energy disclosure thresholds that reflect a city's morphology. In
   contrast to New York City's 50,000-square-foot reporting threshold, to
   capture half of Los Angeles' electricity consumption, the threshold for
   reporting would have to be 5,000 square feet.}},

Abstract = {{We present a continuous-wave instrument for non-invasive diffuse optical
   imaging of the breast in a parallel-plate transmission geometry. The
   instrument measures continuous spectra in the wavelength range 650-1000
   nm, with an intensity noise level <1.5\% and a spatial sampling rate of
   5 points/cm in the x-and y-directions. We collect the optical
   transmission at four locations, one collinear and three offset with
   respect to the illumination optical fiber, to recover the depth of
   optical inhomogeneities in the tissue. We imaged a tissue-like, breast
   shaped, silicone phantom (6 cm thick) with two embedded absorbing
   structures: a black circle (1.7 cm in diameter) and a black stripe (3 mm
   wide), designed to mimic a tumor and a blood vessel, respectively. The
   use of a spatially multiplexed detection scheme allows for the
   generation of on-axis and off-axis projection images simultaneously, as
   opposed to requiring multiple scans, thus decreasing scan-time and
   motion artifacts. This technique localizes detected inhomogeneities in
   3D and accurately assigns their depth to within 1 mm in the ideal
   conditions of otherwise homogeneous tissue-like phantoms. We also
   measured induced hemodynamic changes in the breast of a healthy human
   subject at a selected location (no scanning). We applied a cyclic,
   arterial blood pressure perturbation by alternating inflation (to a
   pressure of 200 mmHg) and deflation of a pneumatic cuff around the
   subject's thigh at a frequency of 0.05 Hz, and measured oscillations
   with amplitudes up to 1 mu M and 0.2 mu M in the tissue concentrations
   of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, respectively. These hemodynamic
   oscillations provide information about the vascular structure and
   functional integrity in tissue, and may be used to assess healthy or
   abnormal perfusion in a clinical setting. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate parameter recovery and forecast accuracy implications of
   incorporating alternative-specific constants (ASCs) in the utility
   functions of vehicle choice models. We compare two methods of
   incorporating ASCs: (1) a maximum likelihood estimator that computes
   ASCs post-hoc as calibration constants (MLE-C) and (2) a generalized
   method of moments estimator that uses instrumental variables (GMM-IV) to
   correct for price endogeneity. In a synthetic study we observe
   significant coefficient bias with MLE-C when the price-ASC correlation
   (endogeneity) is large. GMM-IV successfully mitigates this bias given
   valid instruments but exacerbates the bias given invalid instruments.
   Despite greater coefficient bias, MLE-C yields better forecasts than
   GMM-IV with valid instruments in most of the cases examined, including
   most cases where the price-ASC correlation present in the estimation
   data is absent in the prediction data. In a market study of U.S. midsize
   sedan sales from 2002 - 2006 the GMM-IV model predicts the
   1-year-forward market better, but the MLE-C model predicts the
   5-year-forward market better. Including an ASC in predictions by any of
   the methods proposed improves share forecasts, and assuming that the ASC
   of each new vehicle matches that of its closest competitor vehicle
   yields the best long term forecasts. We find evidence that the
   instruments most frequently used in the automotive demand literature may
   be invalid. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analyzing Latency-Aware Self-Adaptation Using Stochastic Games and
   Simulations}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS AND ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Self-adaptive systems must decide which adaptations to apply and when.
   In reactive approaches, adaptations are chosen and executed after some
   issue in the system has been detected (e.g., unforeseen attacks or
   failures). In proactive approaches, predictions are used to prepare the
   system for some future event (e.g., traffic spikes during holidays). In
   both cases, the choice of adaptation is based on the estimated impact it
   will have on the system. Current decision-making approaches assume that
   the impact will be instantaneous, whereas it is common that adaptations
   take time to produce their impact. Ignoring this latency is problematic
   because adaptations may not achieve their effect in time for a predicted
   event. Furthermore, lower impact but quicker adaptations may be ignored
   altogether, even if over time the accrued impact is actually higher. In
   this article, we introduce a novel approach to choosing adaptations that
   considers these latencies. To show how this improves adaptation
   decisions, we use a two-pronged approach: (i) model checking of
   Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs) enables us to understand best-and
   worst-case scenarios of optimal latency-aware and non-latency-aware
   adaptation without the need to develop specific adaptation algorithms.
   However, since SMGs do not provide an algorithm to make choices at
   runtime, we propose a (ii) latency-aware adaptation algorithm to make
   decisions at runtime. Simulations are used to explore more detailed
   adaptation behavior and to check if the performance of the algorithm
   falls within the bounds predicted by SMGs. Our results show that latency
   awareness improves adaptation outcomes and also allows a larger set of
   adaptations to be exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional radioactive I-125 monolayers are a recent development
   that combines the fields of radiochemistry and nanoscience. These
   Au-supported monolayers show great promise for understanding the local
   interaction of radiation with 2D molecular layers, offer different
   directions for surface patterning, and enhance the emission of
   chemically and biologically relevant low-energy electrons. However, the
   elemental composition of these monolayers is in constant flux due to the
   nuclear transmutation of I-125 to Te-125, and their precise composition
   and stability under ambient conditions has yet to be elucidated. Unlike
   I, which is stable and unreactive when bound to Au, the newly formed Te
   atoms would be expected to be more reactive. We have used electron
   emission and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to quantify the
   emitted electron energies and to track the film composition in vacuum
   and the effect of exposure to ambient conditions. Our results reveal
   that the Auger electrons emitted during the ultrafast radioactive decay
   process have a kinetic energy corresponding to neutral Te. By combining
   XPS and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments with density
   functional theory, we are able to identify the reaction of newly formed
   Te to TeO2 and its subsequent dimerization. The fact that the Te2O4
   units stay intact during major lateral rearrangement of the monolayer
   illustrates their stability. These results provide an atomic-scale
   picture of the composition and mobility of surface species in a
   radioactive monolayer as well as an understanding of the stability of
   the films under ambient conditions, which is a critical aspect in their
   future applications.}},

Abstract = {{In a long-haul sensor network, sensors are remotely deployed over a
   large geographical area to perform certain tasks, such as target
   tracking. In this paper, we study the scenario where sensors take
   measurements of one or more dynamic targets and send state estimates of
   the targets to a fusion center via satellite links. The severe loss and
   delay inherent over the satellite channels reduce the number of
   estimates successfully arriving at the fusion center, thereby limiting
   the potential fusion gain and resulting in suboptimal accuracy
   performance of the fused estimates. In addition, the errors in
   target-sensor data association can also degrade the estimation
   performance. To mitigate the effect of imperfect communications on state
   estimation and fusion, we consider retransmission and retrodiction. The
   system adopts certain retransmission-based transport protocols so that
   lost messages can be recovered over time. Moreover,
   retrodiction/smoothing techniques are applied so that the chances of
   incurring excess delay due to retransmission are greatly reduced. We
   analyze the extent to which retransmission and retrodiction can improve
   the performance of delay-sensitive target tracking tasks under variable
   communication loss and delay conditions. Simulation results of a
   ballistic target tracking application are shown in the end to
   demonstrate the validity of our analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) has been associated with
   diminished biomechanical strength and disruption in the collagen fiber
   microarchitecture. Additionally, the congenital bicuspid aortic valve
   (BAV) leads to a distinct extracellular matrix structure that may be
   related to ATAA development at an earlier age than degenerative
   aneurysms arising in patients with the morphological normal tricuspid
   aortic valve (TAV). The purpose of this study was to model the
   fiber-reinforced mechanical response of ATM specimens from patients with
   either BAV or TAV. This was achieved by combining image-analysis derived
   parameters of collagen fiber dispersion and alignment with tensile
   testing data. Then, numerical simulations were performed to assess the
   role of anisotropic constitutive formulation on the wall stress
   distribution of aneurysmal aorta. Re suits indicate that both BAV ATM
   and TAV ATM have altered collagen fiber architecture in the medial plane
   of experimentally-dissected aortic tissues when compared to normal
   ascending aortic specimens. The study findings highlight that
   differences in the collagen fiber distribution mostly influences the
   resulting wall stress distribution rather than the peak stress. We
   conclude that fiber-reinforced constitutive modeling that takes into
   account the collagen fiber defect inherent to the aneurysmal ascending
   aorta is paramount for accurate finite element predictions and
   ultimately for biomechanical-based indicators to reliably distinguish
   the more from the less `malignant' ATAAs. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by

Title = {{Design of microfluidic channels for magnetic separation of

Abstract = {{This study is motivated by the development of a blood cell filtration
   device for removal of malaria-infected, parasitized red blood cells
   (pRBCs). The blood was modeled as a multi-component fluid using the
   computational fluid dynamics discrete element method (CFD-DEM), wherein
   plasma was treated as a Newtonian fluid and the red blood cells (RBCs)
   were modeled as soft-sphere solid particles which move under the
   influence of drag, collisions with other RBCs, and a magnetic force. The
   CFD-DEM model was first validated by a comparison with experimental data
   from Han and Frazier (Lab Chip 6: 265-273, 2006) involving a
   microfluidic magnetophoretic separator for paramagnetic deoxygenated
   blood cells. The computational model was then applied to a parametric
   study of a parallel-plate separator having hematocrit of 40 \% with 10
   \% of the RBCs as pRBCs. Specifically, we investigated the hypothesis of
   introducing an upstream constriction to the channel to divert the
   magnetic cells within the near-wall layer where the magnetic force is
   greatest. Simulations compared the efficacy of various geometries upon
   the stratification efficiency of the pRBCs. For a channel with nominal
   height of 100 mu m, the addition of an upstream constriction of 80 \%
   improved the proportion of pRBCs retained adjacent to the magnetic wall
   (separation efficiency) by almost twofold, from 26 to 49 \%. Further
   addition of a downstream diffuser reduced remixing and hence improved
   separation efficiency to 72 \%. The constriction introduced a greater
   pressure drop (from 17 to 495 Pa), which should be considered when
   scaling up this design for a clinical-sized system. Overall, the
   advantages of this design include its ability to accommodate
   physiological hematocrit and high throughput, which is critical for
   clinical implementation as a blood-filtration system.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{713-723}},

Abstract = {{Strategies for managing climate-change risks impact diverse stakeholder
   groups that possess potentially conflicting preferences. Basic physics
   and economics suggest that reconciling all of these preference conflicts
   may not be possible. Moreover, different climate risk management
   strategies can yield diverse and potentially severe impacts across
   different global stakeholders. These preference conflicts and their
   uncertain impacts require an explicit understanding of the trade-offs
   that emerge across different risk management strategies. Traditionally,
   integrated assessment models (IAMs) typically aggregate the
   stakeholders' preferences across the entire globe into a single, a
   priori defined utility function. This framing hides climate risk
   management trade-offs as well as the inherent stakeholder compromises
   implicit to the resulting single ``optimal{''} expected utility
   solution. Here, we analyze a simple IAM to quantify and visualize the
   multidimensional trade-offs among four objectives representing global
   concerns: (i) global economic productivity, (ii) reliable temperature
   stabilization, (iii) climate damages, and (iv) abatement costs. We
   quantify and visualize the trade-offs across these objectives and
   demonstrate how a traditional optimal expected utility policy implicitly
   eliminates many relevant policy pathways. Explicit trade-off analysis
   provides a richer context for exploring conflicting global policy
   preferences and clarifies the implications of alternative climate risk
   mitigation policies to better inform negotiated compromises.}},

Title = {{A new method for temperature-field reconstruction during

Journal = {{CRYOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The current study aims at developing computational tools in order to
   gain information about the thermal history in areas invisible to
   ultrasound imaging during cryosurgery. This invisibility results from
   the high absorption rate of the ultrasound energy by the frozen region,
   which leads to an apparent opacity in the cryotreated area and a shadow
   behind it. A proof-of-concept for freezing-front estimation is
   demonstrated in the current study, using the new potential-field analogy
   method (PFAM). This method is further integrated with a recently
   developed temperature-field reconstruction method (TFRM) to estimate the
   temperature distribution within the frozen region. This study uses
   prostate cryosurgery as a developmental model and trans-rectal
   ultrasound imaging as a choice of practice. Results of this study
   indicate that the proposed PFAM is a viable and computationally
   inexpensive solution to estimate the extent of freezing in the acoustic
   shadow region. Comparison of PFAM estimations and experimental data
   shows an average mismatch of less than 2 mm in freezing-front location,
   which is comparable to the uncertainty in ultrasound imaging. Comparison
   of the integrated PFAM + TFRM scheme with a full-scale finite-elements
   analysis (FEA) indicates an average mismatch of 0.9 mm for the freezing
   front location and 0.1 mm for the lethal temperature isotherm of -45
   degrees C. Comparison of the integrated PFAM + TFRM scheme with
   experimental temperature measurements show a difference in the range of
   2 degrees C and 6 degrees C for selected points of measurement. Results
   of this study demonstrate the integrated PFAM + TFRM scheme as a viable
   and computationally inexpensive means to gain information about the
   thermal history in the frozen region during ultrasound-monitored
   cryosurgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) is present in a variety of solid wastes including
   industrial wastes, household products, consumer electronics, and medical
   wastes, some of which can be disposed in conventional landfills. The
   presence of this neurotoxic metal in landfills is a concern due to the
   potential for it to leach or volatilize from the landfill and impact
   local ecosystems. The objective of this review is to describe general
   practices for the disposal of mercury-bearing solid wastes, summarize
   previous studies on the release of mercury from landfills, and delineate
   the expected transformations of Hg within landfill environments that
   would influence transport of Hg via landfill gas and leachate. A few
   studies have documented the emissions of Hg as landfill gas, primarily
   as gaseous elemental Hg(0) and smaller amounts as methylated Hg species.
   Much less is known regarding the release of Hg in leachate. Landfill
   conditions are unique from other subsurface environments in that they
   can contain water with very high conductivity and organic carbon
   concentration. Landfills also experience large changes in redox
   potential (and the associated microbial community) that greatly
   influence Hg speciation, transformations, and mobilization potential.
   Generally, Hg is not likely to persist in large quantities as dissolved
   species, since Hg(0) tends to evolve in the gas phase and divalent
   Hg(II) sorbs strongly to particulate phases including organic carbon and
   sulfides. However, Hg(II) has the potential to associate with or form
   colloidal particles that can be mobilized in porous media under high
   organic carbon conditions. Moreover, the anaerobic conditions within
   landfills can foster the growth of microorganisms that produced
   monomethyl-and dimethyl-Hg species, the forms of mercury with high
   potential for bioaccumulation. Much advancement has recently been made
   in the mercury biogeochemistry research field, and this study seeks to
   incorporate these findings for landfill settings.}},

   implemented in several pilot sequestration sites for site
   characterization and CO2 leakage detection. This study evaluates the
   detection power of seismic wave travel time measurements and statistical
   tests at different CO2 leakage rate levels. A simplified rock physics
   model is assumed for monitoring zones at sequestration sites and the
   effects of leakage-induced changes in pressure and CO2 saturation on
   P-wave travel times are modeled. The empirical distributions of
   detection power using the P-wave travel time for four regions in the
   permeability-porosity input space at four leakage levels are obtained
   from the Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis with a stochastic response
   surface method. The detection power using the P-wave travel time
   measurements and test alone is generally not high enough, unless the
   porosity and the permeability of the monitoring zone are high, and/or a
   long period of time has elapsed since the leakage occurred. For
   monitoring layers with lower permeability and porosity, measurements
   from other monitoring techniques will likely be needed to increase the
   probability that leakage events are detected and addressed in a timely
   manner. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The oral delivery of macromolecular drugs, including proteins and
   nucleic acids, is one of the greatest unmet needs in modern biomedicine.
   Although engineering solutions have been used to overcome enzymatic
   degradation and the low pH in the stomach, poor absorption across the
   intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream continues to pose the most
   significant challenge to clinical translation. One common approach to
   increase the flux of macromolecules across the intestinal epithelium is
   the use of chemical permeation enhancers. Unfortunately, the vast
   majority of effective enhancers have been thwarted by toxicity, and the
   structural and molecular parameters that contribute to this behavior are
   poorly understood. Previous work has shown that select
   piperazine-derived molecules favorably affect transepithelial and
   intracellular delivery outcomes, suggesting that piperazine-derived
   molecules interface uniquely with cellular barriers. To gain a better
   understanding of piperazine-mediated permeation enhancement, this work
   examined piperazine and 13 of its simple, hydrocarbon-substituted
   derivatives using Caco-2 monolayers as a model of the intestinal
   epithelium. After evaluating each piperazine for permeation enhancement
   efficacy and cytotoxicity at three concentrations, it became clear that
   piperazine derivatives consistently enhance permeability with each
   derivative resulting in noncytotoxic permeation enhancement at one or
   more concentrations. In attempting to identify structure function
   relationships for the piperazine derivatives, it was found that
   treatment concentration, structural characteristics, and molecular pK(a)
   were not reliable indicators of permeation potential. Interestingly, the
   pH of the enhancer solution was identified as a controlling parameter
   even when accounting for the effects from pH change alone. Specifically,
   piperazine treatments with a pH between 9.2 and 9.6 guaranteed
   noncytotoxic efficacy. Furthermore, all effective treatments resulted in
   pH values between 8.7 and 9.6, behavior that was not shared by the other
   small, noncyclic amines studied. These data have important implications
   in the design of oral biologic delivery systems that employ permeation
   enhancers and underscore the need to carefully control the final
   treatment pH of the local intestinal epithelial environment.}},

Title = {{Is rooftop solar PV at socket parity without subsidies?}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{84-94}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Installations of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) technology in the
   United States have increased dramatically in recent years, in large part
   because of state and federal subsidies. In the future, such subsidies
   may be reduced or eliminated. From the homeowner's perspective, solar PV
   is competitive when it can produce electricity at a cost equivalent to
   the retail electricity rate, a condition sometimes referred to as
   ``socket parity{''}. In assessing the economic viability of residential
   solar PV, most existing literature considers only a few locations and
   fails to consider the differences in PV system cost and electricity
   prices that exist across the U.S. We combined insolation data from more
   than 1000 locations, installation costs by region, and county-level
   utility rates to provide a more complete economic assessment of rooftop
   solar PV across the U.S. We calculated the break-even electricity prices
   and evaluated the reductions in installed costs needed to reach socket
   parity. Among the scenarios considered, we estimate that only Hawaii has
   achieved socket parity without the use of subsidies. With subsidies, six
   states reach socket parity, yet widespread parity is still not achieved.
   We find that high installation costs and financing rates are two of the
   largest barriers to socket parity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Invertible image representation methods (transforms) are routinely

   current use (e.g., Fourier, wavelet, and so on) are linear transforms

   representation of image classes for classification. Here, we describe a
   nonlinear, invertible, low-level image processing transform based on
   combining the well-known Radon transform for image data, and the 1D
   cumulative distribution transform proposed earlier. We describe a few of
   the properties of this new transform, and with both theoretical and
   experimental results show that it can often render certain problems
   linearly separable in a transform space.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by recently derived fundamental limits on total (transmit +
   decoding) power for coded communication with VLSI decoders, this paper
   investigates the scaling behavior of the minimum total power needed to
   communicate over AWGN channels as the target bit-error-probability tends
   to zero. We focus on regular-LDPC codes and iterative message-passing
   decoders. We analyze scaling behavior under two VLSI complexity models
   of decoding. One model abstracts power consumed in processing elements
   (node model), and another abstracts power consumed in wires which
   connect the processing elements (wire model). We prove that a coding
   strategy using regular-LDPC codes with Gallager-B decoding achieves
   order-optimal scaling of total power under the node model. However, we
   also prove that regular-LDPC codes and iterative message-passing
   decoders cannot meet existing fundamental limits on total power under
   the wire model. Furthermore, if the transmit energy-per-bit is bounded,
   total power grows at a rate that is worse than uncoded transmission.
   Complementing our theoretical results, we develop detailed physical
   models of decoding implementations using post-layout circuit
   simulations. Our theoretical and numerical results show that approaching
   fundamental limits on total power requires increasing the complexity of
   both the code design and the corresponding decoding algorithm as
   communication distance is increased or error-probability is lowered.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment and reuse of brines, produced from energy extraction
   activities, requires aqueous solubility data for organic compounds in
   saline solutions. The presence of salts decreases the aqueous solubility
   of organic compounds (i.e. salting-out effect) and can be modeled using
   the Setschenow Equation, the validity of which has not been assessed in
   high salt concentrations. In this study, we used solid-phase
   microextraction to determine Setschenow constants for selected organic
   compounds in aqueous solutions up to 2-5 M NaCl, 1.5-2 M CaCl2, and in
   Na-Ca binary electrolyte solutions to assess additivity of the
   constants. These compounds exhibited log-linear behavior up to these
   high NaCl concentrations. Log-linear decreases in solubility with
   increasing salt concentration were observed up to 1.5-2 M CaCl2 for all
   compounds, and added to a sparse database of CaCl2 Setschenow constants.
   Setschenow constants were additive in binary electrolyte mixtures. New
   models to predict CaCl2 and KCl Setschenow constants from NaCl
   Setschenow constants were developed, which successfully predicted the
   solubility of the compounds measured in this study. Overall, data show
   that the Setschenow Equation is valid for a wide range of salinity
   conditions typically found in energy-related technologies. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While modern computer aided design (CAD) systems currently offer tools
   for generating simple patterns, such as uniformly spaced rectangular or
   radial patterns, these tools are limited in several ways: (1) They
   cannot be applied to free-form geometries used in industrial design, (2)
   patterning of these features happens within a single working plane and
   is not applicable to highly curved surfaces, and (3) created features
   lack anisotropy and spatial variations, such as changes in the size and
   orientation of geometric features within a given region. In this paper,
   we introduce a novel approach for creating anisotropic patterns of
   geometric features on free-form surfaces. Complex patterns are generated
   automatically, such that they conform to the boundary of any specified
   target region. Furthermore, user input of a small number of geometric
   features (called ``seed features{''}) of desired size and orientation in
   preferred locations could be specified within the target domain. These
   geometric seed features are then transformed into tensors and used as
   boundary conditions to generate a Riemannian metric tensor field. A form
   of Laplace's heat equation is used to produce the field over the target
   domain, subject to specified boundary conditions. The field represents
   the anisotropic pattern of geometric features. This procedure is
   implemented as an add-on for a commercial CAD package to add geometric
   features to a target region of a three-dimensional model using two set
   operations: union and subtraction. This method facilitates the creation
   of a complex pattern of hundreds of geometric features in less than 5
   min. All the features are accessible from the CAD system, and if
   required, they are manipulable individually by the user.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of multiple phases on the evolution of texture during cold
   rolling and annealing of a copper-iron multilayer, fabricated by
   accumulative roll bonding, has been studied. The presence of an iron
   layer affects the deformation texture of the copper layer only at very
   large strains. On the other hand, a strong effect of copper on iron is
   observed at both small and large strains. At smaller strains, the larger
   deformation carried by the copper suppresses the texture development in
   the iron, whereas, at higher strains, selection of specific orientation
   relationship at the interface influences the texture of the iron layer.
   Shear banding and continuous dynamic recrystallization were found to
   influence the evolution of texture in the copper layer. The influence of
   large plastic deformation on the recrystallization behavior of copper is
   demonstrated with the suppression of typical fcc annealing texture
   components, described as constrained recrystallization. Evolution of
   typical annealing texture component is suppressed because of the
   multilayer microstructure. The plane of the interface formed during
   deformation is determined by a combination of the rolling texture of
   individual phases, constrained annealing, and the tendency to form a
   low-energy interface between the two phases during annealing.}},

Abstract = {{The challenges of guided-wave based structural health monitoring can be
   discussed under three headings: (a) multiple modes, (b) multi-path
   reflections, and (c) sensitivity to environmental and operational
   conditions (EOCs). The objective of this paper is to develop damage
   detection methods that simplify guided-wave signals while retaining
   damage information and have low sensitivity to EOC variations. A
   supervised method is proposed for damage detection. The detection
   performance is maximized, by imposing a sparsity constraint on the
   signals. This paper reports a diverse set of laboratory and field
   experiments validating the extent to which EOC variations, as well as
   damage characteristics can influence the discriminatory power of the
   damage-sensitive features. The laboratory setup includes an aluminum
   pipe with temperature varying between 24 and 38 degrees C. The method is
   further validated using an operational hot water supply piping system of
   different size and configuration than the one used in the laboratory,
   which operates under noisy environment, with constantly varying flow
   rate, temperature, and inner pressure. Moreover, the proposed method is
   used to detect occurrence of consecutive actual damages, namely, a crack
   and a mass loss as small as 10\% and 8\% of the wall thickness,
   respectively. The validation results suggest that a simple
   binary-labeled training data (i.e., undamaged/damaged), obtained under a
   limited range of EOCs, are sufficient for the proposed method. That is,
   the detection method does not require prior knowledge about the
   characteristics of the damage (e.g., size, type, and location), and/or a
   training dataset that is obtained from a wide range of EOCs. Copyright

Title = {{Identification and management of technical debt: A systematic mapping
   study}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{100-121}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Context: The technical debt metaphor describes the effect of immature
   artifacts on software maintenance that bring a short-term benefit to the
   project in terms of increased productivity and lower cost, but that may
   have to be paid off with interest later. Much research has been
   performed to propose mechanisms to identify debt and decide the most
   appropriate moment to pay it off. It is important to investigate the
   current state of the art in order to provide both researchers and
   practitioners with information that enables further research activities
   as well as technical debt management in practice.
   Objective: This paper has the following goals: to characterize the types
   of technical debt, identify indicators that can be used to find
   technical debt, identify management strategies, understand the maturity
   level of each proposal, and identify what visualization techniques have
   been proposed to support technical debt identification and management
   activities.
   Method: A systematic mapping study was performed based on a set of three
   research questions. In total, 100 studies, dated from 2010 to 2014, were
   evaluated.
   Results: We proposed an initial taxonomy of technical debt types,
   created a list of indicators that have been proposed to identify
   technical debt, identified the existing management strategies, and
   analyzed the current state of art on technical debt, identifying topics
   where new research efforts can be invested.
   Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help to identify
   points that still require further investigation in technical debt
   research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an extended Truncated Hierarchical
   Catmull-Clark Subdivision (eTHCCS) method, which improves the efficiency
   of local refinement in Truncated Hierarchical Catmull-Clark Subdivision
   (THCCS). Based on the Stam's method, we first build a set of basis
   functions over arbitrary quadrilateral meshes and apply them to THCCS.
   Then, a new basis-function-insertion scheme is developed with the aid of
   the truncation mechanism, which refines one-ring neighboring elements
   rather than two-ring neighborhoods. Therefore, eTHCCS significantly
   improves the efficiency of local refinement compared with THCCS, as
   demonstrated by one benchmark problem and several complex models.
   Moreover, eTHCCS is also proved to preserve the input geometry and
   produce nested spaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the use of subnanometer adhesion layers significantly
   enhances the thermal interface conductance at metal-dielectric
   interfaces. A metal-dielectric interface between Au and sapphire (Al2O3)
   is considered using Cu (low optical loss) and Cr (high optical loss) as
   adhesion layers. To enable high throughput measurements, each adhesion
   layer is deposited as a wedge such that a continuous range of
   thicknesses could be sampled. Our measurements of thermal interface
   conductance at the metal-Al2O3 interface made using frequency-domain
   thermoreflectance show that a 1-nm-thick adhesion layer of Cu or Cr is
   sufficient to enhance the thermal interface conductance by more than a
   factor of 2 or 4, respectively, relative to the pure Au/Al2O3 interface.
   The enhancement agrees with the diffuse-mismatch-model-based predictions
   of accumulated thermal conductance versus adhesion-layer thickness
   assuming that it contributes phonons with wavelengths less than its
   thickness, while those with longer wavelengths transmit directly from
   the Au.}},

Abstract = {{We present measurements of thermal interface conductance as a function
   of metal alloy composition. Composition spread alloy films of AuxCu1-x
   and AuxPd1-x solid solutions were deposited on single crystal sapphire
   substrates via dual electron-beam evaporation. High throughput
   measurements of thermal interface conductance across the (metal
   alloy)-sapphire interfaces were made by positional scanning of frequency
   domain thermoreflectance measurements to sample a continuum of Au atomic
   fractions (x similar to 0 -> 1). At a temperature of 300 K, the thermal
   interface conductance at the AuxCu1-x-sapphire interfaces monotonically
   decreased from 197 +/- 39 MW m(-2) K-1 to 74 +/- 11 MW m(-2) K-1 for x =
   0 -> 0.95 +/- 0.02 and at the AuxPd1-x-sapphire interfaces from 167 +/-
   35 MW m(-2) K-1 to 60 +/- 10 MW m(-2) K-1 for x = 0.03 -> 0.97 +/- 0.02.
   To shed light on the phonon physics at the interface, a Diffuse Mismatch
   Model for thermal interface conductance with alloys is presented and
   agrees reasonably with the thermal interface conductance data.}},

Abstract = {{Tertiary treatment is needed to render secondary-treated municipal
   wastewater usable in power plant cooling systems. Various tertiary
   treatment options exist to provide different levels of water quality.
   This paper integrates life cycle inventory emissions from a life cycle
   assessment approach with direct costs to determine the optimal treatment
   alternative based on cost-effectiveness and environmental
   sustainability. The costs of damage due to air emissions released during
   construction and operation of tertiary treatment alternatives were
   estimated using a hybrid based approach and were converted to external
   damage costs. Greenhouse gas emission (CO2 eq.), acidifying gas emission
   (SO2 and NOx), and particulate matter (PM2.5) emission unit costs were
   obtained from a Social Carbon Costs study, and cost factors from the Air
   Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy model were used to determine.
   the total costs of emissions. The sum of average air emissions impact
   costs for the selected treatment processes were found to be between 5
   and 8\% of the total costs for tertiary treatment. Accounting for the
   external air emission costs provides a measure to assess the relative
   environmental costs of tertiary treatment options for reuse of treated
   municipal wastewater in cooling systems. Environmental costs of other
   emissions to air, water and land, as well as benefits stemming from
   offsetting freshwater withdrawal by reusing treated effluent in power
   plant cooling systems were not included in the analysis. (C) 2015

Title = {{Electromagnetic Induction of Zerovalent Iron (ZVI) Powder and Nanoscale
   Zerovalent Iron (NZVI) Particles Enhances Dechlorination of
   Trichloroethylene in Contaminated Groundwater and Soil: Proof of Concept}},

Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{This study evaluates the concept of using zerovalent iron (ZVI) powder
   or nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles in combination with a low
   frequency (150 kHz) AC electromagnetic field (AC EMF) to effectively
   remove trichloroethylene (TCE) from groundwater and saturated soils. ZVI
   and NZVI are ferromagnetic, which can induce heat under applied AC EMF.
   The heat generated by ZVI and NZVI induction can increase the rate of
   dechlorination, according to Arrhenius equation, and increase the rate
   of TCE desorption from TCE-sorbed soil. Both dechlorination and TCE
   desorption enhance the overall TCE removal rate. We evaluated this novel
   concept in laboratory batch reactors. We found that both ZVI and NZVI
   can induce heat under applied AC EMF up to 120 degrees C in 20 min.
   Using ZVI and NZVI with AC EMF enhanced dechlorination of dissolved TCE
   (no soil) up to 4.96-fold. In addition to increasing the temperature by
   ZVI and NZVI induction heating, AC EMF increased intrinsic ZVI and NZVI
   reactivity, ostensibly due to accelerated corrosion, as demonstrated by
   the increased ORP. In a soil-water-TCE system, NZVI together with AC EMF
   thermally enhanced desorption of TCE from soil and increased the
   degradation of TCE up to 5.36-fold compared to the absence of AC EMF.
   For the first time, this study indicates the potential for ZVI and NZVI
   coupled with AC EMF as a combined remediation technique for increasing
   the rate and completeness of in situ cleanup of adsorbed phase
   contaminants.}},

Title = {{Operational resilience: concepts, design and analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Building resilience into today's complex infrastructures is critical to
   the daily functioning of society and its ability to withstand and
   recover from natural disasters, epidemics, and cyber-threats. This study
   proposes quantitative measures that capture and implement the definition
   of engineering resilience advanced by the National Academy of Sciences.
   The approach is applicable across physical, information, and social
   domains. It evaluates the critical functionality, defined as a
   performance function of time set by the stakeholders. Critical
   functionality is a source of valuable information, such as the
   integrated system resilience over a time interval, and its robustness.
   The paper demonstrates the formulation on two classes of models: 1)
   multi-level directed acyclic graphs, and 2) interdependent coupled
   networks. For both models synthetic case studies are used to explore
   trends. For the first class, the approach is also applied to the Linux
   operating system. Results indicate that desired resilience and
   robustness levels are achievable by trading off different design
   parameters, such as redundancy, node recovery time, and backup supply
   available. The nonlinear relationship between network parameters and
   resilience levels confirms the utility of the proposed approach, which
   is of benefit to analysts and designers of complex systems and networks.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an exact solution framework for the Consistent Traveling
   Salesman Problem. This problem calls for identifying the minimum-cost
   set of routes that a single vehicle should follow during the multiple
   time periods of a planning horizon, in order to provide consistent
   service to a given set of customers. Each customer may require service
   in one or multiple time periods and the requirement for consistent
   service applies at each customer location that requires service in more
   than one time period. This requirement corresponds to restricting the
   difference between the earliest and latest vehicle arrival-times, across
   the multiple periods, to not exceed some given allowable limit. We
   present three mixed-integer linear programming formulations for this
   problem and introduce a new class of valid inequalities to strengthen
   these formulations. The new inequalities are used in conjunction with
   traditional traveling salesman inequalities in a branch-and-cut
   framework. We test our framework on a comprehensive set of benchmark
   instances, which we compiled by extending traveling salesman instances
   from the well-known TSPLIB library into multiple periods, and show that
   instances with up to 50 customers, requiring service over a 5-period
   horizon, can be solved to guaranteed optimality. Our computational
   experience suggests that enforcing arrival-time consistency in a
   multi-period setting can be achieved with merely a small increase in
   total routing costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European

Abstract = {{In this paper, we define a new problem related to social media, namely,
   the data-driven engineering of social dynamics. More precisely, given a
   set of observations from the past, we aim at finding the best short-term
   intervention that can lead to predefined long-term outcomes. Toward this
   end, we propose a general formulation that covers two useful engineering
   tasks as special cases, namely, pattern matching and profit
   maximization. By incorporating a deep learning model, we derive a
   solution using convex relaxation and quadratic-programming
   transformation. Moreover, we propose a data-driven evaluation method in
   place of the expensive field experiments. Using a Twitter dataset, we
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our dynamics engineering approach for
   both pattern matching and profit maximization, and study the
   multifaceted interplay among several important factors of dynamics
   engineering, such as solution validity, pattern-matching accuracy, and
   intervention cost. Finally, the method we propose is general enough to
   work with multi-dimensional time series, so it can potentially be used
   in many other applications.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{322-333}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Rafting, the directional coarsening of y' precipitates in a gamma/gamma'
   microstructure, can affect the mechanical performance and lifetime of
   Ni-based superalloys. While rafting has been commonly observed in many
   systems, a criterion for the onset and completion of rafting has not
   been fully established. In this work, we employ 2D and 3D moment
   invariants (MIs) to track the evolution of a synthetic gamma/gamma'
   microstructure under a tensile load as a function of time. Systems with
   negative and positive misfit are considered. Under normal conditions, y'
   precipitates have high MI values characteristic of cuboidal shapes,
   while rafted precipitates have low MI values. The onset of rafting is
   defined as the time at which more than half of the y' precipitates have
   20 MIs in particular regions of interest of the MI density maps. The
   rafting completion time is defined as the time at which the initial
   linear trend slows down with time. The MI approach is also compared to
   other shape parameters and is shown to provide a convenient
   ``all-in-one{''} shape descriptor that can detect the elongation and
   wavy morphology of the rafted precipitates, as well as the morphological
   changes in the gamma/gamma' microstructure as a function of time.

Title = {{Parsing abnormal grain growth}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{681-687}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Abnormal grain growth, the enlargement of a minority of grains in a
   polycrystal at the expense of the surrounding grains, occurs in both
   metallic and ceramic materials and can have a profound impact on their
   mechanical and electrical properties. Somewhat surprisingly then, there
   is little consensus as to which specific microstructural features
   provide a signature of abnormal growth. Indeed, some workers describe
   this phenomenon in terms of a bimodal grain size distribution, often
   without justification, while others focus on very few, elongated grains.
   Using specialty alumina (i.e., high-purity aluminum oxide with tailored
   impurity composition) as our prototype, we describe here a set of
   practical maps and metrics that are useful in quantifying various
   microstructural features that are associated with abnormal grain growth.
   These maps provide a visual ``fingerprint{''} of abnormal growth, while
   the metrics permit the design of processing routes to obtain desired
   microstructures. We then present an application of correlation analysis
   that illustrates the efficacy of data analytics in quantifying which
   input (i.e., processing) variables exert the strongest influence on
   abnormal grain growth. Finally, we outline the use of this methodology
   to examine correlations among processing variables and the
   thermomechanical and kinetic properties of materials (e.g., strength,
   hardness, thermal conductivity, etc.). (c) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Matrix free assemblies of polymer-grafted, ``hairy{''} nanoparticles
   (aHNP) exhibit novel morphology, dielectric, and mechanical properties,
   as well as providing means to overcome dispersion challenges ubiquitous
   to conventional polymer-inorganic nanocomposite blends. Physical aging
   of the amorphous polymer glass between the close-packed nanoparticles
   (NPs) will dominate long-term stability; however, the energetics of
   volume recovery within the aHNPs is unknown. Herein, we compare glass
   transition temperature (T-g) and enthalpy recovery of aHNPs to
   NP-polymer blends, across different nano-silica loadings (0-50 v/v\%)
   and canopy architecture of polystyrene (PS) grafted silica. For aHNPs,
   the grafting of PS to silica imposes an additional design constraint
   between silica volume fraction, graft density, and graft molecular
   weight. At low and intermediate silica volume fraction, the Inc of
   blended nanocomposites is independent of silica content, reflecting a
   neutral polymer-NP interface. For aHNPs, the T-g decreases with silica
   content, implying that chain tethering decreases local segment density
   more than the effect of molecular weight or polymer-NP interactions.
   Additionally, the T-g of the aHNPs is higher than a linear matrix of
   comparable molecular weight, implying a complementary effect to local
   segment density that constrains cooperativity. In contrast, enthalpy
   recovery rate in the blend or aHNP glass is retarded comparably. In
   addition, a cross-over temperature, T-x, emerges deep within the glass
   where the enthalpy recovery process of all nanocomposites becomes
   similar to linear unfilled matrices. Differences between structural
   recovery in aHNP and blended nanocomposites occur only at the highest
   silica loadings (similar to 50 v/v\%), where enthalpy recovery for aHNPs
   is substantially suppressed relative to the blended counterparts. The
   absence of physical aging at these loadings is independent of brush
   architecture (graft density or molecular weight of tethered chains) and
   indicates that the impact of chain tethering on effective bulk
   structural relaxation starts to appear at particle-particle surface
   separations on the order of the Kuhn length. Overall, these observations
   can be understood within the context of how three separate structural
   characteristics impact local segment density and relaxation processes:
   the dimension and architecture of the tethered polymer chains, the
   separation between NP surfaces, and the confinement imposed by chain
   tethering and space filling within the aHNP. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Transient Marangoni transport of colloidal particles at the
   liquid/liquid interface caused by surfactant convective-diffusion under
   radial flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{462}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Interfacial tension gradients at a liquid/liquid interface
   drive Marangoni flows. When colloidal particles are adsorbed to an
   interface in systems with spatial and temporal gradients of surfactant
   concentration, these interfacial flows can be potentially significant
   contributors to the direction and rate of particle transport.
   Experiments: In this work, we use optical microscopy to measure the
   interfacial velocities of 5 lam diameter polystyrene latex particles
   adsorbed at an oil/water interface, using olive oil to represent polar
   oils often encountered in cleaning applications.
   Findings: On surfactant adsorption the maximum interfacial velocity
   scales linearly with bulk surfactant concentration, even for
   concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The
   maximum interfacial velocity weakly decreases with increasing flow rate,
   but it varies non-monotonically with the radial distance from the inlet.
   Upon surfactant desorption into a rinse solution, the maximum velocity
   increases with increasing concentration of the original surfactant
   solution, but only up to a plateau near the CMC. These experimental
   trends are well-described by a convective-diffusion model for surfactant
   transport to or from the liquid/liquid interface coupled with
   Langmuir-type adsorption, using a constitutive relation between the
   interfacial tension gradient and interfacial velocity based on the
   interfacial tangential stress jump. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Stability of a compound sessile drop at the axisymmetric configuration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{462}},
Pages = {{88-99}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The equilibrium configuration of compound sessile drops has been
   calculated previously in the absence of gravity. Using the Laplace
   equations, we establish seven dimensionless parameters describing the
   axisymmetric configuration in the presence of gravity. The equilibrium
   axisymmetric configuration can be either stable or unstable depending on
   the fluid properties. A stability criterion is established by
   calculating forces on a perturbed Laplacian shape. In the zero Bond
   number limit, the stability criterion depends on the density ratio, two
   ratios of interfacial tensions, the volume ratio of the two drops, and
   the contact angle. We use Surface Evolver to examine the stability of
   compound sessile drops at small and large Bond numbers and compare with
   the zero Bond number approximation. Experimentally, we realize a stable
   axisymmetric compound sessile drop in air, where the buoyancy force
   exerted by the air is negligible. Finally, using a pair of fluids in
   which the density ratio can be tuned nearly independently of the
   interfacial tensions, the stability transition is verified for the
   axisymmetric configuration. Even though the perturbations are different
   for the theory, simulations and experiments, both simulations and
   experiments agree closely with the zero Bond number approximation,
   exhibiting a small discrepancy at large Bond number. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{The linear sequence of DNA encodes access to the complete set of
   proteins that carry out cellular functions. Yet, much of the
   functionality appropriate for each cell is nested within layers of
   dynamic regulation and organization, including a hierarchy of chromatin
   structural states and spatial arrangement within the nucleus. There
   remain limitations in our understanding of gene expression within the
   context of nuclear organization from an inability to characterize
   hierarchical chromatin organization in situ. Here we demonstrate the use
   of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to quantify and
   spatially resolve chromatin condensation state using cell-permeable,
   DNA-binding dyes (Hoechst 33342 and PicoGreen). Through in vitro and in
   situ experiments we demonstrate the sensitivity of fluorescence lifetime
   to condensation state through the mechanical effects that accompany the
   structural changes and are reflected through altered viscosity. The
   establishment of FLIM for resolving and quantifying chromatin
   condensation state opens the door for single-measurement mechanical
   studies of the nucleus and for characterizing the role of genome
   structure and organization in nuclear processes that accompany
   physiological and pathological changes.}},

Abstract = {{Implantable microelectrode arrays have attracted considerable interest
   due to their high temporal and spatial resolution recording of neuronal
   activity in tissues. We herein presented an implantable multichannel
   neural probe with multiple real-time monitoring of neural-chemical and
   neural-electrical signals by a nonenzymatic neural-chemical interface,
   which was designed by creating the newly developed reduced graphene
   oxide-gold oxide (rGO/Au2O3) nanocomposite electrode. The modified
   electrode on the neural probe was prepared by a facile one-step cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) electrochemical method with simultaneous occurrence of
   gold oxidation and GOs reduction to induce the intimate attachment by
   electrostatic interaction using chloride ions (Cl-). The
   rGO/Au2O3-modified electrode at a low deposition scan rate of 10 mVs(-1)
   displayed significantly improved electrocatalytic activity due to large
   active areas and well-dispersive attached rGO sheets. The in vitro
   amperometric response to H2O2 demonstrated a fast response of less than
   5 s and a very low detection limit of 0.63 mu M. In in vivo hyperacute
   stroke model, the concentration of H2O2 was measured as 100.48 +/- 4.52
   mu M for rGO/Au2O3 electrode within 1 h photothrombotic stroke, which
   was much higher than that (71.92 mu M +/- 2.52 mu M) for noncoated
   electrode via in vitro calibration. Simultaneously, the
   somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) test provided reliable and
   precise validation for detecting functional changes of neuronal
   activities. This newly developed implantable probe with localized
   rGO/Au2O3 nanocomposite electrode can serve as a rapid and reliable
   sensing platform for practical H2O2 detection in the brain or for other
   neural-chemical molecules in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) alignment and crystallization of membrane proteins
   (MPs) is increasingly important in characterizing their
   three-dimensional (3D) structure, in designing pharmacological agents,
   and in leveraging MPs for biomimetic devices. Large, highly ordered MP
   2D crystals in block copolymer (BCP) matrices are challenging to
   fabricate, but a facile and scalable technique for aligning and
   crystallizing MPs in thin-film geometries would rapidly translate into
   applications. This work introduces a novel method to grow larger and
   potentially better ordered 2D crystals by performing the crystallization
   process in the presence of a strong magnetic field. We demonstrate the
   efficacy of this approach using a beta-barrel MP, outer membrane protein

Title = {{Inner membrane fusion mediates spatial distribution of axonal
   mitochondria}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria form a dynamic interconnected network
   to respond to changing needs at different subcellular locations. A
   fundamental yet unanswered question regarding this network is whether,
   and if so how, local fusion and fission of individual mitochondria
   affect their global distribution. To address this question, we developed
   high-resolution computational image analysis techniques to examine the
   relations between mitochondrial fusion/fission and spatial distribution
   within the axon of Drosophila larval neurons. We found that stationary
   and moving mitochondria underwent fusion and fission regularly but
   followed different spatial distribution patterns and exhibited different
   morphology. Disruption of inner membrane fusion by knockdown of dOpa1,
   Drosophila Optic Atrophy 1, not only increased the spatial density of
   stationary and moving mitochondria but also changed their spatial
   distributions and morphology differentially. Knockdown of dOpa1 also
   impaired axonal transport of mitochondria. But the changed spatial
   distributions of mitochondria resulted primarily from disruption of
   inner membrane fusion because knockdown of Milton, a mitochondrial
   kinesin-1 adapter, caused similar transport velocity impairment but
   different spatial distributions. Together, our data reveals that
   stationary mitochondria within the axon interconnect with moving
   mitochondria through fusion and fission and that local inner membrane
   fusion between individual mitochondria mediates their global
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Energy barriers for flipping the transverse dipole moments in

   an amorphous environment has a similar transition pathway as that of an

   expand the lattice and lower the energy barriers for flipping VDF

   missing, which corresponds to the minimum number of vertices in a subset
   S such that all other vertices have unique distances to S in all
   minimally connected graphs that result from completing the original
   graph. This extension allows for incomplete knowledge of the underlying
   graph in applications such as localizing the source of infection. We
   give precise values for the extended metric dimension when the original

   the boundary of the graph. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{382-393}},

Abstract = {{Increased volatility in electricity prices and new emerging demand side
   management opportunities call for efficient tools for the optimal
   operation of power-intensive processes. In this work, a general
   discrete-time model is proposed for the scheduling of power-intensive
   process networks with various power contracts. The proposed model
   consists of a network of processes represented by Convex Region
   Surrogate models that are incorporated in a mode-based scheduling
   formulation, for which a block contract model is considered that allows
   the modeling of a large variety of commonly used power contracts. The
   resulting mixed-integer linear programming model is applied to an
   illustrative example as well as to a real-world industrial test case.
   The results demonstrate the model's capability in representing the
   operational flexibility in a process network and different electricity
   pricing structures. Moreover, because of its computational efficiency,
   the model holds much promise for its use in a real industrial setting.

Abstract = {{Plant maintenance poses extended disruptions to production. Maintenance
   effects are amplified when the plant is part of an integrated chemical
   site, as production levels of adjacent plants in the site are also
   significantly influenced. A challenge in dealing with turnarounds is the
   difficulty in predicting their duration, due to discovery work and
   delays. This uncertainty in duration affects two major planning
   decisions: production levels and maintenance manpower allocation. The
   latter must be decided several months before the turnarounds occur. We
   address the scheduling of a set of plant turnarounds over a medium-term
   of several months using integer programming formulations. Due to the
   nature of uncertainty, production decisions are treated through
   stochastic programming ideas, while the manpower aspect is handled
   through a robust optimization framework. We propose combined robust
   optimization and stochastic programming formulations to address the
   problem and demonstrate, through an industrial case study, the potential
   for significant savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A reactive optimization strategy for the simultaneous planning,

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{507-515}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{The efficient and economic operation of processing systems ideally
   requires a simultaneous planning, scheduling and control framework. Even
   when the optimal simultaneous solution of this problem can result in
   large scale optimization problems, such a solution can represent
   economic advantages making feasible its computation using optimization
   decomposition and/or few operating scenarios. After reducing the
   complexity of the optimal simultaneous deterministic solution, it
   becomes feasible to take into account the effect of model and process
   uncertainties on the quality of the solution. In this work we consider
   those changes in product demands that take place once the process is
   already under continuous operation. Therefore, a reactive strategy is
   proposed to meet the new product demands. Based on an optimization
   formulation for handling the simultaneous planning, scheduling, and
   control problem of continuous reactors, we propose a heuristic strategy
   for dealing with unexpected events that may appear during operation of a
   plant. Such a strategy consists of the rescheduling of the products that
   remain to be manufactured after the given disturbance hits the process.
   Such reactive strategy for dealing with planning, scheduling and control
   problems under unforeseen events is tested using two continuous chemical
   reaction systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Attention-based encoder-decoder neural network models have recently
   shown promising results in machine translation and speech recognition.
   In this work, we propose an attention-based neural network model for
   joint intent detection and slot filling, both of which are critical
   steps for many speech understanding and dialog systems. Unlike in
   machine translation and speech recognition, alignment is explicit in
   slot filling. We explore different strategies in incorporating this
   alignment information to the encoder-decoder framework. Learning from
   the attention mechanism in encoder-decoder model, we further propose
   introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN models. Such attentions
   provide additional information to the intent classification and slot
   label prediction. Our independent task models achieve state-of-the-art
   intent detection error rate and slot filling F1 score on the benchmark
   ATIS task. Our joint training model further obtains 0.56\% absolute
   (23.8\% relative) error reduction on intent detection and 0.23\%
   absolute gain on slot filling over the independent task models.}},

Abstract = {{Speech recognition in cocktail-party environments remains a significant
   challenge for state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, as it is
   extremely difficult to extract an acoustic signal of an individual
   speaker from a background of overlapping speech with similar frequency
   and temporal characteristics. We propose the use of speaker-targeted
   acoustic and audio-visual models for this task. We complement the
   acoustic features in a hybrid DNN-HMM model with information of the
   target speaker's identity as well as visual features from the mouth
   region of the target speaker. Experimentation was performed using
   simulated cocktail-party data generated from the GRID audio-visual
   corpus by overlapping two speakers's speech on a single acoustic
   channel. Our audio-only baseline achieved a WER of 26.3\%. The
   audio-visual model improved the WER to 4.4\%. Introducing speaker
   identity information had an even more pronounced effect, improving the
   WER to 3.6\%. Combining both approaches, however, did not significantly
   improve performance further. Our work demonstrates that speaker-targeted
   models can significantly improve the speech recognition in cocktail
   party environments.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the ability of LNCC features (Locally Normalized Cepstral
   Coefficients) to improve speaker recognition accuracy in highly
   reverberant environments. We used a realistic test environment, in which
   we changed the number and nature of reflective surfaces in the room,
   creating four increasingly reverberant times from approximately 1 to 9
   seconds. In this room, we re-recorded reverberated versions of the Yoho
   speaker verification corpus. The recordings were made using four
   speaker-to-microphone distances, from 0.32m to 2.56m. Experimental
   results for a speaker verification task suggest that LNCC features are
   an attractive alternative to MFCC features under such reverberant
   conditions, as they were observed to improve verification accuracy
   compared to baseline MFCC features in all cases where the reverberation
   time exceeded 1 second or with a greater speaker-microphone distance
   (i.e. 2.56 m).}},

   Our model is based on an attention-based neural network which directly

   the pronunciation, acoustic and language model. We evaluate the model
   for online speech recognition on English and Mandarin. On English, we
   achieve a 33.0\% WER on the WSJ task, or a 5.4\% absolute reduction in
   WER compared to an online CTC based system. We also introduce a new
   training method and show how we can learn joint Mandarin
   Character-Pinyin models. Our Mandarin character only model achieves a
   72\% CER on the GALE Phase 2 evaluation, and with our joint Mandarin
   Character-Pinyin model, we achieve 59.3\% CER or 12.7\% absolute
   improvement over the character only model.}},

Abstract = {{Recognizing speech under high levels of channel and/or noise degradation
   is challenging. Current state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition
   systems are sensitive to changing acoustic conditions, which can cause
   significant performance degradation. Noise-robust acoustic features can
   improve speech recognition performance under varying background
   conditions, where it is usually observed that robust modeling techniques
   and multiple system fusion can help to improve the performance even
   further. This work investigates a wide array of robust acoustic features
   that have been previously used to successfully improve speech
   recognition robustness. We use these features to train individual
   acoustic models, and we analyze their individual performance. We
   investigate and report results for simple feature combination,
   feature-map combination at the output of convolutional layers, and
   fusion of deep neural nets at the senone posterior level. We report
   results for speech recognition on a large-vocabulary, noise and
   channel-degraded Levantine Arabic speech corpus distributed through the
   Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robust Automatic Speech
   Transcription (RATS) program. In addition, we report keyword spotting
   results to demonstrate the effect of robust features and multiple levels

Abstract = {{Integration of multiple microphone data is one of the key ways to
   achieve robust speech recognition in noisy environments or when the
   speaker is located at some distance from the input device. Signal
   processing techniques such as beamforming are widely used to extract a
   speech signal of interest from background noise. These techniques,
   however, are highly dependent on prior spatial information about the
   microphones and the environment in which the system is being used. In
   this work, we present a neural attention network that directly combines
   multi-channel audio to generate phonetic states without requiring any
   prior knowledge of the microphone layout or any explicit signal
   preprocessing for speech enhancement. We embed an attention mechanism
   within a Recurrent Neural Network based acoustic model to automatically
   tune its attention to a more reliable input source. Unlike traditional
   multi-channel preprocessing, our system can be optimized towards the
   desired output in one step. Although attention-based models have
   recently achieved impressive results on sequence-to-sequence learning,
   no attention mechanisms have previously been applied to learn
   potentially asynchronous and non-stationary multiple inputs. We evaluate
   our neural attention model on the CHiME-3 task, and show that the model
   achieves comparable performance to beamforming using a purely
   data-driven method.}},

   Robust Deep Boltzmann Machines (RDBM), respectively. The RDBM, an
   alternative form of Robust Boltzmann Machines, can separate
   corrupted/occluded pixels in the texture modeling to achieve better
   reconstruction results. The two models are connected by Restricted
   Boltzmann Machines at the top layer to jointly learn and capture the
   variations of both facial shapes and appearances. This paper also
   introduces new fitting algorithms with occlusion awareness through the
   mask obtained from the RDBM reconstruction. The proposed approach is

Abstract = {{The problems of hand detection have been widely addressed in many areas,
   e.g. human computer interaction environment, driver behaviors
   monitoring, etc. However, the detection accuracy in recent hand
   detection systems are still far away from the demands in practice due to
   a number of challenges, e.g. hand variations, highly occlusions,
   low-resolution and strong lighting conditions. This paper presents the
   Multiple Scale Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network
   (MS-FRCNN) to handle the problems of hand detection in given digital
   images collected under challenging conditions. Our proposed method
   introduces a multiple scale deep feature extraction approach in order to
   handle the challenging factors to provide a robust hand detection
   algorithm. The method is evaluated on the challenging hand database,
   i.e. the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications (VIVA)
   Challenge, and compared against various recent hand detection methods.
   Our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results with 20\% of
   the detection accuracy higher than the second best one in the VIVA
   challenge.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two new approaches using the Convolution
   Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for tracking
   3D hand poses. The first approach is a detection based algorithm while
   the second is a data driven method. Our first contribution is a new
   tracking-by- detection strategy extending the CNN based single frame
   detection method to a multiple frame tracking approach by taking into
   account prediction history using RNN. Our second contribution is the use
   of RNN to simulate the fitting of a 3D model to the input data. It helps
   to relax the need of a carefully designed fitting function and
   optimization algorithm. With such strategies, we show that our tracking
   frameworks can automatically correct the fail detection made in previous
   frames due to occlusions. Our proposed method is evaluated on two public
   hand datasets, i.e. NYU and ICVL, and compared against other recent hand
   tracking methods. Experimental results show that our approaches achieve
   the state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency in the challenging problem
   of 3D hand pose estimation.}},

Abstract = {{In face recognition tasks, the changing pose of the face can cause
   enough information to be lost to cause the recognition to fail so being
   able to determine the pose of the face beforehand can allow for some
   better recognition performance. Many methods used for pose estimation
   tasks rely on finding some underlying structure of the data given to
   create a classifier. We propose an alternative method in which the
   training data itself is the underlying structure of a classifier. This
   is accomplished through the use of matrix decomposition equations.
   However, instead of decomposing a matrix, one is created by carefully
   selecting the terms in the decomposition equation such that the
   resulting matrix has the desired properties for classification. We show
   two recomposition methods using the Spectral Decomposition and Singular
   Value Decomposition equations. We show this method can perform pose
   estimation with a high accuracy of 85.21\% and an accuracy of 98.42\%
   when allowing a +/- 15 degrees tolerance on the pose estimate on the
   CUbiC FacePix dataset. We also show results on both yaw and pitch
   estimation on the Pointing'04 dataset with our methods achieving 77.01\%
   accuracy on yaw estimation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a rethinking of the conventional method of moments (MoM)
   using the modern machine learning (ML) technology. By repositioning the
   MoM matrix and unknowns in an artificial neural network (ANN), the
   conventional linear algebra MoM solving is changed into a machine
   learning training process. The trained result is the solution. As an
   application, the parasitic capacitance extraction broadly needed by VLSI
   modeling is solved through the proposed new machine learning based
   method of moments (ML-MoM). The multiple linear regression (MLR) is
   employed to train the model. The computations are done on Amazon Web
   Service (AWS). Benchmarks demonstrated the interesting feasibility and
   efficiency of the proposed approach. According to our knowledge, this is
   the first MoM truly powered by machine learning methods. It opens
   enormous software and hardware resources for MoM and related algorithms
   that can be applied to signal integrity and power integrity simulations.}},

   catalyst layers critically affects cell performance. The small length
   scales and complex structure of these composite layers make it

   simulate transport and chemical reaction phenomena at the
   pore/particle-scale and apply it to a PEFC cathode with platinum group
   metal free (PGM-free) catalyst. We numerically solve the governing
   equations for the physics with heterogeneous oxygen diffusion
   coefficient and proton conductivity evaluated using the actual electrode
   structure and ionomer distribution obtained using nano-scale resolution
   X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT). Using this approach, the oxygen
   concentration and electrolyte potential distributions imposed by the
   oxygen reduction reaction are solved and the impact of the catalyst

Abstract = {{The present work investigates the role of water on the ion conductivity
   and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of metal/water
   interfaces. Ionomer-free electrodes such as nanostructured thin film
   (NSTF) electrode have the potential to reduce the loading of platinum
   (Pt) for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). However, the proton
   transport mechanism is not well understood. To examine the dependence of
   ion conductivity and ORR performance on relative humidity (RH), two
   ionomer/binder-free metal surfaces, Pt and gold (Au), were measured at
   different RH conditions. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows that currents
   for the double layer, hydrogen and oxide species formation and reduction
   increase with increased inlet gas RH. This indicates that water films on
   the Au and Pt black surfaces play an essential role in ion conduction.
   The increased active area also yields increased ORR current density
   during fuel cell operation. The results indicate a significant thickness
   of the ionomer-free cathode is active despite the lack of ionomer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the optimization of the energy intensity in
   industrial complexes that corresponds to minimizing this parameter
   (energy intensity) which is a ratio between energy and water
   consumption. There are some modern technologies/techniques that can
   reduce water consumption but they have the downside of requiring more
   energy up to the point that, if used, they would increase the overall
   energy consumption. This paper describes a methodology to reduce water
   consumption, while optimizing the energy intensity (kWh/M-3) taking into
   account the treatment and transportation processes. This methodology
   finds good feasible solutions by following 7 steps, where each of them
   adds more constraints to the system. All the equations describing the
   costs were annualized and linearized and then compared to the results
   obtained with the commercial software ``Aspen Capital Cost
   Estimator{''}. After validating the equations they were added to the
   optimization model so a solution can be more easily obtained. In this
   paper we present case studies of a petrochemical complex, from cooling
   towers to pluvial treatment, showing the energy intensity in each one of
   them.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity planning for capital intensive industries is a challenging task
   because expansion plans are highly dependent on market behavior and
   future demands. A suboptimal expansion strategy may lead to unnecessary
   investments and loss of market share. To mitigate the risk associated
   with uncertain demands and to account for market preferences in the face
   of competition, we propose a stochastic bilevel optimization model. The
   model combines two-stage stochastic programming and bilevel optimization
   to consider uncertainty and the behavior of multiple decision-makers
   simultaneously. Uncertainty is considered in scenarios describing
   different realizations of demand. The upper level of the bilevel program
   maximizes the expected net present value obtained from the capacity
   expansion plan, while the lower level minimizes the cost paid by the
   markets in different scenarios. The bilevel model is transformed into a
   single level using a duality-based reformulation. The single-level
   reformulation is implemented on an illustrative example; the results
   demonstrate its advantages over the equivalent deterministic
   formulation.}},

   the target glycols along with mixed butanediols and heavy components. As
   a result, the bio-mixture has to be dehydrated and separated from the
   heavy cut to obtain market grade glycols. After these steps, a
   distillation sequence is required to get the main oxygenated chemicals
   at the desired purity. A systematic process design methodology is
   applied to the entire downstream process based on the formulation of a
   Generalized Disjunctive Programming problem. The solution of the
   reformulated MINLP optimization problem is approached with the
   Logic-Based Outer Approximation algorithm, coupling the simulation
   environment of PRO/II with the optimization environment of GAMS and C++.
   This optimization procedure selects the best technology, optimizes
   units' topology, column design and operating parameters, and reduces the
   utility consumption by means of thermal integration.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, chance-constrained programming is applied for the
   real-time optimization (RTO) under uncertainty of a hydroformylation
   mini-plant. For this purpose, a dynamic model of the mini-plant
   consisting of 23 units, 12 components, and 25 streams. The model
   contains five uncertain parameters: the activation energy of the main
   reaction, a reaction inhibition factor, and the flows of the three feed
   streams. The objective function is the maximization of the product
   content in the outlet stream of the plant while keeping the catalyst
   loss below a required bound. The problem is resolved with IPOPT every 5
   h whereby set-points for 6 controls are calculated for 15 minute
   intervals. The fully automated mini-plant is operated for 200 h. Two
   offline gas chromatographs analyze samples on an hourly basis to provide
   the necessary information. Overall, a stable mini-plant operation with a
   constant yield and excellent phase separation could be achieved.}},

   computational demands via a Monte Carlo approach. While SFP does
   mitigate the complexity of FP, it can be shown that SFP still uses

   software (i.e., or generally any corpus of artifacts of unknown

   an entire and complete maps of software code clones (copy features in
   data). We report on a practical methodology, which employs enhanced
   suffix data structures and partial orderings of clones to compute a
   compact representation of most interesting clones features in data. The
   enumeration of clone features is useful for malware triage and
   prioritization when human exploration, testing and verification is the
   most costly factor. We further show that the enhanced arrays may be used
   for discovery of provenance relations in data and we introduce two
   distinct Jaccard similarity coefficients to measure code similarity in
   binary artifacts. We illustrate the use of these tools on real malware
   data including a retro-diction experiment for measuring and enumerating
   evidence supporting common provenance in Stuxnet and Duqu. The results
   indicate the practicality and efficacy of mapping completely the clone
   features in data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for harmonic steady-state
   analysis of power systems that is based on the equivalent split-circuit
   models recently introduced for power flow analysis. By using an
   equivalent circuit with current and voltage as the state variables, we
   extend the harmonic balance method that is used for nonlinear circuit
   simulation in the frequency domain to capture the frequency harmonics
   and inter-harmonics induced into a power grid due to nonlinear
   components. This enables the direct incorporation of physics-based
   steady-state models of power electronics and smart grid devices directly
   within the power-system simulation framework. For demonstration,
   steady-state models of a diode and a nonlinear core saturation inductor
   are derived and incorporated into the steady-state models of a
   three-phase full bridge rectifier and a magnetic core saturation
   transformer. These components are simulated within the proposed power
   flow analysis framework for a multi-bus power system.}},

Abstract = {{Power drives most activities in health centers and homes. However, its
   availability and high cost make it an expensive commodity. Off grid
   power systems like PV-battery setups are more sensitive to fluctuations
   in the generation and load. Power generation in such systems is also
   intermittent due to dynamic weather changes and other natural factors
   which require inevitable use of batteries. Batteries are the most
   expensive part of off-grid solutions and their use has to be optimized.
   Furthermore, these systems, like any other power source, have maximum
   capacities beyond which they should not operate. If these limitations
   are not well observed, usage of the available power cannot be maximized
   and the power equipment may be damaged. In this regard, this paper
   proposes an embedded system solution that schedules appliances to run
   when there is available power from solar panels. The appliances are
   connected to the smart scheduler through a dedicated smart plug that
   powers the appliance depending on the conditions set by the smart
   scheduler. This solution not only ensures that loads are served at the
   earliest possible availability, but also avoids blackouts in the system.
   Furthermore, smart utilization of the resources minimizes the battery
   need and hence, the investment costs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experimental evidence and theoretical results challenge the
   belief that ultra high-density EEG sensing will not yield higher spatial
   resolutions. It raises the exciting possibility that source-localization
   accuracy can be improved substantially with ultra high-density systems;
   however, these systems are hindered by implementation constraints in
   circuit volume and energy consumption. Recently, an
   information-theoretic hierarchical referencing mechanism has been
   proposed to exploit the decay of high-spatial frequencies during volume
   conduction from source to scalp -- and the induced high local spatial
   correlations -- to reduce the required circuit power and volume. In this
   paper, human EEG data is used to experimentally test and validate
   theoretical inter-electrode correlations and bit savings when employing
   a hierarchical referencing strategy. Extrapolating from electrodes that
   are at least 2 cm apart, we observe that on average savings can exceed 3
   bits per electrode at inter-electrode distances of 3 mm.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the duality of the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the
   binary defect channel (BDC). This duality holds for channel capacities,
   capacity achieving schemes, minimum distances, and upper bounds on the
   probability of failure to retrieve the original message. In addition,
   the relations between BEC, BDC, binary erasure quantization (BEQ), and
   write-once memory (WOM) are described. From these relations we claim
   that the capacity of the BDC can be achieved by ReedMuller (RM) codes
   under maximum a posterior (MAP) decoding. Also, polar codes with a
   successive cancellation encoder achieve the capacity of the BDC.
   Inspired by the duality between the BEC and the BDC, we introduce
   locally rewritable codes (LWC) for resistive memories, which are the
   counterparts of locally repairable codes (LRC) for distributed storage
   systems. The proposed LWC can improve endurance limit and power
   efficiency of resistive memories.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents new cryptographic protocols for a standalone
   simulatable two-party parallel coin-flipping (into a well) and a
   universally composable commitment scheme, with near optimal asymptotic
   communication rate, in the static and computational malicious model. The
   approach, denoted expand-mask-hash, uses in both protocols a
   pseudo-random generator (PRG) and a collision-resistant hash function
   (CR-Hash) to combine separate extractable commitments and equivocable
   commitments (associated with short bit-strings) into a unified
   extractable-and-equivocable property amplified to a larger target
   length, amortizing the cost of base commitments. The new stand-alone
   coin-flipping protocol is based on a simple augmentation of the
   traditional coin-flipping template. To the knowledge of the author, it
   is the first proposal shown to simultaneously be two-side-simulatable
   and have an asymptotic (as the target length increases) communication
   rate converging to two bits per flipped coin and computation rate per
   party converging to that of PRG-generating and CR-hashing a bit-string
   with the target length. The new universally composable commitment scheme
   has efficiency comparable to very recent state-of-the-art constructions
   namely asymptotic communication rate as close to 1 as desired, for each
   phase (commit and open) -while following a distinct design approach.
   Notably it does not require explicit use of oblivious transfer and it
   uses an erasure encoding instead of stronger error correction codes.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalent distributed generation resources warrant reconsideration
   on how their coordination is achieved. In this paper, we particularly
   focus on how to enhance secondary frequency control by exploiting
   peer-to-peer communication among the resources. We design a control
   framework based on a consensus-plus-global-innovation approach. The
   control signals of distributed resources are updated in response to a
   global innovation (utilizing the area control error signal), and
   additional information exchanged via communication among neighboring
   resources. We show that such a distributed control scheme can be very
   well approximated by a proportional-integral controller and stabilizes
   the system. Moreover, since our scheme takes advantage of both the
   global and neighboring information, simulation results demonstrate that
   our scheme stabilizes the system significantly faster than the
   conventional automatic generation control framework. In addition, our
   control scheme asymptotically achieves the cost effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{As Electric Vehicles (EVs) grow in popularity in developed countries,
   their integration within the Internet of Things (IoT) domain is
   envisaged. When fitted with wireless sensors and communication devices,
   On-Board Units (OBUs) for example, EVs have the ability to establish
   links with their surroundings. In this regard, EVs could communicate
   with Road Side Units (RSUs) in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) and
   smartgrid. This paper proposes an EV charging load management scheme
   based on communication between EVs and RSU modeled on the IEEE Wireless
   Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) standard and EV communication
   with charging stations (CSs) modeled on the IEC 61850 power utility
   automation and communication standard. Communication and service models
   of EVs communication with RSUs and CSs based on the IEEE WAVE and IEC
   61850 standards are developed. An EV charge scheduling algorithm based
   on communication among EVs, ITS components like RSUs and smartgrid
   components like CSs is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this work an integrated facility that produces methanol from
   switchgrass and reuses the captured CO2 to enhance its production
   capacity by 50\% is proposed. The process consists of two sections:
   biomass processing to syngas and its conversion to methanol, and the
   hydrolytic section where hydrogen is produced to hydrogenate the CO2
   that has been captured during syngas cleaning. The integrated facility

   requires a large amount of electricity to generate the hydrogen. As a
   result, it can only be used in regions where wind velocity is above 8
   m/s and solar radiation is above 5 kWh/m(2)/day such as Midwest US,
   certain regions in China or the South of Europe. The investment is high,

Abstract = {{In this contribution a framework for the solution of chance-constrained
   MINLP problems is described and tested to solve of process synthesis
   problems with strongly nonlinear and non-convex subsystems. The
   framework can handle the appearance of non-monotonic relationships
   between uncertain inputs and chance-constrained outputs, the appearance
   of multiple roots in the chance constraint evaluation, and performs
   extensive result recycling to ensure a robust performance despite the
   structural changes implemented by the MINLP optimization solver. The
   framework can be interfaced with optimization and simulation solvers
   programmed in C++, Fortran, and Python. As a first application the
   process synthesis of the oxidative coupling of methane with a focus on
   the removal of carbon dioxide from the product stream is investigated.}},

   This problem involves planning, design and strategic decisions such as

   arrange. Our objective is to use a computational model to identify the

   propose a large-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. We
   rely on generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) to systematically

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology has grown rapidly over the last two decades, leading to
   advances in science and engineering and to releases of engineered
   nanomaterials (ENMs) to drinking water sources. Conventional drinking
   water treatment processes remove sub-micron particles, including natural
   nanomaterials (e.g., viruses); however, the novel shapes,
   configurations, and properties of ENMs may enable their persistence.
   This review of the state of knowledge of ENM production and release,
   environmental fate and transport, detection in aquatic environments, and
   removal in drinking water treatment shows that detection methods and
   source water data are limited. In the absence of adequate methods for
   detecting ENMs in the environment, models have been developed and
   predict that ENM concentrations in surface water are likely to be very
   low (<< 1 mu g/L), and research of physicochemical transformations of
   ENMs in the environment suggests that they will be transformed into
   forms that are more likely to be removed during drinking water
   treatment.}},

   constitutive model based on dislocations, point defects and texture in
   order to predict anisotropic response under complex load paths. In
   detail, dislocation/solute atom interactions were considered to account
   for strain aging and static recovery. A hardening matrix based on the
   interaction of dislocations was built to represent the cross-hardening
   of different slip systems. Clear differentiation between forward and
   backward slip directions of dislocations was made to describe back
   stresses during path changes. In addition, we included dynamic recovery
   in order to better account for large plastic deformation. The model is
   validated against experimental data for AA5754-O with path changes,

Abstract = {{The aging and shrinking populations are one of the most challenging
   global trends, e.g., only in China, there is currently a senior
   population of about 200 million. How to provide better assist to older
   people and continuously improve the quality of their daily life are big
   challenges. The service robot is believed to be one of the most feasible
   solutions for future senior care. However, identifying the right
   requirements is the key to develop the right robots for individual
   users. This paper aims at developing a framework for the identification
   of design requirements of service robots for senior care. Four kinds of
   methods and three key factors were used to explore the requirement space
   of service robots for senior care. Important user requirements are
   identified, which include: 1) physical function related requirements, 2)
   social function related requirement, and 3) emotional function related
   requirements. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying a
   systematic approach to explore user requirements for designing service

Abstract = {{Recommender systems play a key role in personalizing service experiences
   by recommending relevant items to users. One popular technique for
   producing such personalization at scale is collaborative filtering via
   Matrix Factorization (MF). The essence of MF is to train a model by
   factorizing a sparse rating matrix consisting of users' ratings of item.
   Unfortunately, existing MF methods require model Learning from Scratch
   when new data (for users, items, or user ratings) arrive. Learning large
   models from scratch incurs significant computation cost and typically
   also results in stale recommendations. With increasing amounts of data
   and a need for real-time recommendations, incremental learning is
   desirable. In this paper, we develop a novel but simple method for
   incremental learning of MF models, called One-sided Least Squares, and
   demonstrate its parallel implementation via Apache Spark. We also
   describe how to integrate it with batch learning via Alternating Least
   Squares (ALS). Unlike previous incremental learning methods, we study
   our method's approximation of the results of ALS, while significantly
   reducing compute and storage costs. Our theoretical analysis and
   experimental results on three realworld datasets suggest that One-sided
   Least Squares achieves prediction accuracy close to Learning from
   Scratch with ALS at substantially faster learning speeds. This fast and
   accurate method for incremental learning enables improved Web-scale
   recommender systems.}},

   doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) in a fair fashion according to a
   prespecified total power reference. In our context fair means that wind
   generators (WGs) are required to reach the same utilization levels after
   dispatched. We pose the problem as a constrained consensus problem on
   the utilization levels among the rotor-side converters (RSCs). Then, we
   propose a leader-follower protocol that RSCs can adopt to guarantee that
   the WGs reach asymptotic consensus on their utilization levels and that
   their total extracted power from the wind converges to a reference
   value. Finally, we develop a Control Lyapunov Function-based (CLF)
   controller for the rotor side converter (RSC) of each WG that realizes
   the protocol in practice. The effectiveness of our proposed protocol and
   the corresponding RSC controller is verified via simulations on the
   modified IEEE 24-bus RT system.}},

Abstract = {{In the future, state-of-the-art wind generators (WGs) are expected to
   produce one of the largest amounts of renewable energy worldwide.
   Nowadays, wind DFIGs with integrated storage are regarded as the
   state-of-the-art WGs. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
   methodology that aims to solve the problem of distributed coordination
   and control of state-of-the-art WGs. The goal is for a WF to generate
   predictable power on a short-time scale while keeping each storage
   utilization at the same level (for efficiency) i.e equal power output
   from each storage. We first pose the problem as a constrained consensus
   problem and then introduce a Leader-follower consensus protocol that the
   WGs can adopt for accomplishing their objectives. Further, we develop a
   distributed control scheme for the grid-side converters (GSCs) that
   realizes the consensus protocol in practice. Finally, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our methodology via simulations on the IEEE 24-bus

   in a cost-effective way, demand response is gaining increased attention
   worldwide. Industrial loads such as cement crushing plants consume large

   provision of significant amounts of demand response. They have the
   capability to turn on/off an arbitrary number of their crushers thereby
   adjusting their electric power consumption. However, the change in power
   consumption by cement crushing plants and also other industrial loads
   are often not granular enough to provide valuable ancillary services

   coordination method based on model predictive control to overcome the

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel design of phase locked loop (PLL) based
   oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) to mitigate the frequency clustering
   phenomenon caused by transmission delays in real systems. Theoretical
   analysis of the ONN reveals that transmission delays can produce
   frequency clustering that leads to synchronization and convergence
   failure. This paper describes the redesign of ONN dynamics and
   associated system-level architecture to achieve robustness.
   Specifically, we first demonstrate that using the phase information of
   zero-crossing points of inputs as the PLL error signal enables the ONN
   dynamical model to correctly synchronize under uniform transmission
   delays. A Type-II PLL based ONN architecture is shown via simulation to
   provide this property in hardware. Furthermore, to accommodate
   non-uniform transmission delays in hardware, a phase synchronization
   technique is proposed that is shown to provide the correct
   synchronization behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are one of the most famous linear
   actuators in bio-inspired robotics. They can generate relatively high
   linear force considering their form factors and weights. Furthermore,
   PAMs are inexpensive compared with traditional electromagnetic actuators
   (e.g. DC motors) and also inherently light and compliant. In robotics
   applications, however, they typically require external sensing
   mechanisms due to their nonlinear behaviors, which may make the entire
   mechanical system bulky and complicated, limiting their use in simple
   systems. This study presents the design and fabrication of a low-cost
   McKibben-type PAM with a self-contained displacement and force sensing
   capability that does not require any external sensing elements. The
   proposed PAM can detect axial contraction force and displacement at the
   same time. In this study, the design of a traditional McKibben muscle
   was modified to include an inductive coil surrounding the muscle fibers.
   Then, a thin, soft silicone layer was coated outside of the muscle to
   protect and hold the sensing coil on the actuator. This novel design
   measures coil inductance change to determine the contraction force and
   the displacement. The process can be applied to a variety of existing
   McKibben actuator designs without significantly changing the rigidity of
   the actuator while minimizing the device's footprint.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an elastic ribbon-like piezoelectric energy
   harvester which is targeted for skin-wearable devices by harnessing the
   movements of stretchable surfaces. The device aims to power up smart
   thin stick-on devices for healthcare monitoring. By embedding a
   ribbon-like PVDF film in a flexible elastomer, Ecoflex, the device is
   potentially able to stretch 34\%, while maintaining internal strain of
   the film below its plastic deformation limit. Alternate electrode layout
   and bimorph configuration help to reduce charge cancellation, while
   increasing overall effectiveness. The harvester prototype with 225 mm(3)
   active volume is able to output 15.6 V at open-circuit upon stretching
   26\% and is capable of generating at least 121 nJ per cycle.}},

   neuroprosthetic devices; but, that number has largely been limited by
   current hermetic packaging technology. Microfabricated packaging is
   becoming reality, but a standard testing system is needed to prepare
   these devices for clinical trials. Impedance measurements of electrodes
   built into the packaging layers may give an early warning of device
   failure and predict device lifetime. Because the impedance magnitudes of
   such devices can be on the order of gigaohms, a versatile system was
   designed to accommodate ultra-high impedances and allow future
   integrated circuit implementation in current neural prosthetic
   technologies. Here we present the circuitry, control software, and

Abstract = {{A silicon neural probe fabricated using a deep reactive ion etching
   based process on 250 mu m thin silicon wafers was developed. The
   fabricated probes replicate the design of soft parylene-C based probes
   embedded in dissolvable needles and can therefore also be used to test
   the encapsulation properties of parylene-C in-vivo without introducing
   additional effects introduced by the dissolvable gel. The process also
   demonstrates the possibility of performing conventional photolithography
   on substrates bonded to a handle wafer using a backgrinding liquid wax
   (BGL7080) as an adhesive. This technique would allow integration of Si
   wafer thinning into the fabrication of neural probes, potentially
   allowing a range of neural probes of different thicknesses to be
   fabricated. Fabricated probes were characterized using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) yielding a measured impedance value of
   similar to 80 k Omega at 1 kHz for 15 mu m by 115 mu m platinum
   electrodes, indicating that extracellular neural recordings are
   possible. The neural probes were inserted into the substantia nigra of a
   mouse that showed successful recording of neural activity. Probes
   fabricated using this technique can thus be potentially used in the
   study of Parkinson's disease.}},

   constitutes a heterogeneous on/off channel model; wherein, the wireless

   gets large. We also present numerical results to support these zero-one

   using unreliable components. We consider both faults in the memory units
   and faults in the processing units. We show that using a
   real-number-coding technique, we can suppress errors during the
   computation and ensure that logistic regression converges with bounded
   error if the number of faults that happen during each iteration of the
   logistic regression is bounded, even when the faults happen in an
   adversarial manner. Moreover, since the coding technique is based on
   computation with real numbers, we show that the error-correction can be
   carried out at the algorithmic level (or block-level) based on the
   results from intermediate steps of logistic regression. Therefore, we
   only need to add redundant hardware at block-level, not the circuit
   level, for achieving fault-tolerance in the computation of logistic
   regression.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of attack identification in
   cyber-physical systems (CPS). Attack identification is often critical
   for the recovery and performance of a CPS that is targeted by malicious
   entities, allowing defenders to construct algorithms which bypass
   harmful nodes. Previous work has characterized limitations in the
   perfect identification of adversarial attacks on deterministic LTI
   systems. For instance, a system must remain observable after removing
   any 2q sensors to only identify q attacks. However, the ability for an
   attacker to create an unidentifiable attack requires knowledge of the
   system model. In this paper, we aim to limit the adversary's knowledge
   of the system model with the goal of accurately identifying all sensor
   attacks. Such a scheme will allow systems to withstand larger attacks or
   system operators to allocate fewer sensing devices to a control system
   while maintaining security. We explore how changing the dynamics of the
   system as a function of time allows us to actively identify
   malicious/faulty sensors in a control system. We discuss the design of
   time varying system matrices to meet this goal and evaluate performance
   in deterministic and stochastic systems.}},

Abstract = {{We study broadcast gossip algorithms to compute the average of given
   initial sensor measurements. In the context of wireless networks, an
   algorithm was proposed by Scaglione et al. that allows a single node to
   broadcast at each time with geometrically fast convergence to consensus.
   To improve the rate of convergence to consensus, we go beyond this
   single node broadcast approach and propose a queue-based broadcast
   gossip algorithm, in which simultaneous node broadcasts are allowed.
   Since packet collisions may happen, we choose time-varying update
   weights. Using a novel interval-based consensus error analysis to handle
   the time-dependent update weights, we show that with appropriate choice
   of parameters, the proposed algorithm converges to consensus in the
   mean-square sense geometrically fast. We prove that for the class of
   networks modeled as non-bipartite Ramanujan graphs, the exponent of
   convergence of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of
   nodes, unlike the single node broadcast case which converges slowly in
   large networks. We also demonstrate through simulations that our
   proposed algorithm improves the rate of convergence for some other
   example networks.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed Bayesian quickest change detection algorithm
   for sensor networks, based on a random gossip inter-sensor communication
   structure. Without a control or fusion center, each sensor executes its
   local change detection procedure in a parallel and distributed fashion,
   interacting with its neighbor sensors via random inter-sensor
   communications to propagate information. By modeling the information
   propagation dynamics in the network as a Markov process, two-layer large
   deviation analysis is presented to analyze the performance of the
   proposed algorithm. The first-layer analysis shows that the probability
   of false alarm according to a rare event decays to zero at an
   exponentially fast rate when the conditional averaged detection decay
   increases, where the Kullback-Leibler information number is established
   as a crucial factor. The second-layer analysis shows that the
   probability of the rare event that not all observations are available at
   a sensor decays to zero at an exponentially fast rate when the averaged
   number of communications increases, where the large deviation upper and
   lower bounds for this rate are also derived, based on which we show that
   the performance of the distributed algorithm converges exponentially
   fast to that of the centralized one.}},

   inaccurate if the connection strength is below a certain critical value,

   critical value, which is analogous to the phase transition phenomenon in
   statistical physics.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the network reliability problem in wireless sensor networks
   secured by the heterogeneous random key predistribution scheme. This
   scheme generalizes Eschenauer-Gligor scheme by considering the cases
   when the network comprises sensor nodes with varying level of resources;
   e. g., regular nodes vs. cluster heads. The scheme induces the
   inhomogeneous random key graph, denoted G (n; mu; K; P). We analyze the
   reliability of G (n; mu; K; P) against random link failures. Namely, we
   consider G (n; mu; K; P; ff) formed by deleting each edge of G (n; mu;
   K; P) independently with probability 1 ff, and study the probability
   that the resulting graph i) has no isolated node; and ii) is connected.
   We present scaling conditions on K, P, and ff such that both events take
   place with probability zero or one, respectively, as the number of nodes
   gets large. We present numerical results to support these in the
   finite-node regime.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with resilient state estimation of cyber-physical

   injection. In particular, the random set paradigm is adopted in order to
   model the switching nature of the signal attack and the fake measurement
   injection via Bernoulli and/or Poisson random sets. The problem of
   jointly detecting a signal attack and estimating the system state in
   presence of fake measurements is then formulated and solved in the
   Bayesian framework leading to the analytical derivation of a hybrid
   Bernoulli filter that updates in real-time the joint posterior density
   of the detection attack Bernoulli set and of the state vector.
   Exploiting a Gaussian-mixture implementation of the filter, a simulation
   example is developed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{This paper considers the development of information flow analyses to
   support resilient design and active detection of adversaries in cyber
   physical systems (CPS). CPS security, though well studied, suffers from
   fragmentation. In this paper, we consider control systems as an
   abstraction of CPS. Here, we use information flow analysis, a well
   established set of methods developed in software security, to obtain a
   unified framework that captures and extends results in control system
   security. Specifically, we propose the Kullback Liebler (KL) divergence
   as a causal measure of information flow, which quantifies the effect of
   adversarial inputs on sensor outputs. We show that the proposed measure
   characterizes the resilience of control systems to specific attack
   strategies by relating the KL divergence to optimal detection. We then
   relate information flows to stealthy attack scenarios where an adversary
   can bypass detection. Finally, this article examines active detection
   mechanisms where a defender intelligently manipulates control inputs or
   the system itself to elicit information flows from an attacker's
   malicious behavior. In all previous cases, we demonstrate an ability to
   investigate and extend existing results through the proposed information
   flow analyses.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-agent system with uncertainty entails a set of agents intent on
   maximizing their local utility functions that depend on the actions of
   other agents and a state of the world while having partial and different
   information about actions of other agents and the state of the world.
   When agents repeatedly have to make decisions in these settings, we
   propose a general class of decision-making dynamics based on the
   Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm with inertia. We show convergence of the
   proposed algorithm to pure Nash equilibria for the class of weakly
   acyclic games-a structural assumption on local utility functions that
   guarantees existence of pure Nash equilibria-as long as the predictions
   of the agents of their local utilities satisfy a mild asymptotic
   accuracy condition. Using the results on the general dynamics, the paper
   proposes distributed implementations of the FP algorithm with inertia
   suited for networked multi-agent systems and shows its convergence to
   pure Nash equilibria. Numerical examples corroborate the analysis
   providing insights to convergence time.}},

   component failures are considered in this paper: 1) the failure of
   arbitrary sensor devices and 2) the failure of arbitrary connections
   between pairs of state variables (referred to as a link). In addition,
   we focus on the design from an economic point of view; thus, we aim to
   identify the minimum number of state variables that need to be measured
   to meet desired reliability criteria. We recast this problem as an
   integer program. Although the integer programming problem is known to be
   NP-complete, we propose a greedy algorithm and characterize its
   performance with respect to the optimal solution. Consequently, the
   proposed approach provides an approximate solution to the problem of
   minimal sensor placement in the presence of stochastic component
   failure. Finally, we illustrate the obtained results with an example and
   simulation analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 18\% of the global population lacks access to electricity,
   and demand for electricity in rural and underdeveloped areas has
   increased drastically. Today, electricity is considered a necessity by
   many, and has had positive impacts on poverty reduction, public health,
   and education around the globe. This work seeks to determine the
   feasibility of localized power production and storage in microgrids for
   numerous diverse locations using HOMER as the optimization tool.
   Multiple schemes are constructed based on different community sizes with
   relative demand and load profiles. Optimization techniques are used to
   value both traditional generation options (diesel generation), their
   renewable counterparts (solar and wind), as well as energy storage such
   as batteries. Each investigation is based on geographically distinct
   irradiance, wind speeds, and fuel prices. Economics remain in the
   foreground, as a community's capacity to buy the power is a highlight of
   this entire investigation. The primary investigation into the economic
   viability of electrification for the proposed communities is to
   determine whether a grid tie-in or standalone microgrid solution is the
   better choice.}},

Abstract = {{Arabian Gulf has experienced a great transition in the last decades.
   Largely due to high petrol incomes, it has been financed in a lop-sided
   way. Nowadays, these oil-rich countries are looking for ways to move out
   of this situation by diversifying their income channels. Ironically, one
   of these channels has been renewable energy research which will enable
   these countries to deploy more of these technologies in their own grids
   and to become regional and global leaders in that area. In other words,
   oil revenues are utilized to investigate ways of phasing them out of our
   daily lives. This paper looks at renewable energy research efforts in
   the Gulf region at large and in Qatar in particular. The current
   situation of the national grids and their sources, electricity prices
   are investigated to estimate the benefits of a possible move to
   renewable energy based smartgrid infrastructure. Finally, knowledge gaps
   are identified and further steps are recommended for a successful and
   smooth transition.}},

Abstract = {{Random features is an approach for kernel-based inference on large
   datasets. In this paper, we derive performance guarantees for random
   features on signals, like images, that enjoy sparse representations and
   show that the number of random features required to achieve a desired
   approximation of the kernel similarity matrix can be significantly
   smaller for sparse signals. Based on this, we propose a scheme termed
   compressive random features that first obtains low-dimensional
   projections of a dataset and, subsequently, derives random features on
   the low-dimensional projections. This scheme provides significant
   improvements in signal dimensionality, computational time, and storage
   costs over traditional random features while enjoying similar
   theoretical guarantees for achieving inference performance. We support
   our claims by providing empirical results across many datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the face aging process is a challenging task due to large and
   non-linear variations present in different stages of face development.
   This paper presents a deep model approach for face age progression that
   can efficiently capture the non-linear aging process and automatically
   synthesize a series of age-progressed faces in various age ranges. In
   this approach, we first decompose the long-term age progress into a
   sequence of short-term changes and model it as a face sequence. The
   Temporal Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines based age progression model
   together with the prototype faces are then constructed to learn the
   aging transformation between faces in the sequence. In addition, to
   enhance the wrinkles of faces in the later age ranges, the wrinkle
   models are further constructed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines to
   capture their variations in different facial regions. The geometry
   constraints are also taken into account in the last step for more
   consistent age-progressed results. The proposed approach is evaluated
   using various face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, Cross-Age Celebrity
   Dataset (CACD) and MORPH, and our collected large-scale aging database
   named AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW). In addition, when ground-truth age
   is not available for input image, our proposed system is able to
   automatically estimate the age of the input face before aging process is
   employed.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing chemical mixture toxicity provides serious challenges to human
   and ecosystem health scientists. To provide insight into the potential
   implications of chemical co-occurrence, as well as the effects of
   incomplete chemical identification and/or inclusion that could occur in
   a risk assessment, this study characterizes the risk implications of
   concentration variability and correlation among co-acting compounds,
   considering the effect of missing chemical data. The potential risks of
   missing chemical data and concentration variability on mixture toxicity
   are explored by developing a set of multiple occurrence scenarios for
   mixtures, including a range of low to high toxicity chemicals,
   exhibiting low to high concentration variability, varying degrees of
   inter-chemical correlation, and omission of different chemicals in the
   mixture toxicity calculation. The calculations are performed for
   hypothetical mixtures of a group of ten synthetic antibiotic
   ``aquinolones{''} that have been tested on marine bacterium for the
   endpoint of long-term bioluminescence inhibition to fit dose-response
   relationships for each, with mixture toxicities assumed to follow
   independent joint action theory. We recommend a pre-assessment of the
   effect of different chemical occurrence patterns on mixture toxicity
   computed using different models for chemical interaction. This will help
   prioritize the experiments needed to differentiate between these models

Abstract = {{Power loss minimization plays an important role in the appropriate
   operation of power networks. Line power loss occurs when the power is
   transmitted through the lines of a network due to the permittivity of
   lines medium. Transmission loss may increase the dispatch cost of all of
   the obtained power flows based on market contracts. Hence, the
   independent system operators should use loss minimization methods to
   facilitate the implementation of the contracted power transactions. Loss
   minimization also will improve the security and stability of power
   network.
   In this paper, we present a novel loss minimization scheme based on
   oblivious network design, referred to as oblivious routing-based power
   flow method. The method is built on the bottom-up oblivious network
   routing scheme which offers multiple paths from several sources
   (generation units) to the specific destinations (electric load demands).
   Although there is limited information regarding other line flows and the
   current status of network, the routing scheme mathematically guarantees
   that the power flow solution is an approximation of the optimal solution
   with a specific competitiveness ratio. In fact, the Our main focus is on
   the power flow calculation while optimizing power losses. Compared with
   the recently developed power flow methods, our approach does not depend
   on the network topology and its performance for both radial and
   non-radial networks is accurate. Hence, it is suitable to use the
   propose approach for large-scale loss minimization while determining the
   power flows. This paper mainly focuses on the theoretical aspect of the
   proposed method. As our method is based on a novel concept from computer
   science discipline, we provide sufficient explanation about the
   preliminaries of oblivious routing scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden weight gain in patients living with Congestive Heart Failure
   (CHF) is often an indication that the individual is retaining fluid,
   which often means that patient's heart has weakened leading to increased
   risk of kidney or cardiac failure. Clinical interventions can be made at
   this stage, leading to better outcomes, however it is essential that the
   interventions take place before the patient's health declines too
   drastically. In this work, we present a latent variable autoregression
   model that tracks patient weight and blood pressure over time, allowing
   us to predict weight values into the future. We are also able to model
   continuous heart-rate signals and evaluate a subject's response to
   physical activity. This allows us to detect signs of health decline days
   earlier than existing rule-based systems, leading to the possibility of
   earlier clinical interventions, potentially preventing deadly medical
   emergencies.}},

Abstract = {{There is no widely-accepted lexicon or standard set of rules for
   auditing static analysis alerts in the software engineering community.
   Auditing rules and a lexicon should guide different auditors to make the

   necessary so that initial determinations are correctly interpreted,
   which helps organizations reduce code flaws. They are also needed to
   improve the quality of audit data to benefit research on alert
   prioritization. This paper provides a suggested set of auditing rules
   and a lexicon, detailing rationales based on modern software engineering
   practices for each rule and each lexicon term. Some code examples are
   provided with the auditing rules. The authors' hope is that this
   suggested framework will motivate community discussion leading to

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the usage of automated hyper-parameter
   optimization techniques with scalarization of multiple objectives to
   find decoder hyper-parameters suitable for a given acoustic and language
   model for an LVCSR task. We compare manual optimization, random
   sampling, tree of Parzen estimators, Bayesian Optimization, and genetic
   algorithm to find a technique that yields better performance than manual
   optimization in a comparable number of hyper-parameter evaluations. We
   focus on a scalar combination of word error rate (WER), log of real time
   factor (logRTF), and peak memory usage, formulated using the augmented
   Tchebyscheff function(ATF), as the objective function for the automated
   techniques. For this task, with a constraint on the maximum number of
   objective evaluations, we find that the best automated optimization
   technique: Bayesian Optimization outperforms manual optimization by 8\%
   in terms of ATF. We find that memory usage was not a very useful
   distinguishing factor between different hyper-parameter settings, with
   trade-offs occurring between RTF and WER a majority of the time. We also
   try to perform optimization of WER with a hard constraint on the real
   time factor of 0.1. In this case, performing constrained Bayesian
   Optimization yields a model that provides an improvement of 2.7\% over
   the best model obtained from manual optimization with 60\% the number of
   evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to
   decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols,
   it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed
   systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not
   benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services
   that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces
   through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the
   importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications,
   running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative
   to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the
   adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures
   metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this
   notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time
   is a controllable operating system primitive with observable
   uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications'
   timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our
   architecture features an expressive application programming interface
   that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline -a virtual
   temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide
   its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and
   resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write
   applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space.
   Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have
   implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven
   QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its
   evaluation are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial large-scale VoD systems such as Netflix and Hulu rely on CDNs
   to deliver videos to users around the world. Various anomalies occur
   often and degrade users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Detecting and
   locating such anomalies are highly complex due to a large number of
   different entities involved in the end-to-end video delivery. These
   entities include VoD provider, CDN/Cloud providers, transit ISPs, access
   ISPs, and end user devices. QoE perceived by the users is a critical
   metric for VoD providers. We propose QWatch, a scalable monitoring
   system, which detects and locates anomalies based on the end user QoE in
   real-time. We evaluate QWatch in a controlled VoD system and production
   Microsoft Azure Cloud and CDN. QWatch effectively detects and locates
   QoE anomalies in our extensive experiments. We discuss insights obtained
   from running VoD system with 200 worldwide users in production Cloud(1).}},

Abstract = {{Surface parameterization is of great importance for many applications
   such as quadrangulation, texture mapping and surface fitting. An
   important issue for surface parameterization is how to align parametric
   lines with feature directions. To address this issue, in this paper we
   first utilize Loop subdivision basis functions and isogeometric analysis
   (IGA) to calculate eigenfunctions of the secondary Laplace operator
   (SLO) on triangle meshes. Eigenfunctions are then used for centroidal
   Voronoi tessellation (CVT) based surface segmentation, and boundaries of
   the segmented regions are extracted as feature lines which contain
   concave creases and convex ridges. Along each feature line, adjacent
   triangles are defined as guidance triangles to parameterize the surface
   using a constrained cross field method, where feature lines are
   preserved and aligned to parametric lines. Several examples are
   presented in the end to verify the robustness of our algorithm. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the analysis and design of secure
   distributed control systems (DCS) in the face of integrity attacks on
   sensors and controllers by external attackers or insiders. In general a
   DCS consists of many heterogenous components and agents including
   sensors, actuators, and controllers. Due to its distributed nature, some
   agents may start misbehaving to disrupt the system. This paper first
   reviews necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic detection
   of integrity attacks carried out by any number of malicious agents,
   based on the concept of left invertibility of structural control
   systems. It then develops a notion equivalent to structural left
   invertibility in terms of vertex separators of a graph, which allows a
   designer to efficiently determine if a network is perfectly attackable.
   This tool is then leveraged to design minimal communication networks for
   DCSs, which ensure that an adversary cannot generate undetectable
   attacks. Numerical examples are included to illustrate these results.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial robots such as quadrotors are subject to range, power,
   communication, and collision constraints, which have to be strictly
   enforced for safe operation. Such constraints are dynamic constraints
   and require the state of the system to be forward-invariant with respect
   to a safe set. We propose a control design method for a planar quadrotor
   subject to collision safety constraints. The proposed controller
   explicitly considers the nonlinear underactuated dynamics of a planar
   quadrotor and formulates a sequential quadratic program that uses
   time-varying control Lyapunov functions to guarantee stability and
   time-varying control Barrier functions to guarantee safety. In
   particular, we introduce an augmented control Barrier function that
   enforces a safety region in position space while explicitly taking into
   account the quadrotor's orientation. We present several numerical
   results to validate the proposed controller, including (a) setpoint
   regulation subject to a single static obstacle, (b) trajectory tracking
   with multiple static obstacles, and (c) trajectory tracking with a

Abstract = {{Recent work on control Lyapunov functions and control Barrier functions
   has enabled addressing stability of nonlinear and underactuated hybrid
   systems while simultaneously enforcing input /state constraints and
   safety-critical constraints. However, under model uncertainty, these
   controllers break down and violate constraints. This paper presents a
   novel method of optimal robust control through quadratic programs that
   can handle stability, input /state dependent constraints, as well as
   safety-critical constraints, in the presence of high level of model
   uncertainty. Under the assumption of bounded uncertainty, the proposed
   controller strictly guarantees constraints without violating them. We
   evaluate our proposed control design for achieving dynamic bipedal
   locomotion that involves orbital stability of an underactuated nonlinear
   hybrid system subject to (a) torque saturation constraints (input
   constraints), (b) contact force constraints (state constraints), and (c)
   precise footstep placements (safety-critical constraints). We present
   numerical results on RABBIT, a five-link planar bipedal robot, subject
   to a large unknown load on its torso. Our proposed controller is able to
   demonstrate walking while strictly enforcing the above constraints with
   an unknown load of up to 15 Kg (47\% of the robot mass.)}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore motor
   abilities to paralyzed individuals. These systems act by reading motor
   intent signals directly from the brain and using them to control, for
   example, the movement of a cursor on a computer screen or the motion of
   a robotic limb. To construct a BCI, a mapping must be specified that
   dictates how neural activity will actuate the device. How should these
   mappings be constructed to maximize user performance? Most approaches
   have focused on this problem from an estimation standpoint, i.e.,
   mappings are designed to implement the best estimate of motor intent
   possible, under various sets of assumptions about how the recorded
   neural signals represent motor intent. Here we forward an alternate
   approach to the BCI design problem, using ideas from optimal control
   theory. We first argue that the brain can be considered as an optimal
   controller. We then introduce a mathematical definition of BCI
   usability, and formulate the BCI design problem as a constrained
   optimization problem that maximizes this usability.}},

Abstract = {{The superpixels provided by an unsupervised segmentation algorithm are
   sets of neighboring pixels homogeneous in some sense. Therefore it is
   very likely that, in a classification problem, most pixels in a
   superpixel belong to the same class, namely if the homogeneity criterion
   is compatible with the class statistics. Superpixels are, therefore, a
   powerful device to express spatial contextual information. However, the
   exploitation of superpixels in a principled way is not straightforward.
   Recent efforts attack this problem under a discrete optimization
   framework, by including regularization terms promoting consistence of
   the labels in the superpixels and computing approximate labelings with
   graph-cut algorithms. The well known hardness of integer optimization
   problems is a major limitation of this line of attack. In this paper, we
   introduce a new strategy, based on convex relaxation, to include the
   spatial information provided by superpixels in classification problems.
   The convex relaxation of an integer optimization problem opens a door to
   include extra information, such as spatial partitioning information
   given by over-segmented superpixels. The convex optimization problem
   thus obtained is solved by using SALSA algorithm. Experimental results
   with the ROSIS Pavia University dataset illustrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed framework.}},

   classification is performed by classifying single morphological
   exemplars (e.g. cells or subcellular features) in combination with a
   majority voting procedure. Here we propose a new hierarchical method for
   classifying sets of nuclei. The method can be interpreted as a type of
   multiple instance learning (MIL) method in that it embeds data from each
   patient into a hierarchical feature space. The feature space, and
   classification boundary, are alternatively optimized utilizing the
   support vector machine (SVM) cost function. We demonstrate the
   application of the method in the diagnosis of thyroid lesions and
   compare to existing MIL methods showing significant improvements in
   classification accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to use quantitative metrics to chart the
   unique history leading to Brazil's leadership in renewable energy and
   identifies a set of meta-scenarios that define possible future carbon
   performance. These meta-scenarios provide a context for discussing
   specific energy policy implications both at the national scale and from
   the perspective of Brazil's urban centres.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper defines and uses three metrics -
   energy efficiency, decarbonisation and carbon efficiency - to plot both
   Brazil's historic energy pathway and a set of future energy scenarios
   put forth by various national and international energy agencies. The
   authors then use a meta-scenario approach to group these alternate
   pathways, identifying specific policy levers associated with the
   realisation of each.
   Findings - The authors identify plausible policy changes that will help
   move Brazil off a current trajectory of stagnated energy performance to
   a ``greener{''} scenario in which carbon efficiency improves even as
   Brazil's economic growth continues. Such policies include energy
   efficiency programmes and continued expansion of the country's already
   extensive hydropower and biomass capacity. Adoption of policies that
   would put Brazil on a more aggressive path towards a global
   sustainability scenario currently seems impractical.
   Originality/value - This paper brings a standardized set of metrics to
   bear on Brazil's unique energy history, which in turn helps identify
   specific policy impacts for continued GHG reduction in Brazil's future
   from national and urban perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Competing causes of efficiency loss in electrochemical and capacitive
   deionization systems were studied. Specifically, we explored voltage and
   pH related efficiency limitations of electrochemical deionization
   devices by comparing operational conditions in three different practical
   cell architectures. Static and slurry flow electrodes based on high
   surface area activated carbon active materials were implemented with and
   without ion exchange membranes. At applied biases as low as 1 V, we
   observe water electrolysis, pH drift, and a reduction in overall device
   efficiency. The impact of dissolved oxygen in the water stream was also
   examined and it was determined that water electrolysis products can skew
   common techniques for measuring conductivity and assessing desalination
   performance regardless of the amount of oxygen present. Additionally,
   the presence of ion selective membranes impacts the retention of
   pH-shifting species and can improve voltage stability and performance,
   while slurry electrodes exhibit higher ion removal efficiency than their

Abstract = {{The view planning problem is the problem that involves finding suitable
   viewpoints for vision-related tasks such as inspection or
   reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel view planning
   algorithm for a camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) acquiring
   visual geometric information of target objects in its surrounding
   environment. The proposed model-based approach makes use of iterative
   random sampling and a probabilistic potential-field method to generate
   candidate viewpoints in a non-deterministic manner. Combinatorial
   optimization is then applied to select the most suitable subset of these
   candidate viewpoints to complete the given visual inspection or shape
   reconstruction task. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated through a number of computational tests that compare its
   overall performance against two previous methods. A field-test is also
   performed to demonstrate the method's applicability in a real world
   UAV-based shape reconstruction task of an outdoor statue.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional path planning algorithms compute a single path through the
   configuration space. There is no guarantee that a physical robot will he
   able to track the trajectory while avoiding collisions, particularly in
   the presence of environmental perturbations and errors in the process
   model. Sequential composition combines planning and control by computing
   a sequence of controllers to execute rather than a single trajectory,
   offering greater safety guarantees. In this paper, we apply sequential
   composition to multirobot systems in a scalable fashion using M{*}, an
   advanced multirobot path planning algorithm. Controllers will vary in
   size and geometry, and thus take different amounts of time to execute.
   To handle these differences, we introduce the time augmented joint
   prepares graph and the approximate time augmented joint prepares graph
   which simplifies implementation by discretizing time. We validate our
   approach in a mixed reality test framework.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce in this paper visibility maps for robots of any shape,
   representing the reachability limit of the robot's motion and sensing in
   a 2D gridmap with obstacles. The brute-force approach to determine the
   optimal visibility map is computationally expensive, and prohibitive
   with dynamic obstacles. We contribute the Robot-Dependent Visibility Map
   (RDVM) as a close approximation to the optimal, and an effective
   algorithm to compute it. The RDVM is a function of the robot's shape,
   initial position, and sensor model. We first overview the computation of
   RDVM for the circular robot case in terms of the partial morphological
   closing operation and the optimal choice for the critical points
   position. We then present how the RDVM for any-shape robots is computed.
   In order to handle any robot shape, we introduce in the first step
   multiple layers that discretize the robot orientation. In the second
   step, our algorithm determines the frontiers of actuation, similarly to
   the case of the the circular robot case. We then derive the concept of
   critical points to the any-shape robot, as the points that maximize
   expected visibility inside unreachable regions. We compare our method
   with the ground-truth in a simulated map compiled to capture a variety
   of challenges of obstacle distribution and type, and discuss the
   accuracy of our approximation to the optimal visibility map.}},

Abstract = {{Inertial reorientation of airborne articulated bodies has been an active
   area of research in the robotics community, as this behavior can help
   guide dynamic robots to a safe landing with minimal damage. The main
   objective of this work is emulating the aggressive and large angle
   correction maneuvers, like somersaults, that are performed by human
   divers. To this end, a planar three link robot, called DiverBot, is
   proposed. By considering a gravity-free scenario, a local connection is
   obtained between joint angles and the body orientation, resulting in a
   reduction in the system dynamics. An optimal control policy applied on
   this reduced configuration space yielded diving maneuvers that are
   dynamically feasible. Numerical results show that the DiverBot can
   execute one somersault without drift and multiple somersaults with
   minimal drift.}},

Abstract = {{The wide spread use of 3D acquisition devices with high-performance
   processing tools has facilitated rapid generation of digital twin models
   for large production plants and factories for optimizing work cell
   layouts and improving human operator effectiveness, safety and
   ergonomics. Although recent advances in digital simulation tools have
   enabled users to analyze the workspace using virtual human and
   environment models, these tools are still highly dependent on user input
   to configure the simulation environment such as how humans are picking
   and moving different objects during manufacturing. As a step towards,
   alleviating user involvement in such analysis, we introduce a data
   driven approach for estimating natural grasp point locations on objects
   that human interact with in industrial applications. Proposed system
   takes a CAD model as input and outputs a list of candidate natural
   grasping point locations. We start with generation of a crowdsourced
   grasping database that consists of CAD models and corresponding grasping
   point locations that are labeled as natural or not. Next, we employ a
   Bayesian network classifier to learn a mapping between object geometry
   and natural grasping locations using a set of geometrical features.
   Then, for a novel object, we create a list of candidate grasping
   positions and select a subset of these possible locations as natural
   grasping contacts using our machine learning model. We evaluate the
   advantages and limitations of our method by investigating the ergonomics
   of resulting grasp postures.}},

Abstract = {{Poverty affects hundreds of millions of people globally. Market-based
   strategies can help alleviate poverty in developing countries by
   encouraging entrepreneurial activity and have the potential to be more
   effective than traditional approaches, such as development aid from
   countries or non-governmental organizations. Development organizations
   often target the agricultural sector because of the prevalence of
   subsistence and small-scale farming, particularly in rural regions of
   developing countries. Improving the reliability of irrigation techniques
   can help farmers expand out of primarily subsistence farming and begin
   to sell a portion of their crop, thus achieving the objectives of
   market-based poverty alleviation. Human-powered pumps are a popular tool
   used in irrigation because they require low capital cost and negligible
   operating cost. Previous work provided a model for finding
   Pareto-optimal IDE-style treadle pump designs. This work utilizes that
   model to produce a dense set of Pareto-optimal designs, and then
   investigates the robustness of the designs by simulating their
   performance in a variety of modified use scenarios. Our results show
   that pumps optimized for low flow rates (less than 3.0 L/s) are highly
   robust, particularly with respect to age-related changes in the
   operator's stature or mobility. In addition, these pumps can operate
   with near-optimal efficiency across a variety of target flow rates and
   well depths. These pumps are ideal for single family use or for shared
   use amongst multiple families in a village. Pumps optimized for flow
   rates greater than 3.0 L/s are less robust with respect to changes of
   operator stature (experiencing decreases in flow rate of up to 60\%) but
   may be suitable for use on farms or by service providers.}},

Abstract = {{Trying to decide whether to purchase or use a sustainable product often
   puts decision makers in a difficult situation, especially if the more
   sustainable option provides less desirable features, or costs a premium.
   These decisions are moral choice scenarios, where benefit to society is
   weighed against personal gain. Here, it is common for individuals to
   visualize themselves, and the way that they will be perceived, by
   choosing whether or not to act sustainably. From an engineering design
   perspective, trying to model-user preferences in this context can be
   extremely difficult While several methods exist to assist researchers in
   eliciting consumer preferences, the vast majority rely on input from the
   potential consumers themselves. More critically, these methods do not
   afford researchers the ability to truly understand what someone may be
   feeling or thinking while these preference judgments are being made. In
   this work, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to
   investigate the neural processes behind multi-attribute product
   preference judgments. In particular, this work centers on uncovering
   unique features of sustainable preference judgments; preference
   judgments which involve products for which the environmental impact is a
   known quantity. This work builds upon earlier work, which investigated
   how preference judgments were altered in the context of sustainability.
   A deeper look at participant decision-making at the time of judgment is
   examined using neuroimaging with the goal of providing actionable
   insights for designers and product developers.}},

Abstract = {{A team with the right characteristics can exceed the sum of their
   individual efforts. However, a team having the wrong characteristics may
   perform more poorly than the sum of its individuals. Therefore, it is
   crucial that teams are assembled and managed properly in order to
   maximize performance. This work examines how the properties of a design
   problem can be used to select the best values for team characteristics.
   Two characteristics are considered: team size and interaction frequency.
   A computational model of design teams that has been shown to effectively
   emulate human team behavior is leveraged to pinpoint optimized team
   characteristics for solving a variety of fluid and structural design
   problems. The nature of each design problem is characterized with
   respect to local and global behavior of the design space, alignment
   between objective functions, and the resources allotted for solving the
   problem. Regression analysis is used to create equations for predicting
   optimized team characteristics based on problem properties. These
   equations, which enable the informed design of design teams based on
   those characteristics, describe statistically significant relationships
   and are found to have useful levels of accuracy. Further analysis
   reveals insights about how the properties of a design problem can
   influence a team's search for solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Continued scaling of semiconductor fabrication processes has made
   achieving yield targets increasingly difficult. The design and
   fabrication of various types of test vehicles is one approach for
   enabling fast yield learning. Recent work introduced the Carnegie Mellon
   logic characterization vehicle (CM-LCV). The CM-LCV design methodology
   uses regularity and existing testability theory to produce logic-based
   designs that are both highly testable and diagnosable. For the CM-LCV to
   be effective for yield learning, it must reflect the design
   characteristics of actual product layouts. Previous work enables
   incorporation of a standard-cell distribution derived from product
   designs into an LCV while simultaneously ensuring optimal testability.
   In this work, a new method is proposed for constructing a CM-LCV that
   reflects the design characteristics of a product through rewiring either
   the entire layout or some portion thereof. Four different approaches for
   rewiring are examined, and the results of each approach are evaluated
   using a variety of metrics. Experiment results reveal that a product
   layout can be easily rewired to construct an LCV with reasonable
   wirelength with reasonable CPU time. Rewiring has many advantages
   including the transformation of an actual product front-end to a
   logic-based test chip that has significant transparency to failure.
   Consequently, this means that front-end masks from an actual product can
   be re-used to create an effective LCV that is both more reflective and
   inexpensive to fabricate.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate and high-resolution diagnosis enables physical failure
   analysis (PFA) to identify and understand the root-cause of
   integrated-circuit failure. Despite many existing techniques for
   improving diagnosis, resolution is still far from ideal, which hinders
   PFA and other analyses. To address this challenge, we extend the
   capability of PADRE (physically-aware diagnostic resolution
   enhancement), a powerful machine learning based diagnosis resolution
   improvement technique, with a novel, active learning (AL) based PFA
   selection approach. An active-learning based PADRE (AL PADRE) selects
   the most useful defects for PFA in order to improve diagnostic
   resolution. AL PADRE provides an alternative to the normal PFA selection
   procedure, it improves the the accuracy of PADRE, and thus enables a
   more accurately improved resolution. AL PADRE is validated by both
   simulation-based experiment and silicon experiment. Simulation-based
   experiments show that by using AL PADRE, the number of PFAs required for
   increasing the accuracy to a stable level of 90\% is reduced by more
   than 60\% on average compared to baseline approach, and AL PADRE
   consistently outperforms the baseline approach for accuracy improvement
   in various scenarios. In the silicon experiment, by using AL PADRE, the
   number of chips needed to undergo PFA was reduced by more than 6x in
   order to increase diagnosis accuracy by more than 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the behavior of cars that are parked in an urban
   area can be very useful to the development of vehicular networks that
   leverage these parked cars. In this paper, we analyze the mobility
   patterns of people living in US cities who use cars as their primary
   means of transportation. We process and analyze survey data from the
   metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Chicago, and Knoxville, to extract
   statistics on the parking behaviors of individual cars.
   We accompany our study with a synopsis of how parked cars are being
   leveraged in urban vehicular networks, and show possible use cases for
   fine-grained parking models. We then provide daily and hourly analytical
   models of parking events, along with useful derivations of key parking
   statistics.
   The data we present in this study conclusively shows that parking events
   can be classified into two major, clearly-identifiable groups according
   to the time cars spend parked; that each group is modeled by distinct
   distributions of probability; that these patterns vary substantially
   throughout the day and, therefore, are better modeled through
   time-evolving processes; and finally, that these trends are very similar
   among different cities.}},

Abstract = {{The kernel trick becomes a burden for some machine learning tasks such
   as dictionary learning, where a huge amount of training samples are
   needed, making the kernel matrix gigantic and infeasible to store or
   process. In this work, we propose to alleviate this problem and achieve
   Gaussian RBF kernel expansion explicitly for dictionary learning using
   Fastfood transform, which is an approximation of full kernel expansion.
   We have shown, in the context of missing data recovery through joint
   dictionary learning i.e. periocular-based full face hallucination, that
   the approximated kernel expansion using Fastfood transform for joint
   dictionary learning yields much better results than its image space
   counterparts. Also, explicit kernel expansion through Fastfood allows us
   to de-kernelize the reconstructed image in the feature space back to the
   image space, enabling applications that require reconstructive
   dictionaries such as cross-domain reconstruction, image
   super-resolution, missing data recovery, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Robust face detection is one of the most important pre-processing steps
   to support facial expression analysis, facial landmarking, face
   recognition, pose estimation, building of 3D facial models, etc.
   Although this topic has been intensely studied for decades, it is still
   challenging due to numerous variants of face images in real-world
   scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach named Multiple
   Scale Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (MS-FRCNN) to
   robustly detect human facial regions from images collected under various
   challenging conditions, e.g. large occlusions, extremely low
   resolutions, facial expressions, strong illumination variations, etc.
   The proposed approach is benchmarked on two challenging face detection
   databases, i.e. the Wider Face database and the Face Detection Dataset
   and Benchmark (FDDB), and compared against recent other face detection
   methods, e.g. Two stage CNN, Multi-scale Cascade CNN, Faceness,
   Aggregate Chanel Features, HeadHunter, Multi-view Face Detection,
   Cascade CNN, etc. The experimental results show that our proposed
   approach consistently achieves highly competitive results with the
   state-of-the-art performance against other recent face detection
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Our position is that a key component of securing cyber-physical systems
   (CPS) is to develop a theory of accountability that encompasses both
   control and computing systems. We envision that a unified theory of
   accountability in CPS can be built on a foundation of causal information
   flow analysis. This theory will support design and analysis of
   mechanisms at various stages of the accountability regime: attack
   detection, responsibility-assignment (e.g., attack identification or
   localization), and corrective measures (e.g., via resilient control) As
   an initial step in this direction, we summarize our results on attack
   detection in control systems. We use the Kullback-Liebler (KL)
   divergence as a causal information flow measure. We then recover, using
   information flow analyses, a set of existing results in the literature
   that were previously proved using different techniques. These results
   cover passive detection, stealthy attack characterization, and active
   detection. This research direction is related to recent work on
   accountability in computational systems {[}1], {[}2], {[}3], {[}4]. We
   envision that by casting accountability theories in computing and
   control systems in terms of causal information flow, we can provide a
   common foundation to develop a theory for CPS that compose elements from
   both domains.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a smart heat pump, which could be used for the cooling of
   electronics, made of the laminated structure of thermoelectric (TE) and
   electrocaloric (EC) materials is studied. A simple arrangement of two TE
   layers sandwiched with one EC layer is modeled. This smart heat pump
   utilized the newly developed EC materials of giant adiabatic temperature
   change and the TE materials of high figure of merit, which has the
   advantages of no moving parts, made of solid state, operable over large
   working temperature difference, and can be formed into very small size.
   The operation of the device is numerically modelled considering the
   three major parametric effects: EC operation as function of time,
   electric current applied on TE, and temperature difference between the
   hot and cold sinks. The results on Coefficient of Performance (COP) and
   heat flow per unit area are discussed. This study validates the
   feasibility of TE-EC-TE laminated structure heat pump, and extends the
   understanding by further discussing the performance of structures with
   more laminated layers.}},

Abstract = {{Concretely communicating technical debt and its consequences is of
   common interest to both researchers and software engineers. In the
   absence of validated tools and techniques to achieve this goal with
   repeatable results, developers resort to ad hoc practices. Most commonly
   they report using issue trackers or their existing backlog management
   practices to capture and track technical debt. In a manual examination
   of 1,264 issues from four issue trackers from open source industry and
   government projects, we identified 109 examples of technical debt. Our
   study reveals that technical debt and its related concepts have entered
   the vernacular of developers as they discuss development tasks through
   issue trackers. Even when issues are not explicitly tagged as technical
   debt, it is possible to identify technical debt items in these issue
   trackers using a categorization method we developed. We use our results
   and data to motivate an improved definition and an approach to
   explicitly report technical debt in issue trackers.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-world graphs, such as those that arise from the web, biology
   and transportation, appear random and without a structure that can be
   exploited for performance on modern computer architectures. However,
   these graphs have a scale-free graph topology that can be leveraged for
   locality. Existing sparse data formats are not designed to take
   advantage of this structure. They focus primarily on reducing storage
   requirements and improving the cost of certain matrix operations for
   these large data sets. Therefore, we propose a data structure for
   storing real-world scale-free graphs in a sparse and hierarchical
   fashion. By maintaining the structure of the graph, we preserve locality
   in the graph and in the cache. For synthetic scale-free graph data we
   outperform the state of the art for graphs with up to 10(7) non-zero
   edges.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an advanced deep learning based approach to
   automatically determine whether a driver is using a cell-phone as well
   as detect if his/her hands are on the steering wheel (i.e. counting the
   number of hands on the wheel). To robustly detect small objects such as
   hands, we propose Multiple Scale Faster-RCNN (MSFRCNN) approach that
   uses a standard Region Proposal Network (RPN) generation and
   incorporates feature maps from shallower convolution feature maps, i.e.
   conv3 and conv4, for ROI pooling. In our driver distraction detection
   framework, we first make use of the proposed MS-FRCNN to detect
   individual objects, namely, a hand, a cell-phone, and a steering wheel.
   Then, the geometric information is extracted to determine if a
   cell-phone is being used or how many hands are on the wheel. The
   proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated on the Vision for
   Intelligent Vehicles and Applications (VIVA) Challenge database and the
   challenging Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP-2) face view videos
   that was acquired to monitor drivers under naturalistic driving
   conditions. The experimental results show that our method archives
   better performance than Faster R-CNN on both hands on wheel detection
   and cell- phone usage detection while remaining at similar testing cost.
   Compare to the state-of-the-art cell-phone usage detection, our approach
   obtains higher accuracy, is less time consuming and is independent to
   landmarking. The groundtruth database will be publicly available.}},

Abstract = {{Weakly supervised methods have recently become one of the most popular
   machine learning methods since they are able to be used on large-scale
   datasets without the critical requirement of richly annotated data. In
   this paper, we present a novel, self-taught, discriminative facial
   feature analysis approach in the weakly supervised framework. Our method
   can find regions which are discriminative across classes yet consistent
   within a class and can solve many face related problems. The proposed
   method first trains a deep face model with high discriminative
   capability to extract facial features. The hypercolumn features are then
   used to give pixel level representation for better classification
   performance along with discriminative region detection. In addition,
   calibration approaches are proposed to enable the system to deal with
   multi-class and mixed-class problems. The system is also able to detect
   multiple discriminative regions from one image. Our uniform method is
   able to achieve competitive results in various face analysis
   applications, such as occlusion detection, face recognition, gender
   classification, twins verification and facial attractiveness analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have undertaken the task of occlusion and
   low-resolution robust facial gender classification. Inspired by the
   trainable attention model via deep architecture, and the fact that the
   periocular region is proven to be the most salient region for gender
   classification purposes, we are able to design a progressive
   convolutional neural network training paradigm to enforce the attention
   shift during the learning process. The hope is to enable the network to
   attend to particular high-profile regions (e.g. the periocular region)
   without the need to change the network architecture itself. The network
   benefits from this attention shift and becomes more robust towards
   occlusions and low-resolution degradations. With the progressively
   trained CNN models, we have achieved better gender classification
   results on the large-scale PCSO mugshot database with 400K images under
   occlusion and low-resolution settings, compared to the one undergone
   traditional training. In addition, our progressively trained network is
   sufficiently generalized so that it can be robust to occlusions of
   arbitrary types and at arbitrary locations, as well as low resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Run-time generation of adaptation plans is a powerful mechanism that
   helps a self-adaptive system to meet its goals in a dynamically changing
   environment. In the past, researchers have demonstrated successful use
   of various automated planning techniques to generate adaptation plans at
   run time. However, for a planning technique, there is often a trade-off
   between timeliness and optimality of the solution. For some
   self-adaptive systems, ideally, one would like to have a planning
   approach that is both quick and finds an optimal adaptation plan. To
   find the right balance between these conflicting requirements, this
   paper introduces a hybrid planning approach that combines more than one
   planner to obtain the benefits of each. In this paper, to instantiate a
   hybrid planner we combine deterministic planning with Markov Decision
   Process (MDP) planning to obtain the best of both worlds: deterministic
   planning provides plans quickly when timeliness is critical, while
   allowing MDP planning to generate optimal plans when the system has
   sufficient time to do so. We validate the hybrid planning approach using
   a realistic workload pattern in a simulated cloud-based self-adaptive
   system.}},

Abstract = {{GraphBLAS is an emerging paradigm for graph computation that makes it
   easy to program new graph algorithms in a highly abstract language of
   linear algebra. The promise of GraphBLAS is that an abstract graph

   this paper we present our initial implementation of GraphBLAS primitives
   for graphics processing unit (GPU) systems called GraphBLAS Template
   Library (GBTL). Our implementation is an ongoing effort in the context
   of GraphBLAS standardization efforts by a diverse group of academics and
   representatives of the industry. Our implementation consists of a
   high-level C++ frontend, and the GPU functionality is implemented with a
   combination of the CUSP library for sparse-matrix computation on GPU and
   the NVIDIA Thrust framework for abstract GPU programs. We give initial
   performance results of our implementations, and we discuss solutions to
   the problems we encountered when providing a low-level implementation

   The model is based on the split equivalent circuit formulation that was

   power flow, and transient analyses. Importantly, this formulation
   establishes variables that are analytical and are compatible with model
   fitting and machine learning approaches. The parameters for the proposed

Abstract = {{With the motivation toward cutting carbon emissions and achieving oil
   independency, many countries are embracing Electric Vehicles (EVs).
   Fitted with wireless sensors and communication devices, EVs have the
   ability to establish links with their surroundings. This interaction is
   not only limited to EVs, that is, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), but can also
   be Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I). This
   offers a new paradigm in networking and communication in the realm of
   Internet of Things (IoT). Unlike traditional grids, smartgrids include
   communication and EVs will have to interact with them as well. Given the
   wide range of EV and wireless communication technologies, there is a
   need for standard communication to achieve seamless IoT integration.
   This paper focuses on the need for standardization of modeling and
   communication in Electric Vehicle Ad-Hoc Networks (EVANETs) and their
   interactions with the surrounding such as the grid, smart meter or a
   smart controller. IEC 61850 substation communication standard, and IEEE
   1609 WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) standard are
   investigated and their integration over IEEE 802.11 is performed.
   Finally, some privacy issues pertaining to IEEE 1609 are discussed and
   potential remedies are proposed to mitigate the identified weaknesses
   while maintaining privacy.}},

Abstract = {{More than 620 million people live without access to electricity in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. With Sub-Saharan Africa uniquely positioned as the
   only continent with a rising population without electricity access, an
   estimated one billion people shall gain access by 2040, but because of
   the population growth, about 645 million people shall remain without it.
   However, even with considerable efforts in rural electrification,
   investment in the power sector is so far insufficient to reverse the
   trend and achieve universal access to electricity by 2030. Rural
   electrification is best served either by grid extension, mini-grids or
   standalone systems. The UN SE4ALL global tracking framework provides a
   tier system that acts as a measurement evaluation for electricity access
   and global comparison. The framework also assists with the
   classification for electrification solutions such as mini-grids based on
   the regular use of appliances and attributes of electricity supply. In
   light of having a standard framework, the successful planning,
   implementation, operation and maintenance of mini-grids is not a
   guarantee since each project is tailor-made. In this paper, a
   conventional rural electrification development scheme is presented that
   aims to eliminate business model and policy making complexities in
   mini-grids. The focus is on minimizing risks, upfront costs, and policy
   interventions while maximizing investor attraction, profitability,
   security for grid operators and reliable or inexpensive energy for the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate insider information technology sabotage.
   After an analysis of over 1200 cases in our insider threat corpus, we
   identified 97 insider information technology sabotage cases that are

   guilty or was convicted in a courtroom. The majority of the cases are
   (United States) domestic. We begin by providing an introduction to the
   problem space. Next, we provide an abridged case summary for a sample of
   the cases. Based on all of the cases, we perform an analysis to answer
   the following research questions: 1) Who are the insiders that commit
   insider information technology sabotage? 2) What is the motivation
   behind the insider attacking? 3) What technical means were used to
   launch the attack? 4) How were the insiders caught? 5) What damage did
   they cause? 6) What sentence did the insider receive? Lastly, we
   describe our aggregated results and provide best practices to help

Abstract = {{Privacy issue has become serious in the area of mobile participatory
   sensing, smart grids, location-based services, and intelligent
   transportation systems. In response, many researchers are tackling the
   issue with technical approaches. In particular, data perturbation
   schemes, where all sensor data are processed on the user-side, are
   prospective techniques for utilizing personal data collected by embedded
   systems and sensor-equipped devices. However, existing data perturbation
   schemes require sharing the protocol between the user-side and the
   server-side, even though this can allow malicious attackers to estimate
   the original sensor data from the perturbed data. In this context, the
   paper presents a protocol-hidden perturbation framework, called
   Democratic Privacy, with which a service provider can acquire the
   original data probability without sharing the perturbation protocol with
   each user. In Democratic Privacy, the perturbation protocol is selected
   dramatically by each user, and the original data are reconstructed based
   on the selection of the crowd. Consequently, malicious attackers cannot
   distinguish the individual settings by eavesdropping. In addition, this
   paper presents Three-level Perturbation as one of the methods for
   Democratic Privacy, and evaluates it by means of simulations. The
   results of our evaluation demonstrate that Democratic Privacy provides a
   secure platform for pervasive computing environments.}},

Abstract = {{The advantages of adaptivity and feedback are of immense interest in
   signal processing and communication with many positive and negative
   results. Although it is established that adaptivity does not offer
   substantial reductions in minimax mean square error for a fixed number
   of measurements, existing results have shown several advantages of
   adaptivity in complexity of reconstruction, accuracy of support
   detection, and gain in signal-to-noise ratio, under constraints on
   sensing energy. Sensing energy has often been measured in terms of the
   Frobenius Norm of the sensing matrix. This paper uses a different metric
   that we call the l(0) cost of a sensing matrix- to quantify the
   complexity of sensing. Thus sparse sensing matrices have a lower cost.
   We derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the l(0) cost that hold
   for any non-adaptive sensing strategy. We establish that any
   non-adaptive sensing strategy must incur an l(0) cost of a Theta (N
   log(2) (N)) to reconstruct an N-dimensional, one-sparse signal when the
   number of measurements are limited to Theta (log(2) (N)). In comparison,
   bisection-type adaptive strategies only require an l(0) cost of at most
   Omicron(N) for equal order of measurements. The problem has an
   interesting interpretation as a sphere packing problem in a
   multidimensional space, such that all the sphere centres have minimum
   non-zero co-ordinates. We also discuss the variation in l(0) cost as the
   number of measurements increase from Theta (log(2)(N)) to Theta (N).}},

   small constant independent of the size of the linear transform, even
   when all logic gates in the computation are prone to probabilistic
   errors. Unlike existing works on applying coding to computing with
   unreliable components, the ``ENCODED{''} technique explicitly considers
   the errors that happen during both the encoding and the decoding phases.
   Further, we show that ENCODED requires fewer operations (in order sense)

   predistribution scheme and an on-off channel model. The heterogeneous
   key predistribution scheme has recently been introduced by Yagan - as an
   extension to the Eschenauer and Gligor scheme - for the cases when the
   network consists of sensor nodes with varying level of resources and/or
   connectivity requirements, e.g., regular nodes vs. cluster heads. The
   network is modeled by the intersection of the inhomogeneous random key
   graph (induced by the heterogeneous scheme) with an Erdos-Renyi graph
   (induced by the on/off channel model). We present conditions (in the
   form of zero-one laws) on how to scale the parameters of the
   intersection model so that with high probability all of its nodes are
   connected to at least k other nodes; i.e., the minimum node degree of
   the graph is no less than k. We also present numerical results to
   support our results in the finite-node regime. The numerical results
   suggest that the conditions that ensure k-connectivity coincide with
   those ensuring the minimum node degree being no less than k.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of distributed composite hypothesis
   testing in a noisy network of sparsely interconnected agents in which a
   pair of agents exchange information over an additive noise channel. The
   network objective is to test a simple null hypothesis against a
   composite alternative concerning the state of the field, modeled as a
   vector of (continuous) unknown parameters determining the parametric
   family of probability measures induced on the agents' observation spaces
   under the hypotheses. A recursive generalized likelihood ratio test
   (GLRT) type algorithm in a distributed setup of the
   consensus+innovations form is proposed, in which the agents update their
   parameter estimates and decision statistics by simultaneously processing
   the latest sensed information (innovations) and information obtained
   from neighboring agents (consensus). This paper characterizes the
   conditions and the testing algorithm design parameters which ensure that
   the probabilities of decision errors decay to zero asymptotically in the

Abstract = {{With the aggressive scaling of integrated circuit technology, analog
   performance modeling is facing enormous challenges due to
   high-dimensional variation space and expensive transistor-level
   simulation. In this paper, we propose a kernel density based sparse
   regression algorithm (KDSR) to accurately fit analog performance models
   where the modeling error is not simply Gaussian due to strong
   nonlinearity. The key idea of KDSR is to approximate the non-Gaussian
   likelihood function by using non-parametric kernel density estimation.
   Furthermore, we adopt Laplace distribution as our prior knowledge to
   enforce a sparse pattern for model coefficients. The unknown model
   coefficients are finally determined by using an EM type algorithm for
   maximum-aposteriori (MAP) estimation. Our proposed method can be viewed
   as an iterative and weighted sparse regression algorithm that aims to
   reduce the estimation bias for model coefficients due to outliers. Our
   experimental results demonstrate that our proposed KDSR method can
   achieve superior accuracy over the conventional sparse regression
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Prior Bayesian Model Fusion
   (DP-BMF) algorithm for performance modeling. Different from the previous
   BMF methods which use only one source of prior knowledge, DP-BMF takes
   advantage of multiple sources of prior knowledge to fully exploit the
   available information and, hence, further reduce the modeling cost.
   Based on a graphical model, an efficient Bayesian inference is developed
   to fuse two different prior models and combine the prior information
   with a small number of training samples to achieve high modeling
   accuracy. Several circuit examples demonstrate that the proposed method
   can achieve up to 1.83x cost reduction over the traditional one-prior
   BMF method without surrendering any accuracy.}},

   selection (SES) approach. As compared to SES, the proposed ESES method
   provides wider calibration range to accommodate multiple variation
   sources and produces higher calibration yield for the same calibration
   resolution target. Two types of ESES-based calibration with application
   in analog/RF designs are demonstrated; current source calibration and
   phase/delay calibration. As compared to traditional calibration methods,
   the proposed ESES-based calibration incurs lower circuit overhead while
   achieving higher calibration resolution. ESES calibration is further
   applied to a wideband harmonic-rejection receiver design that achieves
   best-in-class harmonic-rejection performance after calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Research in code and architectural analysis has demonstrated that a
   clear understanding of structural dependencies among software elements
   helps developers comprehend the impact of change. Yet examples are
   abundant from industry of major issues due to missed dependencies
   associated with different views of the architecture. Key concerns
   include dependencies related to allocation of modules to implementation
   packages to improve safety-critical testing and allocation of
   implementation packages to hardware partitions to optimize performance.
   In this paper, we present an in-depth study of a safety-critical system
   that underwent major changes as a result of missed architectural
   dependencies. We describe the challenges that resulted in
   re-architecting the system, the techniques we used for intervention, our
   results, and the developers' perspective. While the engineering tools
   provided coverage of design concerns, they missed implications of
   end-to-end integration testing, latency, and cost of change. In our
   study, we observed that the tools led the engineers to focus on data and
   control flow and therefore to miss many data-entity relationships,
   resource behavior, and deployment-related dependencies. Research
   continues to focus on more tooling and automation to assist with
   dependency analysis rather than interim, easier-to-adopt solutions. Our
   findings demonstrate that providing developers with a lightweight,
   semantically well-defined description of dependencies enables them to
   reason about change impact and propagation implications that they might
   otherwise overlook.}},

Abstract = {{Architecture modernization requires a clear roadmap to transition to a
   new state. However, creating that roadmap is often difficult,
   particularly in complex settings. This paper investigates how one might
   systematically derive such roadmaps. We introduce the Architecture
   Options Workshop (AOWS), a systematic treatment to address the problems
   of moving from identified system risk themes to potential design
   options, and a roadmap for implementation. Many techniques present a
   range of options and leave it to stakeholders to select, or are tailored
   for detailed design processes. The Architecture Options Workshop, by
   contrast, is intended to resolve the question of what options to choose
   at a high level of abstraction. Applying a technical action research
   approach, we applied the AOWS to three different real-world systems. We
   describe the advantages-reasonably efficient, systematic architecture
   modernization-and some remaining questions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{The scale, heterogeneity, and pace of evolution of the storage

   this paper we present an architecture that automates these metric
   collection processes, using a model-driven approach to configure a
   distributed runtime observability framework. We describe and evaluate an
   implementation of the architecture that collects and aggregates metrics
   for a big data system using heterogeneous NoSQL data stores. Our
   scalability tests demonstrate that the implementation can monitor 20
   different metrics from 10,000 database nodes with a sampling interval of
   20 seconds. Below this interval, we lose metrics due to the sustained
   write load required in the metrics database. This indicates that
   observability at scale must be able to support very high write loads in
   a metrics collection database.}},

   Rather than looking through logs, our goal is for robots to respond to

   route experiences into natural language, and highlight the importance of
   varying verbalizations based on user preferences. We present our

   users can request different verbalizations in dialog. Using the study

   promising way to express hidden robot state information such that it is

   evaluate the effect of robot communication through expressive lights on
   people's understanding of the robot's state and actions. In our study,
   we use the CoBot mobile service robot with our light interface, designed
   to express relevant robot information to humans. We evaluate three
   designed light animations on three corresponding scenarios for each, for
   a total of nine scenarios. Our results suggest that expressive lights
   can play a significant role in helping people accurately hypothesize
   about a mobile robot's state and actions from afar when minimal

Abstract = {{Trajectory planning methods for on-road autonomous driving are commonly
   formulated to optimize a Single Objective calculated by accumulating
   Multiple Weighted Feature terms (SOMWF). Such formulation typically
   suffers from the lack of planning tunability. Two main causes are the
   lack of physical intuition and relative feature prioritization due to
   the complexity of SOMWF, especially when the number of features is big.
   This paper addresses this issue by proposing a framework with multiple
   tunable phases of planning, along with two novel techniques:
   Optimization-free trajectory smoothing/nudging.
   Sampling-based trajectory search with cascaded ranking.}},

Abstract = {{Proactive latency-aware adaptation is an approach for self-adaptive
   systems that improves over reactive adaptation by considering both the
   current and anticipated adaptation needs of the system, and taking into
   account the latency of adaptation tactics so that they can be started
   with the necessary lead time. Making an adaptation decision with these
   characteristics requires solving an optimization problem to select the
   adaptation path that maximizes an objective function over a finite
   look-ahead horizon. Since this is a problem of selecting adaptation
   actions in the context of the probabilistic behavior of the environment,
   Markov decision processes (MDP) are a suitable approach. However, given
   all the possible interactions between the different and possibly
   concurrent adaptation tactics, the system, and the environment,
   constructing the MDP is a complex task. Probabilistic model checking can
   be used to deal with this problem since it takes as input a formal
   specification of the stochastic system, which is internally translated
   into an MDP, and solved. One drawback of this solution is that the MDP
   has to be constructed every time an adaptation decision has to be made
   to incorporate the latest predictions of the environment behavior. In
   this paper we present an approach that eliminates that run-time overhead
   by constructing most of the MDP offline, also using formal
   specification. At run time, the adaptation decision is made by solving
   the MDP through stochastic dynamic programming, weaving in the
   stochastic environment model as the solution is computed. Our
   experimental results show that this approach reduces the adaptation
   decision time by an order of magnitude compared to the probabilistic
   model checking approach, while producing the same results.}},

   cross-scale predictive model enables faster solutions to sparse

   approximation problem for the downsampled signal and using the support
   of the solution to constrain the support at the original resolution. The
   speedups obtained are especially compelling for high dimensional signals
   that require large dictionaries to provide precise sparse
   approximations. We demonstrate speedups in the order of 10 - 20x for

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the potential cost-saving incentives for content
   distribution networks to shift traffic load among geographically
   distributed data centers in response to hourly variation in electricity
   prices. Such incentives are likely aligned with benefits to utilities
   and grid operators, which might take the form of peak-shaving or
   ancillary services. However, private cost savings are not strictly
   aligned with public benefits related to the avoidance of health and
   environmental damages from power plant emissions, so we compare private
   cost minimization with a strategy that minimizes these externalities. We
   find that feasible strategies exist to simultaneously realize public and
   private benefits and that load shifting can result in substantial cost
   savings and avoided damages in some circumstances. Concerns over
   increased latency and bandwidth costs can be mitigated with
   modifications to the model. However, the level of realized savings is
   dependent upon the specifics of a particular network operator and

Abstract = {{Aggregating data from multiple sensors has become a critical requirement
   in cyberphysical systems (CPS) to increase the effective sampling rate
   for signal reconstruction. Depending on the application, these sensors
   can be geo-distributed, mobile, or only intermittently functional. These
   factors cause the aggregated sample set to be nonuniformly spaced with
   varying amounts of data collected per sensor. Due to the nature of how
   the timing or location measurements are made from the different sensors
   (e.g., indexed by GPS location), the samples may have significant errors
   in variables (EIV), where the location error from the different sensors
   follows an exponential autocorrelation function. In this work we
   demonstrate how to reconstruct signals using such noisy multi-source,
   variable rate (MSVR) data samples, and show that the proposed approach
   improves the error over existing EIV signal reconstruction algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A myriad of security vulnerabilites can be exposed via the reverse
   engineering of the integrated circuits contained in electronics systems.
   The goal of IC reverse engineering is to uncover the functionality and
   internal structure of the chip via techniques such as
   depackaging/delayering, high-resolution imaging, probing, and
   side-channel examination. With this knowledge, an attacker can more
   efficiently mount various attacks, clone/counterfeit the design possibly
   with hardware Trojans inserted, and discover trade secrets. We propose a
   gate camouflaging technique that relies on the usage of different
   threshold voltage transistors, but with identical layouts, to determine
   the logic gate function. In our threshold voltage defined (TVD)
   camouflaging technique, every TVD logic gate has the same physical
   structure and is one time mask programmed with different threshold
   implants for different boolean functionality. We design and implement
   TVD logic gates in an industrial 65nm bulk CMOS process. Using
   post-layout extracted simulation, we evaluate the logic style for VLSI
   overheads (area, power, delay) versus conventional logic, for process
   variablity robustness, and for various security metrics. Further, we
   evaluate the macro block overheads for ISCAS benchmark designs under
   various levels of TVD gate replacement upto and including 100\%
   replacement. TVD logic gates are found to be CMOS process compatible,
   low overhead, and to increase security against various forms of attacks.}},

   system is built on advanced wireless sensor networks and cloud service
   over the Internet, and the system is highly scalable. The parking
   information provided to the users is set in the form of occupancy rates
   and expected cruising time. Both are obtained from an analytical
   algorithm that processes historical and real-time data and are then
   visualized in a color theme. The entire parking system is deployed and
   extensively evaluated at Stanford University, California, Parking

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for identifying the measurement error
   in the DC power flow state estimation problem. The proposed algorithm
   exploits the singularity of the impedance matrix and the sparsity of the
   error vector by posing the DC power flow problem as a sparse vector
   recovery problem that leverages the structure of the power system and
   uses l(1)-norm minimization for state estimation. This approach can
   provably compute the measurement errors exactly, and its performance is
   robust to the arbitrary magnitudes of the measurement errors. Hence, the
   proposed approach can detect the noisy elements if the measurements are
   contaminated with additive white Gaussian noise plus sparse noise with
   large magnitude, which could be caused by data injection attacks. The
   effectiveness of the proposed sparsity-based decomposition-DC power flow
   approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus test systems.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns of future power systems is to utilize EVs as
   effective flexible means of controlling load demand. In this paper, the
   main goal is to evaluate the effect of large-scale utilization of
   electric vehicles (EV) on the total system loss. In this context, first
   the EVs' charging demand will be obtained using two probabilistic
   parameters: 1) expected driven distance, 2) expected duration of
   charging. The result is EV demand for 24 hours period which are added to
   the demand at load points. Eventually we solve the optimal power flow
   problem in each hour.
   We consider parking lots as demand aggregators to find the total
   charging demand at each hours based on single EV's electricity
   consumption. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of parking lots
   characteristics (charging rate, capacity in terms of number of EVs, and
   location in the power network) on the network's hourly loss and daily
   energy loss. To this end, we define four scenarios to determine the
   effect of charging rate and distribution of EVs over the network on the
   system loss. We also evaluate the effect of EV parking lot's location on
   the system loss.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a bilevel control framework to achieve a
   highly-reliable smart distribution network with large-scale penetration
   of distributed renewable resources (DRRs). We assume that the power
   distribution network consists of several residential/commercial
   communities. In the first level of the proposed control scheme,
   distributed community-level controllers are designed based on the
   stochastic model of demand and generation. These controllers utilize the
   local storage units and DRRs to maintain a certain level of reliability
   for the community. In order to formulate the residential demand and
   DRRs, we use the Gaussian white noise added to some periodic signals,
   formulated as a stochastic process. In the second level of the proposed
   control framework, we take the advantage of bulk generation units to
   improve the reliability by a global flow controller. In other words, we
   get help from a few number of bulk power plants in the grid to improve
   its reliability in the context of satisfying the residential demand with
   high probability. The global controller dispatches the available
   non-renewable power plants between communities to enhance the
   reliability of each community. Using our stochastic model, we obtain a
   theoretical low-threshold for the certainty of the demand satisfaction
   in the smart power distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{Clutches can be used to enhance the functionality of springs or
   actuators in robotic devices. Here we describe a lightweight, low-power
   clutch used to control spring engagement in an ankle exoskeleton. The
   clutch is based on electrostatic adhesion between thin electrode sheets
   coated with a dielectric material. Each electrode pair weighs 1.5 g,
   bears up to 100 N, and changes states in less than 30 ms. We placed
   clutches in series with elastomer springs to allow control of spring
   engagement, and placed several clutched springs in parallel to
   discretely adjust stiffness. By engaging different numbers of springs,
   the system produced six different levels of stiffness. Force at peak
   displacement ranged from 14 to 501 N, and the device returned 95\% of
   stored mechanical energy. Each clutched spring element weighed 26 g. We
   attached one clutched spring to an ankle exoskeleton and used it to
   engage the spring only while the foot was on the ground during 150
   consecutive walking steps. Peak torque was 7.3 N.m on an average step,
   and the device consumed 0.6 mW of electricity. Compared to other
   electrically-controllable clutches, this approach results in three times
   higher torque density and two orders of magnitude lower power
   consumption per unit torque. We anticipate this technology will be
   incorporated into exoskeletons that tune stiffness online and into new
   actuator designs that utilize many lightweight, low-power clutches
   acting in concert.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of range-based beacon placement
   given a floor plan to support indoor localization systems. Existing
   approaches for trilateration require three or more beacons to determine
   a unique position solution. We show that with prior knowledge of the map
   and a model of beacon coverage, it is possible to uniquely localize with
   only two beacons. This not only reduces installation cost by requiring
   fewer nodes, but can also improve robustness. One of the main challenges
   with respect to beacon placement algorithms is defining a metric for
   estimating performance. We propose augmenting the commonly used
   Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) metric to account for indoor
   spaces. We then use this enhanced GDOP metric as part of a toolchain to
   compare various beacon placement algorithms in terms of coverage and
   expected accuracy. When applied to a set of real floor plans, our
   approach is able to reduce the number of beacons between 22\% and 60\%
   (33\% on an average) as compared to standard trilateration.}},

Abstract = {{Given their large energy footprints and the availability of building
   energy management systems, airports are uniquely positioned to take
   advantage of demand response (DR) programs. Although a baseline-the
   estimation of what the load would have been without load reduction-is
   essential to assess the performance of DR strategies, there has been
   very little published research on developing baselines for airports.
   Therefore, the research described in this paper aims to develop baseline
   models specially intended for airport facilities. Specifically, we
   propose piece-wise linear regression models for predicting electricity
   demand using time-of-week, temperature, and flight schedule information.
   For the given period of April and May, test results reveals that a
   model, which has trained over specific seasonal data with only
   time-of-week and temperature as inputs, has the best prediction
   performance. The number of passengers of departure flight schedules is
   shown to have a positive relationship to the load, but does not improve
   the model accuracy significantly. However, since this study is done for
   the spring season, when HVAC systems run the least, the results may not
   represent other seasons with high cooling or heating demand. Therefore,
   further studies should be carried out to conclude the potential of
   flight schedules in improving accuracies of energy prediction baselines.}},

Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) users in architecture, engineering

   environments to support coordination and information visualization. With
   recent advancements in inexpensive and ubiquitous computing power, BIM
   users have access to multiple types of VR systems ranging from
   non-immersive desktop VR to immersive head mounted systems and immersive
   CAVEs. These systems have different strengths and weaknesses. Many users
   face the question on which VR technology to adopt in a given context to
   get the most value. In the study described in this paper, we will
   evaluate three different types of VR environments, namely Oculus Rift
   VR, Cardboard VR, and CAVE VR, in their ability to support tasks driven
   by construction project management related use cases. We also compare
   these environments in terms of ease of generation and deployment of
   facility models and interactions with such models, as well as their
   usability that is conducted through a user study associated with a
   construction project. The results from this study indicate significant
   variation in users' performance in different tasks using different

Abstract = {{Sorting microparticles (or cells, or bacteria) is significant for
   scientific, medical and industrial purposes. Research groups have used
   lithium niobate SAW devices to produce standing waves, and then to align
   microparticles at the node lines in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS,
   silicone) microfluidic channels. The ``tilted angle{''} (skewed)
   configuration is a recent breakthrough producing particle trajectories
   that cross multiple node lines, making it practical to sort particles.
   However, lithium niobate wafers and PDMS microfluidic channels are not
   mechanically robust. We demonstrate ``tilted angle{''} microparticle
   sorting in novel devices that are robust, rapidly prototyped, and
   manufacturable. We form our microfluidic system in a rigid polymethyl
   methacrylate (PMMA, acrylic) prism, sandwiched by
   lead-zirconium-titanate (PZT) wafers, operating in through -thickness
   mode with inertial backing, that produce standing bulk waves. The
   overall configuration is compact and mechanically robust, and actuating
   PZT wafers in through -thickness mode is highly efficient. Moving to
   this novel configuration introduced new acoustics questions involving
   internal reflections, but we show experimental images confirming the
   intended nodal geometry. Microparticles in ``tilted angle{''} devices
   display undulating trajectories, where deviation from the straight path
   increases with particle diameter and with excitation voltage to create
   the mechanism by which particles are sorted. We show a simplified
   analytical model by which a ``phase space{''} is constructed to
   characterize effective particle sorting, and we compare our experimental
   data to the predictions from that simplified model; precise correlation
   is not expected and is not observed, but the important physical trends
   from the model are paralleled in the measured particle trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing data from multiple sensing agents has become a fundamental
   mechanism for extracting information in large-scale cyber-physical
   systems (CPS). However, there has been little attention paid to the
   difficulties crowdsourcing presents when the desired information is
   represented by continuous signals. Crowdsourcing can result in unique
   types of noise in the aggregated data sample set. Errors from clock
   synchronization, GPS location determination, or sensor heterogeneity
   result in biased and correlated errors in the sampled data from each
   individual sensor. Furthermore, in CPS sensors are often mobile and
   operate asynchronously. This affects the spatial sampling rates among
   sensors and results in nonuniform sample spacing. We refer to these
   sampling issues as the noisy multi-source, variable-rate (MSVR) sampling
   problem. This work introduces and investigates signal reconstruction
   algorithms given MSVR sampling conditions. These signal reconstructions
   are investigated for vehicular applications, using a joint road
   inclination and bank angle signal estimation algorithm that has access
   to MSVR sampled vehicle GPS and accelerometer data. The signal
   reconstruction and angle determination algorithms are validated on
   simulated and real-world vehicle data, where we reconstruct a road
   elevation signal with 0.89 m root-mean-square error.}},

Abstract = {{There is a general belief that cyber attacks on the United States are
   increasing, as indicated by the 30\% increase in cyber-attack related
   news from 2014 to 2015. During the same time frame, however, the USA
   government enacted several policy measures meant to reduce or mitigate
   cyber-attacks. These recent developments have lead us to ask two
   questions, a) Have cyber-attacks on the United States actually
   increased, as perceived in the news media? b) What is the impact of
   changes in US cyber-policy on this trend in cyber-attacks? Our initial
   investigation reveals that in contrast to the perception, there has been
   a drop in the number of DDoS cyber-attacks on the USA.
   In this research, we compare the perceptions and the reality of cyber
   attacks by considering recent trends in cyber-related news and
   cyber-attacks (specifically DDoS type attacks). The analysis makes three
   important contributions: a) Using GDelt data, we show that from 2014 to
   2015 the amount of news referring to cyber events have increased, but
   the sentiment expressed in such news has become more negative. b) Using
   DDoS-attacks data shared by Arbor Network, we show that from 2014 to
   2016, there has been a marked decrease in the number of cyber-attacks on
   the USA. c) Using a time series intervention analysis, we show that the
   decline in cyber-attacks appears to be related to the changes in US
   cyber policy. In particular, the US President's authorization to
   prosecute malicious cyber actors significantly decreased the
   DDoS-attacks on the US.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-attacks are cheap, easy to conduct and often pose little risk in
   terms of attribution, but their impact could be lasting. The low
   attribution is because tracing cyber-attacks is primitive in the current
   network architecture. Moreover, even when attribution is known, the
   absence of enforcement provisions in international law makes cyber
   attacks tough to litigate, and hence attribution is hardly a deterrent.
   Rather than attributing attacks, we can re-look at cyber-attacks as
   societal events associated with social, political, economic and cultural
   (SPEC) motivations. Because it is possible to observe SPEC motives on
   the internet, social media data could be valuable in understanding cyber
   attacks.
   In this research, we use sentiment in Twitter posts to observe
   country-to-country perceptions, and Arbor Networks data to build ground
   truth of country-to-country DDoS cyber-attacks. Using this dataset, this
   research makes three important contributions: a) We evaluate the impact
   of heightened sentiments towards a country on the trend of cyber-attacks
   received by the country. We find that, for some countries, the
   probability of attacks increases by up to 27\% while experiencing
   negative sentiments from other nations. b) Using cyber-attacks trend and
   sentiments trend, we build a decision tree model to find attacks that
   could be related to extreme sentiments. c) To verify our model, we
   describe three examples in which cyber-attacks follow increased tension
   between nations, as perceived in social media.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-attacks appear to have grown in the past few years. Many policy
   changes have been made to control them, however, a clear path to a safe
   and secure cyber world is not visible. A mere technical view to confront
   the cyber-attacks could be futile if motivations behind attacks are not
   understood. To understand the motives behind cyber-attacks, we look at
   cyber-attacks as societal events associated with social, economic,
   cultural and political factors. To find factors that encourage unsafe
   cyber activities, we build a network of aggregate country-to-country
   cyber-attacks, and compare the network with other country-to-country
   networks. In particular, we use variable correlation and network
   correlation (QAP) to examine the relevance of factors like income
   difference, alliance-hostility, internet penetration, and corruption. We
   observe that higher corruption and a large internet bandwidth favors
   attacks origination. We also find that countries with higher
   Per-capita-GDP and better Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICT) infrastructure are targeted more often.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving high performance for compute bounded numerical kernels
   typically requires an expert to hand select an appropriate set of
   Single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) instructions, then statically
   scheduling them in order to hide their latency while avoiding register
   spilling in the process. Unfortunately, this level of control over the
   code forces the expert to trade programming abstraction for performance
   which is why many performance critical kernels are written in assembly
   language. An alternative is to either resort to auto-vectorization (see
   Figure 1) or to use intrinsic functions, both features offered by
   compilers. However, in both scenarios the expert loses control over
   which instructions are selected, which optimizations are applied to the
   code and moreover how the instructions are scheduled for a target
   architecture. Ideally, the expert would need assembly-like control over
   their SIMD instructions beyond what intrinsics provide while maintaining
   a C-level abstraction for the non-performance critical parts.
   In this paper, we bridge the gap between performance and abstraction for
   SIMD instructions through the use of custom macro intrinsics that
   provide the programmer control over the instruction selection, and
   scheduling, while leveraging the compiler to manage the registers. This
   provides the best of both assembly and vector intrinsics programming so
   that a programmer can obtain high performance implementations within the
   C programming language.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the impact of fading on downlink performance
   of wireless cellular systems. In a wireless cellular system, the mobile
   station selects the base station based on one set of measurements that
   are impacted by fading. This fading can differ at a later time when the
   mobile station uses the base station to communicate. Further, a base
   station's power distribution can depend on whether or not it is selected
   as a receiver. This paper formalizes these concepts in selection and
   evaluation stages. Selection has one set of fading factors and possibly
   a selection bias. Evaluation has different fading factors and
   distinguishes between the selected base station and other interfering
   base stations in the signal to interference plus noise ratio. These are
   studied in the context of the probability a mobile station achieves
   coverage in a multi-tier network using techniques from stochastic
   geometry. Several applications of the result are given to show the
   utility of the results.}},

Abstract = {{Visual tracking in unconstrained environments often involves following
   an object that exhibits a number of appearance changes from factors such
   as scale change, rotation, and illumination. Effective tracking requires
   adapting a tracker to the object's changing appearance over time. When a
   target becomes occluded by other objects in the scene, a naive tracker
   may end up learning the appearance of the occluding object. Our work
   introduces a method of detecting occlusion by considering the color
   profile of the target to prevent inappropriate tracker updates while the
   target is occluded. We show improved overlap and central location
   precision with three visual trackers when adding our hue-based occlusion
   detection to each tracking system.}},

Abstract = {{Face recognition is widely used for a variety of applications, such as
   identifying people for security purposes, as well as photo album
   organization. A challenge is to perform accurate face recognition when
   there exist partial occlusions of the face such as scarves or
   sunglasses. Correlation Filters (CFs) are an occlusion-tolerant object
   recognition method, potentially suited to deal with partial occlusions.
   In this paper, we introduce a new class of correlation filters called
   Masked Correlation Filters (MCFs), that are designed specifically to
   handle partial occlusions in face images. The benefits of using MCFs are
   illustrated using well-known face image data sets.}},

   representations that, in spirit, resemble the classical Haar wavelet
   basis and are naturally localized in both graph vertex and graph Fourier
   domains. Moreover, they promote sparsity when representing

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of counterfeiting of medicines in the
   form of pills and capsules by proposing a novel micron-scale secure RFID
   tag that would be inserted into the pill or capsule during the
   manufacturing process. For secure identification and authentication, a
   tagged pill or capsule would be scanned by a small inexpensive RFID
   reader, and key medicine information such as the drug type,
   manufacturer, and expiration date would be retrieved from a secure
   database. This application is enabled by an RFID tag integrated circuit
   (IC) incorporating an on-chip ID storage and custom security engine with
   a novel on-chip antenna (OCA) structure that has the potential to
   achieve an order of magnitude greater working distance at constant power
   level when compared to prior art passive single-chip silicon RFID tags
   with OCAs. This paper describes the proposed solution in detail and
   presents analysis, electromagnetic simulation, and circuit simulation
   results supporting its design and performance.}},

   automatic identification and communication of physical parameters with
   on board integrated sensor attracts vast applications on a large scale

Abstract = {{City-identification of videos aims to determine the likelihood of a
   video belonging to a set of cities. In this paper, we present an
   approach using only audio, thus we do not use any additional modality
   such as images, user-tags or geo-tags. In this manner, we show to what
   extent the city-location of videos correlates to their acoustic
   information. Success in this task suggests improvements can be made to
   complement the other modalities. In particular, we present a method to
   compute and use semantic acoustic features to perform
   city-identification and the features show semantic evidence of the
   identification. The semantic evidence is given by a taxonomy of urban
   sounds and expresses the potential presence of these sounds in the
   city-soundtracks. We used the MediaEval Placing Task set, which contains
   Flickr videos labeled by city. In addition, we used the UrbanSound8K set
   containing audio clips labeled by sound-type. Our method improved the
   state-of-the-art performance and provides a novel semantic approach to

Abstract = {{The Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) service allows short text messages to
   be broadcast to all capable mobile devices in a specified geographic
   area. Although it enjoys nationwide reach, the current WEA service has
   limitations that impede its public acceptance. These limitations include
   imprecise geographical targeting of alerts, which reduces the alerts'
   relevance to many recipients, increasing the likelihood of these
   recipients to opt out of receiving alerts or stop paying attention. The
   growing capabilities of smart phones, such as improved location
   awareness and increased computing power, provide opportunities to
   alleviate the limitations by personalizing targeted alerts and allowing
   optimized alert delivery decisions. Motivated by these opportunities, we
   designed and developed a prototypical, enhanced end-to-end WEA service
   that includes an alert creation subsystem, a message delivery subsystem,
   and a smart phone application for capturing, processing, and presenting
   simulated alerts to recipients. We conducted two public trials with over
   225 subjects to evaluate several WEA enhancements using this service.
   The evaluated enhancements included (1) augmenting WEA messages with
   high-information maps, (2) precise geographical targeting of alerts, and
   (3) use of the recipient's location history to influence the alert
   delivery decision. Our results suggest significant added value for all
   three enhancements, making them worthy of consideration for future WEA
   implementations.}},

Abstract = {{We are increasingly reliant on cellular data services for many types of
   day-to-day activities, from hailing a cab, to searching for nearby
   restaurants. Geo-location has become a ubiquitous feature that underpins
   the functionality of such applications. Network operators can also
   benefit from accurate mobile terminal localization in order to quickly
   detect and identify location-related network performance issues, such as
   coverage holes and congestion, based on mobile measurements. Current
   implementations of mobile localization on the wildly-popular Android
   platform depend on either the Global Positioning System (GPS), Android's
   Network Location Provider (NLP), or a combination of both.
   In this paper, we extensively study the performance of such systems, in
   terms of its localization accuracy. We show through real-world
   measurements that the performance of GPS+ NLP is heavily dependent on
   the mobility of the user, and its gains on localization performance is
   minimal, and often even detrimental, especially for network round-trip
   delays up to 1s.
   Building upon these findings, we evaluate the efficacy of using Tattle,
   a cooperative local measurement-exchange system, and propose
   Delay-Adjusted U-CURE, a clustering algorithm that greatly improves the
   localization performance of both GPS-only, and GPS+ NLP techniques,
   without keeping expensive system states, nor requiring any location
   anchors nor additional instrumentation, nor any external knowledge that
   is not available programmatically to application designers. Our results
   are promising, demonstrating that median location accuracy improvements
   of over 30\% is achievable with just 3 co-located devices, and close to
   60\% with just 6 co-located devices. These findings can be used by
   operators to better manage their networks, or by application designers
   to improve their location-based services.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular service subscribers are increasingly reliant on cellular data
   services for all kinds of mobile applications. Oftentimes, when
   subscribers experience frustratingly high network delays and timeouts,
   they like to know whether their experiences are shared by other users
   nearby. The question that is often asked is essentially this: ``is it
   just me, or do others around me face the same problem?{''}
   In this paper, we describe how we use Tattle, a distributed real-time
   participatory sensing and monitoring framework, to glean network
   performance information from users nearby. Tattle relies on recent
   advances in peer-to-peer device networking, such as WiFi Direct,
   Bluetooth Low Energy, and Apple's iBeacon, to exchange key snippets of
   diagnostic information using very low-power, very short-range local-area
   wireless interfaces, between participating devices. We propose and
   develop a robust statistical algorithm, based on quantile regression,
   which identifies key points in time where a device experiences high
   delays and outages that are not observed by its neighbors, and decides
   if the device is performing ``normally{''}, or ``abnormally{''}. This
   directly answers the ``me, or others?{''} question. We demonstrate and
   validate the efficacy of our system through real-world measurements of
   network delay, consisting of over 7,300 time-series that comprises over
   443,500 data samples, using commodity smart devices attached to two
   different providers' networks.}},

Abstract = {{Security is becoming an essential problem for integrated circuits (ICs).
   Various attacks, such as reverse engineering and dumping on-chip data,
   have been reported to undermine IC security. IEEE 1149.1, also known as
   JTAG, is primarily used for IC manufacturing test but inevitably
   provides a ``backdoor{''} that can be exploited to attack ICs.
   Encryption has been used extensively as an effective mean to protect ICs
   through authentication, but a few weaknesses subsist, such as key
   leakage. Signature-based techniques ensure security using a database
   that includes known attacks, but fail to detect attacks that are not
   contained by the database. To overcome these drawbacks, a two-layer
   learning-based protection scheme is proposed. Specifically, the scheme
   monitors the execution of JTAG instructions and uses support vector
   machines (SVM) to identify abnormal instruction sequences. The use of
   machine learning enables the detection of unseen attacks without the
   need for key-based authentication. The experiments based on the
   OpenSPARC T2 platform demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the
   accuracy of detecting unseen attacks by 50\% on average when compared to
   previous work.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the authors describe the evolution of software
   engineering (SE) and software assurance (SwA) from the days of punch
   cards until today. The authors create the backdrop for this development
   by describing the environment over the last 50 years. Technological
   advances during that period include the creation of programming
   languages, personal computers, the intranet, organized incident
   management, structured programming, and complex software applications.
   Impacts of these advances, including the massive growth of the Internet
   and software-intensive products, transformed everyday lives.
   While these changes were happening, cyberattacks were also growing.
   Dating back to the late 1960s when phone systems were attacked, society
   has been affected by the ``dark side{''} of computer technology.
   Computer viruses and malware are a common aspect of today's landscape.
   To protect us and our data, laws that govern the protection of computer
   data were created and developed. Likewise, organizations and approaches
   for finding and addressing cyberattacks were established and grown.
   Education has supported this radically changing environment through the
   development of educational programs in industry and academia, including
   bachelor's and master's degree programs. SE education responded to the
   advancing technology, resulting in a new profession. SwA education
   responded to the failures of industry to develop quality software,
   including security challenges that arose as technology was used and
   exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Sophisticated electrode design for high power and energy density
   batteries will require a more thorough understanding of how electrode
   porosity affects cell failure mechanisms such as solid electrolyte
   interphase (SEI) formation. This study uses high resolution three
   dimensional (3D) mapping to examine the anode SEI deposits in off the
   shelf Li-ion cells that have been deeply cycled to complete failure.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to show the buildup of SEI
   on the surface of the graphite anode, while nano-scale resolution X-ray
   computed tomography (nano-CT) was used to show the SEI accumulation
   within the anode's pore structure. Through a combination of phase
   contrast and absorption contrast imaging, it was shown that the average
   pore diameter and total internal pore volume fraction decreased
   significantly after cycling, while there was a corresponding increase of
   absorption contrast from heavier elements throughout the anode. We
   propose this is due to buildup of electrolyte decomposition products
   within the pores. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{As transistor geometries get smaller, static leakage power dominates the
   power consumption in modern processors. This phenomenon diminishes the
   ability of frequency scaling-based techniques to save energy. Modern
   processors also provide sleep states which minimize leakage power by
   gating portions of the processor and/or the system clock. This paper
   presents partitioned fixed-priority scheduling solutions for utilizing
   these sleep states to efficiently schedule periodic real-time tasks, and
   maximize energy savings on multi-core processors. The techniques
   presented rely on an Enhanced Version of Energy-Saving Rate-Harmonized
   Scheduling (ES-RHS), and our newly proposed Energy-Saving Rate-Monotonic
   Scheduling (ES-RMS) policy to maximize the time the processor spends in
   the lowest-power deep sleep state. In some modern multi-core processors,
   all cores need to transition synchronously into deep sleep. For this
   class of processors, we present a partitioning technique called
   Max-SyncSleep which utilizes a priori task information, to maximize the
   synchronous deep sleep duration across all processing cores. The
   performance of Max-SyncSleep is compared to the classical Worst-Fit
   Decreasing load balancing heuristic. We also illustrate the benefits of
   using ES-RMS over ES-RHS for this class of processors. For processors
   which allow cores to individually transition into deep sleep, we prove
   that, while utilizing ES-RHS on each core, any feasible partition can
   optimally utilize all of the processor's idle durations to put it into
   deep sleep. Experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed
   techniques can provide significant energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{We report calculated elastic tensors, axial Gruneisen parameters, and
   thermal stress distributions in Al2Mo3O12, ZrMgMo3O12, Sc2Mo3O12, and
   Y2Mo3O12, a series of isomorphic materials for which the coefficients of
   thermal expansion range from low-positive to negative. Thermal stress in
   polycrystalline materials arises from interactions between thermal
   expansion and mechanical properties, and both can be highly anisotropic.
   Thermal expansion anisotropy was found to be correlated with elastic
   anisotropy: axes with negative thermal expansion were less compliant.
   Calculations of axial Gruneisen parameters revealed that the thermal
   expansion anisotropy in these materials is in part due to the Poisson
   effect. Models of thermal stress due to thermal expansion anisotropy in
   polycrystals following cooling showed thermal stresses of sufficient
   magnitude to cause microcracking in all cases. The thermal expansion
   anisotropy was found to couple to elastic anisotropy, decreasing the
   bulk coefficient of thermal expansion and leading to lognormal extremes
   of the thermal stress distributions.}},

Abstract = {{SkinTrack is a wearable system that enables continuous touch tracking on
   the skin. It consists of a ring, which emits a continuous high frequency
   AC signal, and a sensing wristband with multiple electrodes. Due to the
   phase delay inherent in a high-frequency AC signal propagating through
   the body, a phase difference can be observed between pairs of
   electrodes. SkinTrack measures these phase differences to compute a 2D
   finger touch coordinate. Our approach can segment touch events at 99\%
   accuracy, and resolve the 2D location of touches With a mean error of
   7.6mm. As our approach is compact, non-invasive, low-cost and low
   powered, we envision the technology being integrated into future
   smartwatches, supporting rich touch interactions beyond the confines of
   the small touchscreen.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical decision support tools (DSTs) are computational systems that
   aid healthcare decision-making. While effective in labs, almost all
   these systems failed when they moved into clinical practice. Healthcare
   researchers speculated it is most likely due to a lack of user-centered
   HCI considerations in the design of these systems. This paper describes
   a field study investigating how clinicians make a heart pump implant
   decision with a focus on how to best integrate an intelligent DST into
   their work process. Our findings reveal a lack of perceived need for and
   trust of machine intelligence, as well as many barriers to computer use
   at the point of clinical decision-making. These findings suggest an
   alternative perspective to the traditional use models, in which
   clinicians engage with DSTs at the point of making a decision. We
   identify situations across patients' healthcare trajectories when
   decision supports would help, and we discuss new forms it might take in
   these situations.}},

Abstract = {{A systematical study is performed to analyze the spurious modes, Q and
   electromechanical coupling of 1.22 GHz AlN MEMS contour-mode resonators.
   A total of 135 different geometrical configurations were studied. An
   unloaded Q of up to 3157, an electromechanical coupling of up to 2.3\%,
   and a figure of merit of up to 61.6 were achieved. In particular, we
   found that Q is primarily affected by finger length and anchor type.
   Also, overhang extension and finger numbers are the only parameters that
   change the relative location of main mode and spurs. Ultimately, by
   optimizing these two parameters it is possible to attain a high figure
   of merit while pushing the spurious modes away from the main mode of
   resonance.}},

Abstract = {{Drilled shaft is an important substructure foundation in building
   construction. A drilled shaft needs to be placed precisely in high
   accuracy and satisfy the diameter precision requirement. In order to
   measure the verticality and the diameter of a shaft, the M-superimposed
   Gaussian Echoes Model (GEM) is used to estimate the time of flight (TOF)
   of ultrasound. Compared to the conventional threshold and
   cross-correlation based methods, GEM method has higher resolution and
   higher signal-to-noise ratio. However, the GEM method is computational
   expensive. In this paper, we propose an Active Shape Models (ASMs)
   tracking based algorithm to estimate the time of flight (TOF) of the
   ultrasound testing inside a cylindrical container. It extracts the
   pattern of the first several arriving peaks and troughs in a more
   flexible way with better efficiency than GEM.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique for accurate measurement of
   high-bandwidth nanomilling forces. Nanomilling has recently emerged as a
   viable mechanical nanomanufacturing technique for creation of
   three-dimensional nano-scale features on engineering materials. Accurate
   measurement of nanomilling forces is paramount to advancing the
   fundamental understanding of nanomilling and to enhancing the process
   outcomes. However, to date, no effective approach has been described for
   obtaining accurate measurement of nanomilling forces that exhibit
   micro/nano Newton range amplitudes and a broad frequency bandwidth. In
   this paper, we introduce a new in situ microcantilever-based technique
   for accurate measurement of nanomilling forces within a 10 kHz bandwidth
   without compromising its high-stiffness configuration. To this end, a
   microcantilever is designed and fabricated as a sensing element. The
   sensor possesses the processing and sensing locations close to its fixed
   and free ends, respectively to enable high stiffness at the processing
   location and high sensitivity at the sensing location. The sensor is
   then integrated into our custom-made nanomilling system as a force
   measurement device (FMD), and its dynamic calibration is achieved
   through an AFM-probe based dynamic testing approach. The calibration
   approach relates the measured displacements at the sensing location to
   the applied forces at the processing location. Subsequently, the
   accurate in situ nanomilling force measurements are obtained within a
   broad frequency range using the calibrated force sensor. It is concluded
   that the presented technique provides an effective means of accurate
   measurement of nanomilling forces within 0-10 kHz frequency range
   towards realizing essential advances in nanomilling.}},

Abstract = {{At the sub-millimeter scale, capillary forces enable robust and
   reversible adhesion between biological organisms and varied substrates.
   Current human-engineered mobile untethered micromanipulation systems
   rely on forces which scale poorly or utilize gripper-part designs that
   promote manipulation. Capillary forces, alternatively, are dependent
   upon the surface chemistry (which is scale independent) and contact
   perimeter, which conforms to the part surface. We report a mobile
   capillary microgripper that is able to pick and place parts of various
   materials and geometries, and is thus ideal for microassembly tasks that
   cannot be accomplished by large tethered manipulators. We achieve the
   programmable assembly of submillimeter parts in an enclosed
   three-dimensional aqueous environment by creating a capillary bridge
   between the targeted part and a synthetic, untethered, mobile body. The
   parts include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components: hydrogel,
   kapton, human hair, and biological tissue. The 200 mu m untethered
   system can be controlled with five-degrees-of-freedom and advances
   progress towards autonomous desktop manufacturing for tissue
   engineering, complex micromachines, microfluidic devices, and
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Interface characteristics of Al/Cu micro-laminates fabricated by an
   Electrically-Assisted Roll Bonding (EARB) process were studied to
   understand the underlying physical/chemical phenomena that lead to bond
   strength enhancement when applying electrical current during
   deformation. Peel tests were conducted for the Al/Cu roll bonded
   laminates produced with no current and under 50A and 150A applied
   current. After peel tests using a micro-tensile machine, the fractured
   surfaces of both the Al and Cu sides were examined using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) for fractography and SEM-based energy
   dispersive (EDS) analysis. Results revealed the strong dependence of the
   fracture path and its morphology on the strength of the bond, which is
   influenced by various phenomena occurring at the interface during EARB,
   such as microextrusion through surface micro-cracks, possible formation
   of intermetallic components and thermal softening during simultaneous
   application of strain and high current density.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication processes of single-layer and multilayer graphene (SLG and
   MLG, respectively) that are simple yet controllable are actively
   sought-after to realize many graphene-based applications. We report the
   fabrication, growth kinetics, and characterization of graphene formed on
   liquid metal surfaces through a segregation method that was determined
   by combining real time and in situ imaging using a high-temperature
   confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) with high-resolution scanning
   electron microscopy imaging and Raman spectroscopy. Carbon was first
   dissolved in liquid copper (silver) at 1300 degrees C (1200 degrees C)
   and then precipitated out as graphene on a liquid copper (silver)
   surface at 1130 degrees C or 1090 degrees C (1000 degrees C). SLG with a
   smooth texture formed and almost fully covered the liquid copper surface
   within seconds but partially covered the liquid silver surface. In
   contrast to graphene formed on liquid silver, which maintained a smooth
   texture after solidification of liquid silver and did not possess any
   MLG, the graphene that formed on liquid copper comprised of SLG and MLG,
   and developed ripples and wrinkles upon solidification. Real time and in
   situ observations with a high-temperature CLSM revealed that small MLG
   precipitates formed between the liquid copper surface and SLG, and were
   attached underneath the SLG. Interestingly, the precipitates grew into
   large hexagonal islands instead of coalescing together. Furthermore,
   occasionally two MLG islands joined into a larger MLG island with
   individual MLG islands maintaining its hexagonal shape and slowly
   drifted as a unit on the liquid copper surface, confirming that the MLG
   islands formed after SLG formation and were attached to the SLG layer.
   Lastly, the number densities, areal sizes, and thicknesses of these MLG
   islands strongly depended on graphene formation temperatures and carbon
   dissolution times. For example, lowering the graphene formation
   temperature from 1130 degrees C to 1090 degrees C with the same graphene
   formation time as well as the carbon dissolution time and temperature
   resulted in a greater number of thinner and laterally smaller MLG
   islands. On the other hand, increasing the carbon dissolution time while
   keeping the carbon dissolution temperature along with the graphene
   formation time and temperature the same led to fewer and thicker MLG
   islands with larger lateral sizes. The real time and in situ
   observations provide direct insights on graphene formation and growth
   kinetics, which will allow precise control of graphene quality formed on
   liquid metal surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Existing smartwatches rely on touchscreens for display and input, which
   inevitably leads to finger occlusion and confines interactivity to a
   small area. In this work, we introduce AuraSense, which enables rich,

   explore how this sensing approach could enhance smartwatch interactions,
   we considered different antenna configurations and how they could enable
   useful interaction modalities. We identified four configurations that
   can support six well-known modalities of particular interest and
   utility, including gestures above the watchface and touchscreen-like
   finger tracking on the skin. We quantify the feasibility of these input
   modalities in a series of user studies, which suggest that AuraSense can
   be low latency and robust across both users and environments.}},

Abstract = {{The world is full of physical interfaces that are inaccessible to blind
   people, from microwaves and information kiosks to thermostats and
   checkout terminals. Blind people cannot independently use such devices
   without at least first learning their layout, and usually only after
   labeling them with sighted assistance. We introduce VizLens-an
   accessible mobile application and supporting backend that can robustly
   and interactively help blind people use nearly any interface they
   encounter. VizLens users capture a photo of an inaccessible interface
   and send it to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly
   label and describe elements of the interface to make subsequent computer
   vision easier. The VizLens application helps users recapture the
   interface in the field of the camera, and uses computer vision to
   interactively describe the part of the interface beneath their finger
   (updating 8 times per second). We show that VizLens provides accurate
   and usable real-time feedback in a study with 10 blind participants, and
   our crowdsourcing labeling workflow was fast (8 minutes), accurate
   (99.7\%), and cheap (\$1.15). We then explore extensions of VizLens that
   allow it to (i) adapt to state changes in dynamic interfaces, (ii)
   combine crowd labeling with OCR technology to handle dynamic displays,
   and (iii) benefit from head-mounted cameras. VizLens robustly solves a
   long-standing challenge in accessibility by deeply integrating
   crowdsourcing and computer vision, and foreshadows a future of
   increasingly powerful interactive applications that would be currently
   impossible with either alone.}},

Abstract = {{The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of multidomain ferroelectric
   BaTiO3 coated with thin (10 nm) anatase TiO2 films has been modeled in
   two dimensions, using physically reasonable property values of each
   material. The minority carrier current density averaged across the
   entire surface, composed of equal portions of positively and negatively
   polarized domains separated by 180 degrees boundaries, is similar to
   that reported previously for a single negatively polarized domain
   (modeled in one dimension). This indicates that photogenerated carriers
   driven away from the surface in one domain can be collected at the
   surface of the neighboring domain and participate in surface reactivity.
   For a wide range of physically reasonable domain widths, from
   approximately 100 to 400 nm, the limiting IQE is more than 90\% of the
   maximum value, and far exceeds that for Z-scheme domain reactivity,
   where the carriers driven away from the surface would recombine in the
   bulk. When the potential and the domain width of alternating positively
   and negatively polarized domains are optimized, the balancing reduction
   and oxidation currents occur on the surface with a total limiting IQE as
   high as 90\%, implying there exists significant room for improvement of
   photocatalysts using spatially varying internal fields at or near the
   reactive surface.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a sensitive and specific lung cancer
   screening tool for the high-risk population and shown to be promising
   for detection of lung cancer. This study proposes an automatic
   methodology for detecting and segmenting lung nodules from CT images.
   The proposed methods begin with thorax segmentation, lung extraction and
   reconstruction of the original shape of the parenchyma using morphology
   operations. Next, a multi-scale hessian-based vesselness filter is
   applied to extract lung vasculature in lung. The lung vasculature mask
   is subtracted from the lung region segmentation mask to extract 3D
   regions representing candidate pulmonary nodules. Finally, the remaining

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of designing fault-tolerant parallel
   linear filters. We assume that a linear filter can either function
   perfectly or fail completely, i.e., generate arbitrary outputs. We use
   real-number error correcting codes based on linear programming decoding
   to introduce redundancy into the linear filters and detect faulty
   filters. We prove that all faulty filters can be detected and corrected
   if the number of faulty filters is smaller than a threshold value. We
   also obtain simulation results to support our statement. To the best of
   our knowledge, we believe that this work is the first to connect the
   information-theoretic idea of real-number error control coding with
   parallel linear filtering systems.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid technology that enables fine-grained monitoring and control
   of electrical power systems makes it possible to envision new operating
   strategies and even new business models. Possibilities for leveraging
   these smart grid tools in the developing world are being explored,
   particularly with emerging microgrids for rural electrification. In
   these off-grid systems, smart meters at the residential level are being
   used to manage the delivery of affordable electricity through novel uses
   of mobile payments and direct demand-side control at the customer level.
   In contrast to traditional power systems in the developed world, the
   available total supply in microgrids, which can incorporate multiple
   types of generation, is not always sufficient to meet the aggregate
   demand, even under normal operating conditions. Moreover, both the
   available supply and the demand are highly variable, limiting the value
   of deterministic analyses. This paper introduces a simulation tool for
   assessing the performance of these systems using probabilistic models of
   supply and demand. A key feature of the tool is the use of stochastic
   models for the individual loads and supplies, which are aggregated
   precisely to obtain stochastic models of the system-level behavior. This
   makes it possible to evaluate and compare system performance for
   different operating and business strategies that take advantage of the
   capabilities for fine-grained control. The paper describes the simulator
   inputs, computations and illustrative results for a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advances in the control and distribution of electricity (
   electrical energy) is causing change in micro-grid technology.
   Similarly, the constant increase in the number of consumers is changing
   the management and control of power distribution. This paradigm change
   in power networks is also influenced by the fact that the world is
   re-thinking how energy should be controlled in order to avoid energy
   loss and limit accidents. Unlike traditional grids, microgrids have a
   unique power operation of distribute energy without controlling and
   communication. The focus of this paper is the implementation of smart
   interface subsystems to enhance control and communication in microgrids.
   In order to perform this task, smart interfaces are designed so that the
   operations can be done seamlessly, the overall power cost is reduced
   with and failures and accidents are reduced. This paper demonstrates
   smart grid interfaces designed for different components of the grid and
   their implementation of a prototype with a PIC 16F887 microcontroller.}},

Abstract = {{With 1.3 billion people lacking access to electricity, the demand for
   power is increasing drastically. Electricity can no longer be considered
   a luxury, and is necessary for maintaining a modern life expectancy.
   This paper explores the feasibility of energy production and storage
   across South America, South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with
   National Renewable Energy Lab's Geospatial Toolkit and the integrated
   HOMER interface. Multiple scenarios are constructed based on different
   community sizes with relative demand and load profiles. Optimization
   techniques are used to value both traditional generation options (diesel
   generation), their renewable counterparts (wind and solar), as well as
   energy storage methods (batteries). Each analysis is based on
   location-specific irradiance, wind speeds, and fuel prices. Economics
   remain at the forefront, as a community's ability to purchase the
   generated power is the centerpiece of this entire investigation. With
   all three regions in a similar state of development, parallels can be
   drawn among them. By scrutinizing data from all three continents,
   similarities can be observed between population density and
   distribution, their demand and usage of electricity, and purchasing
   power parity. These similarities can be used to fill gaps in our
   understanding of how a community may use generated electricity, or how
   that demand will change over time. This is instrumental in scaling
   renewable energy based microgrids globally.}},

Abstract = {{Levels of electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa are low with large
   populations living far from existing electricity infrastructure. This
   has led to interest in decentralized electrification solutions like
   microgrids, which can reach remote communities more quickly. To address
   a lack of capital to deploy these projects, governments have sought
   private investment in the sector. Studies have found that hybrid
   microgrids using both conventional and renewable generators provide
   electricity at lower cost than diesel powered systems. These studies
   focus on metrics such as levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and life
   cycle cost (LCC) and do not account explicitly for investment risk. This
   paper employs a stochastic techno-economic model to examine the impact
   of PV array sizing in microgrids on debt and equity investment metrics
   like debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and net present value (NPV)
   using a risk based approach. Results indicate that high levels of PV
   penetration mitigate fuel price risks when low-cost capital is
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Non-Technical Loss (NTL) represents a major challenge when providing
   reliable electrical service in developing countries, where it often
   accounts for 11-15\% of total generation capacity {[}1]. NTL is caused
   by a variety of factors such as theft, unmetered homes, and inability to
   pay, which at volume can lead to system instability, grid failure, and
   major financial losses for providers.
   In this paper, we investigate error sources and techniques for
   separating NTL from total losses in microgrids. We adopt and compare two
   classes of approaches for detecting NTL: (1) model-driven and (2)
   data-driven. The model-driven class considers the primary sources of
   state uncertainty including line losses, meter consumption, meter
   calibration error, packet loss, and sample synchronization error. In the
   data-driven class, we use two approaches that learn grid state based on
   training data. The first approach uses a regression technique on an
   NTL-free period of grid operation to capture the relationship between
   state error and total consumption. The second approach uses an SVM
   trained on synthetic NTL data. Both classes of approaches can provide a
   confidence interval based on the amount of detected NTL. We
   experimentally evaluate and compare the approaches on wireless meter
   data collected from a 525-home microgrid deployed in Les Anglais, Haiti.
   We see that both are quite effective, but that the data-driven class is
   significantly easier to implement. In both cases, we are able to
   experimentally evaluate to what degree we can reliably separate NTL from
   total losses.}},

Title = {{Curie Temperature Engineering in High Entropy Alloys for Magnetocaloric
   Applications}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{High entropy alloys (HEAs) are useful in applications that requir high
   strength, oxidation resistance, and high temperature stability. Research
   on HEAs for magnetocaloric applications focuses on increasing the
   refrigeration constant and controlling the Curie temperature (T-c). Here
   we investigate the effect of metal additions on exchange interaction
   distributions in eqiatomic ferromagnetic alloys of Fe, Co, and Ni. The
   metal additions are (a) noble metals (e.g., Cu, Ag), (b)
   antiferromagnetic transition metals (e.g., Mn), (c) Stoner-enhanced
   transition metals (e.g., Pt), and (d) early transition metals (e.g., Mo)
   that contribute to the virtual bound states. We are able to: 1)
   stabilize a ferromagnetic face-centered cubic. gamma-phase with
   equiatomic compositions in 4-, 5-, and 6-component systems, 2) make
   slight departures from equiatomic compositions to a chosen alloy to
   bring its Tc closer to room temperature, and 3) measure the role of
   alloying on exchange interaction distributions. We present a simple
   model to predict Tc in HEAs using the Bethe-Slater curve and binary
   phase diagrams of alloy constituents. Compared to the rare-earth-based
   magnetocaloric materials, the HEAs investigated here have significantly
   lower costs.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of hard tribological coatings was studied in
   terms of mitigating impact damage between tungsten carbide spherical
   elements and two different types of steel substrates. The coatings
   included a hard, highly elastic Tungsten-incorporated diamond-like
   carbon (W-DLC) coating at two different thicknesses and a harder, less
   elastic CrxN coating. Impacts were created using a drop-test rig
   described herein and characterized in three ways: a measure of the
   coefficient of restitution during impact, investigation of the impact
   site using an optical interferometer, and fixed ion beam cross sections
   of select impacts for observation of subsurface damage within the
   coating and substrate. It was found that hard coatings on softer
   substrates such as 440C steel were able to mitigate surface damage up to
   a certain impact speed, depending on the coating, but were unable to
   influence the coefficient of restitution. On harder substrates like
   52100 alloy steel, the coatings were found to increase the coefficient
   of restitution, indicating a reduction in energy loss due to plastic
   deformation, and to reduce damage at each tested speed. These effects
   and their potential influence on bearing performance are discussed in
   regard to impact mechanics, surface metrology, and the material
   properties of the coating and substrate acquired by nanoindentation.}},

   polymorphs}},
Journal = {{CRYSTENGCOMM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{7353-7362}},
Abstract = {{Singlet fission (SF), the conversion of one singlet exciton into two
   triplet excitons, may lead to the realization of high efficiency organic
   photovoltaics by generating two carriers from one photon. Recently, SF
   has been observed in molecular crystals of rubrene. While the
   orthorhombic form of rubrene is most often observed under ambient
   conditions, metastable monoclinic and triclinic polymorphs are known.
   Here, dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) is used to
   investigate the relative stability of all three phases. Many-body
   perturbation theory is then employed to study the effect of crystal
   structure on the electronic and excitonic properties. Band structures
   are calculated within the GW approximation and optical properties are
   calculated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We find that
   crystal packing significantly affects the electronic and excitonic
   properties of rubrene. Based on our calculations, the triclinic and
   especially the monoclinic forms of rubrene are expected to exhibit
   higher SF efficiencies than the orthorhombic form.}},

Title = {{Guidance to improve the scientific value of zetapotential measurements
   in nanoEHS}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{953-965}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle zeta-potentials are relatively easy to measure, and have
   consistently been proposed in guidance documents as a particle property
   that must be included for complete nanoparticle characterization. There
   is also an increasing interest in integrating data collected on
   nanomaterial properties and behavior measured in different systems (e.g.
   in vitro assays, surface water, soil) to identify the properties
   controlling nanomaterial fate and effects, to be able to integrate and
   reuse datasets beyond their original intent, and ultimately to predict
   behaviors of new nanomaterials based on their measured properties (i.e.
   read across), including zeta-potential. Several confounding factors pose
   difficulty in taking, integrating and interpreting this measurement
   consistently. Zeta-potential is a modeled quantity determined from
   measurements of the electrophoretic mobility in a suspension, and its
   value depends on the nanomaterial properties, the solution conditions,
   and the theoretical model applied. The ability to use zeta-potential as
   an explanatory variable for measured behaviors in different systems (or
   potentially to predict specific behaviors) therefore requires robust
   reporting with relevant meta-data for the measurement conditions and the
   model used to convert mobility measurements to zeta-potentials. However,
   there is currently no such standardization for reporting in the nanoEHS
   literature. The objective of this tutorial review is to familiarize the
   nanoEHS research community with the zeta-potential concept and the
   factors that influence its calculated value and interpretation,
   including the effects of adsorbed macromolecules. We also provide
   practical guidance on the precision of measurement, interpretation of
   zeta-potential as an explanatory variable for processes of interest
   (e.g. toxicity, environmental fate), and provide advice for addressing
   common challenges associated with making meaningful zeta-potential
   measurements using commercial instruments. Finally, we provide specific
   guidance on the parameters that need to be reported with zetapotential
   measurements to maximize interpretability and to support scientific
   synthesis across data sets.}},

Title = {{Photochemical transformations of thiolated polyethylene glycol coatings
   on gold nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1090-1102}},
Abstract = {{Photochemical reactions can cause significant transformations of
   manufactured nanomaterials in sunlit environments. While transformations
   of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) have been investigated extensively,
   less attention has been focused on the direct impact of aqueous
   photochemical reactions on adsorbed organic macromolecules that form the
   NP corona and strongly influence the surface interactions and reactivity
   that affect NP transport, fate, and toxicity. Here, we assess the
   transformations of methoxy polyethylene glycol thiol (mPEGSH) coatings
   on gold NPs (AuNPs) under controlled UV irradiation. A decrease in the
   adsorbed layer thickness of polymer was observed within 24 h of UV
   irradiation, resulting in increased susceptibility of the transformed
   NPs to aggregation. Surface chemistry analyses, including X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), showed loss of the ether groups but
   persistence of reduced S on the AuNP surface, indicative of a chain
   scission mechanism yielding different NP surface properties from that of
   either the initial PEGylated AuNP or the citrate-stabilized AuNP prior
   to coating with mPEGSH. The transformation of the chemisorbed polymer
   was compared to that of dissolved mPEGSH in the presence and absence of
   the Au NPs, as evaluated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS). In contrast to the NP-adsorbed coating, the primary observed
   transformation of the dissolved mPEGSH was thiol oxidation to disulfides
   without extensive chain scission. This study demonstrates that
   transformations of adsorbed macromolecular coatings must be considered
   to accurately predict NP attachment behavior, and hence transport, in
   environmental systems. Because the corona transformation was not
   predictable from that of the dissolved polymer, direct NP surface
   characterization is required to discern the fundamental reactions
   involved in the photochemical transformation of coatings after sorption
   to the NP surface.}},

Abstract = {{Most compressive imaging architectures rely on programmable
   light-modulators to obtain coded linear measurements of a signal. As a
   consequence, the properties of the light modulator place fundamental
   limits on the cost, performance, practicality, and capabilities of the
   compressive camera. For example, the spatial resolution of the single
   pixel camera is limited to that of its light modulator, which is seldom
   greater than 4 megapixels. In this paper, we describe a novel approach
   to compressive imaging that avoids the use of spatial light modulator.
   In its place, we use novel cylindrical optics and a rotation gantry to
   directly sample the Radon transform of the image focused on the sensor
   plane. We show that the reconstruction problem is identical to sparse
   tomographic recovery and we can leverage the vast literature in
   compressive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to good effect.
   The proposed design has many important advantages over existing
   compressive cameras. First, we can achieve a resolution of N x N pixels
   using a sensor with N photodetectors; hence, with commercially available
   SWIR line-detectors with 10k pixels, we can potentially achieve spatial
   resolutions of 100 megapixels, a capability that is unprecedented.
   Second, our design is scalable more gracefully across wavebands of light
   since we only require sensors and optics that are optimized for the
   wavelengths of interest; in contrast, spatial light modulators like DMDs
   require expensive coatings to be effective in non-visible wavebands.
   Third, we can exploit properties of line-detectors including electronic
   shutters and pixels with large aspect ratios to optimize light
   throughput. On the flip side, a drawback of our approach is the need for
   moving components in the imaging architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is a major health problem worldwide, and there is substantial
   interest in developing xenogeneic islet transplantation as a potential
   treatment. The potential to relieve the demand on an inadequate supply
   of human pancreata is dependent upon the efficiency of techniques for
   isolating and culturing islets from the source pancreata. Porcine islets
   are favored for xenotransplantation, but mature pigs (>2 years) present
   logistic and economic challenges, and young pigs (3-6 months) have not
   yet proven to be an adequate source. In this study, islets were isolated
   from 20 juvenile porcine pancreata (similar to 3 months; 25 kg Yorkshire
   pigs) immediately following procurement or after 24 h of hypothermic
   machine perfusion (HMP) preservation. The resulting islet preparations
   were characterized using a battery of tests during culture in silicone
   rubber membrane flasks. Islet biology assessment included oxygen
   consumption, insulin secretion, histopathology, and in vivo function.
   Islet yields were highest from HMP-preserved pancreata (2,242 +/- 449
   IEQ/g). All preparations comprised a high proportion (>90\%) of small
   islets (<100 mu m), and purity was on average 63 +/- 6\%.
   Morphologically, islets appeared as clusters on day 0, loosely
   disaggregated structures at day 1, and transitioned to aggregated
   structures comprising both exocrine and endocrine cells by day 6.
   Histopathology confirmed both insulin and glucagon staining in cultures
   and grafts excised after transplantation in mice. Nuclear staining
   (Ki-67) confirmed mitotic activity consistent with the observed
   plasticity of these structures. Metabolic integrity was demonstrated by
   oxygen consumption rates=175 +/- 16 nmol/min/mg DNA, and physiological
   function was intact by glucose stimulation after 6-8 days in culture. In
   vivo function was confirmed with blood glucose control achieved in
   nearly 50\% (8/17) of transplants. Preparation and culture of juvenile
   porcine islets as a source for islet transplantation require specialized
   conditions. These immature islets undergo plasticity in culture and form
   fully functional multicellular structures. Further development of this
   method for culturing immature porcine islets is expected to generate
   small pancreatic tissue-derived organoids termed ``pancreatites,{''} as
   a therapeutic product from juvenile pigs for xenotransplantation and
   diabetes research.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, both industry and academia have proposed many different
   roadmaps for the future of DRAM. Consequently, there is a growing need
   for an extensible DRAM simulator, which can be easily modified to judge
   the merits of today's DRAM standards as well as those of tomorrow. In
   this paper, we present Ramulator, a fast and cycle-accurate DRAM
   simulator that is built from the ground up for extensibility. Unlike
   existing simulators, Ramulator is based on a generalized template for
   modeling a DRAM system, which is only later infused with the specific
   details of a DRAM standard. Thanks to such a decoupled and modular
   design, Ramulator is able to provide out-of-the-box support for a wide
   array of DRAM standards: DDR3/4, LPDDR3/4, GDDR5, WIO1/2, HBM, as well
   as some academic proposals (SALP, AL-DRAM, TL-DRAM, RowClone, and SARP).
   Importantly, Ramulator does not sacrifice simulation speed to gain
   extensibility: according to our evaluations, Ramulator is 2.5x faster
   than the next fastest simulator. Ramulator is released under the
   permissive BSD license.}},

Abstract = {{We report the ability of nanoscale pore channels of anodized aluminum
   oxide (AAO) to endow entrapped silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) within with
   structural and oxidation stability for potential surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) at elevated temperatures. AAO was prepared via
   two-step anodization of high purity aluminum foil in phosphoric acid. Ag
   NPs of controlled size and coverage were obtained via in situ seeded
   growth from aqueous AgNO3 solution inside the AAO pore channels. The
   structural and chemical characteristics and the SERS activity of the Ag
   NPs before and after environmental exposure in air at up to 600 degrees
   C for as long as 5 days were evaluated using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman
   spectroscopy. We show that the Ag NPs entrapped in the AAO pore channels
   exhibit enhanced structural and oxidation stability and thus retain
   significant SERS activity upon high-temperature treatment, indicating
   the intricate role of geometric confinement in retarding Ostwald
   ripening, evaporation loss, as well as oxidation of Ag NPs.}},

Abstract = {{In this tutorial, I will present SEAHORN, a software verification
   framework. The key distinguishing feature of SEAHORN is its modular
   design that separates the concerns of the syntax of the programming
   language, its operational semantics, and the verification semantics.
   SEAHORN encompasses several novelties: it (a) encodes verification
   conditions using an efficient yet precise inter-procedural technique,
   (b) provides flexibility in the verification semantics to allow
   different levels of precision, (c) leverages the state-of-the-art in
   software model checking and abstract interpretation for verification,
   and (d) uses Horn-clauses as an intermediate language to represent
   verification conditions which simplifies interfacing with multiple
   verification tools based on Horn-clauses. SEAHORN provides users with a
   powerful verification tool and provides researchers with an extensible
   and customizable framework for experimenting with new software
   verification techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Building energy accounts large amount of the total energy consumption,
   and smart building energy control leads to high energy efficiency and
   significant energy savings. A compact and accurate building thermal
   model is important for designing the efficient energy control system. In
   this paper, we propose an accurate thermal behavior modeling technique
   for general and complicated buildings. This new modeling technique
   builds compact thermal model by system identification using temperature
   and power data obtained from EnergyPlus software, which can provide
   realistic temperature, weather and power data for buildings. In order to
   make the best use of data from EnergyPlus and avoid the overfitting
   problem associated with the system identificatoin method, a
   cross-validation technique is employed to generate multiple thermal
   models to find the optimal model order. The final model is then
   generated by performing a regular system identification using the
   previously selected order. Experimental results from a case study of a
   5-zone building have shown that the proposed method is able to find the
   optimal model order, and the building models built by the proposed
   method can achieve 1-3\% average errors and less than 10-18\% maximum
   errors for the estimation of zone temperatures for about a one year
   period.}},

Abstract = {{Moving horizon estimation (MHE) has emerged as a popular technique for
   state estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems. A key parameter in MHE
   is the arrival cost that links the formulation in the current horizon
   with the past data. Most approaches available in literature use
   additional filters, such as extended Kalman filter or unscented Kalman
   tiller to obtain the covariance matrix used in the arrival cost. In this
   work, we propose conceptually simple, alternate ways for obtaining the
   covariances of the arrival cost. Our approaches are motivated by
   parameter estimation in nonlinear regression. We view the MHE problem as
   a nonlinear regression problem with the states being the unknown
   parameters of the regression problem. The covariance of these estimated
   parameters can then be computed based on the Jacobian matrix. We also
   propose a Monte-Carlo based sampling approach for covariance
   calculation. This approach avoids Jacobian matrix calculation but is
   computationally intensive. A third approach utilizing approximate
   Hessian, based on equivalence between nonlinear regression and maximum
   likelihood estimation, is also proposed. Thus, the proposed approaches
   are able to compute the arrival cost without requiring any other
   external filter implementation. The MHE estimation performances obtained
   with the arrival cost covariances computed using the proposed approaches
   are compared with extended Kalman filter (EKF) and EKE based MHE
   implementation on case studies taken from literature. These comparisons
   demonstrate the utility of the proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a method to improve the electrochemical properties of
   platinum electrodes fabricated using parylene-C based processes. It is
   found that the use of O-2 reactive-ion etch to etch parylene-C, the
   state-of-the-art method for processing parylene-C, oxidizes a surface
   layer of platinum, which results in high electrochemical impedance of
   the electrode. By introducing an Ar+ ion milling step, the
   electrochemical impedance of the electrode is reduced by an order of
   magnitude. The surface roughness of the electrodes (R-a) using this
   method of de-insulation is found to be 13.1 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Computer vision and image-based inference have predominantly focused on
   extracting scene information by assuming that the camera measures direct
   light transport (i.e., single-bounce light paths). As a consequence,
   strong multi-bounce effects are treated typically as sources of noise
   and, in many scenarios, the presence of such effects can result in gross
   errors in the estimates of shape and reflectance. This paper provides
   the theoretical and algorithmic foundations for shape and reflectance
   estimation from two-bounce light transients, i.e., scenarios where
   photons from a light source interact with the scene exactly twice before
   reaching the sensor. We derive sufficient conditions for exact recovery
   of shape and reflectance given lengths and intensities associated with
   two-bounce light paths. We also develop algorithms for recovery of shape
   and reflectance, and validate these on a range of simulated scenes.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the general principles and initial results of coherent
   hemodynamics spectroscopy (CHS), which is a new technique for the
   quantitative assessment of cerebral hemodynamics on the basis of dynamic
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements. The two components of
   CHS are (1) dynamic measurements of coherent cerebral hemodynamics in
   the form of oscillations at multiple frequencies (frequency domain) or
   temporal transients (time domain), and (2) their quantitative analysis
   with a dynamic mathematical model that relates the concentration and
   oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in tissue to cerebral blood volume
   (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
   (CMRO2). In particular, CHS can provide absolute measurements and
   dynamic monitoring of CBF, and quantitative measures of cerebral
   autoregulation. We report initial results of CBF measurements in
   hemodialysis patients, where we found a lower CBF (54 +/- 16 ml/(100
   g-min)) compared to a group of healthy controls (95 +/- 11 ml/(100
   g-min)). We also report CHS measurements of cerebral autoregulation,
   where a quantitative index of autoregulation (its cutoff frequency) was
   found to be significantly greater in healthy subjects during
   hyperventilation (0.034 +/- 0.005 Hz) than during normal breathing
   (0.017 +/- 0.002 Hz). We also present our approach to depth resolved
   CHS, based on multi-distance, frequencydomain NIRS data and a two-layer
   diffusion model, to enhance sensitivity to cerebral tissue. CHS offers a
   potentially powerful approach to the quantitative assessment and
   continuous monitoring of local brain perfusion at the microcirculation
   level, with prospective brain mapping capabilities of research and
   clinical significance.}},

Abstract = {{As more devices gain Internet connectivity, more information needs to be
   exchanged between them. For instance, cloud servers might disseminate
   instructions to clients, or sensors in the Internet of Things might send
   measurements to each other. In such scenarios, information spreads
   faster when users have an incentive to contribute data to others. While
   many works have considered this problem in peer-to-peer scenarios, none
   have rigorously theorized the performance of different design choices
   for the incentive mechanisms. In particular, different designs have
   different ways of ``bootstrapping{''} new users (distributing
   information to them) and preventing `` free-riding{''} (receiving
   information without uploading any in return). We classify incentive
   mechanisms in terms of reciprocity-, altruism-, and reputation-based
   algorithms, and then analyze the performance of these three basic and
   three hybrid algorithms. We show that the algorithms lie along a
   tradeoff between fairness and efficiency, with altruism and reciprocity
   at the two extremes. The three hybrids all leverage their component
   algorithms to achieve similar efficiency. The reputation hybrids are the
   most fair and can nearly match altruism's bootstrapping speed, but only
   the reciprocity/reputation hybrid can match reciprocity's zero-tolerance
   for free-riding. It therefore yields better fairness and efficiency when
   free-riders are present. We validate these comparisons with extensive
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature prediction can enhance datacenter thermal management towards
   minimizing cooling power draw. Traditional approaches achieve this
   through analyzing task-temperature profiles or resistor-capacitor
   circuit models to predict CPU temperature. However, they are unable to
   capture task resource heterogeneity within multi-tenant environments and
   make predictions under dynamic scenarios such as virtual machine
   migration, which is one of the main characteristics of Cloud computing.
   This paper proposes virtual machine level temperature prediction in
   Cloud datacenters. Experiments show that the mean squared error of
   stable CPU temperature prediction is within 1.10, and dynamic CPU
   temperature prediction can achieve 1.60 in most scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{As low-voltage distribution grids and microgrids emerge, their
   decentralized control design is a major issue and needs rethinking, as
   several recent examples of oscillatory behavior in voltage and reactive
   power have been reported. This paper analyzes a few possible reasons for
   these oscillations. Oscillations can occur as a result of connecting
   distributed energy resources to a single phase only, which creates
   unbalanced conditions. In order to avoid these oscillations, a novel
   master controller for assigning the slow set points to the inverters is
   proposed, so that the interdependence between unbalanced phases is
   accounted for. Oscillations can also occur due to the lack of a master
   controller to ensure the existence of an equilibrium or even as a result
   of inaccurate power set points used by droop-based controllers. Finally,
   even the very fast power electronic dynamics, which are usually assumed
   to be instantaneous in literature, may cause high frequency
   instabilities because the power electronics are not an ideal power
   source and have stability and switch saturation limits.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are considered as flexible loads since
   their charging schedules can be shifted over the course of a day without
   impacting drivers' mobility. This property can be exploited to reduce
   charging costs and adverse network impacts. The increasing number of
   PEVs makes the use of distributed charging coordinating strategies
   preferable to centralized ones. In this paper, we propose an agent-based
   method which enables a fully distributed solution of the PEVs'
   Coordinated Charging (PEV-CC) problem. This problem aims at coordinating
   the charging schedules of a fleet of PEVs to minimize costs of serving
   demand subject to individual PEV constraints originating from battery
   limitations and charging infrastructure characteristics. In our proposed
   approach, each PEV's charging station is considered as an agent that is
   equipped with communication and computation capabilities. Our
   multi-agent approach is an iterative procedure which finds a distributed
   solution for the first order optimality conditions of the underlying
   optimization problem through local computations and limited information
   exchange with neighboring agents. In particular, the updates for each
   agent incorporate local information such as the Lagrange multipliers, as
   well as enforcing the local PEV's constraints as local innovation terms.
   Finally, the performance of our proposed algorithm is evaluated on a
   fleet of 100 PEVs as a test case, and the results are compared with the
   centralized solution of the PEV-CC problem.}},

   physical barriers such as walls, tree stands, and shrubs. Numerical
   simulation tools can be very useful to investigate the effectiveness of
   these barriers in mitigating air pollution. In the present work, a
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) solver is used to predict filtration of UFP by
   vegetation. The RANS equations for turbulent flow are combined with a
   dry deposition velocity model and three different wake turbulence
   models. Reasonably good predictions of pressure drop across the
   vegetation and particle penetration efficiency are obtained when
   compared with available wind tunnel experiments for high leaf area
   density (LAD) in the range 69-263 m(2)/m(3). It is found that the model
   predictions are sensitive to the choice of wake turbulence model and
   certain model parameters. The model predictions also suggest that thin
   roadside vegetation with local LAD <= 5 m(2)/m(3) is only partially
   effective in filtering UFP, especially when the vegetation thickness is
   less than 10 m along the direction of the wind.}},

Title = {{Global combustion sources of organic aerosols: model comparison with 84

Abstract = {{Emissions of organic compounds from biomass, biofuel, and fossil fuel
   combustion strongly influence the global atmospheric aerosol load. Some
   of the organics are directly released as primary organic aerosol (POA).
   Most are emitted in the gas phase and undergo chemical transformations
   (i.e., oxidation by hydroxyl radical) and form secondary organic aerosol
   (SOA). In this work we use the global chemistry climate model
   ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) with a computationally
   efficient module for the description of organic aerosol (OA) composition
   and evolution in the atmosphere (ORACLE). The tropospheric burden of
   open biomass and anthropogenic (fossil and biofuel) combustion particles
   is estimated to be 0.59 and 0.63 Tg, respectively, accounting for about
   30 and 32\% of the total tropospheric OA load. About 30\% of the open
   biomass burning and 10\% of the anthropogenic combustion aerosols
   originate from direct particle emissions, whereas the rest is formed in
   the atmosphere. A comprehensive data set of aerosol mass spectrometer
   (AMS) measurements along with factoranalysis results from 84 field
   campaigns across the Northern Hemisphere are used to evaluate the model
   results. Both the AMS observations and the model results suggest that
   over urban areas both POA (25-40 \%) and SOA (60-75 \%) contribute
   substantially to the overall OA mass, whereas further downwind and in
   rural areas the POA concentrations decrease substantially and SOA
   dominates (80-85 \%). EMAC does a reasonable job in reproducing POA and
   SOA levels during most of the year. However, it tends to underpredict
   POA and SOA concentrations during winter indicating that the model
   misses wintertime sources of OA (e.g., residential biofuel use) and SOA
   formation pathways (e.g., multiphase oxidation).}},

Abstract = {{Nonuniform discretizations of state and control profiles and model
   reduction arc essential to approximate discretized DAE systems, capture
   multiple time scales of the state profiles and reduce the size of
   nonlinear programming (NLP) subproblems for off-line optimal control
   problems. These discretizations are often dictated by dynamic
   characteristics that depend on the system application. However,
   nonuniform grids in Nonlinear MPC (NMPC), which we denote as input and
   state blocking strategies, may not lead to recursive feasibilit), a key
   property for nominal stability that follows directly with uniform grids.
   In this study, we analyze a class of NMPC blocking strategies and show
   that nominal stability and input-to-state stability (ISS) can be
   preserved with these formulations. These strategies are especially
   useful for large first principles models, as we demonstrate on a
   bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) process that captures CO2 from flue gas.
   With this case study we demonstrate that input and state blocking, along
   with model reduction, leads to accurate state profiles, nominal and
   robust stability, far less computation, and essentially the same NMPC
   performance as with uniform grids. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{A robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is proposed
   for batch processes with multiple types of uncertainties Recently,
   economic MPC (eMPC) has attracted significant attention, particularly
   for batch process control given its flexibility in the cost function

   in most batch processes. However, in the presence of various
   uncertainties such as parameter errors, external disturbances, and
   noise, performance of eMPC can deteriorate significantly as it tends to
   drive the system to limits of constraints. To achieve constraint
   satisfaction in the presence of common uncertainties, we propose a
   robust NMPC method based on multi-stage scenarios, state estimation; and
   back-off constraints. Performance of the proposed robust NMPC scheme is

Abstract = {{Estimation of slowly varying model parameters/unmeasured disturbances is
   of paramount importance in process monitoring, fault diagnosis, model
   based advanced control and online optimization. The conventional
   approach to estimate drifting parameters is to model them as a random
   walk process and estimate them simultaneously with the states. However,
   this may lead to a poorly conditioned problem, where the tuning of the
   random walk model becomes a non-trivial exercise. Recently, Huang et al.
   (2010) has proposed a novel moving window weighted least squares
   parameter estimation approach, which is capable of simultaneous
   estimation of states and slowly drifting parameters/unmeasured
   disturbances. The slowly drifting parameters are assumed to remain
   constant in a time window in the immediate past and are estimated by
   solving a constrained minimization problem formulated over the window.
   In this work, the moving window parameter estimator of Huang et al.
   (2010) is recast as a moving window maximum likelihood (ML) estimator.
   It is assumed that the innovation sequence generated by the DAE-EKF is a
   Gaussian white noise process and further used to construct a likelihood
   function that treats the drifting model parameters as unknowns. This
   leads to a well conditioned problem where the only tuning parameter is
   the length of the moving window, which is much easier to select than
   selecting the covariance of the random walk model. Efficacy of the
   proposed ML formulation has been demonstrated by conducting simulation
   studies on an ideal reactive distillation system. Analysis of the
   simulation results reveals that the proposed moving window ML estimator
   is capable of tracking the drifting unmeasured parameter fairly
   accurately using only the tray temperature measurements. (C) 2016, IFAC

Abstract = {{Solid sorbent-based CO, capture from flue gas provides a novel
   alternative to traditional solvent-based processes due to potentially
   lower energy consumption for regeneration. Optimal operation of such a
   gas-solid flow process requires an advanced control framework for
   efficient disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking. This work focuses
   on the development of computationally fast and accurate dynamic reduced
   models (D-RMs) and the application of these models to nonlinear model
   predictive control (NMPC) algorithms. TWO different types of D-RMs are
   developed: the first type is a data-driven model Where step-test data
   are utilized to generate the D-RM through the Decoupled A-B Net (DABNct)
   model, and the second type of D-RM is a temporal and spatial reduction
   of the original process model to improve its computational efficiency
   while still retaining its physics. Disturbance rejection and setpoint
   tracking characteristics of the NMPC and its computational performance
   are studied for both types of D-RMs. In addition, performance of both
   NMPC formulations arc compared with linear model predictive control
   (LMPC) formulations. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

   are stabilized provided the degrees of freedom (boundary conditions) are
   chosen appropriately,. The result is applied to the multi-component

   hold-up and pressure has a unique and stable steady state. However, a

Abstract = {{Traditionally, electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical
   polymerization (eATRP) is performed with Pt electrodes, but extensive
   use of such an expensive, rare, and non-functionalizable metal may pose
   some limitations to the method, owing mainly to the high cost of the
   experimental setup and the limited natural resources of platinum. As a
   further development of eATRP, polymerization of n-butyl acrylate in
   dimethylformamide was investigated employing different cathodic
   materials: glassy carbon, gold, iron, nickel-chromium, and stainless
   steel. With all these electrodes, eATRP was fast (conversion >85\% in 2
   h) and well-controlled (dispersity <1.2) under a wide range of
   experimental setups. To show the robustness of eATRP with inexpensive
   non-noble electrodes (i) the catalyst loading was reduced to less than
   75 ppm, (ii) the same cathode was reused several times without
   reactivation, and (iii) undivided cells with all non-platinum electrodes
   were used. Lastly, all electrodes were stable and did not significantly
   release metal ions in solution, merely acting as an electron sink for
   the reduction of the catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive investigation of new integrated circuit design and
   fabrication technologies is crucial for yielding reliable parts. Prior
   work proposed a novel logic characterization vehicle called the Carnegie
   Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV), and an implementation
   flow that ensures a test chip to be product-like with near optimal
   testability and diagnosability. This work describes an enhanced
   implementation methodology for CM-LCV that not only guarantees 100\%
   intracell defect testability for all standard cells but also reflects
   the user-specified design characteristics. Experiments comparing
   intra-cell defect testability between a CM-LCV and various benchmark
   circuits demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. Specifically, the
   CM-LCV achieves 92.4\% overall input pattern fault coverage and 100\%
   cell-aware fault coverage using an optimal, minimal test set.}},

Abstract = {{Heartbeat monitoring during sleep is critically important to ensuring
   the well-being of many people, ranging from patients to elderly.
   Technologies that support heartbeat monitoring should be unobtrusive,
   and thus solutions that are accurate and can he easily applied to
   existing beds is an important need that has been unfulfilled. We tackle
   the challenge of accurate, low-cost and easy to deploy heartbeat
   monitoring by investigating whether off-the-shelf analog geophone
   sensors can be used to detect heartbeats when installed under a bed.
   Geophones have the desirable property of being insensitive to
   lower-frequency movements, which lends itself to heartbeat monitoring as
   the heartbeat signal has harmonic frequencies that are easily captured
   by the geophone. At the same time, lower-frequency movements such as
   respiration, can be naturally filtered out by the geophone. With
   carefully-designed signal processing algorithms, we show it is possible
   to detect and extract heartbeats in the presence of environmental noise
   and other body movements a person may have during sleep.
   We have built a prototype sensor and conducted detailed experiments that
   involve 43 subjects (with IRB approval), which demonstrate that the
   geophone sensor is a compelling solution to long-term at-home heartbeat
   monitoring. We compared the average heartbeat rate estimated by our
   prototype and that reported by a pulse oximeter. The results revealed
   that the average error rate is around 1.30\% over 500 data samples when
   the subjects were still on the bed, and 3.87\% over 300 data samples
   when the subjects had different types of body movements while lying on
   the bed. We also deployed the prototype in the homes of 9 subjects for a
   total of 25 nights, and found that the average estimation error rate was
   8.25\% over more than 181 hours' data.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for communicating between a moving camera and
   an electronic display by embedding and recovering hidden, dynamic
   information within an image. A small intensity pattern is added to
   alternate frames of a time-varying display. A handheld camera pointed at
   the display can receive not only the display image, but also an
   underlying message. Differencing the camera-captured alternate frames
   leaves the small intensity pattern, but results in errors due to
   photometric effects that depend on camera pose. Detecting and robustly
   decoding the message requires careful photometric modeling for message
   recovery. The key innovation of our approach is an algorithm that
   performs simultaneous radiometric calibration and message recovery in
   one convex optimization problem. By modeling the photometry of the
   system using a camera-display transfer function (CDTF), we derive an
   optimal online radiometric calibration (OORC) for robust computational
   messaging as demonstrated with nine different commercial cameras and
   displays. The online radiometric calibration algorithms described in
   this paper significantly reduces message recovery errors, especially for
   low intensity messages and oblique camera angles.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosols directly affect the radiative balance of the Earth through the
   absorption and scattering of solar radiation. Although the contributions
   of absorption (heating) and scattering (cooling) of sunlight have proved
   difficult to quantify, the consensus is that anthropogenic aerosols cool
   the climate, partially offsetting the warming by rising greenhouse gas
   concentrations. Recent estimates of global direct anthropogenic aerosol
   radiative forcing (i.e., global radiative forcing due to
   aerosol-radiation interactions) are -0.35 +/- 0.5 W m(-2), and these
   estimates depend heavily on aerosol simulation. Here, we integrate a
   comprehensive suite of satellite and ground-based observations to
   constrain total aerosol optical depth (AOD), its fine-mode fraction, the
   vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds, and the collocation of
   clouds and overlying aerosols. We find that the direct fine-mode aerosol
   radiative effect is -0.46 W m(-2) (-0.54 to -0.39 W m(-2)). Fine-mode
   aerosols include sea salt and dust aerosols, and we find that these
   natural aerosols result in a very large cooling (-0.44 to -0.26 W m(-2))
   when constrained by observations. When the contribution of these natural
   aerosols is subtracted from the fine-mode radiative effect, the net
   becomes -0.11 (-0.28 to +0.05) W m(-2). This net arises from total
   (natural C anthropogenic) carbonaceous, sulfate and nitrate aerosols,
   which suggests that global direct anthropogenic aerosol radiative
   forcing is less negative than -0.35 W m(-2).}},

Abstract = {{``Clad steel{''} refers to a thick carbon steel structural plate bonded
   to a corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) plate, such as stainless steel or
   titanium, and is widely used in industry to construct pressure vessels.
   The CRA resists the chemically aggressive environment on the interior,
   but cannot prevent the development of corrosion losses and cracks that
   limit the continued safe operation of such vessels. At present there are
   no practical methods to detect such defects from the exposed outer
   surface of the thick carbon steel plate, often necessitating removing
   such vessels from service and inspecting them visually from the
   interior. In previous research, sponsored by industry to detect and
   localize damage in pressurized piping systems under operational and
   environmental changes, we investigated a number of data-driven signal
   processing methods to extract damage information from ultrasonic guided
   wave pitch-catch records. We now apply those methods to relatively large
   clad steel plate specimens. We study a sparse array of wafer-type
   ultrasonic transducers adhered to the carbon steel surface, attempting
   to localize mass scatterers grease-coupled to the stainless steel
   surface. We discuss conditions under which localization is achieved by
   relatively simple first-arrival methods, and other conditions for which
   data-driven methods are needed; we also discuss observations of
   plate-like mode properties implied by these results.}},

Abstract = {{In ultrasonic structural health monitoring (SHM), environmental and
   operational conditions, especially temperature, can significantly affect
   the propagation of ultrasonic waves and thus degrade damage detection.
   Typically, temperature effects are compensated using optimal baseline
   selection (OBS) or optimal signal stretch (OSS). The OSS method achieves
   compensation by adjusting phase shifts caused by temperature, but it
   does not fully compensate phase shifts and it does not compensate for
   accompanying signal amplitude changes. In this paper, we develop a new
   temperature compensation strategy to address both phase shifts and
   amplitude changes. In this strategy, OSS is first used to compensate
   some of the phase shifts and to quantify the temperature effects by
   stretching factors. Based on stretching factors, empirical adjusting
   factors for a damage indicator are then applied to compensate for the
   temperature induced remaining phase shifts and amplitude changes. The
   empirical adjusting factors can be trained from baseline data with
   temperature variations in the absence of incremental damage. We applied
   this temperature compensation approach to detect volume loss in a thick
   wall aluminum tube with multiple damage levels and temperature
   variations. Our specimen is a thick-walled short tube, with dimensions
   closely comparable to the outlet region of a frac iron elbow where
   flow-induced erosion produces the volume loss that governs the service
   life of that component, and our experimental sequence simulates the
   erosion process by removing material in small damage steps. Our results
   show that damage detection is greatly improved when this new temperature
   compensation strategy, termed modified-OSS, is implemented.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to characterize frequency-dependent wave
   propagation of footstep induced floor vibration to improve robustness of
   vibration-based occupant localization. Occupant localization is an
   essential part of many smart structure applications (e.g., energy
   management, patient/customer tracking, etc.). Existing techniques
   include visual (e.g. cameras and IR sensors), acoustic, RF, and
   load-based approaches. These approaches have many deployment and
   operational requirements that limits their adaptation. To overcome these
   limitations, prior work has utilized footstep-induced vibrations to
   allow sparse sensor configuration and non-intrusive detection. However,
   frequency dependent propagation characteristics and low signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) of footstep-induced vibrations change the shape of the
   signal. Furthermore, estimating the wave propa- gation velocity for
   forming the multilateration equations and localizing the footsteps is a
   challenging task. They, in turn, lead to large errors of localization.
   In this paper, we present a structural vibration based indoor occupant
   localization technique using improved time-difference-of-arrival between
   multiple vibration sensors. In particular we overcome signal distortion
   by decomposing the signal into frequency components and focusing on high
   energy components for accurate indoor localization. Such decomposition
   leverages the frequency-specific propagation characteristics and reduces
   the ect of low SNR (by choosing the components of highest energy).
   Furthermore, we develop a velocity calibration method that finds the
   optimal velocity which minimizes the localization error. We validate our
   approach through field experiments in a building with human
   participants. We are able to achieve an average localization error of
   less than 0.21 meters, which corresponds to a 13X reduction in error
   when compared to the baseline method using raw data.}},

Abstract = {{The number of people passing through different indoor areas is useful in
   various smart structure applications, including occupancy-based building
   energy/space management, marketing research, security, etc. Existing
   approaches to estimate occupant traffic include vision-, sound-, and
   radio-based (mobile) sensing methods, which have placement limitations
   (e.g., requirement of line-of-sight, quiet environment, carrying a
   device all the time). Such limitations make these direct sensing
   approaches difficult to deploy and maintain. An indirect approach using
   geophones to measure floor vibration induced by footsteps can be
   utilized. However, the main challenge lies in distinguishing multiple
   simultaneous walkers by developing features that can effectively
   represent the number of mixed signals and characterize the selected
   features under different traffic conditions.
   This paper presents a method to monitor multiple persons. Once the
   vibration signals are obtained, features are extracted to describe the
   overlapping vibration signals induced by multiple footsteps, which are
   used for occupancy traffic estimation. In particular, we focus on
   analysis of the efficiency and limitations of the four selected key
   features when used for estimating various traffic conditions. We
   characterize these features with signals collected from controlled
   impulse load tests as well as from multiple people walking through a
   real-world sensing area. In our experiments, the system achieves the
   mean estimation error of +/- 0.2 people for different occupant traffic
   conditions (from one to four) using k-nearest neighbor classifier.}},

Abstract = {{We report a mathematical model for ion transport and electrical
   impedance in zwitterionic hydrogels, which possess acidic and basic
   functional groups that carry a net charge at a pH not equal to the
   isoelectric point. Such hydrogels can act as an electro-mechanical
   interface between a relatively hard biosensor and soft tissue in the
   body. For this application, the electrical impedance of the hydrogel
   must be characterized to ensure that ion transport to the biosensor is
   not significantly hindered. The electrical impedance is the ratio of the
   applied voltage to the measured current. We consider a simple model
   system, wherein an oscillating voltage is applied across a hydrogel
   immersed in electrolyte and sandwiched between parallel, blocking
   electrodes. We employ the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations coupled
   with acid-base dissociation reactions for the charge on the hydrogel
   backbone to model the ionic transport across the hydrogel. The
   electrical impedance is calculated from the numerical solution to the
   PNP equations and subsequently analyzed via an equivalent circuit model
   to extract the hydrogel capacitance, resistance, and the capacitance of
   electrical double layers at the electrode-hydrogel interface. For
   example, we predict that an increase in pH from the isoelectric point,
   pH = 6.4 for a model PCBMA hydrogel, to pH = 8 reduces the resistance of
   the hydrogel by similar to 40\% and increases the double layer
   capacitance by similar to 250\% at an electrolyte concentration of 0.1
   mM. The significant impact of charged hydrogel functional groups to the
   impedance is damped at higher electrolyte concentration.}},

Title = {{Insoluble layer deposition and dilatational rheology at a microscale
   spherical cap interface}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{7038-7055}},
Abstract = {{The dilatational properties of insoluble monolayers are important for
   understanding the mechanics of biological systems and consumer products,
   but isolating the dilatational response of an interface is challenging
   due to the difficulties in separating dilatation from shear and other
   deformation modes. Oscillations of a microscale bubble radius are useful
   for generating purely dilatational flows, but the current deposition
   methods for insoluble layers onto fluid interfaces are not easily scaled
   down. In this paper, we describe a miscible solvent exchange procedure
   for generating insoluble layers at an air-water interface pinned at the
   tip of a capillary tens of micrometers in diameter. We show that the
   amount of surfactant adsorbed at the interface can be controlled by the
   initial concentration dissolved in isopropanol (the starting solvent)
   and the volumetric flow rate of solvent exchange. Surface pressure-area
   isotherms and dilatational moduli are measured concurrently for three
   insoluble surfactants: palmitic acid (PA),
   dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
   (DPPC). The isotherms measured on the microscale interface compare well
   with previous experiments performed on a Langmuir trough. However, the
   magnitudes of the dilatational moduli differ from those measured on
   either Langmuir trough or pendant drop apparatuses. Several possible
   reasons for the observed differences are discussed. A comparison of the
   dilatational modulus with the Gibbs elasticity is used to determine the
   presence of dilatational extra stresses at the interface. The isotherm
   and dilatational modulus of the insoluble component of the industrial
   surfactant Tween 80 are measured using this approach. The methods
   developed here also open the possibility for future study of the
   important role of finite size effects on microstructure formation and
   the resulting interfacial mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present an occupant detection method
   through step-induced structural vibration. Occupant detection enables
   various smart building applications such as space/energy management.
   Ambient structural vibration monitoring provides a non-intrusive sensing
   approach to achieve that. The main challenges for structural vibration
   based occupant footstep detection include that (1) the ambient
   structural vibration noise may overwhelm the step-induced vibration and
   (2) there are various other impulse-like excitations that look similar
   to footstep excitations in the sensing environment (e.g., door closing,
   chair dragging, etc.), which increase the false alarm rate for occupant
   detection. To overcome these challenges, a two-stage step-induced signal
   detection algorithm is developed to (1) incorporate the structural
   characteristics by selecting the dominant frequencies of the structure
   to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the vibration data and thus
   improve the detection performance and (2) perform footstep
   classification on detected events to distinguish step-induced floor
   vibrations from other impulse excitations. The method is validated
   experimentally in two different buildings with distinct structural
   properties and noise characteristics, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
   campus building and Vincentian Nursing Home deployments in Pittsburgh,
   PA. The occupant footstep detection F1 score shows up to 4X reduction in
   detection error compared to traditional thresholding method.}},

   during a four-month long course. With more than 25 years of use, the
   last 20 years in a formal class setting, the methodology has proven
   robust in creating increasingly capable applications leveraging
   state-of-the-art components. For example, wireless technology bandwidth
   increased by over four orders of magnitude during the course. UICSM is
   web-supported and defines intermediary products that document the
   evolution of the design. These products are posted on the web so that
   even remote designers and end-users can participate in the design
   activities. The design methodology proceeds through three phases:
   conceptual design, detailed design and implementation. End-users
   critique the design at each phase. In addition, simulated and real
   application tasks provide further focus for design evaluation. The
   methodology has been used in designing more than three dozen computer

   range transport of secondary PM from sources located hundreds of
   kilometres from the cities is becoming a bigger contributor to the urban
   PM levels in all seasons. ``Non-traditional{''} sources including
   cooking, and residential and agricultural biomass burning contribute an
   increasing fraction of the now reduced fine PM levels. Atmospheric
   chemistry is found to change the chemical signatures of a number of
   these sources relatively fast both during the day and night,
   complicating the corresponding source apportionment.}},

Abstract = {{New opportunities in design often surface with scientific advances,
   however, the rapid pace of scientific findings in biological domains,
   and their complexity, may impede effective technological design. This
   paper addresses such challenges through weaving phases of scientific
   discovery, analytical description, and technological design in an
   integrative ``d(3) Methodology.{''} The method is implemented using
   human-guided automated processes developed with cognitive-based
   considerations. A case study of designing myosin bio-libraries is
   specifically investigated, and optimization results suggest that
   bio-libraries of designed synthetic isoforms have advantages over
   natural isoforms. The findings are motivating for future scientific
   endeavors to investigate the benefits of designed myosins, thus
   demonstrating reciprocity among design and science. The successes in
   implementing each d(3) phase suggests the methodology is a feasible
   approach for nanoscale biosystems design, and is well-suited for driving
   the scientific inquiries of today towards the novel technologies of
   tomorrow.}},

Abstract = {{Novel design methodologies are often evaluated through empirical studies
   involving human designers. However, such empirical studies can incur a
   high personnel cost. Further, it can be difficult to isolate the effects
   of specific team or individual characteristics. These limitations could
   be bypassed by employing a computational model of design teams. This
   work introduces the Cognitively-Inspired Simulated Annealing Teams
   (CISAT) modeling framework, an agent-based platform that provides a
   means for efficiently simulating human design teams. A number of
   empirically demonstrated cognitive phenomena are modeled within the
   platform, striking a balance between model simplicity and direct
   applicability to engineering design problems. This paper discusses the
   composition of the CISAT modeling framework and demonstrates how it can
   be used to simulate the performance of human design teams in a cognitive
   study. Results simulated with CISAT are compared directly to the results
   derived from human designers. Finally, the CISAT model is also used to
   investigate the characteristics that were most and least helpful to
   teams during the cognitive study.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{6184-6195}},
Abstract = {{We investigate mismatch strain driven programmable shape transformation
   of spherical domes and report the effects of different geometric and
   structural characteristics on dome behavior in response to applied
   mismatch strain. We envision a bilayer dome design where the
   differential swelling of the inner layer with respect to the passive
   outer layer in response to changes in dome surroundings (such as the
   introduction of an organic solvent) introduces mismatch strain within
   the bilayer system and causes dome shape transformation. Finite element
   analysis reveals that, in addition to snap-through, spherical domes
   undergo bifurcation buckling and eventually gradual bending to morph
   into cylinders with increasing mismatch strain. Besides demonstrating
   how the snap-through energy barrier depends on the spherical dome shape,
   our analysis identifies three distinct groups of dome geometries based
   on their mismatch strain-transformed configuration relationships. Our
   experiments with polymer-based elastic bilayer domes that exhibit
   differential swelling in organic solvents qualitatively confirm the
   finite element predictions. We establish that, in addition to externally
   applied stimuli (mismatch strain), bilayer spherical dome morphing can
   be tuned and hence programmed through its geometry and structural
   characteristics. Incorporation of an elastic instability mechanism such
   as snap-through within the framework of stimuli-responsive functional
   devices can improve their response time which is otherwise controlled by
   diffusion. Hence, our proposed design guidelines can be used to realize
   deployable, multi-functional, reconfigurable, and therefore, adaptive
   structures responsive to a diverse set of stimuli across multiple length
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Complex systems are challenging to design, particularly because of
   multi-level organizations that lead to non-obvious relationships among
   design components. One aspect of that challenge is how to effectively
   present complex information to the user for systems with multiple levels
   of organization. Two contrasting design graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
   were developed to aid multi-level biosystem design: a GUI with feedback
   via performance charts that emphasized learning of parametric
   relationships, and a GUI with feedback via agent-based animations that
   emphasized learning of inter-level causalities. The effectiveness of
   these interfaces is compared through assessing the design proficiency of
   human users for optimization design tasks. Results from user
   interactions with the interfaces demonstrated that users with both
   interfaces improved on pre-/post-learning design tasks, and users that
   demonstrated an understanding of inter-level causal relationships had
   greater improvement. However, only users with the animations interface
   tended to learn inter-level causal relationships. All users were then
   presented contrasting animations of systems with opposing emergent
   system behaviors, resulting in many more participants demonstrating an
   understanding of inter-level causal behaviors. These findings reveal the
   usefulness of interactive software tools for supporting engineers in
   overcoming challenges of complex systems design. Particularly, that
   successful design of complex systems requires unique reasoning skills
   that are informed by knowing how system components relate across levels,
   and specialized interfaces with animations provide information necessary
   for the learning these relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional interconnected honeycomb-like porous carbon (IHPC-800)
   is successfully fabricated via activated and graphitized plane tree
   fluff with the aid of Co2+ and KOH in a synthetic process at 800 degrees

   for application in supercapacitors (SCs), including interconnected
   pathways, high specific surface area (1154 m(2) g(-1)), large pore
   volume (0.78 cm(3) g(-1)), heteroatom doping, and full graphitization.
   This material possesses a very high charge storage capacity with a
   specific capacitance of 493 F g(-1) in 2 M H2SO4 in a three-electrode
   system at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1). It exhibits excellent cycle
   stability, even over 10 000 cycles with a capacity retention of more
   than 96\%. The energy density of 42.8 W h kg(-1) is also verified with 1
   M LiPF6 in EC/DEC as the organic electrolyte at a power density of 299 W

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{63}},
Pages = {{57773-57779}},
Abstract = {{Phagraphene is a novel 2D carbon allotrope with interesting electronic
   properties which has been recently theoretically proposed. Phagraphene
   is similar to a defective graphene structure with an arrangement of
   pentagonal, heptagonal and hexagonal rings. In this study we investigate
   the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of phagraphene using
   molecular dynamics simulations. Using the non-equilibrium molecular
   dynamics method, we found the thermal conductivity of phagraphene to be
   anisotropic, with room temperature values of 218 +/- 20 W m(-1) K-1
   along the armchair direction and 285 +/- 29 W m(-1) K-1 along the zigzag
   direction. Both values are one order of magnitude smaller than for
   pristine graphene. The analysis of the phonon group velocities also
   shows a significant reduction in this quantity for phagraphene in
   comparison to graphene. By performing uniaxial tensile simulations, we
   studied the deformation process and mechanical response of phagraphene.
   We found that phagraphene exhibits a remarkable high tensile strength
   around 85 +/- 2 GPa, whereas its elastic modulus is also anisotropic
   along the in-plane directions, with values of 870 +/- 15 GPa and 800 +/-
   14 GPa for the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The lower
   thermal conductivity of phagraphene along with its predicted electronic
   properties suggests that it could be a better candidate than graphene in
   future carbon-based thermoelectric devices.}},

Abstract = {{A probabilistic framework for Bayesian inference combined with extreme
   values of Gaussian processes is proposed to assess the maximum of the
   response of an uncertain structure instrumented with sensors and subject
   to a stochastic load. The framework is applied to the analysis of the
   inter-story drift of a multi-story shear-type building under seismic
   hazard using measurements collected by accelerometers. A cascade of two
   dynamic systems is proposed to model the stochastic ground motion and
   the response of the structure. We present an approximate analytical
   solution to estimate the distribution of the maximum response, and
   verify the accuracy and limitations of this solution against simulation
   results. Finally, robustness of the proposed framework to system
   uncertainties, including uncertainties in the structural
   characteristics, ground characteristics, and input motion parameters, is
   investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend the basic edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi
   tessellation (EWCVT) for image segmentation to a new advanced model,
   namely harmonic edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (HEWCVT).
   This extended model introduces a harmonic form of clustering energy by
   combining the image intensity with cluster boundary information.
   Improving upon the classic centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) and
   EWCVT methods, the HEWCVT algorithm can not only overcome the
   sensitivity to the seed point initialisation and noise, but also improve
   the accuracy and stability of clustering results, as verified in several
   types of images. We then present an adaptive superpixel generation
   algorithm based on HEWCVT. First, an innovative initial seed sampling
   method based on quadtree decomposition is introduced, and the image is
   divided into small adaptive segments according to a density function.
   Then, the local HEWCVT algorithm is applied to generate adaptive
   superpixels. The presented algorithm is capable of generating adaptive
   superpixels while preserving local image features efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{The eigen-modes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) applied to
   triangulated three-dimensional (3D) surface geometries have been shown
   to be effective parametric representations of overall shape and
   structural detail, which may constitute promising feature spaces for
   statistical shape comparison. The objective of this study is to explore
   a Laplace spectral-matching approach to compare pairs of similar 3D
   surface geometries using their respective Laplace spectral
   representations, obtained from the LBO or the graph Laplacian of the
   distributed points over each surface manifold. We demonstrate the
   efficacy of a greedy algorithm for appropriate selection of a set of
   Laplacian eigen-mode shape descriptors, while resolving their respective
   sign ambiguities, for optimal shape matching. We test our algorithm on
   three pairs of experimental shapes, as well as three sets of clinically
   relevant test geometries, i.e. surface models of two similar
   patient-specific models of the left atrial appendage of the atrial
   chamber of the heart, several pairs of patient-specific models of the
   left ventricular chamber of the heart functioning over the cardiac
   cycle, as well as a pair of similar coronary artery geometries. We also
   explore the relationship between accuracy of spectral shape matching and
   mesh refinement of compared geometries. Our results demonstrate good
   spectral matching efficacy for pairs of geometries, which differ only in
   terms of affine transformations relative to each other, but additionally
   illustrate the method's potential for biomedical applications such as
   shape-based patient information retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been widely
   used to build flat-panel X-ray detectors for digital radiography (DR).
   As the demand for low-dose X-ray imaging grows, a detector with high
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) pixel architecture emerges. ``Smart{''}
   pixel is intended to use a dual-gate photosensitive TFT for sensing,
   storage, and switch. It differs from a conventional passive pixel sensor
   (PPS) and active pixel sensor (APS) in that all these three functions
   are combined into one device instead of three separate units in a pixel.
   Thus, it is expected to have high fill factor and high spatial
   resolution. In addition, it utilizes the amplification effect of the
   dual-gate photosensitive TFT to foul' a one-transistor APS that leads to
   a potentially high SNR. This paper addresses the design, optimization
   and evaluation of the smart pixel sensor and array for low-dose DR. We
   will design and optimize the smart pixel from the scintillator to TFT
   levels and validate it through optical and electrical simulation and
   experiments of a 4x4 sensor array.}},

Title = {{Enhancing radiative energy transfer through thermal extraction}},
Journal = {{NANOPHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thermal radiation plays an increasingly important role in many emerging
   energy technologies, such as thermophotovoltaics, passive radiative
   cooling and wearable cooling clothes {[}1]. One of the fundamental
   constraints in thermal radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which
   limits the maximum power of far-field radiation to P-0 = sigma(TS)-S-4,
   where sigma is the Boltzmann constant, S and T are the area and the
   temperature of the emitter, respectively (Fig. 1a). In order to overcome
   this limit, it has been shown that near-field radiations could have an
   energy density that is orders of magnitude greater than the
   Stefan-Boltzmann law {[}2-7]. Unfortunately, such near-field radiation
   transfer is spatially confined and cannot carry radiative heat to the
   far field. Recently, a new concept of thermal extraction was proposed
   {[}8] to enhance far-field thermal emission, which, conceptually,
   operates on a principle similar to oil immersion lenses and light
   extraction in light-emitting diodes using solid immersion lens to
   increase light output {[}62]. Thermal extraction allows a black-body to
   radiate more energy to the far field than the apparent limit of the
   Stefan-Boltzmann law without breaking the second law of thermodynamics.
   Thermal extraction works by using a specially designed thermal extractor
   to convert and guide the near-field energy to the far field, as shown in
   Fig. 1b. The same blackbody as shown in Fig. 1a is placed closely below
   the thermal extractor with a spacing smaller than the thermal
   wavelength. The near-field coupling transfers radiative energy with a
   density greater than sigma T-4. The thermal extractor, made from
   transparent and high-index or structured materials, does not emit or
   absorb any radiation. It transforms the near-field energy and sends it
   toward the far field. As a result, the total amount of far-field
   radiative heat dissipated by the same blackbody is greatly enhanced
   above S sigma T-4, where S is the area of the emitter. This paper will
   review the progress in thermal extraction. It is organized as follows.
   In Section 1, we will discuss the theory of thermal extraction {[}8]. In
   Section 2, we review an experimental implementation based on natural
   materials as the thermal extractor {[}8]. Lastly, in Section 3, we
   review the experiment that uses structured metamaterials as thermal
   extractors to enhance optical density of states and far-field emission
   {[}9].}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to test the impact of a plasma-based,
   material (PBM) impregnated with amiodarone on atrial electrophysiology
   and atrial fibrillation susceptibility in a porcine post-cardiac surgery
   model.
   Methods: Ten healthy pigs underwent implantation of transvenous pacing
   systems, after which sterile talc was infused into the pericardial sac
   via a pericardiotomy. In five animals, PBM was applied to the atrial
   epicardial surface just before talc infusion. Electrophysiologic
   evaluations were performed using the pacing system immediately after
   chest closure and 7 days later. Atrial histologic evaluations were
   performed.
   Results: Immediately after chest closure, there were no significant
   differences in electrophysiologic parameters between talc-only and talc
   + PBM animals, and atrial fibrillation was largely noninducible. On
   postsurgical day 7, electrophysiologic evaluation revealed significantly
   shorter sinus cycle length and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness
   among talc-only animals relative to talc + PBM animals, possibly
   suggesting attenuated sympathetic nervous system activation in the
   latter. Atrial fibrillation inducibility and duration were significantly
   greater among talc-only animals. No significant differences in atrial
   refractoriness or conduction time between groups were apparent.
   Histologic evaluation revealed a relative reduction in epicardial
   inflammation and less myolysis among talc + PBM animals.
   Conclusions: Epicardial application of a plasma-based,
   amiodarone-impregnated material was associated with a significant
   reduction in atrial inflammation and susceptibility to fibrillation.}},

   introduces classes of macromolecules of interest in the field of
   environmental nanotechnology. Methods to characterize adsorbed
   macromolecules on ENMs are presented along with their limitations for
   ENMs in natural systems. Finally, the current state of knowledge
   regarding the effects of attached organic macromolecules, both
   engineered and incidental, on the environmental fate and reactivity of
   ENMs is critically reviewed. These concepts in whole are synthesized to
   identify the fundamental gaps in understanding and metrology that must
   be addressed to improve our mechanistic understanding of the effects of
   organic macromolecules on ENM environmental fate, and approaches to
   correlate the properties of coated ENMs to their environmental fate are
   discussed. We postulate that a first principles approach to modeling
   ENM-macromolecule interactions is not warranted, particularly for
   complex and heterogeneous natural macromolecules. On the other hand, a
   mechanistic understanding is needed to inform parameter selection for
   empirical correlations, which may offer tractable alternatives to
   predicting the behavior of macromolecule-coated ENMs. Development of
   these empirical correlations and prediction of the long-term fate of
   ENMs is currently hampered by incomplete characterization of the
   adsorbed macromolecule layer properties and their evolution over time in
   natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Three variants of multi-threaded IC3 are presented. Each variant has a
   fixed number of IC3s running in parallel, and communicating by sharing
   lemmas. They differ in the degree of synchronization between threads,
   and the aggressiveness with which proofs are checked. The correctness of
   all three variants is shown. The variants have unpredictable runtime. On
   the same input, the time to find the solution over different runs varies
   randomly depending on the thread interleaving. The use of a portfolio of
   solvers to maximize the likelihood of a quick solution is investigated.
   Using the Extreme Value theorem, the runtime of each variant, as well as
   their portfolios is analyzed statistically. A formula for the portfolio
   size needed to achieve a verification time with high probability is
   derived, and validated empirically. Using a portfolio of 20 parallel
   IC3s, speedups over 300 are observed compared to the sequential IC3 on
   hardware model checking competition examples. The use of parameter
   sweeping to implement a solver that performs well over a wide range of
   problems with unknown ``hardness{''} is investigated.}},

Title = {{How should the completeness and quality of curated nanomaterial data be

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is of increasing significance. Curation of nanomaterial
   data into electronic databases offers opportunities to better understand
   and predict nanomaterials' behaviour. This supports innovation in, and
   regulation of, nanotechnology. It is commonly understood that curated
   data need to be sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality to serve
   their intended purpose. However, assessing data completeness and quality
   is non-trivial in general and is arguably especially difficult in the
   nanoscience area, given its highly multidisciplinary nature. The current
   article, part of the Nanomaterial Data Curation Initiative series,
   addresses how to assess the completeness and quality of (curated)
   nanomaterial data. In order to address this key challenge, a variety of
   related issues are discussed: the meaning and importance of data
   completeness and quality, existing approaches to their assessment and
   the key challenges associated with evaluating the completeness and
   quality of curated nanomaterial data. Considerations which are specific
   to the nanoscience area and lessons which can be learned from other
   relevant scientific disciplines are considered. Hence, the scope of this
   discussion ranges from physicochemical characterisation requirements for
   nanomaterials and interference of nanomaterials with nanotoxicology
   assays to broader issues such as minimum information checklists,
   toxicology data quality schemes and computational approaches that
   facilitate evaluation of the completeness and quality of (curated) data.
   This discussion is informed by a literature review and a survey of key
   nanomaterial data curation stakeholders. Finally, drawing upon this
   discussion, recommendations are presented concerning the central
   question: how should the completeness and quality of curated
   nanomaterial data be evaluated?}},

Abstract = {{We use a three-dimensional regional chemical transport model (PMCAMx)
   with high grid resolution and high-resolution emissions (4 x 4 km(2))
   over the Paris greater area to simulate the formation of carbonaceous
   aerosol during a summer (July 2009) and a winter (January/February 2010)
   period as part of the MEGAPOLI (megacities: emissions, urban, regional,
   and global atmospheric pollution and climate effects, and Integrated
   tools for assessment and mitigation) campaigns. Model predictions of
   carbonaceous aerosol are compared against Aerodyne aerosol mass
   spectrometer and black carbon (BC) high time resolution measurements
   from three ground sites. PMCAMx predicts BC concentrations reasonably
   well reproducing the majority (70aEuro-\%) of the hourly data within a
   factor of two during both periods. The agreement for the summertime
   secondary organic aerosol (OA) concentrations is also encouraging (mean
   bias = 0.1 A mu g m(-3)) during a photochemically intense period. The
   model tends to underpredict the summertime primary OA concentrations in
   the Paris greater area (by approximately 0.8 A mu g m(-3)) mainly due to
   missing primary OA emissions from cooking activities. The total cooking
   emissions are estimated to be approximately 80 mg d(-1) per capita and
   have a distinct diurnal profile in which 50 \% of the daily cooking OA
   is emitted during lunch time (12:00-14:00 LT) and 20 \% during dinner
   time (20:00-22:00 LT). Results also show a large underestimation of
   secondary OA in the Paris greater area during wintertime (mean bias =
   aEuro-a'2.3 A mu g m(-3)) pointing towards a secondary OA formation
   process during low photochemical activity periods that is not simulated
   in the model.}},

Title = {{Tailoring structure formation and mechanical properties of particle
   brush solids via homopolymer addition}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{17-30}},
Abstract = {{Recent progress in the area of surface-initiated controlled radical
   polymerization (SI-CRP) has enabled the synthesis of polymer-grafted
   colloids with precise control over the architecture of grafted chains.
   The resulting `particle brush materials' are of interest both from a
   fundamental as well as applied perspective because structural
   frustrations (associated with the tethering of chains to a curved
   surface) imply a sensitive dependence of the interactions between brush
   particles on the architecture of surfacetethered chains that offers new
   opportunities to design hybrid materials with novel functionalities. An
   important prerequisite for establishing structure-property relations in
   particle brush materials is to understand the role of homopolymer
   impurities that form, for example, by thermal self-initiation. This
   contribution presents a detailed discussion of the role of homopolymer
   additives on the structure and mechanical properties of particle brush
   materials. The results suggest that the dissolution of homopolymer
   fillers follows a two-step mechanism comprised of the initial
   segregation of homopolymer to the interstitial regions within the array
   and the subsequent swelling of the particle brush (depending on the
   respective degree of polymerization of brush and linear chains).
   Addition of even small amounts of homopolymer is found to significantly
   increase the fracture toughness of particle brush assembly structures.
   The increased resistance to failure could enable the synthesis of robust
   colloidal crystal type materials that can be processed into complex
   shapes using `classical' polymer forming techniques such as molding or
   extrusion.}},

Abstract = {{Application of shear stress has been shown to unidirectionally orient
   the microstructures of block copolymers and polymer blends. In the
   present work, we study the phase separation of a novel nanoparticle
   (NP)-polymer blend thin film system under shear using a soft-shear
   dynamic zone annealing (DZA-SS) method. The nanoparticles are densely
   grafted with polymer chains of chemically dissimilar composition from
   the matrix polymer, which induces phase separation upon thermal
   annealing into concentrated nanoparticle domains. We systematically
   examine the influence of DZA-SS translation speed and thus the effective
   shear rate on nanoparticle domain elongation and compare this with the
   counterpart binary polymer blend behavior. Unidirectionally aligned
   nanoparticle string-domains are fabricated in the presence of soft-shear
   in confined thin film geometry. We expect this DZA-SS method to be
   applicable to various NP-polymer blends towards unidirectionally aligned
   nanoparticle structures, which are important to functional nanoparticle
   structure fabrication.}},

Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{435-454}},
Abstract = {{Water soluble poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene
   oxide) {[}PEO-PPO-PEO] triblock copolymers self-assemble into
   thermoreversible micellar crystals comprised of periodically spaced
   micelles. The micelles have PPO cores surrounded by hydrated PEO coronas
   and the dimensions of the unit cell of the organized micelles is on the
   order of several to tens of nanometers. Fluorescence recovery after
   photobleaching (FRAP) is used to quantify nanoparticle transport in
   these nanostructured polymer micelle systems. Diffusivity of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA, D-h similar to 7 nm) is quantified across a wide
   range of polymer, or micelle, concentrations covering both the
   disordered fluid as well as the structured micellar crystal to
   understand the effects of nanoscale structure on particle transport.
   Measured particle diffusivity in these micellar systems is reduced by as
   much as four orders of magnitude when compared to diffusivity in free
   solution. Diffusivity in the disordered micellar fluid is best
   understood in terms of diffusion through a polymeric solution, while
   transport in the structured micellar phase is possibly due to hopping
   between interstitial sites. These results not only show that the
   nanoscale structures of the micelles have a measureable impact on
   particle diffusivity, but also demonstrate the ability to tune nanoscale
   transport in self-assembled materials.}},

Title = {{Evolution of the Annealing Twin Density during delta-Supersolvus Grain
   Growth in the Nickel-Based Superalloy Inconel (TM) 718}},
Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Grain growth experiments were performed on Inconel (TM) 718 to
   investigate the possible correlation of the annealing twin density with
   grain size and with annealing temperature. Those experiments were
   conducted at different temperatures in the delta supersolvus domain and
   under such conditions that only capillarity forces were involved in the
   grain boundary migration process. In the investigated range, there is a
   strong inverse correlation of the twin density with the average grain
   size. On the other hand, the twin density at a given average grain size
   is not sensitive to annealing temperature. Consistent with previous
   results for pure nickel, the twin density evolution in Inconel (TM) 718
   is likely to be mainly controlled by the propagation of the pre-existing
   twins of the growing grains; i.e., the largest ones of the initial
   microstructure. Almost no new twin boundaries are created during the
   grain growth process itself. Therefore, the twin density at a given
   average grain size is mainly dependent on the twin density in the
   largest grains of the initial microstructure and independent of the
   temperature at which grains grow. Based on the observations, a mean
   field model is proposed to predict annealing twin density as a function
   of grain size during grain growth.}},

Journal = {{SOCIETY \& NATURAL RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{885-899}},
Abstract = {{A persistent paradox in the global boom of renewable energy revolves
   around how little of its vast potential has been developed on Native
   American lands. For economic and environmental reasons, attempts to
   reverse this pattern are on the rise. Such plans will encounter many
   unique conditions, particularly those related to tribal norms, customs,
   and histories. This article examines the prospect of renewable energy
   (RE) development on the Navajo Nation of the American Southwest. We
   examine its potential in light of past energy projects, current
   jurisdictions and control, and the cultural and social heritage of the
   Navajo Nation. We find that robust RE development on Navajo Nation lands
   will remain hindered without accounting for Navajo values, intratribal
   and tribal-nontribal politics, and their relationship to a multifaceted
   set of regulatory procedures. Without due consideration of these
   factors, RE development on Navajo and other Native American lands will
   continue to be slow and disappointing.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{103-114}},
Abstract = {{An experimental methodology was developed to measure the nonvolatile
   particle number concentration using a thermodenuder (TD). The TD was
   coupled with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer,
   measuring the chemical composition and mass size distribution of the
   submicrometer aerosol and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) that
   provided the number size distribution of the aerosol in the range from
   10 to 500 nm. The method was evaluated with a set of smog chamber
   experiments and achieved almost complete evaporation (> 98 \%) of
   secondary organic as well as freshly nucleated particles, using a TD
   temperature of 400 degrees C and a centerline residence time of 15 s.
   This experimental approach was applied in a winter field campaign in
   Athens and provided a direct measurement of number concentration and
   size distribution for particles emitted from major pollution sources.
   During periods in which the contribution of biomass burning sources was
   dominant, more than 80\% of particle number concentration remained after
   passing through the thermodenuder, suggesting that nearly all biomass
   burning particles had a nonvolatile core. These remaining particles
   consisted mostly of black carbon (60\% mass contribution) and organic
   aerosol (OA; 40 \%). Organics that had not evaporated through the TD
   were mostly biomass burning OA (BBOA) and oxygenated OA (OOA) as
   determined from AMS source apportionment analysis. For periods during
   which traffic contribution was dominant 50-60\% of the particles had a
   nonvolatile core while the rest evaporated at 400 degrees C. The
   remaining particle mass consisted mostly of black carbon with an 80\%
   contribution, while OA was responsible for another 15-20 \%. Organics
   were mostly hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and OOA. These results suggest
   that even at 400 degrees C some fraction of the OA does not evaporate
   from particles emitted from com-mon combustion processes, such as
   biomass burning and car engines, indicating that a fraction of this type
   of OA is of extremely low volatility.}},

Title = {{Non-dimensional physics of pulsatile cardiovascular networks and energy
   efficiency}},

Abstract = {{In Nature, there exist a variety of cardiovascular circulation networks
   in which the energetic ventricular load has both steady and pulsatile
   components. Steady load is related to the mean cardiac output (CO) and
   the haemodynamic resistance of the peripheral vascular system. On the
   other hand, the pulsatile load is determined by the simultaneous
   pressure and flow waveforms at the ventricular outlet, which in turn are
   governed through arterial wave dynamics (transmission) and pulse decay
   characteristics (windkessel effect). Both the steady and pulsatile
   contributions of the haemodynamic power load are critical for
   characterizing/comparing disease states and for predicting the
   performance of cardiovascular devices. However, haemodynamic performance
   parameters vary significantly from subject to subject because of body
   size, heart rate and subject-specific CO. Therefore, a `normalized'
   energy dissipation index, as a function of the `non-dimensional'
   physical parameters that govern the circulation networks, is needed for
   comparative/integrative biological studies and clinical decision-making.
   In this paper, a complete network-independent non-dimensional
   formulation that incorporates pulsatile flow regimes is developed.
   Mechanical design variables of cardiovascular flow systems are
   identified and the Buckingham Pi theorem is formally applied to obtain
   the corresponding non-dimensional scaling parameter sets. Two scaling
   approaches are considered to address both the lumped parameter networks
   and the distributed circulation components. The validity of these
   non-dimensional number sets is tested extensively through the existing
   empirical allometric scaling laws of circulation systems. Additional
   validation studies are performed using a parametric numerical arterial
   model that represents the transmission and windkessel characteristics,
   which are adjusted to represent different body sizes and non-dimensional
   haemodynamic states. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed
   non-dimensional indices are independent of body size for healthy
   conditions, but are sensitive to deviations caused by off-design disease
   states that alter the energetic load. Sensitivity simulations are used
   to identify the relationship between pulsatile power loss and
   non-dimensional characteristics, and optimal operational states are
   computed.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{77-90}},
Abstract = {{Optimal allocation of monitoring efforts is necessary to
   cost-effectively obtain information to support the management of civil
   infrastructure. To optimize the design of sensing networks,
   pre-posterior analysis of the network can be conducted based on some
   metric for comparing alternative monitoring schemes. One such metric is
   conditional entropy, an information theoretic measure of the uncertainty
   in a set of random variables, conditioned on available sensor
   measurements. A second metric is the value of information, a decision
   theoretic metric which explicitly quantifies the benefit of sensor
   measurements in reducing the expected losses to a managing agent in the
   context of a decision-making problem under uncertainty. In this paper,
   we present a scalable probabilistic framework to perform pre-posterior
   analysis in large infrastructure systems using either metric. A
   discussion is also provided concerning situations in which either metric
   should be preferred. To demonstrate this framework, an example
   infrastructure monitoring problem related to seismic risk is presented
   and analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3527-3537}},
Abstract = {{The effect of polymer modification on the deformation characteristics
   and processibility of particle assembly structures is analyzed as a
   function of particle size and degree of polymerization of
   surface-tethered chains. A pronounced increase of the fracture toughness
   (by approximately one order of magnitude) is observed as the degree of
   polymerization exceeds a threshold value that increases with particle
   size. The threshold value is interpreted as being related to the
   transition of tethered chains from stretched-to-relaxed conformation
   (and the associated entanglement of tethered chains) and agrees with
   predictions from scaling theory. The increase in toughness is reduced
   with increasing particle size - this effect is rationalized as a
   consequence of the decrease of entanglement density with increasing
   dimension of interstitial (void) space in particle array structures. The
   increased fracture toughness of particle brush materials (with
   sufficient degree of polymerization of tethered chains) enables the
   fabrication of ordered colloidal films and even complex 3D shapes by
   scalable polymer processing techniques, such as spin coating and
   micromolding. The results, therefore, suggest new opportunities for the
   processing of colloidal material systems that could find application in
   the economical fabrication of functional components or systems
   compromised of colloidal materials.}},

Abstract = {{Verification of machine-code programs using program logic has focused on
   functional correctness, and proofs have required manually-provided
   program specifications. Fortunately, the verification of shallow safety
   properties such as memory isolation and control-flow safety can be
   easier to automate, but past techniques for automatically verifying
   machine-code safety have required post-compilation transformations,
   which can change program behavior. In this work, we automatically verify
   safety properties for unmodified machine-code programs without requiring
   user-supplied specifications. Our novel logic framework, AUSPICE, for
   automatic safety property verification for unmodified executables,
   extends an existing trustworthy Hoare logic for local reasoning, and
   provides a novel proof tactic for selective composition. We demonstrate
   our automated proof technique on synthetic and realistic programs. Our
   verification completes in 6 h for a realistic 533-instruction string
   search algorithm, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Using a mass transfer model and the volatility basis set, we estimate
   the volatility distribution for the organic aerosol (OA) components
   during summer and winter in Paris, France as part of the collaborative
   project MEGAPOLI. The concentrations of the OA components as a function
   of temperature were measured combining data from a thermodenuder and an
   aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF)
   analysis. The hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) had similar
   volatility distributions for the summer and winter campaigns with half
   of the material in the saturation concentration bin of 10 mu g m(-3) and
   another 35-40\% consisting of low and extremely low volatility organic
   compounds (LVOCs with effective saturation concentrations C{*} of
   10(-3)-0.1 mu g m(-3) and ELVOCs C{*} less or equal than 10(-4) mu g
   m(-3), respectively). The winter cooking OA (COA) was more than an order
   of magnitude less volatile than the summer COA. The low-volatility
   oxygenated OA (LV-OOA) factor detected in the summer had the lowest
   volatility of all the derived factors and consisted almost exclusively
   of ELVOCs. The volatility for the semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA)
   was significantly higher than that of the LV-OOA, containing both
   semi-volatile organic components (SVOCs with C{*} in the 1-100 mu g
   m(-3) range) and LVOCs. The oxygenated OA (OOA) factor in winter
   con-sisted of SVOCs (45 \%), LVOCs (25 \%) and ELVOCs (30 \%). The
   volatility of marine OA (MOA) was higher than that of the other factors
   containing around 60\% SVOCs. The biomass burning OA (BBOA) factor
   contained components with a wide range of volatilities with significant
   contributions from both SVOCs (50 \%) and LVOCs (30 \%). Finally,
   combining the bulk average O:C ratios and volatility distributions of
   the various factors, our results are placed into the two-dimensional
   volatility basis set (2D-VBS) framework. The OA factors cover a broad
   spectrum of volatilities with no direct link between the average
   volatility and average O:C of the OA components.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{654-657}},
Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer and other near-field applications can generate
   large magnetoquasistatic fields that can potentially be harmful to
   humans or interact negatively with the environment. Several shields have
   been proposed for the magnetic near field, such as ferrite sheets or
   metallic shields. While each can be effective, there are tradeoffs to
   each, namely loss, weight, and cost. In addition, metallic and ferrite
   shields are broadband and block large portions of the electromagnetic
   spectrum. In this letter, we introduce a new type of magnetic near-field
   shield, a zero-permeability near-field metamaterial (NF-MM) shield. This
   shield operates by canceling the incident magnetic flux without
   significant additional loss to the system. Moreover, the
   zero-permeability shield is frequency-selective, blocking only a single
   or small bandwidth of frequencies, enabling shielding only at the
   desired frequency while allowing the remainder of the electromagnetic
   spectrum through. We show that a zero-permeability NF-MM shield can
   reduce magnetic field strength by 22.84 dB in simulation and demonstrate
   77\% reduction in an experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for filtering sinusoidal noise with a
   variable bandwidth filter that is capable of tracking a sinusoid's
   drifting frequency. The method, which is based on the adaptive noise
   canceling (ANC) technique, will be referred to here as the adaptive
   sinusoid canceler (ASC). The ASC eliminates sinusoidal contamination by
   tracking its frequency and achieving a narrower bandwidth than typical
   notch filters. The detected frequency is used to digitally generate an
   internal reference instead of relying on an external one as ANC filters
   typically do. The filter's bandwidth adjusts to achieve faster and more
   accurate convergence. In this paper, the focus of the discussion and the
   data is physiological signals, specifically electrocorticographic (ECoG)
   neural data contaminated with power line noise, but the presented
   technique could be applicable to other recordings as well. On simulated
   data, the ASC was able to reliably track the noise's frequency, properly
   adjust its bandwidth, and outperform comparative methods including
   standard notch filters and an adaptive line enhancer. These results were
   reinforced by visual results obtained from real ECoG data. The ASC
   showed that it could be an effective method for increasing signal to
   noise ratio in the presence of drifting sinusoidal noise, which is of
   significant interest for biomedical applications.}},

   single-wall carbon nanotube aerogels}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{22285-22294}},
Abstract = {{Photocatalysts are being extensively investigated to convert renewable
   solar energy into chemical energy but suffer from high costs or low
   efficiencies. We report on the development of highly visible-light
   photoactive composites of titania (TiO2) and single-wall carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs) that rapidly photodegrade methylene blue dyes under
   visible-light illumination in the absence of cocatalysts. We fabricated
   these freestanding porous composites of density approximate to 36 mg
   mL(-1) (volume fraction approximate to 0.01) by an in situ sol-gel
   synthesis of titania nanoparticles of diameter approximate to 9 nm
   within SWCNT aerogels. The SWCNT aerogels are three-dimensional porous
   networks of individualized SWCNTs having a density approximate to 9 mg
   mL(-1) (volume fraction approximate to 0.006), whose large surface area
   and high porosity enable substantial titania loading and unimpeded dye
   transport to titania. The TiO2/SWCNT aerogel composites had a surface
   area of 293 m(2) g(-1) and pores of diameters between 2-25 nm. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy showed a strong bonding interaction between
   titania and SWCNTs (i.e., titanium-carbon and titanium-oxygen-carbon
   bonds), which possibly rendered these aerogel composites photoactive in
   visible-light with an absorption edge approximate to 2.6 eV. In
   contrast, titania is only active in ultraviolet-light due to its large
   bandgap (approximate to 3.2 eV). Further, they degraded dyes at a rate
   of approximate to 25 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with a rate constant of
   approximate to 0.012 min(-1) under visible-light irradiation, values
   that are more than two times greater than those from other titania-based
   photocatalysts under visible or ultraviolet illumination. In comparison,
   titania nanoparticles alone were essentially inactive under similar test
   conditions. Interestingly, the rate constant for dye degradation
   decreased with an increase in dye concentration, but the overall rate of
   degradation remained nearly unchanged. Moreover, the addition of
   platinum cocatalysts did not improve the photocatalytic performance of
   the TiO2/SWCNT composites. These observations suggest that the
   composites efficiently separate visible-light generated electron-hole
   pairs and that photodegradation was limited by the availability of
   reactive sites on titania (the anodic reaction). We postulate that
   further enhancements are plausible through composite design and that our
   facile fabrication method can be readily adapted to create nearly any
   freestanding photocatalyst/SWCNT aerogel composites for use in high
   performance photoelectrochemical cells.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding organic composition of gases and particles is essential to
   identifying sources and atmospheric processing leading to organic
   aerosols (OA), but atmospheric chemical complexity and the analytical
   techniques available often limit such analysis. Here we present
   speciated measurements of semivolatile and intermediate volatility
   organic compounds (S/IVOCs) using a novel dual-use instrument
   (SV-TAG-AMS) deployed at Manitou Forest, CO, during the
   Bio-hydro-atmosphere interactions of Energy, Aerosols, Carbon, H2O,
   Organics \& Nitrogen - Rocky Mountain Biogenic Aerosol Study
   (BEACHON-RoMBAS) 2011 campaign. This instrument provides on-line
   speciation of ambient organic compounds with 2 h time resolution. The
   species in this volatility range are complex in composition, but their
   chemical identities reveal potential sources. Observed compounds of
   biogenic origin include sesquiterpenes with molecular formula C15H24
   (e.g., beta-caryophyllene and longifolene), which were most abundant at
   night. A variety of other biogenic compounds were observed, including
   sesquiterpenoids with molecular formula C15H22, abietatriene and other
   terpenoid compounds. Many of these compounds have been identified in
   essential oils and branch enclosure studies but were observed in ambient
   air for the first time in our study. Semivolatile polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkanes were observed with highest
   concentrations during the day and the dependence on temperature suggests
   the role of an evaporative source. Using statistical analysis by
   positive matrix factorization (PMF), we classify observed S/IVOCs by
   their likely sources and processes, and characterize them based on
   chemical composition. The total mass concentration of elutable S/IVOCs
   was estimated to be on the order of 0.7 mu g m(-3) and their volatility
   distributions are estimated for modeling aerosol formation chemistry.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{2951-2959}},
Abstract = {{The relative reactivities of monoclinic and tetragonal BiVO4-based
   ceramics are described, focusing on the contributions of ferroelastic
   domains and surface orientations. First, the photo-oxidation of Mn2+ on
   monoclinic BiVO4 is shown to be domain selective, occurring on the set
   of domains that is not active for the photo-reduction of Ag+. Next, the
   domain and orientation dependent photochemical reduction of Ag+ is
   investigated for two samples in the co-doped family
   (Bi1-0.5xNa0.5x)(V1-xMox)O-4: a monoclinic sample (x = 0.05) and a
   tetragonal sample (x = 0.175). Like BiVO4, the x = 0.05 sample has
   ferroelastic domains that exhibit contrast in piezoresponse force
   microscopy (PFM) and exhibit domain specific reactivity. The x = 0.175
   sample has no domains, no PFM contrast, and uniform grain reactivity.
   The orientation dependence of Ag+ reduction is similar for the two
   samples, with surfaces near (001) being more active than others. For any
   given orientation, however, the monoclinic sample is quantitatively more
   active than the same orientation in the tetragonal sample. These
   collected results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   monoclinic-structured BiVO4 ceramics have enhanced photochemical
   activity owing to ferroelastic domain-selective reactivity, which allows
   for local separation of photogenerated carriers and redox reactions.}},

Title = {{Non-fouling hyaluronic acid coatings for improved sandwich ELISA
   measurements in plasma}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{1222-1228}},
Abstract = {{Nonspecific protein adsorption can interfere with blood diagnostics,
   especially in point-of-care tests for which minimal sample processing is
   required. Here we report a non-fouling coating material for presenting
   capture antibodies in ELISA that significantly increased precision and
   accuracy compared to a commercial ELISA microplates in human plasma and
   model solutions containing plasma proteins. The coating was prepared by
   functionalizing the hydrophilic polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) with
   a thermoresponsive polymer, poly(di(ethylene glycol)) methyl ether
   methacrylate (PMEO(2)MA). Previous studies demonstrated that these
   coatings were resistant to adsorption of major blood proteins, and we
   demonstrate that functionalization of the coatings with a monoclonal
   antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) provided
   enhanced detection accuracy for this pro-inflammatory cytokine in ELISA.
   Three plasma-type solutions were explored in this work based either on
   buffer containing known concentrations of albumin, fibrinogen and
   immunoglobulin at sub-physiological and physiological concentrations,
   and non-diluted human plasma. In model solutions of plasma, even
   sub-physiological concentrations of plasma proteins resulted in a 20\%
   overestimate of TNF-alpha concentration in the commercial ELISA kit but
   a 4\% overestimate in HA-coated microwells. However, in human plasma,
   the commercial ELISA kit underestimated the analyte concentration by up
   to 95\% while the HA-coated microwells did so by only 15\% at an analyte
   concentration of 12.5 pg mL(-1). The improvements in precision and
   accuracy provided by HA coatings suggests they could be used to enhance
   ELISA measurements in a broad range of complex biological media.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1324-1330}},
Abstract = {{Albumins are used biologically and pharmacologically as transport
   proteins to deliver molecules to cells. Albumins also efficiently coat
   single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and promote their entry into
   mammalian and immune cells by the millions. Here, we show SWCNTs
   dispersed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) that are pre-loaded with
   rhodamine B (RB), small hydrophobic dye molecules that we consider here
   as models for drugs, drastically increase delivery of RB to HeLa cells
   and macrophages in culture. We determine spatial and concentration
   distribution of RB by independently visualizing SWCNTs and RB within the
   cells using unique SWCNT NIR fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime
   imaging of RB. The SWCNTs-BSA-RB ternary complexes are stable in water
   for days, and RB is only released when BSA is thermally or enzymatically
   denatured. We demonstrate efficacy of this approach by delivering
   daunomycin, a fluorescent chemotherapeutic drug that reduces
   proliferation in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we use molecular dynamics
   simulations to identify separate regions in BSA for drug loading and
   binding to SWCNTs. Together, our results demonstrate a pathway to
   enhance the delivery of a wide variety of drugs to cells through SWCNTs
   coated with albumin pre-loaded with drug molecules.}},

Title = {{Improving accuracy and usability of growth charts: case study in Rwanda}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: We evaluate and compare manually collected paper records
   against electronic records for monitoring the weights of children under
   the age of 5.
   Setting: Data were collected by 24 community health workers (CHWs) in 2
   Rwandan communities, 1 urban and 1 rural.
   Participants: The same CHWs collected paper and electronic records.
   Paper data contain weight and age for 320 boys and 380 girls. Electronic
   data contain weight and age for 922 girls and 886 boys. Electronic data
   were collected over 9 months; most of the data is cross-sectional, with
   about 330 children with time-series data. Both data sets are compared
   with the international standard provided by the WHO growth chart.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: The plan was to collect 2000
   individual records for the electronic data set-we finally collected 1878
   records. Paper data were collected by the same CHWs, but most data were
   fragmented and hard to read. We transcribed data only from children for
   whom we were able to obtain the date of birth, to determine the exact
   age at the time of measurement.
   Results: Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error
   (MAPE) provide a way to quantify the magnitude of the error in using a
   given model. Comparing a model, log(weight)= a+b log(age), shows that
   electronic records provide considerable improvements over paper records,
   with 40\% reduction in both performance metrics. Electronic data improve
   performance over the WHO model by 10\% in MAPE and 7\% in MAE. Results
   are statistically significant using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at
   p<0.01.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that using modern electronic tools
   for health data collection is allowing better tracking of health
   indicators. We have demonstrated that electronic records facilitate
   development of a country-specific model that is more accurate than the
   international standard provided by the WHO growth chart.}},

   EMERGENCY MANAGERS}},
Journal = {{BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Emergency managers (EMs) use National Weather Service (NWS) forecasts to
   prepare for and respond to severe weather events. To effectively
   facilitate such decision making, the NWS needs to understand this large
   and important group of clients. EMs translate the forecasts to local
   topography, suggest actions to take in preparation of high water levels,
   and use their local network and reputation to make people act. For this
   study, 17 EMs in towns along rivers were interviewed and asked to
   describe their use of river and weather forecasts.Forecast uncertainty
   is one of the many uncertainties an EM has to manage when coordinating
   an emergency response. Each of the interviewed EMs who uses river
   forecasts was acutely aware that river forecasts often have substantial
   uncertainty. To cope with this uncertainty, EMs engage in extensive
   information gathering before forming their own judgments. However, EMs
   often do not communicate their judgment of the situation to the public,
   fearing potential liability claims and backlash from the media. For
   emergency management decisions, while EMs do consider forecast data,
   they rely heavily on recorded data and monitoring crews, limiting the
   benefits of forecasts that can be made with significant lead time. This
   paper arrives at recommendations for the NWS on how to increase the
   value of river and weather forecasts for decision making in emergency
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Enzyme immobilization onto gold-or carbon nanotube-based nanomaterials
   has driven recent advances in the development of enzymatic biofuel cells
   (EBFCs). Enzyme-gold and enzyme-carbon nanotube interfaces are conducive
   to achieving efficient electron transfer between the enzyme active site
   and an electrode along with high enzyme loadings. Herein, we investigate
   the performance dependence of EBFCs on the surface curvature, specific
   surface area (SSA) and pore size of underlying enzyme supports. One of
   the supports was gold/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fiber paddles
   that were formed by depositing gold nanoparticles and MWCNTS onto
   electrospun polyacrylonitrile fibers with a diameter of 1 mm and a SSA
   of 3.6 m2 g(-1) with micrometer sized pores. The other support was
   graphene-coated single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) gels, which had 1 nm
   thick struts, 686 m(2) g(-1) SSA, and pores of diameter <= 15 nm.
   Glucose oxidase (GOX) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD) were immobilized onto
   each material to form enzymatically active anodes and cathodes,
   respectively. EBFCs constructed using gold/MWCNT fiber paddle electrodes
   yielded power densities of 0.4 mW cm(-2) with an open circuit voltage of
   0.22 V and GOX loadings of 2.0 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2). In comparison,
   EBFCs utilizing graphene-coated SWCNT gel electrodes had 10-fold lower
   GOX loadings (1.0 x 10(-11) mol cm(-2)), but still produced 10-fold
   greater power densities (approximate to 3.6 mW cm(-2)) and an open
   circuit voltage of 0.22 V. We postulate that a greater fraction of GOX
   supported on graphene-coated SWCNTs that had high curvature retained
   their biochemical functionality. Further, this study provides a design
   principle for improving enzymatic power generation.}},

Abstract = {{Transport characteristics of TiN/Ta/TaOx/TiN resistive-switching
   crossbar devices with amorphous TaOx functional layer have been
   investigated at cryogenic temperatures. Quasi-DCI-V characteristics at
   10 K show a negative differential resistance region followed by a rapid
   transition to the non-volatile formed state. Accounting for Joule
   heating, the device temperature at the point of switching was estimated
   at 150 K. Measurements of transient resistance at low stage temperatures
   revealed an abrupt drop of resistance delayed by a characteristic
   incubation time after the leading edge of the voltage pulse. The
   incubation time was a strong function of applied voltage but did not
   depend on temperature between 10 K and 100 K. This implies a very low
   activation energy of the threshold switching process at low
   temperatures. Both of these observations argue against the involvement
   of oxygen vacancy motion at the onset of the forming process. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a subdivision-based finite element method as
   an integration of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) framework which adopts
   the uniform representation for geometric modeling and finite element
   simulation. The finite element function space is induced from the limit
   form of Catmull-Clark surface subdivision containing boundary
   subdivision schemes which has Cl continuity everywhere. It is capable of
   exactly representing complex geometries with any shaped boundaries which
   are represented as piecewise cubic B-spline curves. It is compatible
   with modern Computer Aided Design (CAD) software systems. The advantage
   of this strategy admits quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology. In
   this work, the computational domains with planar geometries are
   considered. We establish the approximation properties of Catmull-Clark
   surface subdivision function based on the Bramble-Hilbert lemma.
   Numerical tests are performed through three Poisson's equations with the
   Dirichlet boundary condition to corroborate the theoretical proof. (C)

Abstract = {{Brain state decoding based on whole-head MEG has been extensively

   this paper. RDA integrates linear classification and beamspace
   transformation into a unified framework by formulating a constrained

Abstract = {{This study conducts a hybrid life cycle analysis to estimate and
   characterize the water use of coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants
   with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS), including
   quantification of variability and uncertainty in the life cycle water
   use. The addition of CCS would remarkably increase the plant and life
   cycle water use, depending on the CO2 capture level. The life cycle
   water use also varies with fuel type and cooling technology. Among
   multiple supply stages for electricity generation, the power plant
   operation dominates the life cycle water use for both types of power
   plants. The probabilistic simulation results show that the plant
   operation is the stage contributing the most to the uncertainty of life
   cycle water use for a pulverized coal-fired power plant, whereas the
   hydraulic fracturing is the dominant stage of uncertainty for a
   shale-gas-fired combined cycle power plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A fast Fourier transform (FFT) based spectral algorithm is used to
   compute the full field mechanical response of polycrystalline
   microstructures. The field distributions in a specific region are used
   to determine the sensitivity of the method to the number of surrounding
   grains through quantification of the divergence of the field values from
   the largest simulation domain, as successively smaller surrounding
   volumes are included in the simulation. The analysis considers a mapped
   3D structure where the location of interest is taken to be a particular
   pair of surface grains that enclose a small fatigue crack, and
   synthetically created statistically representative microstructures to
   further investigate the effect of anisotropy, loading condition, loading
   direction, and texture. The synthetic structures are generated via
   DREAM3D and the measured material is a cyclically loaded, Ni-based, low
   solvus high refractory (LSHR) superalloy that was characterized via 3D
   high energy x-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM). Point-wise comparison
   of distributions in the grain pairs shows that, in order to obtain a
   Pearson correlation coefficient larger than 99\%, the domain must extend
   to at least the third nearest neighbor. For an elastic FFT calculation,
   the stress-strain distributions are not sensitive to the shape of the
   domain. The main result is that convergence can be specified in terms of
   the number of grains surrounding a region of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Precise, tunable emulsions and foams produced in microfluidic geometries
   have found wide application in biochemical analysis and materials
   synthesis and characterization. Superb control of the volume,
   uniformity, and generation rate of droplets and bubbles arises from
   unique features of the microscale behavior of fluid interfaces. Fluid
   interfaces confined within microfluidic channels behave quite
   differently than their counterparts in unbounded flows. Confinement
   inhibits capillary instabilities so that breakup occurs by largely
   quasi-static mechanisms. The three-dimensional flow near confined
   interfaces in rectangular geometries and feedback effects from
   resistance changes in the entire microfluidic network play important
   roles in regulating the interfacial deformation. Timescales for
   transport of surfactants and particles to interfaces compete with flow
   timescales at the microscale, providing further opportunity for tuning
   the interfacial coverage and properties of individual droplets and
   bubbles.}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates the existence of multiple optimal control

   While it was demonstrated recently that the steady-state optimization
   for the Jones-Kompala model would reveal multiple optimum solutions,
   this work demonstrates the existence of multiple optimum control
   profiles when dynamic optimization is performed. To perform the dynamic
   optimization, the differential equations were converted to a nonlinear
   program (NLP) using Radau collocation with finite elements and the
   state-of-the-art optimization program CONOPT (constrained optimizer) was
   used to obtain the local optimum profiles. The global solution was
   confirmed using the deterministic global optimization program
   branch-and-reduce optimization navigator. Both the programs were

Abstract = {{We consider the optimal reactor network synthesis of a polymerization
   process with detailed molecular weight distributions (MWDs). Based on an
   industrial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) slurry process model
   including an embedded MWD, a fully connected process superstructure of
   continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) is established through the
   introduction of splitters. Using this generalized superstructure as a
   basis, two nonlinear programming (NLP) problem formulations, which
   simultaneously maximize the monomer conversion and minimize the
   deviation between the calculated and target MWDs, are developed by
   applying multiobjective optimization (MO) methods. Different optimal
   flowsheet configurations are generated by systematically manipulating a
   set of continuous decision variables. Several case studies that consider
   different specifications on MWD are conducted to illustrate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed synthesis approach.
   Numerical results show that the optimal flowsheet configurations
   overcome the limitations of conventional reactor network structures and
   help to increase reactor productivity at the desired product quality.

Abstract = {{We study the generalization of split, k-branch split, and intersection
   cuts from mixed integer linear programming to the realm of mixed integer
   nonlinear programming. Constructing such cuts requires calculating the
   convex hull of the difference between a convex set and an open set with
   a simple geometric structure. We introduce two techniques to give
   precise characterizations of such convex hulls and use them to construct
   split, k-branch split, and intersection cuts for several classes of
   non-polyhedral sets. In particular, we give simple formulas for split
   cuts for essentially all convex sets described by a single conic
   quadratic inequality. We also give simple formulas for k-branch split
   cuts and some general intersection cuts for a wide variety of convex
   quadratic sets.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiently optimizing large-scale, complex analog systems requires to
   know the performance tradeoffs for various analog circuit blocks. In
   this paper, we propose a radically new approach for analog performance
   tradeoff modeling. Our key idea is to broadly search the rich design
   knowledge from the Internet, and then mathematically encode the
   knowledge as high-dimensional performance tradeoff curves that are
   referred to as Pareto fronts in the literature. Toward this goal,
   several novel numerical algorithms, such as sparse regression and
   semi-infinite programming, are developed in order to construct the
   high-dimensional Pareto front model while guaranteeing its monotonicity.
   Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed modeling technique
   can accurately capture the high-dimensional Pareto fronts for
   large-scale analog systems (e.g., analog-to-digital converter) while
   most traditional methods are limited to low-dimensional Pareto front
   modeling of small circuit blocks without considering layout parasitics
   and manufacturing nonidealities.}},

Abstract = {{We explore amorphous soft-magnetic alloys as candidates for electric
   motor applications. The Co-rich system combines the benefits of low
   hysteretic and eddy-current losses while exhibiting negligible
   magnetostriction and robust mechanical properties. The amorphous
   precursors can be devitrified to form nanocomposite magnets. The
   superior characteristics of these materials offer the advantages of ease
   of handling in the manufacturing processing and low iron losses during
   motor operation. Co-rich amorphous ribbons were laser-cut to build a
   stator for a small demonstrator permanent-magnet machine. The motor was
   tested up to 30,000 rpm. Finite-element analyses proved that the iron
   losses of the Co-rich amorphous stator were 80\% smaller than for a Si
   steel stator in the same motor, at 18,000 rpm (equivalent to an electric
   frequency of 2.1 kHz). These low-loss soft magnets have great potential
   for application in highly efficient high-speed electric machines,
   leading to size reduction as well as reduction or replacement of rare
   earths in permanent-magnet motors. More studies evaluating further
   processing techniques for amorphous and nanocomposite materials are
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation models are explicit representations of geometrical and
   topological information of physical environments that can be utilized
   for map-matching of indoor positioning data. This research paper
   presents algorithms for automated generation of three different types of
   navigation models, namely, centerline-based network, metric-based and
   grid-based navigation models, for map-matching of indoor positioning
   data. The abovementioned navigation models have been generated in an
   automated fashion from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based building
   information models (BIM). Specifically, we have 1) built on and targeted
   addressing limitations of existing algorithms that generate
   centerline-based network navigation models for polygonal shapes, 2)
   developed an approach to extract 2D geometry and topology from IFC-based
   BIM for creating metric-based navigation models, and 3) modified an
   existing algorithm to generate grid-based navigation models using
   geometry and topology extracted from BIM. The abovementioned three types
   of navigation models have been generated for six different testbeds with
   varying shape, size and density of spaces. We have validated the
   generality of the developed algorithms by evaluating the accuracy of
   geometrical and topological information contained within the three types
   of navigation models generated from testbeds with varying spatial
   characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{371-388}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the resource adequacy requirements of the PJM
   Interconnection, and the sensitivity of capacity procurement decisions
   to the choice of reliability metric used to measure resource adequacy.
   Assuming that plants fail independently, we find that PJM's 2010 reserve
   margin of 20.5\% was sufficient to achieve the stated reliability
   standard of one loss of load event per ten years, with 0.012 expected
   loss of load events per year. PJM could reduce reserve margins to 13\%
   and still achieve adequate levels of reliability as measured by the 2.4
   Loss of Load Hours metric and the 0.001\% Unserved Energy metric, which
   are used by other U.S. and international systems. A reserve margin of
   13-15\% would minimize long-run system costs. Reducing reserve margins
   from 20.5\% to 13\% in 2010 would have reduced PJM's capacity
   procurement by 11 GW, the same amount of coal capacity that PJM has
   identified as at high risk of retirement, We also investigate the risk
   posed by correlated failures among generators, a risk traditionally not
   modeled by system planners. We illustrate that three types of correlated
   failures may increase outage risks: natural gas supply disruptions,
   reduced reliability among generators during winter months, and the
   simultaneous shutdown of multiple nuclear generators for regulatory
   reasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multi-orientation error separation technique to
   remove the artifact form error from the radial measurements to obtain
   the radial spindle error motions of miniature ultra-high-speed (UHS)
   spindles. Unlike the existing approaches, the present technique neither
   relies on high-accuracy fixtures, nor necessitates measurements from
   specific orientations of the artifact. Rather, the spindle error motions
   are measured from a set of arbitrary artifact orientations using laser
   Doppler vibrometry (LDV). The angle of each artifact-setup orientation
   with respect to the spindle is determined with high precision through
   reflectivity measurement of the marks made on both the artifact and the
   spindle using another LDV. Although the presented approach can be
   applied by using different sensors (e.g., capacitance probes), we
   demonstrate the approach using LDVs. With the displacement measurement
   direction fixed, measurements are conducted from both LDVs for multiple
   orientations of the artifact. Using the unique implementation scheme
   developed in this paper, data from these orientations are post-processed
   to compute the artifact form error and further remove it from the radial
   motion measurements to obtain the synchronous radial spindle error
   motions. A thorough experimental evaluation is presented to quantify
   both the repeatability of the measured artifact form errors as well as
   the bandwidth of error separation for various number of artifact
   orientations. The spindle error motions measured from both the sphere
   and stem portions of a custom fabricated sphere-on-stem artifact mounted
   on a typical miniature UHS spindle, are seen to be similar in shape and
   within 5 nm in magnitude across the revolution, thus demonstrating the
   effectiveness of the technique. Using this technique, spindle error
   motions at ultra-high speeds up to 150 krpm were successfully
   quantified. Although the implementation scheme is demonstrated for
   miniature UHS spindles, it is readily applicable for error separation on

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of sequential Gaussian shift-in-mean
   hypothesis testing in a distributed multi-agent network. A sequential
   probability ratio test (SPRT) type algorithm in a distributed framework
   of the consensus+innovations form is proposed, in which the agents
   update their decision statistics by simultaneously processing latest
   observations (innovations) sensed sequentially over time and information
   obtained from neighboring agents (consensus). For each pre-specified set
   of type I and type II error probabilities, local decision parameters are
   derived which ensure that the algorithm achieves the desired error
   performance and terminates in finite time almost surely (a.s.) at each
   network agent. Large deviation exponents for the tail probabilities of
   the agent stopping time distributions are obtained and it is shown that
   asymptotically (in the number of agents or in the high
   signal-to-noise-ratio regime) these exponents associated with the
   distributed algorithm approach that of the optimal centralized detector.
   The expected stopping time for the proposed algorithm at each network
   agent is evaluated and is benchmarked with respect to the optimal
   centralized algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the
   sense of the expected stopping times is characterized in terms of
   network connectivity. Finally, simulation studies are presented which
   illustrate and verify the analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on thermomechanical effects in cryopreservation
   associated with a novel approach of volumetric heating by means on
   nanoparticles in an alternating electromagnetic field. This approach is
   studied for the application of cryopreservation by vitrification, where
   the crystalline phase is completely avoided-the cornerstone of
   cryoinjury. Vitrification can be achieved by quickly cooling the
   material to cryogenic storage, where ice cannot form. Vitrification can
   be maintained at the end of the cryogenic protocol by quickly rewarming
   the material back to room temperature. The magnitude of the rewarming
   rates necessary to maintain vitrification is much higher than the
   magnitude of the cooling rates that are required to achieve it in the
   first place. The most common approach to achieve the required cooling
   and rewarming rates is by exposing the specimen's surface to a
   temperature-controlled environment. Due to the underlying principles of
   heat transfer, there is a size limit in the case of surface heating
   beyond which crystallization cannot be prevented at the center of the
   specimen. Furthermore, due to the underlying principles of solid
   mechanics, there is a size limit beyond which thermal expansion in the
   specimen can lead to structural damage and fractures. Volumetric heating
   during the rewarming phase of the cryogenic protocol can alleviate these
   size limitations. This study suggests that volumetric heating can reduce
   thermomechanical stress, when combined with an appropriate design of the
   thermal protocol. Without such design, this study suggests that the
   level of stress may still lead to structural damage even when volumetric
   heating is applied. This study proposes strategies to harness
   nanoparticles heating in order to reduce thermomechanical stress in
   cryopreservation by vitrification.}},

Abstract = {{With rising complexity of indoor environments and growing demand for
   positioning and tracking of people (such as occupants and field workers)
   indoors, there has been an increasing need to have accurate and reliable
   indoor positioning. In this paper, the effects of (1) the quality of
   positioning data and (2) the types of navigation models on the accuracy
   of map-matching of indoor positioning data are evaluated. Sensitivity
   analyses on the quality of two different types of positioning data,
   namely, (1) absolute point-positioning data and (2) relative
   point-positioning data have been carried out. Two different types of
   navigation models, namely, (1) network models and (2) metric models,
   have been evaluated to examine their effect on the accuracy of the
   map-matching results. Eight different map-matching algorithms were
   selected and their accuracies were assessed in six different indoor
   data-collection routes containing spaces with varying density, sizes,
   and shapes. The results show different ways through which the quality of
   positioning data and the navigation model type affect the performance of
   map-matching algorithms in different indoor layouts. In addition, no
   single algorithm generates the most accurate results for all the cases.

Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bethe potentials were introduced by Bethe in 1928 as a first order
   perturbation approach to reducing the number of diffracted beams in
   dynamical electron scattering problems. The approach starts from the
   Bloch wave representation, and uses a threshold criterion to split the
   diffracted beams into two subsets, namely strong and weak beams. Since
   the use of Bloch wave based Bethe potentials for defect simulations is
   somewhat tedious, this paper applies the perturbation approach to the
   scattering matrix formalism, which is more readily adaptable for defect
   image simulations. The size of the dynamical matrix, and hence the
   computation time, can be reduced significantly. A threshold criterion
   for the separation of scattered beams into strong and weak sets is
   introduced. A general guideline in setting the threshold for strong or
   weak beam selection is discussed along with several parameters that may
   influence the threshold values, such as atomic number, accelerating
   voltage, structure complexity, incident beam tilt and temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{Various geometric operators have been playing an important role in
   surface processing. For example, many shape analysis algorithms have
   been developed based on eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
   (LBO), which is defined based on the first fundamental form of the

   on the second fundamental form of the surface, namely the secondary
   Laplace operator (SLO) and generalized Giaquinta-Hildebrandt operator
   (GGHO). Surface features such as concave creases/regions and convex
   ridges can be captured by eigenfunctions of the SLO, which can be used
   in surface segmentation with concave and convex features detected.
   Moreover, a new geometric flow method is developed based on the GGHO,
   providing an effective tool for sharp feature-preserving surface

Abstract = {{The interactions between silica nanoparticles grafted with a brush of
   cationic poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (SiO2-g-PDMAEMA) and
   anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is investigated by
   dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic mobility, quartz crystal
   microbalance with dissipation, ellipsometry, and atomic force
   microscopy. SiO2-g-PDMAEMA exhibits pH-dependent charge and size
   properties which enable the SDS binding to be probed over a range of
   electrostatic conditions and brush conformations. SDS monomers bind
   irreversibly to SiO2-g-PDMAEMA at low surfactant concentrations (similar
   to 10(-4) M) while exhibiting a pH-dependent threshold above which
   cooperative, partially reversible SDS binding occurs. At pH 5, SDS
   binding induces collapse of the highly charged and swollen brush as
   observed in the bulk by DLS and on surfaces by QCM-D. Similar
   experiments at pH 9 suggest that SDS binds to the periphery of the
   weakly charged and deswollen brush and produces SiO2-g-PDMAEMA/SDS
   complexes with a net negative charge. SiO2-g-PDMAEMA brush collapse and
   charge neutralization is further confirmed by colloidal probe AFM
   measurements, where reduced electrosteric repulsions and bridging
   adhesion are attributed to effects of the bound SDS. Additionally,
   sequential adsorption schemes with SDS and SiO2-g-PDMAEMA are used to
   enhance deposition relative to SiO2-g-PDMAEMA direct adsorption on
   silica. This work shows that the polyelectrolyte brush configuration
   responds in a more dramatic fashion to SDS than to pH-induced changes in
   ionization, and this can be exploited to manipulate the structure of
   adsorbed layers and the corresponding forces of compression and friction
   between opposing surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Published estimates of methane emissions from atmospheric data (top-down
   approaches) exceed those from source-based inventories (bottom-up
   approaches), leading to conflicting claims about the climate
   implications of fuel switching from coal or petroleum to natural gas.
   Based on data from a coordinated campaign in the Barnett Shale oil and
   gas-producing region of Texas, we find that top-down and bottom-up
   estimates of both total and fossil methane emissions agree within
   statistical confidence intervals (relative differences are 10\% for
   fossil methane and 0.1\% for total methane). We reduced uncertainty in
   top-down estimates by using repeated mass balance measurements, as well
   as ethane as a fingerprint for source attribution. Similarly, our
   bottom-up estimate incorporates a more complete count of facilities than
   past inventories, which omitted a significant number of major sources,
   and more effectively accounts for the influence of large emission
   sources using a statistical estimator that integrates observations from
   multiple ground-based measurement datasets. Two percent of oil and gas
   facilities in the Barnett accounts for half of methane emissions at any
   given time, and high-emitting facilities appear to be spatiotemporally
   variable. Measured oil and gas methane emissions are 90\% larger than
   estimates based on the US Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse
   Gas Inventory and correspond to 1.5\% of natural gas production. This
   rate of methane loss increases the 20-y climate impacts of natural gas
   consumed in the region by roughly 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-scale analysis of the diffusion and reaction in the catalyst
   coating of a reformer is done based on virtual reconstructions of the
   porous catalyst coating. Pore structure can have significant impact on
   reaction and transport processes in the catalyst coating and
   consequently on the reformer performance. In this work, tomography-based
   simulation of the methane steam reforming in the microstructure of a
   nickel-alumina spinet coating is presented. X-ray nano-and
   micro-computed tomography are done to reconstruct the catalyst pore
   structure at different length scales and to consider the effect of both
   intra-and inter-particle pores on the reacting flow in the coating.
   Results of the reacting flow simulation in the coating microstructure
   based on tomographic imaging are compared with the simulation using
   numerically reconstructed microstructure based on a random packing of
   spheres with similar morphological characteristics. The comparison shows
   that the rate of hydrogen production, in general, is higher in the
   particle packing due to better inter-particle pore connectivity. (C)

Title = {{Interpretation of thermoreflectance measurements with a two-temperature
   model including non-surface heat deposition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{We develop a solution to the two-temperature diffusion equation in
   axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates to model heat transport in
   thermoreflectance experiments. Our solution builds upon prior solutions
   that account for two-channel diffusion in each layer of an N-layered
   geometry, but adds the ability to deposit heat at any location within
   each layer. We use this solution to account for non-surface heating in
   the transducer layer of thermoreflectance experiments that challenge the
   timescales of electron-phonon coupling. A sensitivity analysis is
   performed to identify important parameters in the solution and to
   establish a guideline for when to use the two-temperature model to
   interpret thermoreflectance data. We then fit broadband frequency domain
   thermoreflectance (BB-FDTR) measurements of SiO2 and platinum at a
   temperature of 300 K with our two-temperature solution to parameterize
   the gold/chromium transducer layer. We then refit BB-FDTR measurements
   of silicon and find that accounting for non-equilibrium between
   electrons and phonons in the gold layer does lessen the previously
   observed heating frequency dependence reported in Regner et al. {[}Nat.
   Commun. 4, 1640 (2013)] but does not completely eliminate it. We perform
   BB-FDTR experiments on silicon with an aluminum transducer and find
   limited heating frequency dependence, in agreement with time domain
   thermoreflectance results. We hypothesize that the discrepancy between
   thermoreflectance measurements with different transducers results in
   part from spectrally dependent phonon transmission at the
   transducer/silicon interface. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{6510-6523}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a sampling theory for signals that are supported on either
   directed or undirected graphs. The theory follows the same paradigm as
   classical sampling theory. We show that perfect recovery is possible for
   graph signals bandlimited under the graph Fourier transform. The sampled
   signal coefficients form a new graph signal, whose corresponding graph
   structure preserves the first-order difference of the original graph
   signal. For general graphs, an optimal sampling operator based on
   experimentally designed sampling is proposed to guarantee perfect
   recovery and robustness to noise; for graphs whose graph Fourier
   transforms are frames with maximal robustness to erasures as well as for
   Erdos-Renyi graphs, random sampling leads to perfect recovery with high
   probability. We further establish the connection to the sampling theory
   of finite discrete-time signal processing and previous work on signal
   recovery on graphs. To handle full-band graph signals, we propose a
   graph filter bank based on sampling theory on graphs. Finally, we apply
   the proposed sampling theory to semi-supervised classification of online
   blogs and digit images, where we achieve similar or better performance
   with fewer labeled samples compared to previous work.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to investigate the rate, extent, and
   structure of amphoteric proteins with charged solid surfaces over a
   range of applied potentials and surface charges. We use Electrochemical
   Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (E-QCM-D) to
   investigate the adsorption of amphoteric Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to a
   gold electrode while systematically varying the surface charge on the
   adsorbate and adsorbent by manipulating pH and applied potential,
   respectively. We also perform cyclic voltammetry-E-QCM-D on an adsorbed
   layer of BSA to elucidate conformational changes in response to varied
   applied potentials. We confirm previous results demonstrating that
   increasing magnitude of applied potential on the gold electrode is
   positively correlated with increasing mass adsorption when the protein
   and the surface are oppositely charged. On the other hand, we find that
   the rate of BSA adsorption is not governed by simple electrostatics, but
   instead depends on solution pH, an observation not well documented in
   the literature. Cyclic voltammetry with simultaneous E-QCM-D
   measurements suggest that BSA protein undergoes a conformational change
   as the surface potential varies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification
   regulating several biological processes. A standard approach to measure
   DNA methylation is bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq). BS-Seq couples
   bisulfite conversion of DNA with next-generation sequencing to profile
   genome-wide DNA methylation at single base resolution. The analysis of
   BS-Seq data involves the use of customized aligners for mapping
   bisulfite converted reads and the bioinformatic pipelines for downstream
   data analysis.
   Results: Here we developed MethGo, a software tool designed for the
   analysis of data from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and
   reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). MethGo provides both
   genomic and epigenomic analyses including: 1) coverage distribution of
   each cytosine; 2) global cytosine methylation level; 3) cytosine
   methylation level distribution; 4) cytosine methylation level of genomic
   elements; 5) chromosome-wide cytosine methylation level distribution; 6)
   Gene-centric cytosine methylation level; 7) cytosine methylation levels
   at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs); 8) single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) calling, and 9) copy number variation (CNV) calling.
   Conclusions: MethGo is a simple and effective tool for the analysis of
   BS-Seq data including both WGBS and RRBS. It contains 9 analyses in 5
   major modules to profile (epi)genome. It profiles genome-wide DNA
   methylation in global and in gene level scale. It can also analyze the
   methylation pattern around the transcription factor binding sites, and
   assess genetic variations such as SNPs and CNVs. MethGo is coded in
   Python and is publically available at
   http://paoyangchen-laboratory.github.io/methgo/.}},

Title = {{Internal models for interpreting neural population activity during
   sensorimotor control}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{To successfully guide limb movements, the brain takes in sensory
   information about the limb, internally tracks the state of the limb, and
   produces appropriate motor commands. It is widely believed that this
   process uses an internal model, which describes our prior beliefs about
   how the limb responds to motor commands. Here, we leveraged a
   brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm in rhesus monkeys and novel
   statistical analyses of neural population activity to gain insight into
   moment-by-moment internal model computations. We discovered that a
   mismatch between subjects' internal models and the actual BMI explains
   roughly 65\% of movement errors, as well as long-standing deficiencies
   in BMI speed control. We then used the internal models to characterize
   how the neural population activity changes during BMI learning. More
   broadly, this work provides an approach for interpreting neural
   population activity in the context of how prior beliefs guide the
   transformation of sensory input to motor output.}},

Title = {{Three dimensional dynamics of rotating structures under mixed boundary
   conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},

Volume = {{358}},

Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the spectral-Tchebychev (ST) technique for solution
   of three dimensional (3D) dynamics of rotating structures. In
   particular, structures that exhibit coupled dynamic response require a
   3D modeling approach to capture their dynamic behavior Rotational
   motions further complicate this behavior, inducing coriolis, centrifugal
   softening, and (nonlinear) stress-stiffening effects. Therefore, a 3D
   solution approach is needed to accurately capture the rotational
   dynamics. The presented 3D-ST technique provides a fast-converging and
   precise solution approach for rotational dynamics of structures with
   complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions. Specifically, unlike
   finite elements techniques, the presented technique uses a series
   expansion approach considering distributed-parameter system equations:
   The integral boundary value problem for rotating structures is
   discretized using the spectral-Tchebychey approach. To simplify the
   domain of the structures, cross-sectional and rotational transformations
   are applied to problems with curved cross-section and pretwisted
   geometry. The nonlinear terms included in the integral boundary value
   problem are linearized around an equilibrium solution using the
   quasi-static method. As a result, mass, clamping, and stiffness
   matrices, as well as a forcing vector, are obtained for a given rotating
   structure. Several case studies are then performed to demonstrate the
   application and effectiveness of the 3D-ST solution. For each problem,
   the natural frequencies and modes shapes from the 3D-ST solution are
   compared to those from the literature (when available) and to those from
   a commercial finite elements software. The case studies include
   rotating/spinning parallelepipeds under free and mixed boundary
   conditions, and a cantilevered pretwisted beam (i.e., rotating blade)
   with an airfoil geometry rotating on a hub It is seen that the natural
   frequencies and mode shapes from the 3D-ST technique differ from those
   from the finite elements model by less than 1 percent for any rotational
   speed; however, 3D-ST approach significantly reduces the computational
   burden. It is concluded that the 3D-ST technique can be used to obtain
   the 3D dynamics of rotating structures, including those with mixed
   boundary conditions and complex geometry in a precise and numerically
   efficient fashion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study is motivated by major needs for accurate bad data detection
   and topology identification in the emerging electric energy systems. Due
   to the non-convex problem formulation, past methods usually reach a
   local optimum. This deficiency may lead to wrong bus/branch modelling
   and inappropriate noise assumption, causing significantly biased state
   estimate, incorrect system operation, and user cutoff. To overcome the
   local optimum issue, the authors propose in this study how to convexify
   bad data detection and topology identification problems to efficiently
   locate a global optimum result. To reduce relaxation error in the
   convexification procedure, a nuclear norm penalty is added to better
   approximate the original problems. Finally, they propose a new metric to
   evaluate the detection and identification results, which enables system
   operator to know how confidence one is for further system operations.
   Simulation results performed for several IEEE test systems show
   promising results for the future smart grid in improved accuracy.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A 2-D write/read channel model, which can accurately capture the media,
   writer, and reader characteristics, is proposed and investigated for
   very-high-density bit-patterned media recording (BPMR) system with large
   media noise. For the write process, a 2-D data-dependent write channel
   combined with a micromagnetic model of the writer is investigated for
   BPMR. In order to better understand the proposed channel model, several
   2-D patterns are investigated, and the corresponding write failure
   events are studied. It is observed that the write error rates (WERs) are
   different for different 2-D patterns due to the 2-D data-dependent
   nature of the write-in errors, even though the write failure rates are
   the same for these different 2-D patterns. For the readback process, a
   read channel, including media noise, is combined with the write channel,
   and the bit error rates (BERs) are studied for various 2-D patterns as a
   function of media jitter and write clock phase drift. It is observed
   that the 2-D pattern corresponding to four identical bits in a square
   pattern provides the best performance at a target BER of 10(-2) ,
   because it can provide adequate tolerance to media noise and
   interference in down-track and cross-track (CT) directions. The
   difference between the WER and the BER after readback is studied for
   various 2-D patterns, and the pattern corresponding to 4 bits with
   transitions in the CT direction is found to exhibit the largest
   difference among the studied patterns due to the fact that inter-track
   interference is more severe than the inter-symbol interference. These
   results motivate possible inclusion of 2-D modulation codes in BPMR
   channel to avoid certain bit patterns.}},

   comprehensive discussion of the fundamental material challenges
   associated with these chemistries and document the progress being made
   in translating next-generation battery systems from the lab to the
   market. We also carry out a critical examination of the hype surrounding
   emerging battery technologies. We report, for the first time, a hype
   chart for batteries akin to those popularized by Gartner, Inc. for
   emerging technologies. We expect this hype chart to give us better

Abstract = {{Characterizing the spatial distribution of proteins directly from
   microscopy images is a difficult problem with numerous applications in
   cell biology (e.g. identifying motor-related proteins) and clinical
   research (e.g. identification of cancer biomarkers). Here we describe
   the design of a system that provides automated analysis of punctate
   protein patterns in microscope images, including quantification of their
   relationships to microtubules. We constructed the system using confocal
   immunofluorescence microscopy images from the Human Protein Atlas
   project for 11 punctate proteins in three cultured cell lines. These
   proteins have previously been characterized as being primarily located
   in punctate structures, but their images had all been annotated by
   visual examination as being simply ``vesicular{''}. We were able to show
   that these patterns could be distinguished from each other with high
   accuracy, and we were able to assign to one of these subclasses hundreds
   of proteins whose subcellular localization had not previously been well
   defined. In addition to providing these novel annotations, we built a
   generative approach to modeling of punctate distributions that captures
   the essential characteristics of the distinct patterns. Such models are
   expected to be valuable for representing and summarizing each pattern
   and for constructing systems biology simulations of cell behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Coherent angular rotation of epithelial cells is thought to contribute
   to many vital physiological processes including tissue morphogenesis and
   glandular formation. However, factors regulating this motion, and the
   implications of this motion if perturbed, remain incompletely
   understood. In the current study, we address these questions using a
   cell-center based model in which cells are polarized, motile, and
   interact with the neighboring cells via harmonic forces. We demonstrate
   that, a simple evolution rule in which the polarization of any cell
   tends to orient with its velocity vector can induce coherent motion in
   geometrically confined environments. In addition to recapitulating
   coherent rotational motion observed in experiments, our results also
   show the presence of radial movements and tissue behavior that can vary
   between solid-like and fluid-like. We show that the pattern of coherent
   motion is dictated by the combination of different physical parameters
   including number density, cell motility, system size, bulk cell
   stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell adhesions. We further observe that
   perturbations in the form of cell division can induce a reversal in the
   direction of motion when cell division occurs synchronously. Moreover,
   when the confinement is removed, we see that the existing coherent
   motion leads to cell scattering, with bulk cell stiffness and stiffness
   of cell-cell contacts dictating the invasion pattern. In summary, our
   study provides an in-depth understanding of the origin of coherent
   rotation in confined tissues, and extracts useful insights into the
   influence of various physical parameters on the pattern of such
   movements.}},

Abstract = {{The consumer response to changing gasoline prices has long interested
   economists and policymakers, for it has important implications for the
   effects of gasoline taxation and vehicle energy efficiency policies.
   This study examines both the elasticity of driving with respect to
   changing gasoline prices and heterogeneity in this elasticity by
   geography, the fuel economy of the vehicle, and the age of the vehicle.
   We use detailed annual vehicle-level emissions inspection test data from
   Pennsylvania that include odometer readings, inspection zip codes, and
   extensive vehicle characteristics. We estimate a short-run gasoline
   price elasticity of driving demand of -0.10, and find substantial
   heterogeneity in this responsiveness. The elasticity is largely driven
   by low fuel economy vehicles, as well as vehicles between 3 and 7 years
   old. Our findings help reconcile some of the recent literature and
   provide guidance on the magnitude of the direct rebound effect from
   light duty vehicle energy efficiency policies.

Title = {{Enabling private sector investment in microgrid-based rural
   electrification in developing countries: A review}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{1268-1281}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Access to electricity is widely recognized as an important factor for
   economic and social development. Low rates of access, particularly in
   remote rural areas in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
   and Southeast Asia, have led developing nations and international
   organizations to set ambitious goals to expand the reach of electricity.
   Decentralized solutions such as microgrids have been proposed as cost
   effective solutions to reaching communities located far from central
   grid infrastructure. Lack of capital from public and donor sources has
   severely impeded achieving access goals, leading to calls for greater
   private sector participation in electrification activities. However, due
   to the high level of risk associated with decentralized electrification
   projects in low-income areas, marginal expected returns on investment,
   and a lack of clear and effective public policy, the private sector has
   not shown significant interest in participating in such projects. The
   purpose of this paper is to review barriers to private sector
   participation in decentralized electrification projects and to identify
   solutions that have been implemented and proposed to overcome these
   barriers. The barriers discussed include unsecure revenue streams,
   inability to finance projects, and long-term project risks such as grid
   encroachment. The range of interventions and business models reviewed
   include methods to secure reliable demand, subsidy models, risk
   guarantees, and different revenue models. This paper does not include an
   analysis of the effectiveness of the different interventions described.
   Future research should evaluate the relative costs and benefits of these
   interventions in order to provide robust policy guidance to decision
   makers in developing countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Estimating greenhouse gas emissions from future Amazonian hydroelectric
   reservoirs}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Brazil plans to meet the majority of its growing electricity demand with
   new hydropower plants located in the Amazon basin. However, large
   hydropower plants located in tropical forested regions may lead to
   significant carbon dioxide and methane emission. Currently, no
   predictive models exist to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions before
   the reservoir is built. This paper presents two different approaches to
   investigate the future carbon balance of eighteen new reservoirs in the
   Amazon. The first approach is based on a degradation model of flooded
   carbon stock, while the second approach is based on flux data measured
   in Amazonian rivers and reservoirs. The models rely on a Monte Carlo
   simulation framework to represent the balance of the greenhouse gases
   into the atmosphere that results when land and river are converted into
   a reservoir. Further, we investigate the role of the residence
   time/stratification in the carbon emissions estimate. Our results imply
   that two factors contribute to reducing overall emissions from these
   reservoirs: high energy densities reservoirs, i.e., the ratio between
   the installed capacity and flooded area, and vegetation clearing. While
   the models' uncertainties are high, we show that a robust treatment of
   uncertainty can effectively indicate whether a reservoir in the Amazon
   will result in larger greenhouse gas emissions when compared to other
   electricity sources.}},

   tornado risk perception}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lay judgments of environmental risks are central to both immediate
   decisions (e.g., taking shelter from a storm) and long-term ones (e.g.,
   building in locations subject to storm surges). Using methods from
   quantitative psychology, we provide a general approach to studying lay
   perceptions of environmental risks. As a first application of these
   methods, we investigate a setting where lay decisions have not taken
   full advantage of advances in natural science understanding: tornado
   forecasts in the US and Canada. Because official forecasts are
   imperfect, members of the public must often evaluate the risks on their
   own, by checking environmental cues (such as cloud formations) before
   deciding whether to take protective action. We study lay perceptions of
   cloud formations, demonstrating an approach that could be applied to
   other environmental judgments. We use signal detection theory to analyse
   how well people can distinguish tornadic from non-tornadic clouds, and
   multidimensional scaling to determine how people make these judgments.
   We find that participants (N = 400 recruited from Amazon Mechanical
   Turk) have heuristics that generally serve them well, helping
   participants to separate tornadic from non-tornadic clouds, but which
   also lead them to misjudge the tornado risk of certain cloud types. The
   signal detection task revealed confusion regarding shelf clouds,
   mammatus clouds, and clouds with upper-and mid-level tornadic features,
   which the multidimensional scaling task suggested was the result of
   participants focusing on the darkness of the weather scene and the ease
   of discerning its features. We recommend procedures for training (e.g.,
   for storm spotters) and communications (e.g., tornado warnings) that
   will reduce systematic misclassifications of tornadicity arising from
   observers' reliance on otherwise useful heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{The CO2 absorption capacity and rate of aqueous solutions of MEA and the
   potassium salts of glycine, taurine, proline, and lysine were compared
   in a microfluidic device. These properties were measured by tracking the
   volume change of an entrained CO2 gas plug as it traveled through a
   microfluidic channel. The potassium salt of lysine, which contains two
   primary amine functional groups, exhibited the highest rich CO2 loading,
   >50\% higher than MEA. The salts of glycine, and taurine exhibited
   similar absorption capacity to MEA, and the salt of proline exhibited
   the lowest absorption capacity. The trend in absorption capacities of
   the potassium salt of lysine and MEA was also observed in a set of
   breakthrough CSTR experiments. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze
   the absorbent solutions before exposure to CO2 as well as the reactor
   effluent. Spectral features of carbamate, carbonate, and bicarbonate
   were identified in the effluent spectra. The effectiveness of the
   microfluidic reactor as a solvent volume and time efficient screening
   tool is demonstrated. The results suggest further work should be done to
   evaluate the efficacy of the alkali salt of lysine as a post-combustion
   CO2 capture absorbent as it has potential to match or possibly improve
   upon the CO2 loading of MEA while offering advantages such as low
   toxicity and lower volatility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A thermally-activated constitutive model is developed based on
   dislocation interactions, crystallographic orientations and
   microstructural evolution to describe the elasto-plastic stress strain
   behavior during multi-axial loading. The aim is to contribute to the
   quantification of complex strain path response in solid solution
   strengthened alloys. In detail, dislocation/dislocation interactions are
   incorporated in the model to quantify latent and kinematic hardening
   phenomena during loading path changes. Dislocation density-based
   constitutive relations are included to account for dislocation features
   such as dislocation forests, walls and channels. Moreover,
   dislocation/solute atom interactions are also considered in order to
   account for both dynamic and static strain aging as well as static
   recovery. The model is validated against multiple multi-axial data sets
   for AA5754-0 with changes of loading path and various degrees of
   pre-strain and time intervals between tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The nature of MgO and Al2O3 dissolution in metallurgical slags may
   affect production cost, efficiency, and product quality. However, the
   rate-limiting dissolution mechanism, chemical reaction or boundary layer
   diffusion, is not well understood. In the present report, the
   dissolution mechanism of MgO and Al2O3 in metallurgical slag was
   evaluated based on available literature data. The mass balance between
   the dissolving particle and the flux equation through the boundary layer
   was applied to predict the dissolution curve. The influence of fluid
   flow was taken into account to calculate the mass transfer rate at the
   oxide/slag interface. It was found that the rate-limiting step of MgO
   and Al2O3 dissolution is the same: mass transfer through the boundary
   layer. Depending on the slag composition and experimental temperature,
   the effective diffusion coefficient for MgO and Al2O3 dissolution falls
   in the range of 10(-12) to 10(-9) m(2)/s. (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Abstract = {{Stable operation of submerged-arc furnaces producing high-carbon
   ferromanganese (HCFeMn) and silicomanganese (SiMn) requires tapping of
   consistent amounts of liquid slag and metal. Minimal effort to initiate
   and sustain tapping at reasonable rates is desired, accommodating
   fluctuations in especially slag chemical composition and temperature. An
   analytical model is presented that estimates the tapping rate of the
   liquid slag-metal mixture as a function of taphole dimensions, coke bed
   particulate properties, and slag and metal physicochemical properties
   with dependencies on chemical composition and temperature. This model
   may be used to evaluate the sensitivity to fluctuations in these
   parameters, and to determine the influence of converting between HCFeMn
   and SiMn production. The model was applied to typical HCFeMn and SiMn
   process conditions, using modeled slag viscosities and densities.
   Tapping flow rates estimated were comparable to operational data and
   found to be dependent mostly on slag viscosity. Slag viscosities were
   generally lower for typical SiMn slags due to the higher temperature
   used for calculating viscosity. It was predicted that flow through the
   taphole would mostly develop into laminar flow, with the pressure drop
   predominantly over the coke bed. Flowrates were found to be more
   dependent on the taphole diameter than on the taphole length. (C) The

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In materials science the orientation of a crystal lattice is described
   by means of a rotation relative to an external reference frame. A number
   of rotation representations are in use, including Euler angles, rotation
   matrices, unit quaternions, Rodrigues-Frank vectors and homochoric
   vectors. Each representation has distinct advantages and disadvantages
   with respect to the ease of use for calculations and data visualization.
   It is therefore convenient to be able to easily convert from one
   representation to another. However, historically, each representation
   has been implemented using a set of often tacit conventions; separate
   research groups would implement different sets of conventions, thereby
   making the comparison of methods and results difficult and confusing.
   This tutorial article aims to resolve these ambiguities and provide a
   consistent set of conventions and conversions between common rotational
   representations, complete with worked examples and a discussion of the
   trade-offs necessary to resolve all ambiguities. Additionally, an open
   source Fortran-90 library of conversion routines for the different
   representations is made available to the community.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{193-199}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of, given the structure of a linear-time
   invariant system and a set of possible inputs, finding the smallest
   subset of input vectors that ensures system's structural
   controllability. We refer to this problem as the minimum constrained
   input selection (minCIS) problem, since the selection has to be
   performed on an initial given set of possible inputs. We prove that the
   minCIS problem is NP-hard, which addresses a recent open question of
   whether there exist polynomial algorithms (in the size of the system
   plant matrices) that solve the minCIS problem. To this end, we show that
   the associated decision problem, to be referred to as the CIS, of
   determining whether a subset (of a given collection of inputs) with a
   prescribed cardinality exists that ensures structural controllability,
   is NP-complete. Further, we explore in detail practically important
   subclasses of the minCIS obtained by introducing more specific
   assumptions either on the system dynamics or the input set instances for
   which systematic solution methods are provided by constructing explicit
   reductions to well known computational problems. The analytical findings
   are illustrated through examples in multi-agent leader-follower type
   control problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented that wastewater disposal by underground injection
   can increase seismic activity. However, it is challenging to predict
   whether and when this effect occurs, as it can manifest itself even many
   years after the beginning of disposal operations. Continuous
   instrumental monitoring of the seismic activity is a first step enabling
   early detection of symptoms of change, updating of site and regional
   risk assessment, and prompt response. To avoid misdetection, however,
   seismic records have to be rationally analyzed, properly modeling the
   statistical features of the earthquake occurrence process.
   In this study, we develop a statistical approach to detect increments in
   seismic rate, accounting for model uncertainty (which is particularly
   acute when the monitoring period is short) and interdependence among
   events. The approach is composed of two steps: (1) stochastic earthquake
   declustering identifies mainshocks, and (2) the hypothesis of a constant
   rate of mainshocks is statistically tested. The method is applied to the
   analysis of the Oklahoma injection region, demonstrating that it is able
   to detect an increment in seismic rate before the change is large enough
   to produce severe consequences. We also investigate the statistical
   power of the method using synthetic data simulated for a wide range of
   scenarios.
   We believe that the method can be employed as a preliminary
   decision-support tool to identify areas with trends in seismicity that
   require further investigation and to guide adaptive management and
   operation of disposal wells.}},

Abstract = {{A chevron thermal actuator has been implemented as a constant velocity
   puller in a multiasperity frictional test platform. This platform
   enables a wide variation of puller velocity (1-3100 mu m/s, 3.5
   decades), normal load (2-4500 mu N, 3.4 decades), and spring constant
   (0.06-100 mu N/mu m, 3.2 decades). These characteristics are achieved by
   leveraging the actuator thermal time constant, which is long compared
   with the mechanical time constant, in combination with iterative
   learning control. Good thermal isolation between the actuator and the
   friction block is achieved by shunting heat to the substrate. Uncoated
   and FOTAS {[}tridecafluorotris(dimethylamino) silane,
   CF3(CF2)(5)(CH2)(2)Si(N(CH3)(2))(3)]-coated devices were tested, and
   normal load induced a transition from steady sliding to stick-slip. This
   platform could have several important uses for mapping microscale
   kinetic friction phase diagrams, including determining the stick-slip to
   steady sliding bifurcation line, performing start-stop tests and
   instantaneous velocity change tests, and inferring information on wear
   performance of coatings as a function of load and velocity.

Abstract = {{An in situ tensile test platform has been developed to study the
   mechanical properties of thin-film metal specimens. The fully integrated
   on-chip platform loads a specimen using a thermal actuator (TA). TAs
   conveniently provide high forces and excellent alignment, but generate
   large heat that can flow to specimens and raise their temperature. In
   the new design, heat flow to the specimen is negligible. This attribute
   was achieved by introducing a thermal resistor that limits heat flow to
   the specimen and a heat sink that shunts the remaining heat. Tensile
   residual stress in the specimen was eliminated by including preinserted
   microgrippers. A comprehensive error analysis indicates that the
   strength accuracy is +/- 5\% (one standard deviation). The platform was
   used to study the strength-related mechanical properties of Al/0.5 wt\%
   Cu microtensile bars with two different thicknesses. Initial tests
   indicate that 0.63-mu m-thick tensile bars exhibit higher strength, a
   larger strain hardening coefficient, and less elongation than 1.03-mu
   m-thick tensile bars. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that
   the lower ductility was due to plastic strain localization. When the
   tensile bar length is decreased from 200 to 70 or 50 mu m, strength
   increased by 40\% for both thickness values. {[}2015-0082]}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of ultra-thin (1-20-mu m thickness) polydimethylsiloxane

   process-dependent mechanical properties of ultra-thin PDMS membranes,
   reported for the first time. The effective Young's modulus of 1-mu
   m-thick PDMS, measured by bulge testing, is approximately ten times
   larger than that of 0.5-mm-thick material, following a continuous
   power-law relationship over the entire thickness range. Mesh-patterned
   metal electrodes of 2-mu m minimum feature size are embedded in selected
   membranes. Metal evaporation and subsequent reactive ion etch patterning
   on PDMS increases its Young's modulus due to the increase in cross-link
   formation and hardening of the surface. The results are meaningful in

Abstract = {{Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) provides a useful means for
   characterizing microstructure. However, it can be difficult to obtain
   index-able diffraction patterns from some samples. This can lead to
   noisy maps reconstructed from the scan data. Various post-processing
   methodologies have been developed to improve the scan data generally
   based on correlating non-indexed or mis-indexed points with the
   orientations obtained at neighboring points in the scan grid. Two new
   approaches are introduced (1) a re-scanning approach using local pattern
   averaging and (2) using the multiple solutions obtained by the triplet
   indexing method. These methodologies are applied to samples with noise
   introduced into the patterns artificially and by the operational
   settings of the EBSD camera. They are also applied to a heavily deformed
   and a fine-grained sample. In all cases, both techniques provide an
   improvement in the resulting scan data, the local pattern averaging
   providing the most improvement of the two. However, the local pattern
   averaging is most helpful when the noise in the patterns is due to the
   camera operating conditions as opposed to inherent challenges in the
   sample itself. A byproduct of this study was insight into the validity
   of various indexing success rate metrics. A metric based given by the
   fraction of points with CI values greater than some tolerance value (0.1
   in this case) was confirmed to provide an accurate assessment of the
   indexing success rate. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which drugs induce pancreatitis are unknown. A
   definite cause of pancreatitis is due to the antiepileptic drug valproic
   acid (VPA). On the basis of three crucial observations-that VPA inhibits
   histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDACs mediate pancreas development, and
   aspects of pancreas development are recapitulated during recovery of the
   pancreas after injury-we hypothesized that VPA does not cause injury on
   its own, but it predisposes patients to pancreatitis by inhibiting HDACs
   and provoking an imbalance in pancreatic recovery. In an experimental
   model of pancreatic injury, we found that VPA delayed recovery of the
   pancreas and reduced acinar cell proliferation. In addition, pancreatic
   expression of class I HDACs (which are the primary VPA targets)
   increased in the midphase of pancreatic recovery. VPA administration
   inhibited pancreatic H DAC activity and led to the persistence of
   acinar-to-ductal metaplastic complexes, with prolonged Sox9 expression
   and sustained beta-catenin nuclear activation, findings that
   characterize a delay in regenerative reprogramming. These effects were
   not observed with valpromide, an analog of VPA that Lacks HDAC
   inhibition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that VPA shifts
   the balance toward pancreatic injury and pancreatitis through H DAC
   inhibition. The work also identifies a new paradigm for therapies that
   could exploit epigenetic reprogramming to enhance pancreatic recovery
   and disorders of pancreatic injury.}},

Abstract = {{This letter reports on a photosensitive dual-gate amorphous silicon
   (a-Si:H) thin-film transistor (TFT) for low-level light detection. It
   differs from a conventional dual-gate TFT in that a 760-nm pi-shape

   of 50 similar to 100 nm in the conventional TFTs. Not only such a device
   improves the photoabsorption, it also preserves the transfer
   characteristics of the TFT. Upon the low-level light exposure, the
   photosensitivity can be multiplied by operating the device in the
   subthreshold region. In addition, resetting the device can minimize the
   residual photocurrent and improves the photoresponse. The device can be,
   therefore, sensitive and fast enough to enable optical applications,
   such as low-dose indirect-conversion X-ray imaging and large-area
   document scanning.}},

Abstract = {{The City of Los Angeles, with a population reaching 4 million people in
   2013, imports nearly 90\% of its water from sources outside the city.
   However, climate change, population growth, competing demands, water
   quality concerns, and environmental restoration projects all have a
   large impact on Los Angeles' dependency on future water importation. In
   this study, a system characterization was performed to assess each of
   the water sources that supply Los Angeles and the factors affecting them
   under present and potential future conditions. Additionally, water
   demand and conservation methods in Los Angeles were examined to
   understand their impact on the overall water supply system. Of the five
   main water sources that supply Los Angeles-Los Angeles Aqueduct,
   Colorado River, California Aqueduct, local groundwater, and reclaimed
   water-a majority will be impacted by climate change, water quality,
   energy, and cost constraints. While the expansion of water demand
   management and agricultural water transfers can help address the
   challenge of increasing demand, the impacts of climate variability and
   competing demands are likely to constrain their potential. The
   characteristics of the Los Angeles water supply system provide the basis
   for a system sustainability assessment that bounds the options for
   solutions to meet both a growing demand and the need for climate change

Title = {{An open source framework for many-objective robust decision making}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{114-129}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces a new open source software framework to support
   bottom-up environmental systems planning under deep uncertainty with a
   focus on many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), called
   OpenMORDM. OpenMORDM contains two complementary components: (1) a
   software application programming interface (API) for connecting planning
   models to computational exploration tools for many-objective
   optimization and sensitivity-based discovery of critical deeply
   uncertain factors; and (2) a web-based visualization toolkit for
   exploring high-dimensional datasets to better understand system
   trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. We demonstrate the
   OpenMORDM framework on a challenging environmental management test case
   termed the ``lake problem{''}. The lake problem has been used
   extensively in the prior environmental decision science literature and,
   in this study, captures the challenges posed by conflicting economic and
   environmental objectives, a water quality ``tipping point{''} beyond
   which the lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple deeply
   uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of pollution
   management policies. The OpenMORDM software framework enables decision
   makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios, quantify the trade-offs
   between alternative strategies in different scenarios, flexibly explore
   alternative definitions of robustness, and identify key system factors
   that should be monitored as triggers for future actions or additional
   planning. The web-based OpenMORDM visualization toolkit allows decision
   makers to easily share and visualize their datasets, with the option for
   analysts to extend the framework with customized scripts in the R
   programming language. OpenMORDM provides a platform for constructive
   decision support, allowing analysts and decision makers to interactively

Abstract = {{One of the significant ways to save energy use in buildings is to
   implement advanced energy retrofits in existing buildings. Improving
   energy performance of buildings through advanced energy retrofitting
   requires a clear understanding of the cost and energy implications of
   design alternatives from various engineering disciplines when different
   retrofit options are considered. The communication of retrofit design
   alternatives and their energy implications is essential in the
   decision-making process, as it affects the final retrofit selections and
   hence the energy efficiency of the retrofitted buildings. The objective
   of the research presented here was to identify a generic list of
   information requirements that are needed to be shared and collectively
   analyzed by integrated design teams during advanced energy retrofit
   design review meetings held in immersive settings. While identifying
   such requirements, the authors used an immersive environment based
   iterative requirements elicitation approach. The technology was used as
   a means to better identify the information requirements of integrated
   design teams to be analyzed as a group. This paper provides findings on
   information requirements of integrated design teams when evaluating
   retrofit options in immersive virtual environments. The information
   requirements were identified through interactions with sixteen experts
   in design and energy modeling domain, and validated with another group
   of participants consisting of six design experts who were experienced in
   integrated design processes. Industry practitioners can use the findings
   in deciding on what information to share with integrated design team
   members during design review meetings that utilize immersive virtual
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{This is the story of a bell-tower and its monitoring. The Civic Tower in
   Portogruaro is a 59 m high masonry bell-tower, originally built in the
   XIII century, today leaning more than a meter out of plumb. Since 2003,
   the building inclination has been continuously monitored with an optical
   inclinometer in an effort to see whether the tilt is still in progress.
   When the monitoring started, it was thought highly unlikely that the
   Tower would tilt further. After three years of monitoring and historical
   investigation, this idea was completely overturned. We show here how the
   initial view developed to a final awareness via a probabilistic analysis
   of the information acquired, based on Bayesian logic. We illustrate how
   the joint use of instrumental monitoring and historical documentation
   allowed timely recognition of signs of ongoing tilting and accurate
   calculation not only of the mean inclination trend, but also the
   credibility of this information.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative power electronic devices such as distribution-interline power
   flow controller (D-IPFC) can be utilized to improve the operating

   distribution grids. The proposed power injection model keeps original
   symmetry of the impedance matrix as well as system equations which
   facilitates power flow calculations. Then, a centralized multi-objective
   optimization algorithm is formulated to optimally coordinate
   multi-microgrids (MMGs) through D-IPFC. The final optimal operating
   point of MMG is a trade-off between minimization of operating cost,
   voltage profile deviation, and feeder congestion. To guarantee voltage
   stability of the system, a voltage security constraint is considered in
   the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm improves flexibility of
   the active distribution grids which is essential for resilient smart
   power grids. A typical MMG and a spider diagram are applied to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate a single-sample periocular-based
   alignment-robust face recognition technique that is pose-tolerant under
   unconstrained face matching scenarios. Our Spartans framework starts by
   utilizing one single sample per subject class, and generate new face
   images under a wide range of 3D rotations using the 3D generic elastic
   model which is both accurate and computationally economic. Then, we
   focus on the periocular region where the most stable and discriminant
   features on human faces are retained, and marginalize out the regions
   beyond the periocular region since they are more susceptible to
   expression variations and occlusions. A novel facial descriptor,
   high-dimensional Walsh local binary patterns, is uniformly sampled on
   facial images with robustness toward alignment. During the learning
   stage, subject-dependent advanced correlation filters are learned for
   pose-tolerant non-linear subspace modeling in kernel feature space
   followed by a coupled max-pooling mechanism which further improve the
   performance. Given any unconstrained unseen face image, the Spartans can
   produce a highly discriminative matching score, thus achieving high
   verification rate. We have evaluated our method on the challenging
   Labeled Faces in the Wild database and solidly outperformed the
   state-of-the-art algorithms under four evaluation protocols with a high
   accuracy of 89.69\%, a top score among image-restricted and unsupervised
   protocols. The advancement of Spartans is also proven in the Face
   Recognition Grand Challenge and Multi-PIE databases. In addition, our
   learning method based on advanced correlation filters is much more
   effective, in terms of learning subject-dependent pose-tolerant
   subspaces, compared with many well-established subspace methods in both
   linear and non-linear cases.}},

Title = {{A functional assay-based strategy for nanomaterial risk forecasting}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{536}},
Pages = {{1029-1037}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The study of nanomaterial impacts on environment, health and safety
   (nanoEHS) has been largely predicated on the assumption that exposure
   and hazard can be predicted from physical-chemical properties of
   nanomaterials. This approach is rooted in the view that nanoobjects
   essentially resemble chemicals with additional particle-based attributes
   that must be included among their intrinsic physical-chemical
   descriptors. With the exception of the trivial case of nanomaterials
   made from toxic or highly reactive materials, this approach has yielded
   few actionable guidelines for predicting nanomaterial risk. This article
   addresses inherent problems in structuring a nanoEHS research strategy
   based on the goal of predicting outcomes directly from nanomaterial
   properties, and proposes a framework for organizing data and designing
   integrated experiments based on functional assays (FAs). FAs are
   intermediary, semi-empirical measures of processes or functions within a
   specified system that bridge the gap between nanomaterial properties and
   potential outcomes in complex systems. The three components of a
   functional assay are standardized protocols for parameter determination
   and reporting, a theoretical context for parameter application and
   reference systems. We propose the identification and adoption of
   reference systems where FAs may be applied to provide parameter
   estimates for environmental fate and effects models, as well as
   benchmarks for comparing the results of FAs and experiments conducted in
   more complex and varied systems. Surface affinity and dissolution rate
   are identified as two critical FAs for characterizing nanomaterial
   behavior in a variety of important systems. The use of these FAs to
   predict bioaccumulation and toxicity for initial and aged nanomaterials
   is illustrated for the case of silver nanoparticles and Caenorhabditis

Abstract = {{Lignopolymers are a new class of polymer additives with the capability
   to be used as dispersants in cementitious pastes. Made with kraft lignin
   cores and grafted polymer side-chains, the custom-synthesized
   lignopolymers were examined in terms of the molecular architecture for
   viscosity reducing potential in inert model suspensions.
   Lignin-poly(acrylic acid) (LPAA) and lignin-polyacrylamide (LPAm) have
   been found to vary the rheology of magnesium oxide (MgO) suspensions
   based on differences in chain architecture and particle-polymer
   interactions. A commercial comb-polymer polycarboxylate ester was
   compared to LPAA and LPAm at 2.7 mg/mL, a typical dosage for cement
   admixtures, as well as 0.25 mg/mL. It was found that LPAm was a more
   effective viscosity reducer than both LPAA and the commercial additive
   at low concentrations, which was attributed to greater adsorption on the
   MgO particle surface and increased steric dispersion from PAm side-chain
   extension. The influence of chain adsorption and grafted side-chain
   molecular weight on rheology was also tested. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3843-3856}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A reliable and accurate biometric identification system must be able to
   distinguish individuals even in situations where their biometric
   signatures are very similar. However, the strong similarity in the
   facial appearance of twins has complicated facial feature based
   recognition and has even compromised commercial face recognition
   systems. This paper addresses the above problem and proposes two novel
   methods to distinguish identical twins using (1) facial aging features
   and (2) asymmetry decomposition features. Facial aging features are
   extracted using Gabor filters from regions of the face that typically
   exhibit wrinkles and laugh lines, while Facial asymmetry decomposition
   based features are obtained by projecting the difference between the two
   left sides (consisting of the left half of the face and its mirror) and
   two right sides (consisting of the right half of the face and its
   mirror) of a face onto a subspace. Feature vectors obtained using these
   methods were used for classification. Experiments conducted on images of
   five types of twins from the University of Notre Dame ND-Twins database
   indicate that both our proposed approaches achieve high identification
   rates and are hence quite promising at distinguishing twins. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nuclear, biological, and cyber weapons are major components of national
   security policy. We currently rely on case studies of individual threats
   to understand the international distribution of latent capabilities of
   weapons of mass destruction (WMD)-and typically look exclusively at
   commercial activity, scientific activity, or policy activity, without
   considering how these activities relate to other capabilities. Part of
   the problem of relying on these case studies is that the most
   interesting cases tend to be the outliers-making it difficult to
   generalize policy. Many of these case studies also ignore the threat of
   multiple weapons of mass destruction-the analyses focus exclusively on
   nuclear issues, biological issues, or cyber issues. We adapt Friedkin's
   socio-cultural model of influence and group dynamics to illustrate how
   countries are motivated to develop WMD using data on international
   hostilities, alliances, and expert opinion. We assess latent
   capabilities based on a country's scientific, commercial, and policy
   activity. After applying this approach, we develop a risk threat score
   for the country's nuclear, biological, and cyber capability, and use
   k-means to assess global trends and profiles in WMD development. By
   using this approach, we systematically consider all countries and do a
   joint analysis across the different technologies. We find that there are
   four broad profiles of countries: countries that invest heavily across
   all three technologies, countries that are invested in nuclear and cyber
   capability, countries that are solely invested in biological capability,
   and countries that are not invested in the three capabilities. These
   profiles provide a more holistic view of the threat landscape for
   policymakers.}},

Abstract = {{Across Europe, organizations in different sectors are sensitive to
   climate variability and change, at a range of temporal scales from the
   seasonal to the interannual to the multi-decadal. Climate forecast
   providers face the challenge of communicating the uncertainty inherent
   in these forecasts to these decision-makers in a way that is
   transparent, understandable and does not lead to a false sense of
   certainty. This article reports the findings of a user-needs survey,
   conducted with 50 representatives of organizations in Europe from a
   variety of sectors (e.g. water management, forestry, energy, tourism,
   health) interested in seasonal and interannual climate forecasts. We
   find that while many participating organizations perform their own `in
   house' risk analysis most require some form of processing and
   interpretation by forecast providers. However, we also find that while
   users tend to perceive seasonal and interannual forecasts to be useful,
   they often find them difficult to understand, highlighting the need for
   communication formats suitable for both expert and non-expert users. In
   addition, our results show that people tend to prefer familiar formats
   for receiving information about uncertainty. The implications of these
   findings for both the providers and users of climate information are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Bright signal outputs are needed for fluorescence detection of
   biomolecules at their native expression levels. Increasing the number of
   labels on a probe often results in crowding-induced self-quenching of
   chromophores, and maintaining the function of the targeting moiety
   (e.g., an antibody) is a concern. Here we demonstrate a simple method to
   accommodate thousands of fluorescent dye molecules on a single antibody
   probe while avoiding the negative effects of self-quenching. We use a
   bottlebrush polymer from which extend hundreds of duplex DNA strands
   that can accommodate hundreds of covalently attached and/or thousands of
   noncovalently intercalated fluorescent dyes. This polymer-DNA assembly
   sequesters the intercalated fluorophores against dissociation and can be
   tethered through DNA hybridization to an IgG antibody. The resulting
   fluorescent nanotag can detect protein targets in flow cytometry,
   confocal fluorescence microscopy, and dot blots with an exceptionally
   bright signal that compares favorably to commercially available
   antibodies labeled with organic dyes or quantum dots.}},

Abstract = {{The modification of the surface of nanoparticles with polymeric chains
   is ubiquitously used to engineer the physicochemical properties of
   nanoparticle fillers and to enable new material technologies based on
   polymer hybrid materials with controlled microstructure. The tethering
   of particles with polymeric chains of distinct (high and low) degree of
   polymerization (so-called ``bimodal polymer grafts{''}) has emerged as a
   particularly interesting strategy to combine the synergistic benefits of
   dense and sparse polymer grafts (i.e., good control of particle
   interactions facilitated by densely grafted polymer chains with the high
   inorganic content characteristic for sparsely grafted systems). In this
   contribution, surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization
   (SI-ATRP) is demonstrated to be a versatile tool that enables the
   synthesis of bimodal graft modifications with precise control of the
   degree of polymerization of the respective graft species. For the
   particular case of polystyrene-tethered silica particles, it was
   demonstrated that the presence of even small fractions of ``long{''}
   chains provided an order-of magnitude increase of the mechanical
   toughness of particle films that is comparable to values found in
   densely tethered particle systems only in the limit of high degree of
   polymerization of tethered chains (and corresponding low inorganic
   content).}},

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the use of wormlike nonionic micelles as drag-tags
   in end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis ({''}micelle-ELFSE{''})
   provides single-base resolution of Sanger sequencing products up to 502
   bases in length, a nearly 2-fold improvement over reported ELFSE
   separations. ``CiEj{''} running buffers containing 48 mM C12E5, 6 mM
   C10E5, and 3 M urea (32.5 degrees C) form wormlike micelles that provide
   a drag equivalent to an uncharged DNA fragment with a length (alpha) of
   509 bases (effective R-h = 27 nm). Runtime in a 40 cm capillary (30 kV)
   was 35 min for elution of all products down to the 26-base primer. We
   also show that smaller Triton X-100 micelles give a read length of 103
   bases in a 4 min run, so that a combined analysis of the Sanger products
   using the two buffers in separate capillaries could be completed in 14
   min for the full range of lengths. A van Deemter analysis shows that
   resolution is limited by diffusion-based peak broadening and wall
   adsorption. Effects of drag-tag polydispersity are not observed, despite
   the inherent polydispersity of the wormlike micelles. We ascribe this to
   a stochastic size-sampling process that occurs as micelle size
   fluctuates rapidly during the runtime. A theoretical model of the
   process suggests that fluctuations occur with a time scale less than 10
   ms, consistent with the monomer exchange process in nonionic micelles.
   The CiEj buffer has a low viscosity (2.7 cP) and appears to be
   semidilute in micelle concentration. The large drag-tag size of the CiEj
   buffers leads to steric segregation of the DNA and tag for short
   fragments and attendant mobility shifts.}},

Abstract = {{Electrodeposited MnO2 was screened as a possible pseudocapacitive
   material for use in a capacitive deionization (CDI) environment. Two
   simple electrochemical deposition conditions (galvanostatic and cyclic
   voltammetric) were used to produce MnO2 coatings on porous carbon
   substrates with contrasting surface areas and morphologies. These
   samples were then tested in static half-cell test fixtures with the
   intention of probing how these types of substrates and coatings might
   work in a CDI flow cell. The results show that the best sodium ion
   uptake performance on per-mass basis was not necessarily the most
   compelling electrode-level solution for practical application, and that
   a high surface area nanoporous substrate displayed evidence of a
   self-limited deposition wherein the internal electrode volume was not
   able to participate in the ion removal reactions of interest. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Modeling cell shape variation is critical to our understanding of cell
   biology. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of nonrigid image
   registration methods for the construction of nonparametric nuclear shape
   models in which pairwise deformation distances are measured between all
   shapes and are embedded into a low-dimensional shape space. Using these
   methods, we explore the relationship between cell shape and nuclear
   shape. We find that these are frequently dependent on each other and use
   this as the motivation for the development of combined cell and nuclear
   shape space models, extending nonparametric cell representations to
   multiple-component three-dimensional cellular shapes and identifying
   modes of joint shape variation. We learn a first-order dynamics model to
   predict cell and nuclear shapes, given shapes at a previous time point.
   We use this to determine the effects of endogenous protein tags or drugs
   on the shape dynamics of cell lines and show that tagged C1QBP reduces
   the correlation between cell and nuclear shape. To reduce the
   computational cost of learning these models, we demonstrate the ability
   to reconstruct shape spaces using a fraction of computed pairwise
   distances. The open-source tools provide a powerful basis for future
   studies of the molecular basis of cell organization.}},

Abstract = {{Water is a life-giving source, fundamental to human existence, yet over
   a billion people lack access to clean drinking water. The present
   techniques for water treatment such as piped, treated water rely on time
   and resource intensive centralized solutions. In this work, we propose a
   decentralized device concept that can utilize sunlight to split water
   into hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide can oxidize
   organics while the hydrogen bubbles out. In enabling this device, we
   require 2 an electrocatalyst that can oxidize water while suppressing
   the thermodynamically favored oxygen evolution and form hydrogen
   peroxide. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the
   free energy of adsorbed OH{*} can be used to determine selectivity
   trends between the 2e(-) water oxidation to H2O2 and the 4e(-) oxidation
   to O-2. We show that materials which bind oxygen intermediates
   sufficiently weakly, such as SnO2, can activate hydrogen peroxide
   evolution. We present a rational design principle for the selectivity in
   electrochemical water oxidation and identify new material candidates
   that could perform H2O2 evolution selectively.}},

   semiconductor thin films with metal nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Thermal properties of organic semiconductors play a significant role in
   the performance and lifetime of organic electronic devices, especially
   for scaled-up large area applications. Here we employ silver
   nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to modify the thermal conductivity of the small
   molecule organic semiconductor, dinaphtho{[} 2,3-b:2',3'-f]
   thieno{[}3,2-b] thiophene (DNTT). The differential 3-omega method was
   used to measure the thermal conductivity of Ag-DNTT hybrid thin films.
   We find that the thermal conductivity of pure DNTT thin films do not
   vary with the deposition temperature over a range spanning 24 degrees C
   to 80 degrees C. The thermal conductivity of the Ag-DNTT hybrid thin
   film initially decreases and then increases when the Ag volume fraction
   increases from 0\% to 32\%. By applying the effective medium
   approximation to fit the experimental results of thermal conductivity,
   the extracted thermal boundary resistance of the Ag-DNTT interface is
   1.14 +/- 0.98 x 10(-7) m(2)-K/W. Finite element simulations of thermal
   conductivity for realistic film morphologies show good agreement with
   experimental results and effective medium approximations.}},

Abstract = {{Living in different areas is associated with different impacts; the
   movement of people to and from those areas will affect energy use and
   emissions over the U.S. The emissions implications of state-to-state
   migration on household energy and GHG emissions are explored. Three
   million households move across state lines annually, and generally move
   from the North East to the South and West. Migrating households often
   move to states with different climates (thus different heating and
   cooling and needs), different fuel mixes, and different regional
   electricity grids, which leads them to experience changes in household
   emissions as a result of their move. Under current migration trends, the
   emissions increases of households moving from the Northeast to the South
   and Southwest are balanced by the emissions decreases of households
   moving to California and the Pacific Northwest. The net sum of emissions
   changes for migrating households is slightly positive but near zero;
   however, that net zero sum represents the balance of many emission
   changes. Planning for continued low carbon growth in low carbon regions
   or cities experiencing high growth rates driven by migration is
   essential in order to offset the moderate emissions increases
   experienced by households moving to high carbon regions.}},

Abstract = {{When microscopic and macroscopic specimens of metals are subjected to
   cyclic loading, the creation, interaction, and accumulation of defects
   lead to damage, cracking, and failure. Here we demonstrate that when
   aluminum single crystals of submicrometer dimensions are subjected to
   low-amplitude cyclic deformation at room temperature, the density of
   preexisting dislocation lines and loops can be dramatically reduced with
   virtually no change of the overall sample geometry and essentially no
   permanent plastic strain. This ``cyclic healing{''} of the metal crystal
   leads to significant strengthening through dramatic reductions in
   dislocation density, in distinct contrast to conventional cyclic strain
   hardening mechanisms arising from increases in dislocation density and
   interactions among defects in microcrystalline and macrocrystalline
   metals and alloys. Our real-time, in situ transmission electron
   microscopy observations of tensile tests reveal that pinned dislocation
   lines undergo shakedown during cyclic straining, with the extent of
   dislocation unpinning dependent on the amplitude, sequence, and number
   of strain cycles. Those unpinned mobile dislocations moving close enough
   to the free surface of the thin specimens as a result of such repeated
   straining are then further attracted to the surface by image forces that
   facilitate their egress from the crystal. These results point to a
   versatile pathway for controlled mechanical annealing and defect
   engineering in submicrometer-sized metal crystals, thereby obviating the
   need for thermal annealing or significant plastic deformation that could
   cause change in shape and/or dimensions of the specimen.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular weight distribution (MWD) is an important quality index of
   polymer products. Many methods have been proposed to dynamically
   simulate the MWD of polymerization, but these methods are normally
   designed for serial computations. In this paper, a multi-thread parallel
   computation method was proposed for multisite free-radical
   polymerization. Analysis of the relationship among different subtasks
   revealed a combined parallel strategy by fully exploiting the parallel
   feature of the process. A good performance was obtained to accelerate
   the dynamic simulation of MWD based on Flory method. We theoretically
   analyzed the speedup ratio (SR) and parallel efficiency (PE). Results
   showed that software algorithm and hardware configuration exhibited a
   good match. The efficiency of the proposed parallel method was presented
   through industrial slurry processes that used high-density polyethylene
   (HDPE). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Computational strategies for large-scale MILP transshipment models for
   heat exchanger network synthesis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{68-83}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Determining the minimum number of units is an important step in heat
   exchanger network synthesis (HENS). The MILP transshipment model
   (Papoulias and Grossmann, 1983) and transportation model (Cerda and
   Westerberg, 1983) were developed for this purpose. However, they are
   computationally expensive when solving for large-scale problems. Several
   approaches are studied in this paper to enable the fast solution of
   large-scale MILP transshipment models. Model reformulation techniques
   are developed for tighter formulations with reduced LP relaxation gaps.
   Solution strategies are also proposed for improving the efficiency of
   the branch and bound method. Both approaches aim at finding the exact
   global optimal solution with reduced solution times. Several
   approximation approaches are also developed for finding good approximate
   solutions in relatively short times. Case study results show that the
   MILP transshipment model can be solved for relatively large-scale
   problems in reasonable times by applying the approaches proposed in this
   paper. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of non-isothermal water networks consisting of water-usage,
   wastewater treatment, and heat exchanger networks has been recognised as
   an active research field in process systems engineering. However, only
   brief overviews of this important field have so far been provided within
   the literature. This work presents a systematic and comprehensive review
   of papers published over the last two decades and highlights possible
   future directions within this field. This review can be useful for
   researchers and engineers interested in water and energy integration
   within process water networks using systematic methods based on pinch
   analysis, mathematical programming, and their combination. We believe
   that this research field will continue to be active in the near future
   due to the importance of simultaneous optimisation of process, water and
   energy integration for achieving profitability and sustainability within
   process industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trauma-induced heterotopic ossification (HO) and fibrodysplasia
   ossificans progressiva (FOP) are acquired and genetic variants of
   pathological bone formation occurring in soft tissues. Conventional
   treatment modalities target the inflammatory processes preceding bone
   formation. We investigated the development of a prophylaxis for
   heterotopic bone formation by addressing the biological basis for HO -
   dysregulation in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway.
   We previously reported the synthesis of cationic nanogel nanostructured
   polymers (NSPs) for efficient delivery of short interfering ribonucleic
   acids (siRNAs) and targeted gene silencing. Results suggested that
   nanogel:siRNA weight ratios of 1:1 and 5:1 silenced Runx2 and Osx gene
   expression in primary mouse osteoblasts with a constitutively active
   (ca) BMP Receptor 1A (BMPR1A) by the Q233D mutation. Repeated RNAi
   treatments over 14 days significantly inhibited alkaline phosphatase
   activity in caBMPR1A osteoblasts. Hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition was
   diminished over 28 days in culture, though complete suppression of HA
   deposition was not achieved. Outcome data suggested minimal cytotoxicity
   of nanogel-based RNAi therapeutics, and the multistage disruption of
   BMP-induced bone formation processes. This RNAi based approach to
   impeding osteoblastic differentiation and subsequent bone formation may
   form the basis of a clinical therapy for heterotopic bone formation.}},

Abstract = {{Mitral cells (MCs) are a major class of principal neurons in the
   vertebrate olfactory bulb, conveying odor-evoked activity from the
   peripheral sensory neurons to olfactory cortex. Previous work has
   described the development of MC morphology and connectivity during the
   first few weeks of postnatal development. However, little is known about
   the postnatal development of MC intrinsic biophysical properties. To
   understand stimulus encoding in the developing olfactory bulb, we have
   therefore examined the development of MC intrinsic biophysical
   properties in acute slices from postnatal day (P) 7-P35 mice. Across
   development, we observed systematic changes in passive membrane
   properties and action potential waveforms consistent with a
   developmental increase in sodium and potassium conductances. We further
   observed developmental decreases in hyperpolarization-evoked membrane
   potential sag and firing regularity, extending recent links between MC
   sag heterogeneity and firing patterns. We then applied a novel
   combination of statistical analyses to examine how the evolution of
   these intrinsic biophysical properties specifically influenced the
   representation of fluctuating stimuli by MCs. We found that immature MCs
   responded to frozen fluctuating stimuli with lower firing rates, lower
   spike-time reliability, and lower between-cell spike-time correlations
   than more mature MCs. Analysis of spike-triggered averages revealed that
   these changes in spike timing were driven by a developmental shift from
   broad integration of inputs to more selective detection of coincident
   inputs. Consistent with this shift, generalized linear model fits to MC
   firing responses demonstrated an enhanced encoding of high-frequency
   stimulus features by mature MCs.}},

Title = {{Use of NH3 fuel to achieve deep greenhouse gas reductions from US
   transportation}},
Journal = {{ENERGY REPORTS}},

Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The transportation sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse
   gases (GHGs) emissions in the United States. This study identifies
   scenarios for dramatically reducing future GHG emissions from the US
   transportation sector, specifically from light-duty vehicles (LDVs), by
   phasing in ammonia (NH3)-fueled vehicles in place of vehicles using
   petroleum-based fuels.
   Projected US LDV carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the Annual Energy
   Outlook (AEO) 2013 reference case projections prepared by the United
   States Department of Energy serve as the reference case for this study.
   Two scenarios, in addition to the AEO reference case, have been
   developed in this study to illustrate the GHG emissions mitigation
   potential of implementing NH3-fueled vehicles in the US LDV
   transportation sector through 2040. This study uses the software tool
   LEAP (the Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System), with which
   alternative scenarios can be created and evaluated by comparing their
   energy requirements and environmental impacts.
   Aggressive implementation of NH3-fueled vehicles replacing gasoline
   vehicles to account for 100\% in 2040 achieves reduction of about 30\%
   of the cumulative LDV CO2 emissions from 2010 through 2040 produced in
   the reference case. It eliminates most of the annual LDV CO2 emissions
   projected in the reference case in the year 2040, with a 96\% reduction
   from reference case levels, equivalent to a reduction of approximately
   718 million metric tons CO2 equivalent in that year's emissions.
   The current study demonstrates that NH3-fueled vehicles could be a
   promising near-term alternative for LDV because of its significant
   contribution in reducing CO2 emissions compared with vehicles of carbon
   based fuels. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an
