Abstract = {{Doped porous SiC nanostructures with metallic atoms, nanoclusters and
   nanoparticles have been recognized as promising materials for hydrogen
   storage. With this regards transition metal elements are interesting
   impurities for use as doping. In view of this prospect, a theoretical
   approach based on density functional theory (DFT) was applied to study
   of the interaction between hydrogen molecule and a graphene-like SiC
   sheet doped with palladium atom. We have selected a single graphene-like
   SiC layer, due to its more surface charge polarization in comparison
   with pure graphene which makes possible remarkable interactions with
   adsorbed hydrogen molecules. In our study we have included two different
   configurations of H-2 adsorption: 1) at the first state, hydrogen atoms
   after adsorption stretched and distance between H-H atoms has increased
   but their chemical bond doesn't break. In this situation a physical
   adsorption occurred and the binding energy restricts applicable
   interests where it is appropriate for reversible hydrogen storage; 2) at
   the second situation, atoms of hydrogen molecule discrete from each
   other and adsorption occurred in a chemical manner. As instance the when
   a H2 molecule interact simultaneously with Pd atom and SiC nanosheet, it
   can be dissociated as in this case a hydrogen atom makes bond with Pd
   atom and the other can be adsorbed chemically on the SiC nanosheet
   surface. More details about adsorption mechanism are discussed it the
   context. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by

Title = {{Probabilistic Assessment of Above Zone Pressure Predictions at a
   Geologic Carbon Storage Site}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage into geological formations is regarded as
   an important mitigation strategy for anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the
   atmosphere. This study first simulates the leakage of CO2 and brine from
   a storage reservoir through the caprock. Then, we estimate the resulting
   pressure changes at the zone overlying the caprock also known as Above
   Zone Monitoring Interval (AZMI). A data-driven approach of arbitrary
   Polynomial Chaos (aPC) Expansion is then used to quantify the
   uncertainty in the above zone pressure prediction based on the
   uncertainties in different geologic parameters. Finally, a global
   sensitivity analysis is performed with Sobol indices based on the aPC
   technique to determine the relative importance of different parameters
   on pressure prediction. The results indicate that there can be
   uncertainty in pressure prediction locally around the leakage zones. The
   degree of such uncertainty in prediction depends on the quality of site
   specific information available for analysis. The scientific results from
   this study provide substantial insight that there is a need for
   site-specific data for efficient predictions of risks associated with
   storage activities. The presented approach can provide a basis of
   optimized pressure based monitoring network design at carbon storage
   sites.}},

Pages = {{492-502}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide bandgap semiconductor material that has
   attracted widespread interest as particle filler in polymer
   nanocomposite materials. However, its applications have been hindered by
   the limited dispersibility and surface-modification techniques. Herein,
   three distinct approaches for the synthesis of polymer-tethered ZnO
   hybrid materials are compared in terms of uniformity and yield of the
   particle-brush product: ``grafting-from{''}, ``grafting-onto{''}, and
   ``grafted-copolymer template{''} methods. In the ``grafting-from{''}
   method, pristine ZnO nanoparticles (NP) were first functionalized with
   atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiators followed by
   grafting-from process to form poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or
   poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PSAN) tethered polymer chains. In the
   ``grafting-on-to{''} method, PMMA-b-PAA (polyacrylic acid I) and
   PSAN-b-PAA diblock copolymers were prepared and attached onto the
   surface of ZnO NPs using sonication bath. For the ``grafted-copolymer
   template{''} method, PSAN-b-PtBA-Br (poly{[}tert-butyl acrylate]-Br)
   macroinitiators were crosslinked with divinylbenzene (DVB) to form
   PSAN-b-PtBA-PDVB core-shell star polymers. After hydrolysis to form
   PSAN-b-PAA-PDVB star polymers, the functional stars were used as polymer
   templates for the synthesis of ZnO NPs within the PAA-core of the stars.
   Core-shell molecular bottlebrushes with PAA-b-PS block-copolymer side
   chains were also used as anisotropic analogues of star template to
   prepared worm-like ZnO particles. Several ZnO precursors, zinc nitrite,
   zinc 2-ethylhexanoate, and zinc acetate were evaluated as precursors of
   ZnO. Conditions were identified that enable the synthesis of
   polymer-tethered ZnO with excellent size uniformity and dispersion
   characteristics using the star-template method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce hybrid-degree weighted T-splines by means of
   local p-refinement and apply them to isogeometric analysis. Standard
   T-splines enable local h-refinement, however, they do not support local
   p-refinement. To increase the flexibility of T-splines so that local
   p-refinement is also available, we first define weighted B-spline curves
   of hybrid degree. Then we extend the idea to weighted T-spline surfaces
   of hybrid degree. A transition region is defined so as to stitch the
   locally p-refined region with the rest of the mesh. The transition
   region has the same basis function degree as the p-refined region, and
   the same surface continuity as the rest of the mesh. Finally, we compare
   the performance of odd-, even-, and hybrid-degree T-splines over an
   L-shaped domain governed by the Laplace equation and create high-genus
   surfaces using hybrid-degree weighted T-splines. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Enabling Marangoni flow at air-liquid interfaces through deposition of
   aerosolized lipid dispersions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{484}},
Pages = {{270-278}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{It has long been known that deposited drops of surfactant solution
   induce Marangoni flows at air-liquid interfaces. These surfactant drops
   create a surface tension gradient, which causes an outward flow at the
   fluid interface. We show that aqueous phospholipid dispersions may be
   used for this same purpose. In aqueous dispersions, phospholipids
   aggregate into vesicles that are not surface-active; therefore, drops of
   these dispersions do not initiate Marangoni flow. However,
   aerosolization of these dispersions disrupts the vesicles, allowing
   access to the surface-active monomers within. These lipid monomers do
   have the ability to induce Marangoni flow. We hypothesize that monomers
   released from broken vesicles adsorb on the surfaces of individual
   aerosol droplets and then create localized surface tension reduction
   upon droplet deposition. Deposition of lipid monomers via aerosolization
   produces surface tensions as low as 1 mN/m on water. In addition,
   aerosolized lipid deposition also drives Marangoni flow on entangled
   polymer solution subphases with low initial surface tensions (similar to
   34 mN/m). The fact that aerosolization of phospholipids naturally found
   within pulmonary surfactant can drive Marangoni flows on low surface
   tension liquids suggests that aerosolized lipids may be used to promote
   uniform pulmonary drug delivery without the need for exogenous spreading
   agents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are capable of generating electricity
   from physiologically present fuels making them promising power sources
   for the future of implantable devices. The potential application of such
   systems is limited, however, by inefficient current generation.
   Polymer-based protein engineering (PBPE) offers a unique method to
   tailor enzyme function through tunable modification of the enzyme
   surface with functional polymers. In this study, we report on the
   modification of glucose oxidase (GOX) with ferrocene,containing redox
   polymers to increase current generation efficiency in an enzyme modified
   anode. Poly(N-(3-dimethyl(ferrocenyl)methylammonium bromide)propyl
   acrylamide) (pFcAc) was grown from covalently attached, water-soluble
   initiator molecules on the surface of GOX in a ``grafting-from{''}
   approach using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The
   covalently-coupled ferrocene-containing polymers on the enzyme surface
   promoted the effective ``wiring{''} of the GOX active site to an
   external electrode. The resulting GOX-pFcAc conjugates generated over an
   order of magnitude increase in current generation efficiency and a
   4-fold increase in maximum EBFC power density (approximate to 1.7 mu W
   cm(-2)) with similar open circuit voltage (0.27 V) compared to native
   GOX when physically adsorbed onto paddle-shaped electrodes made up of
   electrospun polyacrylonitrile fibers coated with gold nanoparticles and
   multi-wall carbon nanotubes. The formation of electroactive enzyme-redox
   polymer conjugates using PBPE represents a powerful new tool for the
   improvement of mediated enzyme-based bioelectronics without the need for
   free redox mediators or anode/cathode compartmentalization. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Soft integrated electronics are key components for emerging applications
   in wearable biomonitoring, soft co-robotics, and physical human-machine
   interaction. They are composed of soft and elastically deformable
   circuits and sensors that are combined with packaged microelectronics
   for signal processing, power regulation, and communication. While
   promising, widespread use of soft wearable electronics is currently
   limited by the lack of robust fabrication techniques to rapidly,
   efficiently, and precisely assemble soft and rigid components into
   multilayered systems. Here, an efficient digital fabrication approach is
   presented to create highly customizable wearable electronics through
   rapid laser machining and adhesion controlled soft materials assembly.
   Well aligned, multilayered materials are created from 2D and 3D elements
   that stretch and bend while seamlessly integrating with rigid components
   such as microchip integrated circuits, discrete electrical components,
   and interconnects. These techniques are applied using commercially
   available materials and components and the fabrication of thin,
   lightweight, customized sensor skins is demonstrated in under an hour.
   These fully integrated wireless devices conformably bond to the hand and
   are successfully used for monitoring hand gesture, pulse rate, and blood
   oxygenation. These materials and methods enable custom wearable
   electronics while offering versatility in design and functionality for a
   variety of applications through material selection and construction.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PSAN)-capped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)
   were synthesized by a ``ligand exchange{''} method. First, octylamine

   by activators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP) and were efficiently exchanged with OA
   ligands on the ZnO particle surface benefiting from the relatively low
   boiling point of OA (175 degrees C). The morphology, content of ZnO, and
   grafting density of the nanocomposite were well controlled by altering
   the ratio between OA and polymer ligands as well as the molecular weight
   of PSAN-NH2 used in the exchange reaction. The resulting ZnO/polymer
   nanocomposites were stable in THE with narrow size distributions and
   varying grafting densities from 0.9 to 2.5 nm(-2). With excess amount of
   polymer ligands, individual dispersed ZnO NPs were observed. However,
   with a limited amount of ligands, NPs clusters were formed, as confirmed
   by TEM and DLS.}},

Title = {{A Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) Decoding the Forelimb Movement from
   Neuronal Spikes in the Rat Motor Cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Several neural decoding algorithms have successfully converted brain
   signals into commands to control a computer cursor and prosthetic
   devices. A majority of decoding methods, such as population vector
   algorithms (PVA), optimal linear estimators (OLE), and neural networks
   (NN), are effective in predicting movement kinematics, including
   movement direction, speed and trajectory but usually require a large
   number of neurons to achieve desirable performance. This study proposed
   a novel decoding algorithm even with signals obtained from a smaller
   numbers of neurons. We adopted sliced inverse regression (SIR) to
   predict forelimb movement from single-unit activities recorded in the
   rat primary motor (M1) cortex in a water-reward lever-pressing task. SIR
   performed weighted principal component analysis (RCA) to achieve
   effective dimension reduction for nonlinear regression. To demonstrate
   the decoding performance, SIR was compared to PVA, OLE, and NN.
   Furthermore, RCA and sequential feature selection (SFS) which are
   popular feature selection techniques were implemented for comparison of
   feature selection effectiveness. Among SIR, PVA, OLE, PCA, SFS, and NN
   decoding methods, the trajectories predicted by SIR (with a root mean
   square error, RMSE, of 8.47 +/- 1.32 mm) was closer to the actual
   trajectories compared with those predicted by PVA (30.41 +/- 11.73 mm),
   OLE (20.17 +/- 6.43 mm), PCA (19.13 +/- 0.75 mm), SFS (22.75 +/- 2.01
   mm), and NN (16.75 +/- 2.02 mm). The superiority of SIR was most obvious
   when the sample size of neurons was small. We concluded that SIR sorted
   the input data to obtain the effective transform matrices for movement
   prediction, making it a robust decoding method for conditions with
   sparse neuronal information.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrins are multi-domain, elastic proteins that provide elasticity to
   the plasma membrane of erythrocytes and select nucleated cells.
   Spectrins have also been found in the nucleus of non-erythrocytes, but
   their function remains to be uncovered. It has been hypothesized that a
   spring-like spectrin network exists within the lamina nucleoskeleton,
   however, experiments testing a spectrin network's mechanical impact on
   the nucleus are lacking. Here, we knock-down levels of nuclear alpha
   II-spectrin with the goal of disrupting this nucleoskeletal spectrin
   network. We mechanically test live cells with intranuclear particle
   tracking and compression assays to probe changes in nuclear mechanics
   with decreases in all-spectrin. We show no changes in chromatin
   mechanics or in the stiffness of nuclei under compression. However, we
   do observe a reduction in the ability of nuclei with decreased alpha
   II-spectrin to recover after compression. These results establish
   spectrin as a nucleoskeletal component that specifically contributes to
   elastic recovery after compression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Competing Forces in Chiral Surface Chemistry: Enantiospecificity versus
   Enantiomer Aggregation}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{27285-27295}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{The enantiospecific adsorption of enantiomer mixtures on surfaces is
   dictated by two competing forces: the enantiospecificity of adsorption
   energetics and the propensity of enantiomers to aggregate into
   homochiral (conglomerate) or heterochiral (racemate) clusters. These
   phenomena have been studied by measuring the surface enantiomeric
   excess, ee(s), of chiral amino acid mixtures adsorbed on Cu
   single-crystal surfaces and in equilibrium with gas-phase mixtures of
   varying enantiomeric excess, ee(g). Alanine adsorption on
   Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) surfaces is non- enantiospecific, ee(s) = ee(g),
   because alanine enantiomers do not interact with either the surface or
   with one another enantiospecifically. Aspartic acid adsorbs
   enantiospecifically on the Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) surfaces; ee(s) not equal
   ee(g), even during exposure to a racemic mixture in the gas phase, ee(g)
   = 0. Exposure of the achiral Cu\{111\}\} surface to nonracemic aspartic
   acid, ee(g) not equal 0, results in local amplification of enantiomeric
   excess on the surface, vertical bar ee(s)vertical bar > vertical bar
   ee(g)vertical bar, as a result of homochiral aggregation. Finally,
   despite the fact that the Cu\{653\}(R\&s) surfaces are chiral, the
   adsorption of aspartic acid mixtures yields vertical bar ee(s)vertical
   bar > vertical bar ee(g)vertical bar, indicating that homochiral
   aggregation dominates enantiospecific adsorbate-surface interactions.
   All of these types of behavior are captured by a Langmuir-like
   adsorption isotherm that includes competition between enantiospecific
   adsorption and both homochiral (conglomerate) and heterochiral
   (racemate) aggregation of chiral adsorbates.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on the characterization of polymer electrolyte fuel
   cell (PEFC) cathodes featuring a platinum group metal-free (PGM-free)
   catalyst using nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT)
   and morphological analysis. PGM-free PEFC cathodes have gained
   significant interest in the past decade since they have the potential to
   dramatically reduce PEFC costs by eliminating the large platinum (Pt)
   raw material cost. However, several challenges remain before they are
   commercially viable. Since these catalysts have lower volumetric
   activity, the PGM-free cathodes are thicker and subject to increased gas
   and proton transport resistances that reduce the performance. To better
   understand the efficacy of the catalyst and improve electrode
   performance, a detailed understanding the correlation between electrode
   fabrication, morphology, and performance is crucial. In this work, the
   pore/solid structure and the ionomer distribution was resolved in three
   dimensions (3D) using nano-CT for three PGM-free electrodes of varying
   Nafion loading. The associated transport properties were evaluated from
   pore/particle-scale simulations within the nano-CT-imaged structure.
   These characterizations are then used to elucidate the microstructural
   origins of the dramatic changes in fuel cell performance with varying
   Nafion ionomer loading. We show that this is primarily a result of
   distinct changes in ionomer's spatial distribution. The significant
   impact of electrode morphology on performance highlights the importance
   of PGM-free electrode development in concert with efforts to improve
   catalyst activity and durability.}},

Abstract = {{Using data on the coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) in Texas
   we assess the economic feasibility of retrofitting existing units with
   carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in order to comply with the Clean
   Power Plan's rate-based emission standards under an emission trading
   scheme. CCS with 90\% capture is shown to be more economically
   attractive for a range of existing units than purchasing emission rate
   credits (ERCs) from a trading market at an average credit price above
   \$28 per MWh under the final state standard and \$35 per MWh under the
   final national standard. The breakeven ERC trading prices would decrease
   significantly if the captured CO, were sold for use in enhanced oil
   recovery, making CCS retrofits viable at lower trading prices. The
   combination of ERC trading and CO, use can greatly reinforce economic
   incentives and market demands for CCS and hence accelerate large-scale
   deployment, even under scenarios with high retrofit costs. Comparing the
   levelized costs of electricity generation between CCS retrofits and new
   renewable plants under the ERC trading scheme, retrofitting coal-fired
   EGUs with CCS may be significantly cheaper than new solar plants under
   some market conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is an important
   transformation and detoxification route in the environment. To better
   understand the influence of PCB congener compositions on dechlorination,
   sediments from two rivers, Hudson and Grasse, and two PCB mixtures (PCB
   5/12, 64/71, 105/114, and 149/153/170 in Mixture 1 and PCB 5/12, 64/71,
   82/97/99, and 144/170 in Mixture 2) were used for this microcosm study.
   The Grasse River sediment microcosms exhibited more extensive
   dechlorination than the Hudson River sediment microcosms. The extent of
   dechlorination was predominantly controlled by sediment itself, not by
   the PCB compositions. Rare ortho dechlorination, targeting mono-ortho
   PCB congeners was observed in Grasse sediment, indicating a potential
   for full dechlorination of some PCBs in this sediment. The identified
   ortho dechlorination pathways were PCB 28 (24-4-CB) to PCB 15 (4-4-CB)
   and PCB 25 (24-3-CB) to PCB 13(3-4-CB). The relative abundances of
   Dehalococcoides were much higher in both sediments spiked with PCBs. An
   apparent increase of Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA genes coincided with the
   commencement of dechlorination. The dechlorination preferences were
   identified using a modified data analysis approach focusing on chlorine
   neighboring conditions. In both sediments, the overall dechlorination
   preferred meta > para > ortho. Specially, ortho-/double-flanked
   meta-chlorines were primarily targeted followed by
   single-/double-flanked parachlorines.}},

   impact. The trade-off between feedstocks costs and production rates is
   analyzed by solving the multiple-product model with different time

   polymerization process under uncertainty}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{95}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Model-based dynamic optimization is an effective tool for control and
   optimization of chemical processes, especially during transitions in
   operation. This study considers the dynamic optimization of grade
   transitions for a solution polymerization process. Here, a detailed
   dynamic model comprises the entire flowsheet and includes a
   method-of-moments reactor model to determine product properties, a
   simple yet accurate vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) model derived from
   rigorous calculations, and a variable time delay model for recycle
   streams. To solve the grade transition problem, both single stage and
   multistage optimization formulations have been developed to deal with
   specification bands of product properties.
   This dynamic optimization framework demonstrates significant performance
   improvements for grade transition problems. However, performance can
   deteriorate in the presence of uncertainties, disturbances and model
   mismatch. To deal with these uncertainties, this study applies robust
   optimization formulations through the incorporation of back-off
   constraints within the optimization problem. With back-off terms
   calculated from Monte Carlo simulations, the resulting robust
   optimization formulation can be solved with the same effort as the
   nominal dynamic optimization problem, and the resulting solution is
   shown to be robust under various uncertainty levels with minimal
   performance loss. Additional case studies show that our optimization
   approach extends naturally to different regularizations and multiple
   sources of uncertainty. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Low natural gas prices, market reports and evidence from New York State
   suggest that the number of commercial combined heat and power (CHP)
   installations in the United States will increase by 2\%-9\% annually
   over the next decade. We investigate how increasing commercial CHP
   penetrations may affect net emissions, the distribution network, and
   total system energy costs. We constructed an integrated planning and
   operations model that maximizes owner profit through sizing and
   operation of CHP on a realistic distribution feeder in New York. We find
   that a greater penetration of CHP reduces both total system energy costs
   and network congestion. Commercial buildings often have low and
   inconsistent heat loads, which can cause low fuel utilization
   efficiencies, low CHP rates-of-return and diminishing avoided emissions
   as CHP penetration increases. In the northeast, without policy
   intervention, a 5\% penetration of small commercially owned CHP would
   increase CO2 emissions by 2\% relative to the bulk power grid. Low
   emission CHP installations can be encouraged with incentives that
   promote CHP operation only during times of high heat loads. Time-varying
   rates, such as time-of-day and seasonal rates, are one option and were
   shown to reduce customer emissions without reducing profits. In
   contrast, natural gas rate discounts, a common incentive for industrial
   CHP in some states, can encourage CHP operation during low heat loads
   and thus increase emissions.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{We examine the flexural deformation and snap-through instability of a
   pre-buckled ferroelastomer beam. The beam is composed of ferromagnetic
   and electrically conductive microparticles suspended in a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. Bending and snap-through are
   controlled remotely with an external magnetic field. The observed
   magnetoflexural coupling is in reasonable agreement with predictions
   from an analytic model based on elastic rod theory and variational
   techniques. Moreover, such coupling results in stable and unstable
   bending modes that can be exploited for a soft-matter, field-controlled,
   reconfigurable electrical relay. These two flexural modes correspond to
   (i) low-power binary (stable) switching and (ii) a more rapid > 10 Hz

Abstract = {{In this study, a smart heat pump, which could be used for the cooling of
   electronics, made of laminated structure of thermoelectric (TE) and
   electrocaloric (EC) materials, is studied. A simple arrangement of two
   TE layers sandwiched with one EC layer is modeled. This smart heat pump
   utilized the newly developed EC materials of giant adiabatic temperature
   change and the TE materials of high figure of merit. The system has the
   advantages of no moving parts, made of solid state, operable over large
   working temperature difference, and can be formed into very small size.
   The operation of the device is numerically modeled considering the three
   major parametric effects: EC operation as a function of time, electric
   current applied on TE, and temperature difference between the hot and
   cold sinks. The results on coefficient of performance (COP) and heat
   flow per unit area are discussed. This study is performed as an early
   attempt of analyzing the basic physical features of TE-EC-TE laminated
   structure heat pump and extends the understanding by further discussing
   the tradeoff between lower COP and larger overall temperature difference
   coverage in the TE/EC hybrid heat pump system with multilaminated
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency-dependent mean free paths (MFPs) of vibrational heat
   carriers in amorphous silicon are predicted from the length dependence
   of the spectrally decomposed heat current (SDHC) obtained from
   non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest a
   (frequency)(-2) scaling of the room-temperature MFPs below 5 THz. The
   MFPs exhibit a local maximum at a frequency of 8 THz and fall below 1 nm
   at frequencies greater than 10 THz, indicating localized vibrations. The
   MFPs extracted from sub-10 nm system-size simulations are used to
   predict the length-dependence of thermal conductivity up to system sizes
   of 100 nm and good agreement is found with independent molecular
   dynamics simulations. Weighting the SDHC by the frequency-dependent
   quantum occupation function provides a simple and convenient method to
   account for quantum statistics and provides reasonable agreement with
   the experimentally-measured trend and magnitude. (C) 2016 Author(s). All

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction has been applied in various brain areas to
   study the activity of populations of neurons. To interpret the outputs
   of dimensionality reduction, it is important to first understand its
   outputs for brain areas for which the relationship between the stimulus
   and neural response is well characterized. Here, we applied principal
   component analysis (PCA) to trial-averaged neural responses in macaque
   primary visual cortex (V1) to study two fundamental, population-level
   questions. First, we characterized how neural complexity relates to
   stimulus complexity, where complexity is measured using relative
   comparisons of dimensionality. Second, we assessed the extent to which
   responses to different stimuli occupy similar dimensions of the
   population activity space using a novel statistical method. For
   comparison, we performed the same dimensionality reduction analyses on
   the activity of a recently-proposed V1 receptive field model and a deep
   convolutional neural network. Our results show that the dimensionality
   of the population response changes systematically with alterations in
   the properties and complexity of the visual stimulus.}},

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have applied dimensionality reduction methods to
   understand how the multidimensional structure of neural population
   activity gives rise to brain function. It is unclear, however, how the
   results obtained from dimensionality reduction generalize to recordings
   with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how these results relate to
   the underlying network structure. We address these questions by applying
   factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates
   and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity
   through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling
   trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction D shared
   dimensionality and percent shared variance D with neuron and trial
   count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with
   non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo
   recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore,
   recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant
   modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the
   network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of
   dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial
   sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the resiliency of wireless sensor networks against sensor
   capture attacks when the network uses the random pairwise key
   distribution scheme of Chan et al. We present conditions on the model
   parameters so that the network is: 1) unassailable and 2) unsplittable,
   both with high probability, as the number n of sensor nodes becomes
   large. Both notions are defined against an adversary who has unlimited
   computing resources and full knowledge of the network topology, but can
   only capture a negligible fraction o(n) of sensors. We also show that
   the number of cryptographic keys needed to ensure unassailability and
   unsplittability under the pairwise key predistribution scheme is an
   order of magnitude smaller than it is under the key predistribution
   scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor.}},

Abstract = {{Extracts containing cationic proteins from Moringa oleifera seeds are
   used to reduce drinking water turbidity in developing regions where the
   plant grows. To identify the active components in the seed extract, high
   performance liquid chromatography was employed, and eight M. oleifera
   cationic protein fractions were isolated. The protein fractions were
   characterized using gel electrophoresis (native molecular weights range
   from 12 to 48 kDa, reduced molecular weights range from 7 to 30 kDa),
   dynamic light scattering (radii of strongly cationic fractions are 1.2
   to 1.5 nm), and circular dichroism (strongly cationic fractions are
   mainly comprised of alpha helices). Coagulation performance experiments
   were conducted using a coagulation micro-assay that was validated by
   comparison to a standard jar test. Fraction coagulation performances
   were compared individually and in various combinations against kaolin
   clay suspensions in model freshwaters of varying hardness. Ionic
   strengths of the model freshwaters ranged from 2.29 to 18.33 mM, and
   protein fraction concentrations ranged from 0 to 20 mg/mL. A combination
   of the weakly cationic fractions did not show coagulation activity. In
   diluted soft through moderately hard water, the individual strongly
   cationic fractions were effective at low dosages across a narrow range.
   Combinations of the strongly cationic fractions, of all cationic
   fractions, and of all cationic and non-cationic fractions were effective
   across broad ranges that encompassed low and medium dosages. The range
   of effective coagulant concentrations broadened for all individual
   fractions and combinations as water hardness increased. In model hard
   water, kaolin is inherently unstable, so protein additives are
   unnecessary to induce flocculation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The structure of a series of lanthanide iron cobalt perovskite oxides,
   R(Fe0.5Co0.5)O-3 (R = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd), have been investigated.
   The space group of these compounds was confirmed to be orthorhombic Pnma
   (No. 62), Z = 4. From Pr to Gd, the lattice parameter a varies from
   5.466 35(13) angstrom to 5.507 10(13) angstrom, b from 7.7018(2) to
   7.561 75(13) angstrom, c from 5.443 38(10) to 5.292 00(8) angstrom, and
   unit-cell volume V from 229.170(9) angstrom(3) to 220.376(9)
   angstrom(3), respectively. While the trend of V follows the trend of the
   lanthanide contraction, the lattice parameter ``a{''} increases as the
   ionic radius r(R3+) decreases. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission
   electron microscopy confirm that Fe and Co are disordered over the
   octahedral sites. The structure distortion of these compounds is
   evidenced in the tilt angles theta, phi, and omega, which represent
   rotations of an octahedron about the pseudocubic perovskite {[}110](p),
   {[}001](p), and {[}111](p) axes. All three tilt angles increase across
   the lanthanide series (for R = Pr to R = Gd:. theta increases from 12.3
   degrees to 15.2 degrees, f from 7.5 degrees to 15.8 degrees, and omega
   from 14.4 degrees to 21.7 degrees), indicating a greater octahedral
   distortion as r(R3+) decreases. The bond valence sum for the sixfold
   (Fe/Co) site and the eightfold R site of R(Fe0.5Co0.5)O-3 reveal no
   significant bond strain. Density Functional Theory calculations for
   Pr(Fe0.5Co0.5)O-3 support the disorder of Fe and Co and suggest that
   this compound to be a narrow band gap semiconductor. XRD patterns of the
   R(Fe0.5Co0.5)O-3 samples were submitted to the Powder Diffraction File.

Title = {{Ultra-miniature ultra-compliant neural probes with dissolvable delivery
   needles: design, fabrication and characterization}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Stable chronic functionality of intracortical probes is of utmost
   importance toward realizing clinical application of brain-machine
   interfaces. Sustained immune response from the brain tissue to the
   neural probes is one of the major challenges that hinder stable chronic
   functionality. There is a growing body of evidence in the literature
   that highly compliant neural probes with sub-cellular dimensions may
   significantly reduce the foreign-body response, thereby enhancing long
   term stability of intracortical recordings. Since the prevailing
   commercial probes are considerably larger than neurons and of high
   stiffness, new approaches are needed for developing miniature probes
   with high compliance. In this paper, we present design, fabrication, and
   in vitro evaluation of ultra-miniature (2.7 mu m x 10 mu m cross
   section), ultra-compliant (1.4 x 10(-2) mu N/mu m in the axial
   direction, and 2.6 x 10(-5) mu N/mu m and 1.8 x 10(-6) mu N/mu m in the
   lateral directions) neural probes and associated probe-encasing
   biodissolvable delivery needles toward addressing the aforementioned
   challenges. The high compliance of the probes is obtained by
   micron-scale cross-section and meandered shape of the parylene-C
   insulated platinum wiring. Finite-element analysis is performed to
   compare the strains within the tissue during micromotion when using the
   ultra-compliant meandered probes with that when using stiff silicon
   probes. The standard batch microfabrication techniques are used for
   creating the probes. A dissolvable delivery needle that encases the
   probe facilitates failure-free insertion and precise placement of the
   ultra-compliant probes. Upon completion of implantation, the needle
   gradually dissolves, leaving behind the ultra-compliant neural probe. A
   spin-casting based micromolding approach is used for the fabrication of
   the needle. To demonstrate the versatility of the process, needles from
   different biodissolvable materials, as well as two-dimensional needle
   arrays with different geometries and dimensions, are fabricated.
   Further, needles incorporating anti-inflammatory drugs are created to
   show the co-delivery potential of the needles. An automated insertion
   device is developed for repeatable and precise implantation of
   needle-encased probes into brain tissue. Insertion of the needles
   without mechanical failure, and their subsequent dissolution are
   demonstrated. It is concluded that ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant
   probes and associated biodissolvable delivery needles can be
   successfully fabricated, and the use of the ultra-compliant meandered
   probes results in drastic reduction in strains imposed in the tissue as
   compared to stiff probes, thereby showing promise toward chronic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report a flexible field-effecttransistor (FET)
   biosensor design based on two-dimensional (2-D) polyaniline (PANI)
   nanostructure. The flexible biosensor devices were fabricated through a
   facile and inexpensive method that combines top-down and bottom-up
   processes. The chemically synthesized PANI nanostructure showed
   excellent p-type semiconductor properties as well as good compatibility
   with flexible design. With the 2-D PANI nanostructure being as thin as
   80 nm and its extremely large surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio due to
   the intrinsic properties of PANI chemical synthesis, the developed
   flexible biosensor exhibited outstanding sensing performance in
   detecting B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) biomarkers, and was able to
   achieve high specificity (averagely 112 folds) with the limit of
   detection as low as 100 pg/mL. PANI nanostructure under bending
   condition was also investigated and showed controllable conductance
   changes being less than 20\% with good restorability whichmay open up
   the possibility for wearable applications.}},

Title = {{Polymer ligand-induced autonomous sorting and reversible phase
   separation in binary particle blends}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The tethering of ligands to nanoparticles has emerged as an important
   strategy to control interactions and organization in particle assembly
   structures. We demonstrate that ligand interactions in mixtures of
   polymer-tethered nanoparticles (which are modified with distinct types
   of polymer chains) can impart upper or lower critical solution
   temperature (UCST/LCST)-type phase behavior on binary particle mixtures
   in analogy to the phase behavior of the corresponding linear polymer
   blends. Therefore, cooling (or heating) of polymer-tethered particle
   blends with appropriate architecture to temperatures below (or above)
   the UCST (or LCST) results in the organization of the individual
   particle constituents into monotype microdomain structures. The shape
   (bicontinuous or island-type) and length-scale of particle microdomains
   can be tuned by variation of the composition and thermal process
   conditions. Thermal cycling of LCST particle brush blends through the
   critical temperature enables the reversible growth and dissolution of
   monoparticle domain structures. The ability to autonomously and
   reversibly organize multicomponent particle mixtures into monotype
   microdomain structures could enable transformative advances in the
   high-throughput fabrication of solid films with tailored and mutable
   structures and properties that play an important role in a range of
   nanoparticle-based material technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The active management of electricity demand, also referred to as demand
   side management (DSM), has been recognized as an effective approach to
   improving power grid performance and consumer benefits. Being large
   electricity consumers, the power-intensive process industries play a key
   role in DSM. In particular, enterprise-wide optimization (EWO) for
   industrial DSM has emerged as a major area of interest for both
   researchers and practitioners. In this work, we introduce the reader to
   the fundamentals of power system economics, provide a definition of DSM
   that reflects more strongly the consumer's perspective, and present a
   comprehensive review of existing works on EWO for industrial DSM. The
   review is organized into four parts, which correspond to the four main
   challenges that we identify as: (1) accurate modeling of operational
   flexibility, (2) integration of production and energy management, (3)
   decision-making across multiple time and space scales, and (4)
   optimization under uncertainty. Finally, we highlight research gaps and
   future opportunities in this area. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Problems faced by engineering students involve multiple pathways to
   solution. Students rarely receive effective formative feedback on
   handwritten homework. This paper examines the potential for
   computer-based formative assessment of student solutions to multipath
   engineering problems. In particular, an intelligenttutor approach is
   adopted and tested out on problems of truss analysis, studied in
   engineering statics. With a cognitive model for solving the class of
   problems, the tutor allows the student wide latitude in solution steps,
   while maintaining sufficient constraints for judging the solution and
   offering feedback. Proper selection of judging points prevents
   interference with productive student work, while avoiding accumulated
   errors. To monitor student learning, efforts to apply distinct skills
   were extracted on the fly from student work. Using statistical methods
   developed for intelligent tutoring systems, metrics of the effectiveness
   of the feedback and areas for further improvements were gleaned from
   error rates in successive opportunities to apply distinct skills.}},

Abstract = {{Providing broadband to schools can be an effective way to foster
   household Internet adoption in neighboring areas. On the one hand, the
   infrastructure put into place to meet schools' needs can also serve
   households. On the other hand, students get acquainted with the Internet
   at school and signal its usefulness to adults at home who, consequently,
   can be more likely to adopt it. In this paper, we model the roles that
   broadband use at school and Internet adoption in neighboring households
   play in the decision to adopt the Internet at home and measure their
   effects empirically. We use data from Portugal between 2006 and 2009 on
   household Internet penetration and on how much schools use broadband. We
   use two different sets of instruments for the schools' broadband use to
   alleviate endogeneity concerns. Both approaches yield similar results.
   We find that broadband use at school leads to higher levels of Internet
   penetration in neighboring households. Broadband use in schools was
   responsible for a year-over-year increase of 3.5 percentage points on
   Internet penetration in households with children. Across our data set
   this effect accounts for about 17\% of the increase in home Internet
   adoption. We also find evidence of regional spillovers in Internet
   adoption across households. These were roughly responsible for an
   increase of 2.1 percentage points in Internet penetration or 38\% of the
   total increase in household Internet penetration between 2006 and 2009.
   These results show that wiring schools with broadband is an effective
   policy to lower the barriers for Internet adoption at home and as such
   contributes to accelerating the pace of broadband diffusion.}},

   purity iron}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{6-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High purity (99.99\%) iron samples were cold rolled with a thickness
   reduction of 87\% followed by a annealing at 620 degrees C for 15 and 45
   min, then the grain boundary plane distributions were characterized by
   electron backscatter diffraction and a stereology and statistics based
   five parameter analysis. The results showed that the grain boundary
   planes were mainly distributed on \{1 0 0\} and such distribution was
   enhanced obviously when the holding time of annealing increased from 15
   to 45 min during which an extensive grain growth and a dramatic texture
   evolution took place. Further analysis indicated such distribution was
   largely due to the rotation of grain boundary planes of the {[}1 0 0]
   misoriented grains. Additionally, it was also observed that some random
   boundaries of {[}1 0 0] misoriented grains were changing from
   asymmetrical tilt into (1 0 0)/(-1 0 0) twist when annealing proceeded
   from 15 to 45 min. Based on the present work and the results reported by
   other investigators, it was suggested that the chemistry appeared to be
   critical in determining the grain boundary plane distribution in iron
   based materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chestnut-like SnO2 and SnO2/C nanocomposites with hierarchical
   structures are synthesized by hydro thermally oxidizing Sn nanoparticles
   in glucose solution. Structural characterizations using SEM and TEM
   reveal that the SnO2 nanoparticles are composed of numerous, randomly
   arranged SnO2 nanosheets with hollow cores. Owing to the short electron
   and ion diffusion distances and transformation strain accommodation
   mechanism of this structure the new SnO2/C nanocomposites exhibit
   enhanced lithium ion storage properties with a capacity of similar to
   930 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention of about 96\% after 100 cycles at
   0.1 C. An in situ TEM study of the electrochemically driven
   lithiation/delithiation of SnO2/C nanocomposites reveals that their
   enhanced cycling stability is mainly facilitated by the limited volume
   expansion and excellent mechanical robustness of the hollow chestnuts.

Title = {{High fidelity computational simulation of thrombus formation in Thoratec
   HeartMate II continuous flow ventricular assist device}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Continuous flow ventricular assist devices (cfVADs) provide a
   life-saving therapy for severe heart failure. However, in recent years,
   the incidence of device-related thrombosis (resulting in stroke,
   device-exchange surgery or premature death) has been increasing
   dramatically, which has alarmed both the medical community and the FDA.
   The objective of this study was to gain improved understanding of the
   initiation and progression of thrombosis in one of the most commonly
   used cfVADs, the Thoratec HeartMate II. A computational fluid dynamics
   simulation (CFD) was performed using our recently updated mathematical
   model of thrombosis. The patterns of deposition predicted by simulation
   agreed well with clinical observations. Furthermore, thrombus
   accumulation was found to increase with decreased flow rate, and can be
   completely suppressed by the application of anticoagulants and/or
   improvement of surface chemistry. To our knowledge, this is the first
   simulation to explicitly model the processes of platelet deposition and
   thrombus growth in a continuous flow blood pump and thereby replicate
   patterns of deposition observed clinically. The use of this simulation
   tool over a range of hemodynamic, hematological, and anticoagulation
   conditions could assist physicians to personalize clinical management to
   mitigate the risk of thrombosis. It may also contribute to the design of
   future VADs that are less thrombogenic.}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic islet transplantation (PIT) represents a potential therapy to
   circumvent the need for exogenous insulin in type 1 diabetes. However,
   PIT remains limited by lack of donor islets and the need for long-term
   multidrug immunosuppression to prevent alloimmune islet rejection. Our
   goal was to evaluate a local immunoregulatory strategy that sustains
   islet allograft survival and restores glucose homeostasis in the absence
   of systemic immunosuppression. Nanogram quantities of murine CTLA4/Fc
   fusion protein were controllably delivered within human acellular dermal
   matrix scaffolds using an inkjet-based biopatterning technology and
   cotransplanted with allogeneic islets under the renal capsule to create
   an immunoregulatory microenvironment around the islet allograft. We
   achieved long-term engraftment of small loads of allogeneic islet cells
   with 40\% of MHC-mismatched mouse recipients maintaining sustained
   normoglycemia following pancreatic beta-cell ablation by streptozotocin.
   Biopatterned CTLA4/Fc local therapy was associated with expansion of
   Foxpr regulatory T cells and shifts in cytokine production and gene
   expression from proinflammatory to regulatory profiles, thus
   substantially benefiting islet allografts survival and function. This
   study is a new paradigm for targeted therapies in PIT that demonstrates
   the favorable effects of immune alterations in the transplant milieu and
   suggests a unique strategy for minimizing systemic immunosuppression and
   promoting islet allograft survival.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a comparative framework for the design of actuated
   inertial appendages for planar aerial reorientation. We define the
   inertial reorientation template, the simplest model of this behavior,
   and leverage its linear dynamics to reveal the design constraints
   linking a task with the body designs capable of completing it. As
   practicable inertial appendage designs lead to morphology that is
   generally more complex, we advance a notion of ``anchoring,{''} whereby
   a judicious choice of physical design in concert with an appropriate
   control policy yields a system whose closed-loop dynamics are
   sufficiently captured by the template to permit all further designs to
   take place in its far simpler parameter space. This approach is
   effective and accurate over the diverse design spaces afforded by
   existing platforms, enabling a performance comparison through the shared
   task space. We analyze examples from the literature and find advantages
   to each body type, but conclude that tails provide the highest potential
   performance for reasonable designs. Thus motivated, we build a physical
   example by retrofitting a tail to a RHex robot and present empirical
   evidence of its efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{This study showed that MgO inclusions can be stable in liquid iron with
   elevated Al and it illustrated an important role of vaporization in the
   evolution of inclusions. Previous studies have shown that dissolved Al
   reduces MgO from slags and refractories, leading to spinel (MgAl2O4)
   inclusions. The elevated Al content of newer steels raises the
   possibility that MgO inclusions can be stable. In this work, MgO
   inclusions were produced and observed in an Fe-Al alloy. The inclusions
   in the liquid alloy at 1873 K (1600 degrees C) were observed in situ
   with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM). Two types of
   experiments were performed: one where only a metal sample was melted and
   the other where the sample was in contact with a liquid, MgO-saturated
   slag. When no slag was present, the MgO inclusions shrank and
   disappeared at 1873 K (1600 degrees C). No inclusions were observed in
   situ during cooling or in post-CLSM analysis. When the MgO-saturated
   slag was present, the inclusion sizes were essentially constant and MgO
   was observed on the surface of post-CLSM samples. Analysis of the
   results showed that MgO can be stable in 1873 K (1600 degrees C), but
   that its presence depends on the rate of removal of Mg due to
   vaporization and the supply of Mg due to slag/metal or refractory/metal
   reactions. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Congestion prediction can support traffic departments to take effective
   traffic management measures, and it aids users to adopt smarter trip
   strategies, including route and departure time selection. This paper
   proposes an adaptive data-driven real-time congestion prediction method.
   The method framework includes a traffic pattern recognition algorithm
   based on the adaptive K-means clustering, a two-dimensional speed
   prediction model and an adaptive threshold calibration method. After the
   principal component analysis, the adaptive K-means cluster algorithm is
   conducted to obtain different traffic patterns. Congestion recognition
   is realized with an adaptive threshold calibration method and congestion
   prediction is then raised according to different traffic patterns.
   Parameter calibration and model evaluation are carried out on the
   proposed method using floating car travel speed data. The results show
   that the adaptive K-means cluster recognition algorithm can better
   recognize the traffic patterns than Gaussian Mixture model, and the
   proposed congestion prediction method has better real-time performance,
   accuracy and robustness than Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
   model and Kalman Filtering method.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient performance modeling is an extremely important task for yield
   analysis and design optimization of analog circuits. In this paper, a
   novel regression modeling method based on hierarchical shrinkage priors
   is proposed to construct hybrid performance models with both high
   accuracy and low computational cost. In particular, the user-defined
   model templates derived from design equations and the general-purpose
   orthogonal polynomials are combined together to set up a hybrid
   dictionary. Next, in order to avoid over-shrinking large model
   coefficients, a novel regression method based on hierarchical shrinkage
   priors and variational Bayesian inference is adopted for model fitting.
   A rail-to-rail operational amplifier example demonstrates that the
   proposed method achieves up to 40\% error reduction over other
   state-of-the-art approaches without increasing the modeling cost.}},

   The khopesh was the first sword style, originating during the Bronze Age

Abstract = {{Climate change poses new and unique challenges that threaten lives and
   livelihoods. Given the increasing risks and looming uncertainty of
   climate change, increasing attention has been directed towards
   adaptation, or the strategies that enable humanity to persist and thrive
   through climate change the best it can. Though climate change is a
   global problem often discussed at the national scale, urban areas are
   increasingly seen as having a distinct role, and distinctive motivation
   and capacity, for adaptation. The 12 articles in this special issue
   explore ways of understanding and addressing climate change impacts on
   urban areas. Together they reveal young but rapidly growing scholarship
   on how to measure, and then overcome, challenges of climate change. Two
   key themes emerge in this issue: 1) that we must identify and then
   overcome current barriers to urban adaptation and 2) frameworks/metrics
   are necessary to identify and track adaptation progress in urban
   settings. Both of these themes point to the power of indicators and
   other quantitative information to inform priorities and illuminate the
   pathway forward for adaptation. As climate change is an entirely new
   challenge, careful measurement that enables investment by private and
   public parties is necessary to provide efficient outcomes that benefit
   the greatest number of people. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have been increasingly adopted to
   detect the dynamic strain of structures. When the sensor is attached on
   the surface, adhesive material is employed to assist the installation,
   which leads to indirect contact of sensing fibre and the monitored
   structure. To correct the strain transfer error induced by the shear lag
   effect and improve the measurement accuracy of FBG sensors under dynamic
   response, strain transfer mechanism of a three-layered testing model
   constituted of sensing fibre, adhesive layer and host material has been
   studied in this paper. Laboratory test on steel beam attached with FBG
   sensor under fatigue load has been projected to investigate the
   feasibility of the derived strain transfer formula, and numerical
   simulation by MATLAB has been used as a supporting tool to offer the
   reference dynamic strain. Based on the analysis, sensitive parameters
   that affect the strain transfer coefficient have been discussed to
   instruct the application design of FBG sensors. Results indicate that
   strain transfer coefficient under dynamic response is much lower than
   that in static state, and error modification is particularly
   significant; in the dynamic testing model, bonded length, shear modulus
   and thickness of adhesive layer are more sensitive, which should be
   precisely selected in practical engineering to guarantee the effective
   strain measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Since the Global Warming Potential (GWP) was first presented in the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) First Assessment
   Report, the metric has been scrutinized and alternative metrics have
   been suggested. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report gives a scientific
   assessment of the main recent findings from climate metrics research and
   provides the most up-to-date values for a subset of metrics and time
   horizons. The objectives of this paper are to perform a systematic
   review of available midpoint metrics (i.e. using an indicator situated
   in the middle of the cause-effect chain from emissions to climate
   change) for well-mixed greenhouse gases and near-term climate forcers
   based on the current literature, to provide recommendations for the
   development and use of characterization factors for climate change in
   life cycle assessment (LCA), and to identify research needs. This work
   is part of the `Global Guidance on Environmental Life Cycle Impact
   Assessment' project held by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative and is
   intended to support a consensus finding workshop. In an LCA context, it
   can make sense to use several complementary metrics that serve different
   purposes, and from there get an understanding about the robustness of
   the LCA study to different perspectives and metrics. We propose a
   step-by-step approach to test the sensitivity of LCA results to
   different modelling choices and provide recommendations for specific
   issues such as the consideration of climate-carbon feedbacks and the
   inclusion of pollutants with cooling effects (negative metric values).

Abstract = {{Applications on wearable personal imaging devices, or Smart-glasses as
   they are called, can largely benefit from accurate and energy-efficient
   recognition of objects that are within the user's view. Existing
   solutions such as optical or computer vision approaches are too energy
   intensive, while low-power active radio tags suffer from imprecise
   orientation estimates. To address this challenge, this paper presents
   the design, implementation, and evaluation of a radio-optical hybrid
   system where a radio-optical transmitter, or tag, whose radio-optical
   beacons are used for accurate relative orientation tracking of tagged
   objects by a wearable radio-optical receiver. A low-power radio link
   that conveys identity is used to reduce the battery drain by
   synchronizing the radio-optical transmitter and receiver so that
   extremely short optical (infrared) pulses are sufficient for orientation
   (angle and distance) estimation. Through extensive experiments with our
   prototype we show that our system can achieve orientation estimates with
   1-to-2 degree accuracy and within 40 cm ranging error, with a maximum
   range of 9 m in typical indoor use cases. With a tag and receiver
   battery power consumption of 81 mu W and 90 mW, respectively, our
   radio-optical tags and receiver are at least 1.5x energy efficient than
   prior works in this space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on recursive nonlinear least-squares parameter
   estimation in multiagent networks, where the individual agents observe
   sequentially over time an independent and identically distributed
   time-series consisting of a nonlinear function of the true but unknown
   parameter corrupted by noise. A distributed recursive estimator of the
   consensus+ innovations type, namely CIWNLS, is proposed, in which the
   agents update their parameter estimates at each observation sampling
   epoch in a collaborative way by simultaneously processing the latest
   locally sensed information (innovations) and the parameter estimates
   from other agents (consensus) in the local neighborhood conforming to a
   prespecified interagent communication topology. Under rather weak
   conditions on the connectivity of the interagent communication and a
   global observability criterion, it is shown that, at every network
   agent, CIWNLS leads to consistent parameter estimates. Furthermore,
   under standard smoothness assumptions on the local observation
   functions, the distributed estimator is shown to yield order-optimal
   convergence rates, i.e., as far as the order of pathwise convergence is
   concerned, the local parameter estimates at each agent are as good as
   the optimal centralized nonlinear least-squares estimator that requires
   access to all the observations across all the agents at all times. To
   benchmark the performance of the CIWNLS estimator with that of the
   centralized nonlinear least-squares estimator, the asymptotic normality
   of the estimate sequence is established, and the asymptotic covariance
   of the distributed estimator is evaluated. Finally, simulation results
   are presented that illustrate and verify the analytical findings.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds theoretical foundations for the recovery of a newly
   proposed class of smooth graph signals, approximately bandlimited graph
   signals, under three sampling strategies: uniform sampling,
   experimentally designed sampling, and active sampling. We then state
   minimax lower bounds on the maximum risk for the approximately
   bandlimited class under these three sampling strategies and show that
   active sampling cannot fundamentally outperform experimentally designed
   sampling. We propose a recovery strategy to compare uniform sampling
   with experimentally designed sampling. As the proposed recovery strategy
   lends itself well to statistical analysis, we derive the exact mean
   square error for each sampling strategy. To study convergence rates, we
   introduce two types of graphs and find that 1) the proposed recovery
   strategy achieves the optimal rates; and 2) the experimentally designed
   sampling fundamentally outperforms uniform sampling for Type-2 class of
   graphs. To validate our proposed recovery strategy, we test it on five
   specific graphs: a ring graph with k nearest neighbors, an Erdos-Renyi
   graph, a random geometric graph, a small-world graph, and a power-law
   graph and find that experimental results match the proposed theory well.
   This paper also presents a comprehensive explanation for when and why
   sampling for semi-supervised learning with graphs works.}},

   the semi-edge of the cubochoric cube. A method to uniformly sample
   misorientation iso-surfaces is also presented. This method is used to
   show that the dot product serves as a proxy for misorientation.
   Furthermore, it is shown that misorientation iso-surfaces in Rodrigues
   space are quadractic surfaces. Finally, using the concept of Riesz
   energies, it is shown that the sampling method results in a near optimal

Abstract = {{Designing networks with specified collective properties is useful in a
   variety of application areas, enabling the study of how given properties
   affect the behavior of network models, the downscaling of empirical
   networks to workable sizes, and the analysis of network temporal

   gap in our ability to systematically generate networks that adhere to
   theoretical guarantees for the given property specifications. In
   thisarticle, we propose the use of Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization
   modeling and solution methodologies to address this Network Generation
   Problem. We present useful modeling techniques and apply them to
   mathematically express and constrain a broad class of network properties
   in the context of an optimization formulation. We derive complete
   formulations for the generation of networks that attain specified levels
   of connectivity, spread, assortativity and robustness, and we illustrate
   these via a number of computational case studies. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper presents a proof of concept for a graphical models approach
   to assessing the moral coherence and moral robustness of systems of
   social interactions. ``Moral coherence{''} refers to the degree to which
   the rights and duties of agents within a system are effectively
   respected when agents in the system comply with the rights and duties
   that are recognized as in force for the relevant context of interaction.
   ``Moral robustness{''} refers to the degree to which a system of social
   interaction is configured to ensure that the interests of agents are
   effectively respected even in the face of noncompliance. Using the case
   of conscientious objection of pharmacists to filling prescriptions for
   emergency contraception as an example, we illustrate how a graphical
   models approach can help stakeholders identify structural weaknesses in
   systems of social interaction and evaluate the relativemerits of
   alternate organizational structures. By illustrating the merits of a
   graphical models approach we hope to spur further developments in this

Abstract = {{The main learning activity provided by intelligent tutoring systems is
   problem solving, although several recent projects investigated the
   effectiveness of combining problem solving with worked examples.
   Previous research has shown that learning from examples is an effective
   learning strategy, especially for novice learners. A worked example
   provides step-by-step explanations of how a problem is solved. Many
   studies have compared learning from examples to unsupported problem
   solving, and suggested presenting worked examples to students in the
   initial stages of learning, followed by problem solving once students
   have acquired enough knowledge. This paper presents a study in which we
   compare a fixed sequence of alternating worked examples and tutored
   problem solving with a strategy that adapts learning tasks to students'
   needs. The adaptive strategy determines the type of the task (a worked
   example, a faded example or a problem to be solved) based on how much
   assistance the student received on the previous problem. The results
   show that students in the adaptive condition learnt significantly more
   than their peers who were presented with a fixed sequence of worked
   examples and problem solving. Novices from the adaptive condition learnt
   faster than novices from the control group, while the advanced students
   from the adaptive condition learnt more than their peers from the
   control group.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient assembly of HIV-1 at the plasma membrane (PM) of the T-cell
   specifically requires PI(4,5)P-2. It was previously shown that a highly
   basic region (HBR) of the matrix protein (MA) on the Gag precursor
   polyprotein Pr55(Gag) is required for membrane association. MA is
   N-terminally myristoylated, which enhances its affinity to membranes. In
   this work we used X-ray scattering and neutron reflectivity to determine
   how the physical properties and structure of lipid bilayers respond to
   the addition of binding domain peptides, either in the myristoylated
   form (MA(31)myr) or without the myristoyl group (MA(31)). Neutron
   reflectivity measurements showed the peptides predominantly located in
   the hydrocarbon interior. Diffuse X-ray scattering showed differences in
   membrane properties upon addition of peptides and the direction of the
   changes depended on lipid composition. The PI(4,5)P-2-containing
   bilayers softened, thinned and became less ordered as peptide
   concentration increased. In contrast, POPS-containing bilayers with
   equivalent net charge first stiffened, thickened and became more ordered
   with increasing peptide concentration. As softening the host cell's PM
   upon contact with the protein lowers the free energy for membrane
   restructuring, thereby potentially facilitating budding of viral
   particles, our results suggest that the role of PI(4,5)P-2 in viral
   assembly goes beyond specific stereochemical membrane binding. These
   studies reinforce the importance of lipids in virology. (C) 2016

Title = {{Quantifying Phishing Susceptibility for Detection and Behavior Decisions}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},

Number = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We use signal detection theory to measure vulnerability to
   phishing attacks, including variation in performance across task
   conditions.
   Background: Phishing attacks are difficult to prevent with technology
   alone, as long as technology is operated by people. Those responsible
   for managing security risks must understand user decision making in
   order to create and evaluate potential solutions.
   Method: Using a scenario-based online task, we performed two experiments
   comparing performance on two tasks: detection, deciding whether an
   e-mail is phishing, and behavior, deciding what to do with an e-mail. In
   Experiment 1, we manipulated the order of the tasks and notification of
   the phishing base rate. In Experiment 2, we varied which task
   participants performed.
   Results: In both experiments, despite exhibiting cautious behavior,
   participants' limited detection ability left them vulnerable to phishing
   attacks. Greater sensitivity was positively correlated with confidence.
   Greater willingness to treat e-mails as legitimate was negatively
   correlated with perceived consequences from their actions and positively
   correlated with confidence. These patterns were robust across
   experimental conditions.
   Conclusion: Phishing-related decisions are sensitive to individuals'
   detection ability, response bias, confidence, and perception of
   consequences. Performance differs when people evaluate messages or
   respond to them but not when their task varies in other ways.
   Application: Based on these results, potential interventions include
   providing users with feedback on their abilities and information about
   the consequences of phishing, perhaps targeting those with the worst
   performance. Signal detection methods offer system operators
   quantitative assessments of the impacts of interventions and their
   residual vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{A proof-of-concept for an advanced-level computerized training tool for
   cryosurgery is demonstrated, based on three-dimensional cryosurgery
   simulations and a variable insertion depth strategy for cryoprobes. The
   objective for system development is two-fold: to identify a cryoprobe
   layout in order to best match a planning isotherm with the target region
   shape and to verify that cryoprobe placement does not violate accepted
   geometric constraints. System validation has been performed by
   collecting training data from 17 surgical residents having no prior
   experience or advanced knowledge of cryosurgery. This advanced-level
   study includes an improved training session design in order to enhance
   knowledge dissemination and elevate participant motivation to excel. In
   terms of match between a planning isotherm and the target region shape,
   results of this demonstrate trainee performance improvement from 4.4\%
   in a pretest to 44.4\% in a posttest over a course of 50 minutes of
   training. In terms of combined performance, including the
   above-mentioned geometrical match and constraints on cryoprobe
   placement, this study demonstrates trainee performance improvement from
   2.2\% in the pretest to 31.1\% in the posttest. Given the relatively
   short training session and the lack of prior knowledge, these
   improvements are significant and encouraging. These results are of
   particular significance, as they have been obtained from a surgical
   resident population which are exposed to the typical stress and
   constraints in advanced surgical education.}},

Abstract = {{Refracturing is a promising option for addressing the characteristically
   steep decline curves of shale gas wells. In this work we propose two
   optimization models to address the refracturing planning problem. First,
   we present a continuous-time nonlinear programming model based on a
   novel forecast function that predicts pre- and post-treatment
   productivity declines. Next, we propose a discrete-time, multi-period
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that explicitly accounts
   for the possibility of multiple refracture treatments over the lifespan
   of a well. In an attempt to reduce solution times to a minimum, we
   compare three alternative formulations against each other (big-M
   formulation, disjunctive formulation using Standard and Compact
   Hull-Reformulations) and find that the disjunctive models yield the best
   computational performance. Finally, we apply the proposed MILP model to
   two case studies to demonstrate how refracturing can increase the
   expected recovery of a well and improve its profitability by several
   hundred thousand USD. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{A second-order-accurate finite-volume method is developed for the
   solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on locally refined
   nested Cartesian grids. Numerical accuracy and stability on locally
   refined nested Cartesian grids are achieved using a finite-volume
   discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on
   higher-order conservation principles - i.e., in addition to mass and
   momentum conservation, kinetic energy conservation in the inviscid limit
   is used to guide the selection of the discrete operators and solution
   algorithms. Hanging nodes at the interface are virtually slanted to
   improve the pressure-velocity projection, while the other parts of the
   grid maintain an orthogonal Cartesian grid topology. The present method
   is straight-forward to implement and shows superior conservation of
   mass, momentum, and kinetic energy compared to the conventional methods
   employing interpolation at the interface between coarse and fine grids.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Discrete dislocation dynamics simulations have been generally limited to
   modeling systems described by isotropic elasticity. Effects of
   anisotropy on dislocation interactions, which can be quite large, have
   generally been ignored because of the computational expense involved
   when including anisotropic elasticity. We present a different formalism
   of dislocation dynamics in which the dislocations are represented by the
   deformation tensor, which is a direct measure of the slip in the lattice
   caused by the dislocations and can be considered as an eigenstrain. The
   stresses arising from the dislocations are calculated with a fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) method, from which the forces are determined and
   the equations of motion are solved. Use of the FFTs means that the
   stress field is only available at the grid points, which requires some
   adjustments/regularizations to be made to the representation of the
   dislocations and the calculation of the force on individual segments, as
   is discussed hereinafter. A notable advantage of this approach is that
   there is no computational penalty for including anisotropic elasticity.
   We review the method and apply it in a simple dislocation dynamics
   calculation.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of this paper is a nonparametric filtering technique for
   the estimation of interface geometry in bulk materials obtainable from
   modern imaging measurements. The filtering methodology relies on an
   assumed hierarchy of topological features present in a typical interface
   network, such as foam interfaces and grain boundary networks in
   polycrystalline materials. Each type of topological feature is treated
   in order of rank in the hierarchy, with the lower-level feature being
   filtered subject to the positional constraints imposed by the
   higher-level features. Such a scheme is an alternative to existing
   surface smoothing/estimation techniques in microstructural materials
   science, in which the explicit treatment of different elements of the
   network topology is absent, or at best arbitrarily parameterized. We
   describe the ramifications of this technique in the usual
   microstructural applications in which the computation of important
   physical quantities is predicated on the precise estimation of the
   interface features. As an additional application, we describe a novel
   front-tracking algorithm for quantifying the transport of such
   interfaces. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale smart grids call for online algorithms that are able to
   achieve the most accurate estimates. This paper shows how to achieve
   both the scalability and near globally optimal results for bad data and
   topology error detection and identification problems, by conducting
   fully distributed algorithms over convexified problem formulations. The
   proposed distributed decomposition is realized by (1) reducing a large
   network into much smaller network ``cliques{''} which do not need
   extensive information exchange; (2) performing a Lagrangian dual
   decomposition in each clique and passing messages between cliques; and
   (3) conducting alternative coordinate descent optimization for
   robustness. To reduce the relaxation error in the convexification
   procedure, a nuclear norm penalty is added to approximate original
   problems. Finally, we propose a new metric to evaluate detection and
   identification results, which enables a system operator to characterize
   confidence for further system operations. We show that the proposed
   algorithms can be realized on IEEE test systems with improved accuracy
   in a short time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, mathematical modeling and simulation of diseases and their
   treatments have enabled the prediction of clinical outcomes and the
   design of optimal therapies on a personalized (i.e., patient-specific)
   basis. This new trend in medical research has been termed ``predictive
   medicine.{''} Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health problem and an
   ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer
   growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second,
   tumor growth can be estimated by measuring serum prostate-specific
   antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo
   validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that
   reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to
   account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use
   diffusion-reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA
   production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our
   simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to
   reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to
   fingered growth. Results of our computations indicate that such shift is
   a tumor response to escape starvation, hypoxia, and, eventually,
   necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance
   from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival
   and further development. We have also used our model to perform
   tissue-scale, personalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on
   prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This
   simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 2012 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were
   monitored by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) in
   urban sites, in Athens and Patras, two of the largest cities in Greece.
   Also, during the winter of 2013, PTR-MS measurements were conducted in
   the center of the city of Athens. Positive matrix factorization (PMF)
   was applied to the VOC measurements to gain insights about their
   sources.
   In summer most of the measured VOCs were due to biogenic and traffic
   emissions. Isoprene, monoterpenes, and several oxygenated VOCs (oVOCs)
   originated mainly from vegetation either directly or as oxidation
   products. Isoprene average concentrations in Patras and Athens were 1
   and 0.7 ppb respectively, while the monoterpene concentrations were 0.3
   and 0.9 ppb respectively. Traffic was the main source of aromatic
   compounds during summer. For Patras and Athens the average
   concentrations of benzene were 0.1 and 0.2 ppb, of toluene 0.3 and 0.8
   ppb, and of the xylenes 0.3 and 0.7 ppb respectively.
   Winter measurements in Athens revealed that biomass burning used for
   residential heating was a major VOC source contributing both aromatic
   VOCs and biogenic compounds such as monoterpenes. Several episodes
   related to biomass burning were identified and emission ratios (ERs) and
   emission factors (EFs) were estimated.}},

   morphology, insoluble coatings, and association with metals. In addition
   to conventionally occurring BC aggregates, we observed single BC
   monomers, complex aggregates with internally, and externally mixed metal

   of less than 30 \%. However, the model overestimates the AOD over
   northern Europe, most probably due to an overestimation of organic
   aerosol and sulfates. At the other end, PMCAMx underestimates the
   monthly mean MODIS AOD over the Balkans, the Mediterranean, and the
   South Atlantic. These errors appear to be related to an underestimation
   of sulfates. Sensitivity tests indicate that the evaluation results of
   the monthly mean AODs are quite sensitive to the relative humidity (RH)
   fields used by PMCAMx, but are not sensitive to the simulated size
   distribution and the black carbon mixing state. The screening of the
   satellite retrievals for periods with high dust (or coarse particles in
   general) concentrations as well as the combination of the MODIS and
   AERONET datasets lead to more robust conclusions about the ability of
   the model to simulate the secondary aerosol components that dominate the
   AOD during this period.}},

Abstract = {{Basement membranes are protein-rich extracellular matrices (ECM) that
   are essential for epithelial and endothelial tissue structure and
   function. Aging and disease cause changes in the physical properties and
   ECM composition of basement membranes, which has spurred research to
   develop methods to repair and/or regenerate these tissues. An area of
   critical clinical need is the cornea, where failure of the endothelium
   leads to stromal edema and vision loss. Here, an engineered basement
   membrane (EBM) is developed that consists of a dense layer of collagen
   IV and/or laminin approximate to 5-10 nm thick, created using
   surface-initiated assembly, conformally attached to a collagen I film.
   These EBMs are used to engineer a corneal endothelium (CE) that mimics
   the structure of Descemet's membrane with a thin stromal layer, toward
   use as a graft for lamellar keratoplasty. Results show that bovine and
   human CE cells form confluent monolayers on the EBM, express ZO-1 at the
   cell-cell borders, and achieve a density of approximate to 1600 cells
   mm(-2) for 28 and 14 d, respectively. These results demonstrate that the
   technique is capable of fabricating EBMs with structural and
   compositional properties that mimic native basement membranes and that
   EBM may be a suitable carrier for engineering transplant quality CE
   grafts.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) was achieved by conducting
   an initiators for continuous activator regeneration atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ICAR ATRP) at low ppm of copper catalyst
   concentration. A poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl ether
   methacrylate)(50) (POEOMA(50)) macroinitiator and stabilizer was
   synthesized by an aqueous ICAR ATRP using
   (CuCl2)-Cl-II/tris(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complex.
   Subsequently, the dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate
   (BnMA) in ethanol was realized with a (CuBr2)-Br-II/TPMA complex either
   at room temperature or at 65 degrees C using V-70 or AIBN as radical
   initiators, respectively. The effect of catalyst concentration, radical
   initiators, targeted degree of polymerization (DP) of PBnMA, solids
   content, and temperature on the molecular characteristics and
   self-assembly behavior of block copolymers POEOMA-PBnMA was evaluated by
   gel permeation chromatography (GPC), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Block copolymers assembled
   into spheres, wormlike aggregates, and vesicles with diameters ranging
   from 100 to 600 nm, depending on the temperature, solids content, and
   the DP of PBnMA. The effect of the temperature on the polymerization
   behavior and morphological evolution was attributed to the
   temperature-dependent plasticization of the core-forming PBnMA block
   above and below its glass transition temperature (T-g = 54 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{This research assesses climate, technological, and policy impacts on
   consumptive water use from electricity generation in the Southwest over
   a planning horizon of nearly a century. We employed an integrated
   modeling framework taking into account feedbacks between climate change,
   air temperature and humidity, and consequent power plant water
   requirements. These direct impacts of climate change on water
   consumption by 2095 differ with technology improvements, cooling
   systems, and policy constraints, ranging from a 3-7\% increase over
   scenarios that do not incorporate ambient air impacts. Upon additional
   factors being changed that alter electricity generation, water
   consumption increases by up to 8\% over the reference scenario by 2095.
   With high penetration of wet recirculating cooling, consumptive water
   required for low-carbon electricity generation via fossil fuels will
   likely exacerbate regional water pressure as droughts become more common
   and population increases. Adaptation strategies to lower water use
   include the use of advanced cooling technologies and greater dependence
   on solar and wind. Water consumption may be reduced by 50\% in 2095 from
   the reference, requiring an increase in dry cooling shares to 35-40\%.
   Alternatively, the same reduction could be achieved through photovoltaic
   and wind power generation constituting 60\% of the grid, consistent with
   an increase of over 250\% in technology learning rates.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the gas-particle partitioning of vehicle emitted primary
   organic aerosol (POA) in a traffic tunnel with three independent
   methods: artifact corrected bare-quartz filters, thermodenuder (TD)
   measurements, and thermal-desorption gas-chromatography
   mass-spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). Results from all methods consistently show
   that vehicle emitted POA measured in the traffic tunnel is semivolatile
   under a wide range of fleet compositions and ambient conditions. We
   compared the gas-particle partitioning of POA measured in both tunnel
   and dynamometer studies and found that volatility distributions measured
   in the traffic tunnel are similar to volatility distributions measured
   in the dynamometer studies, and predict similar gas-particle
   partitioning in the TD. These results suggest that the POA volatility
   distribution measured in the dynamometer studies can be applied to
   describe gas-particle partitioning of ambient POA emissions. The POA
   volatility distribution measured in the tunnel does not have significant
   diurnal or seasonal variations, which indicate that a single volatility
   distribution is adequate to describe the gas-particle partitioning of
   vehicle emitted POA in the urban environment.}},

Number = {{44}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates surface forces that result from adsorbed layers
   of silica nanoparticles with grafted pH-responsive, cationic
   poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) brushes (SiO2-g-PDMAEMA) and
   how adhesive bridging forces can be suppressed and friction forces
   reduced by ``backfilling{''} these heterogeneous adsorbed layers with
   nonionic poly(ethylene oxide) star copolymers (Star PEO(45)MA).
   Adsorption of SiO2-g-PDMAE.MA and Star PEO45MA to silica is measured as
   a function of pH by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D)
   in order to evaluate the electrostatically driven adsorption of
   SiO2-g-PDMAEMA and hydrogen-bonding-driven adsorption of Star PEO45MA.
   Force measurements performed using colloidal probe force microscopy show
   the strong role that limited surface coverage plays in adhesive bridging
   forces between silica with adsorbed SiO2-gPDMAEMA, while Star PEO45MA
   adsorption produces purely repulsive steric interactions. Bridging
   between SiO2-gPDMAEMA-coated surfaces produces frictional forces that
   tend to be larger than those acting between bare surfaces at similar
   normal loads, while friction is consistently decreased by Star PEO45MA
   adsorption. Sequential adsorption of SiO2-g-PDMAEMA and Star PEO45MA
   generates high-coverage mixed nanoparticulate brush layers with
   uniformly repulsive normal forces and reduced friction forces.
   Adsorption and force measurements reveal that Star PEO45MA not only
   adsorbs to silica but also binds to SiO2-g-PDMAEMA. The latter allows
   sequential adsorption of the two components to produce mixed
   multilayers. The mixed SiO2-g-PDMAEMA/Star PEO45MA multilayers exhibit
   larger layer thicknesses, no bridging, and sustained smooth friction,
   highlighting their potential usefulness as aqueous boundary lubricant
   layers.}},

   from polymerization in 30 to 90 wt \% H2O. Media with water contents of
   and above 70 wt \% are well suited for controlled ATRP. The Fe-mesohemin
   catalyst provides an exceptionally high ATRP equilibrium constant even
   at ambient temperature, which approaches the one of highly active Cu
   catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic reduced models (D-RMs) derived from rigorous models are highly
   desired for speeding up dynamic simulations. A useful software tool
   named D-RM Builder was developed to automatically generate data-driven
   D-RMs from high-fidelity dynamic models. It allows a user to configure
   input/output variables, sample input space and generate sequences of
   step changes, launch high-fidelity model simulations, fit simulation
   results to a D-RM, and finally visualize and validate the D-RM. The
   Decoupled A-B Net (DABNet) nonlinear system identification model was
   used as the main D-RM type and was enhanced to model nonlinear multiple
   input and multiple output dynamic systems with options for double-pole
   formulation to handle fast/slow time scales and pole value optimization.
   The D-RM Builder tool has been successfully used to generate D-RMs for a
   highly nonlinear pH neutralization reactor system and a two-time-scale
   bubbling fluidized bed adsorber-reactor for CO2 capture. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the short-term scheduling problem for the ethylene
   cracking process with feedstocks and energy constraints. The cracking
   production of ethylene is a process with units that have decaying
   performance, requiring periodic cleanup to restore their performance.
   Under the condition of limited feedstocks, the production operating mode
   of the cracking furnaces is to keep yields constant by continuously
   increasing the coil temperature. We present a hybrid MINLP/GDP
   formulation based on continuous-time representation for the scheduling
   problem over a finite time horizon. In order to solve the proposed
   model, which is reformulated as an MINLP model, an improved outer
   approximation algorithm with multi-generation cuts and problem-dependent
   integer cuts are developed to solve real large-scale problems. Numerical
   examples are presented to illustrate the application of the model. Based
   on analyzing the optimal solution and sensitivity of the model, some
   conclusions are obtained to provide useful suggestions for real cracking
   process production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic induction can be regarded as a negative feedback effect, where
   the motive-force opposes the change of magnetic flux that generates the
   motive-force. In artificial electromagnetics emerging from spintronics,
   however, this is not necessarily the case. By studying the
   current-induced domain wall dynamics in a cylindrical nanowire, we show
   that the spin motive-force exerting on electrons can either oppose or
   support the applied current that drives the domain wall. The switching
   into the anomalous feedback regime occurs when the strength of the
   dissipative torque beta is about twice the value of the Gilbert damping
   constant alpha. The anomalous feedback manifests as a negative domain
   wall resistance, which has an analogy with the water turbine.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ohmic micro- and nanoswitches are of interest for a wide variety of
   applications including radio frequency communications and as low power
   complements to transistors. In these switches, it is of paramount
   importance to maintain surface cleanliness in order to prevent frequent
   failure by tribopolymer growth. To prepare surfaces, an oxygen plasma
   clean is expected to be beneficial compared to a high temperature vacuum
   bakeout because of shorter cleaning time (<5 min compared to similar to
   24 h) and active removal of organic contaminants. We demonstrate that
   sputtering of the electrode material during oxygen plasma cleaning is a
   critical consideration for effective cleaning of switch surfaces. With
   Ti electrodes, a TiOx layer forms that increases electrical contact
   resistance. When plasma-cleaned using graphite electrodes, the
   resistance of Pt-coated microswitches exhibit a long lifetime with
   consistently low resistance (<0.5 Omega variation over 300 million
   cycles) if the test chamber is refilled with ultra-high purity nitrogen
   and if the devices are not exposed to laboratory air. Their
   current-voltage characteristic is also linear at the millivolt level.
   This is important for nanoswitches which will be operated in that range.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of radon in natural gas varies with its source. Little has
   been published about the radon from shale gas to date, making estimates
   of its impact on radon-induced lung cancer speculative. We measured
   radon in natural gas pipelines carrying gas from the Marcellus Shale in
   Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Radon concentrations ranged from 1,520
   to 2,750 Bq/m(3) (41-74 pCi/L), and the throughput-weighted average was
   1,983 Bq/m(3) (54 pCi/L). Potential radon exposure due to the use of
   Marcellus Shale gas for cooking and space heating using vent-free
   heaters or gas ranges in northeastern U.S. homes and apartments was
   assessed. Though the measured radon concentrations are higher than what
   has been previously reported, it is unlikely that exposure from natural
   gas cooking would exceed 1.2 Bq/m(3) (<1\% of the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's action level). Using worst-case assumptions, we
   estimate the excess lifetime (70 years) lung cancer risk associated with
   cooking to be 1.8x10(-4) (interval spanning 95\% of simulation results:
   8.5x10(-5), 3.4x10(-4)). The risk profile for supplemental heating with
   unvented gas appliances is similar. Individuals using unvented gas
   appliances to provide primary heating may face lifetime risks as high as
   3.9x10(-3). Under current housing stock and gas consumption assumptions,
   expected levels of residential radon exposure due to unvented combustion
   of Marcellus Shale natural gas in the Northeast United States do not
   result in a detectable change in the lung cancer death rates.}},

Title = {{Technology adoption under time-differentiated market-based instruments
   for pollution control}},
Journal = {{ENERGY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{23-34}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Peak concentrations of ground-level ozone pose health risks to millions
   of U.S. citizens across the U.S. In order to reduce peak ozone
   concentrations, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the power sector,
   among others, have been regulated with technology-based standards or,
   more commonly in recent years, market-based instruments such as
   cap-and-trade programs. However, the lack of temporal flexibility in
   current designs of these market based instruments limits their
   cost-effectiveness on days forecasted to have the highest levels of
   pollution, including ozone precursors such as NOx, and as further
   emission reductions are sought, the marginal cost of these approaches
   increases dramatically. In this paper, we compare three regulatory
   schemes for reducing NOx emissions on high-ozone days:
   time-differentiated pricing, which prices NOx emissions only on days
   with high-ozone concentrations; undifferentiated pricing, which
   represents current NOx emission regulations; and technology-based
   standards. We develop a novel model that captures for the first time
   both the short- and long-term response of generators, through
   redispatching and control technology adoption, to a dynamic pricing
   scheme such as time-differentiated pricing. Unlike prior studies on
   time-differentiated pricing, the heart of our model, a unit commitment
   model, accounts for inter-temporal constraints on power generation that
   may be crucial to accurately capturing the response of generators to a
   transient price signal. We apply this model to the Texas power system
   and find that while control technology adoption (specifically selective
   catalytic reduction) does occur at very high time-differentiated prices,
   time-differentiated pricing mainly affects emissions and costs through
   redispatching of gas- for coal-fired generation. Furthermore, we show
   that time-differentiated pricing, due to its targeted pricing mechanism,
   provides a more cost-effective approach than undifferentiated pricing or
   technology-based standards for reducing NOx emissions on high-ozone
   days, but is not cost-effective at reducing summer-wide NOx emissions.
   Our results illustrate the trade-offs between these regulatory
   approaches and suggest that states should consider dynamic pricing
   schemes such as time-differentiated pricing for achieving further
   reductions in peak ozone concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel subject-adaptable heartbeat classificationmodel
   is presented, in order to address the significant interperson variations
   in ECG signals. A multiview learning approach is proposed to automate
   subject adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled personal data,
   without requiring manual labeling. The designed subject-customized
   models consist of two models, namely, general classification model and
   specific classification model. The general model is trained using
   similar subjects out of a population dataset, where a pattern matching
   based algorithm is developed to select the subjects that are
   ``similar{''} to the particular test subject for model training. In
   contrast, the specific model is trained mainly on a small amount of
   high-confidence personal dataset, resulting from multiview-based
   learning. The learned general model represents the population knowledge,
   providing an interperson perspective for classification, while the
   specific model corresponds to the specific knowledge of the subject,
   offering an intraperson perspective for classification. The two models
   supplement each other and are combined to achieve improved personalized
   ECG analysis. The proposed methods have been validated on the MIT-BIH
   Arrhythmia Database, yielding an average classification accuracy of
   99.4\% for ventricular ectopic beat class and 98.3\% for
   supraventricular ectopic beat class, which corresponds to a significant
   improvement over other published results.}},

Abstract = {{With a service area population exceeding four million people and with
   close to 90 \% of the water supply being imported from sources outside
   the city, the Los Angeles water system is subject to multiple stressors,
   including climate change and population growth. The influence of various
   factors on water demand in Los Angeles was evaluated through development
   and application of multiple linear regression models for residential,
   commercial, industrial, and governmental water demand categories from
   1970 to 2014 in the service area of the Los Angeles Department of Water
   and Power. Performance of the models in describing historical water
   demand was compared using the coefficient of determination, mean average
   percent error, and normalized root mean square error. Overall, the
   results of the linear regression models demonstrated that each water
   demand category is affected by different parameters. However, price and
   population were found to have the most significant impact on all
   categories. The seasonality of residential water demand was well
   described with the model based on monthly data, with precipitation and
   temperature being highly significant factors. Fitting of the residential
   data furthermore revealed that price and conservation have significantly
   counteracted the impact of population growth on water demand.}},

Abstract = {{Unsteady turbulent flow characteristics over a two-blade horizontal wind
   turbine rotor is analyzed using a large-eddy simulation technique. The
   wind turbine rotor corresponds to the configuration of the U.S. National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) phase VI campaign. The filtered
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a non-inertial reference frame
   fixed at the centroid of the rotor, are solved with centrifugal and
   Coriolis forces using an unstructured-grid finite-volume method. A
   systematic analysis of effects of grid resolution, computational domain
   size, and time-step size on simulation results, is carried out.
   Simulation results such as the surface pressure coefficient, thrust
   coefficient, torque coefficient, and normal and tangential force
   coefficients are found to agree favorably with experimental data. The
   simulation showed that pressure fluctuations, which produce broadband
   flow-induced noise and vibration of the blades, are especially
   significant in the mid-chord area of the suction side at around 70 to 95
   percent spanwise locations. Large-scale vortices are found to be
   generated at the blade tip and the location connecting the blade with an
   airfoil cross section and the circular hub rod. These vortices propagate
   downstream with helical motions and are found to persist far downstream
   from the rotor.}},

Abstract = {{Autoinflammatory skin diseases are characterized by a disequilibrium of
   cytokines in the local skin microenvironment, suggesting that local
   delivery of therapeutics, including anticytokine antibodies, may provide
   benefit without the unwanted off-target effects of systemically
   delivered therapies. Rapid diffusion of therapeutics away from the
   target site has been a challenge to the development of local therapies.
   Conjugation of high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers to cytokine
   neutralizing mAbs has been shown to be an effective strategy for local
   control of inflammation in healing burn wounds. However, the burn
   application is unique because the skin barrier is already breached. For
   the treatment of autoinflammatory skin diseases, the major challenge for
   local delivery lies in penetrating the stratum corneum. Here, we
   investigate a new therapeutic approach combining the use of tip-loaded
   dissolvable microneedle arrays (TL-dMNAs) for local application of
   polymer-conjugated antibody inhibitors of tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha). Specifically, intradermal delivery and pharmacokinetics of
   (anti-TNF-alpha-Ab)-(high molecular weight hyaluronic acid {[}HA])
   conjugates from tip-loaded, obelisk-shaped dissolvable microneedle
   arrays were investigated in living human skin. The results indicate (1)
   TL-dMNAs can be successfully fabricated to integrate
   (anti-TNF-alpha-Ab)-HA at the tip portion of the microneedles while
   preserving the biological activity necessary for antibody ligand
   binding; (2) (anti-TNF-alpha-Ab)-HA can be effectively delivered into
   human skin using obelisk-shaped TL-dMNAs; and (3) polymer conjugation
   effectively inhibits antibody diffusion from the delivery site. Taken
   together, these results support the evaluation of microneedle
   array-based delivery of varying polymer-antibody conjugates for the
   treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists

Abstract = {{We present an adaptive memory programming (AMP) metaheuristic to address
   the robust capacitated vehicle routing problem under demand uncertainty.
   Contrary to its deterministic counterpart, the robust formulation allows
   for uncertain customer demands, and the objective is to determine a
   minimum cost delivery plan that is feasible for all demand realizations
   within a prespecified uncertainty set. A crucial step in our heuristic
   is to verify the robust feasibility of a candidate route. For generic
   uncertainty sets, this step requires the solution of a convex
   optimization problem, which becomes computationally prohibitive for
   large instances. We present two classes of uncertainty sets for which
   route feasibility can be established much more efficiently. Although we
   discuss our implementation in the context of the AMP framework, our
   techniques readily extend to other metaheuristics. Computational studies
   on standard literature benchmarks with up to 483 customers and 38
   vehicles demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to quickly
   provide high-quality solutions. In the process, we obtain new best
   solutions for a total of 123 benchmark instances.}},

Abstract = {{We tested interventions to reduce ``sunk-cost bias,{''}the tendency to
   continue investing in failing plans even when those plans have soured
   and are no longer rewarding. We showed members of a national U.S.
   life-span panel a hypothetical scenario about a failing plan that was
   halfway complete. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention
   to focus on how to improve the situation, an intervention to focus on
   thoughts and feelings, or a no-intervention control group. First, we
   found that the thoughts and feelings intervention reduced sunk-cost bias
   in decisions about project completion, as compared to the improvement
   intervention and the no-intervention control. Second, older age was
   associated with greater willingness to cancel the failing plan across
   all 3 groups. Third, we found that introspection processes helped to
   explain the effectiveness of the interventions. Specifically, the larger
   reduction in sunk-cost bias as observed in the thoughts and feelings
   intervention (vs. the improvement intervention) was associated with
   suppression of future-oriented thoughts of eventual success, and with
   suppression of augmentations of the scenario that could make it seem
   reasonable to continue the plan. Fourth, we found that introspection
   processes were related to age differences in decisions. Older people
   were less likely to mention future-oriented thoughts of eventual success
   associated with greater willingness to continue the failing plan. We
   discuss factors to consider when designing interventions for reducing
   sunk-cost bias.}},

Abstract = {{Automated vehicles represent a technology that promises to increase
   mobility for many groups, including the senior population (those over
   age 65) but also for non-drivers and people with medical conditions.
   This paper estimates bounds on the potential increases in travel in a
   fully automated vehicle environment due to an increase in mobility from
   the non-driving and senior populations and people with
   travel-restrictive medical conditions. In addition, these bounding
   estimates indicate which of these demographics could have the greatest
   increases in annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and highlight those age
   groups and genders within these populations that could contribute the
   most to the VMT increases. The data source is the 2009 National
   Household Transportation Survey (NHTS), which provides information on
   travel characteristics of the U.S. population. The changes to light-duty
   VMT are estimated by creating and examining three possible travel demand
   wedges. In demand wedge one, non-drivers are assumed to travel as much
   as the drivers within each age group and gender. Demand wedge two
   assumes that the driving elderly (those over age 65) without medical
   conditions will travel as much as a younger population within each
   gender. Demand wedge three makes the assumption that working age adult
   drivers (19-64) with medical conditions will travel as much as working
   age adults without medical conditions within each gender, while the
   driving elderly with medical any travel-restrictive conditions will
   travel as much as a younger demographic within each gender in a fully
   automated vehicle environment. The combination of the results from all
   three demand wedges represents an upper bound of 295 billion miles or a
   14\% increase in annual light-duty VMT for the US population 19 and
   older. Since traveling has other costs besides driving effort, these
   estimates serve to bound the potential increase from these populations
   to inform the scope of the challenges, rather than forecast specific VMT
   scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rare earth elements (REE) are elements that drive the development of new
   technologies in many sectors, including green energy. However, the
   supply chain of REE is subject to a complex set of technical,
   environmental, and geopolitical constraints. Some of these challenges
   may be circumvented if REE are recovered from naturally abundant
   alternative sources, such as saline waters and brines. Here, we
   synthesized and tested aminated silica gels, functionalized with 2
   REE-reactive ligands: diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA),
   diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPA-DA), phosphonoacetic
   acid (PAA), and N,N-bisphosphono(methyl)glycine (BPG). A suite of
   characterization techniques and batch adsorption experiments were used
   to evaluate the properties of the functionalized silica adsorbents and
   test the REE-uptake chemistry of the adsorbents under environmentally
   relevant conditions. Results showed that BPG and DTPADA yielded the most
   REE-reactive adsorbents of those tested. Moreover, the DTPADA adsorbents
   demonstrated chemical and physical robustness as well as ease of
   regeneration. However, as in previous studies, amino-poly(carboxylic
   acid) adsorbents showed limited uptake at midrange pH and low-sorbate
   concentrations. This work highlighted the complexity of intermolecular
   interactions between even moderately sized reactive sites when
   developing high-capacity, high-selectivity adsorbents. Additional
   development is required to implement an REE recovery scheme using these
   materials; however, it is clear that BPG- and DTPADA-based adsorbents
   offer a highly reactive adsorbent warranting further study.}},

Abstract = {{Taylor vortices in a miniature mixed-flow rotodynamic blood pump were
   investigated using micro-scale particle image velocimetry (-PIV) and a
   tracer particle visualization technique. The pump featured a cylindrical
   rotor (14.9mm diameter) within a cylindrical bore, having a radial
   clearance of 500m and operated at rotational speeds varying from 1000 to
   12000 rpm. Corresponding Taylor numbers were 700-101800, respectively.
   The critical Taylor number was observed to be highly dependent on the
   ratio of axial to circumferential velocity, increasing from 1200 to
   18000 corresponding to Rossby numbers from 0 to 0.175. This demonstrated
   a dramatic stabilizing effect of the axial flow. The size of Taylor
   vortices was also found to be inversely related to Rossby number. It is
   concluded that Taylor vortices can enhance the mixing in the annular gap
   and decrease the dwell time of blood cells in the high-shear-rate
   region, which has the potential to decrease hemolysis and platelet
   activation within the blood pump.}},

   Westinghouse SMR (W-SMR) to be 9.1 g of CO2-eq/kwh (5.9-13.2 g of
   CO2-eq/kwh) and the Westinghouse AP1000 to be 8.4 g of CO2-eq/ kwh
   (5.5-12.1 g of CO2-eq/kwh). The GHG emissions of the AP1000 are 9\% less
   than the W-SMR. However, when the nuclear fuel cycle is not included in
   the analysis the GHG emissions for the W-SMR and the AP1000 are
   effectively the same given the inherent uncertainties in the analysis.
   The analysis finds that both types of plants stochastically dominate the

Abstract = {{Composites made with high thermal conductivity meshes embedded in phase
   change materials (PCMs) increase charge/discharge rates of latent heat
   energy storage systems. We study the benefits of spatially-dependent
   enhancements to thermal conductivity on the charge/discharge rates of
   PCMs in both one-dimensional Cartesian and one-dimensional cylindrical
   coordinates. Our nondimensionalized quasi-steady (Stefan number less
   than or similar to 0.1) solution indicates that the average charge
   (discharge) rate in a spatially-enhanced PCM outperforms the
   uniformly-enhanced case by maximizing the enhancement near the heat
   source and therein reducing the time averaged thermal resistance to
   melting (solidifying). Relative to a uniformly-enhanced thermal
   conductivity, the optimal charge/discharge rate enhancement is a modest
   12\% in one-dimensional Cartesian coordinates but as high as 140\% in
   one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates. Our analytical solutions are a
   design guide for graded mesh structures that can be realized by advanced
   fabrication techniques such as additive manufacturing and applied in

Abstract = {{Durotaxis, a phenomenon that cells move according to changes in
   stiffness of the extra cellular matrix, has emerged as a crucial
   parameter controlling cell migration behavior. The current study
   provides a simple method to generate three-dimensional continuous
   stiffness variations without changing other physical characteristics of
   the extra cellular environment. Using Finite Element simulations, the
   stiffness and the stiffness gradient variations are evaluated
   quantitatively, leading to an analysis of the dependence of cell
   migration behavior on the substrate stiffness parameters. We tested
   various cell lines on several 3-D environments. The durotaxis results
   show that the cell migration velocity does not have any consistency with
   the stiffness of the substrate, rather it is more related to the
   stiffness gradient of the substrate. This finding suggests a new
   mechanism underlying the durotaxis phenomenon, highlighting the
   importance of the substrate stiffness gradient, rather than the
   stiffness itself. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{An expert-based bayesian assessment of 2030 German new vehicle CO2
   emissions and related costs}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{197-208}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We formulate and elicit Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) for assessing
   possible characteristics of the 2030 German new passenger car fleet,
   including market shares of different vehicle types, CO2 emissions, user
   costs, and CO2 abatement costs for internal combustion engine vehicles
   including hybrid electric vehicles (ICE); plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEV); and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Seven technology
   and environmental experts from the German Original Equipment
   Manufacturers (OEM) sector were elicited for key relationships and
   conditional probability values in the model, yielding seven distinct
   BBNs able to predict how different future technology, economic and
   policy scenarios will influence model projections. The 2030 scenarios
   include differing amounts of technological advancement in battery
   development, regulation, and fuel and electricity greenhouse gas
   intensities. Across the expert models, 2030 baseline fleet greenhouse
   gas emissions are predicted to be at 50-65\% of 2008 new fleet
   emissions. They can be further reduced to 40-50\% of the emissions of
   the 2008 new fleet through a combination of a higher share of renewables
   in the electricity mix, a larger share of biofuels in the fuel mix, and
   a stricter regulation of car CO2 emissions in the European Union. The
   experts' BBNs predict that the 2030 ICE will have lower user costs per
   kilometer than PHEV or BEV for most scenarios, and that ICE will remain
   the dominant vehicle type in the 2030 German new fleet. According to all
   of the experts' BBNs, CO2 abatement costs are negative for the 2030 ICE
   in all scenarios, but can be positive or negative for PHEV and BEV,
   depending on the expert model and scenario assumed. Critical areas where
   expert models agree and differ serve to highlight where reductions in
   uncertainty regarding future technology, economic, environmental and
   regulatory relationships are most needed to improve our ability to
   predict and anticipate future vehicle fleet composition and vehicle
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Best management practices (BMPs) such as bioretentions, dry and wet
   ponds, porous pavement, and many other methods are widely used to reduce
   the runoff volume and the concentration of sediments and nutrients in
   the runoff. Numerical models are used to develop and assess water
   quality management plans that, among others, include BMPs. Those models
   need to take into account the BMP effectiveness to remove pollutants,
   being a function of the volume of daily runoff, in order to estimate
   their performance under a range of different climate scenarios.
   Circumventing the lack of monitoring data, this study used the
   Environmental Protection Agency's system for urban stormwater treatment
   and analysis integration model (SUSTAIN) to run 22years (1984-2005) of
   runoff data from the Patuxent River (Maryland) through seven types of
   BMPs. It was found that BMP effectiveness decreases sooner, steeper, and
   deeper with increasing sizes of storm events than assumed in the
   Chesapeake Bay Phase 5 watershed model. At a minimum, the resulting
   performance curves should differentiate among BMPs. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{The separation of lithium from magnesium ions in salt brines is an
   important step in producing raw lithium for prospective use in
   electrochemical storage systems. Liquid-liquid extraction of Mg2+ ions
   from Li+ ions is challenging because of comparable thermodynamic
   behavior in aqueous solutions. Removing Mg2+ ions from brines using
   consumable ion-exchange membranes is also a challenging prospect due to
   poor chemical selectivity and compromised sustainability. Here, we
   propose the use of redox-active catechols in the form of melanin
   pigments for selective removal of Mg2+ ions from aqueous solutions.
   Synthetic melanin films are oxidatively polymerized on stainless steel
   meshes from aqueous solutions of dopamine precursors to create
   electrochemically functionalized polydopamine membranes. The binding
   selectivity of redox-active catechol-bearing polydopamine melanin for
   Mg2+ ions in aqueous solutions was measured as a function of
   electrochemical cycling. The binding kinetics of Mg2+ ions to
   polydopamine pigments was measured. Mg2+ ions binding selectivity to
   polydopamine in mixed aqueous solutions containing both Li+ and Mg2+
   ions were also measured. Additionally, the equilibrium binding
   concentrations of Mg2+ ions to polydopamine were achieved very rapidly
   (<1min). Redox-active polydopamine membranes therefore show promise as
   functional materials for the separation of Mg2+ and Li+ ions in aqueous
   solutions. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{A new kinetic Monte Carlo model, termed the Material Point Monte Carlo

   their material data are updated according to a statistical mechanics
   scheme. Because material points are randomly distributed, and remain so
   under affine deformations, the MPMC eliminates artifacts of the
   simulation grid that occur in lattice-based methods such as the Monte
   Carlo Potts model. For model systems the MPMC is verified to correctly
   reproduce grain boundary motion caused by bulk and interfacial driving
   forces. It is then applied to larger and more complex problems,

Title = {{ARIMA-based decoupled time series forecasting of electric vehicle
   charging demand for stochastic power system operation}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{378-390}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) affects the total
   electricity demand considerably. Demand forecast is usually designed for
   the seasonally changing load patterns. However, with the high
   penetration of EVs, daily charging demand makes traditional forecasting
   methods less accurate. This paper presents an autoregressive integrated
   moving average (ARIMA) method for demand forecasting of conventional
   electrical load (CEL) and charging demand of EV (CDE) parking lots
   simultaneously. Our EV charging demand prediction model takes daily
   driving patterns and distances as an input to determine the expected
   charging load profiles. The parameters of the ARIMA model are tuned so
   that the mean square error (MSE) of the forecaster is minimized. We
   improve the accuracy of ARIMA forecaster by optimizing the integrated
   and auto-regressive order parameters. Furthermore, due to the different
   seasonal and daily pattern of CEL and CDE, the proposed decoupled demand
   forecasting method provides significant improvement in terms of error
   reduction. The impact of EV charging demand on the accuracy of the
   proposed load forecaster is also analyzed in two approaches: (1)
   integrated forecaster for CEL + CDE, and (2) decoupled forecaster that

Title = {{The Borderline between Simultaneous Reverse and Normal Initiation and
   Initiators for Continuous Activator Regeneration ATRP}},

Abstract = {{Multiple methods for initiation and selecting catalyst concentration
   exist in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Among them,
   simultaneous reverse and normal initiation (SR\&NI) ATRP and initiators
   for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) ATRP are phenomenologically
   very similar. In both methods, thermal radical initiators are employed
   to reduce the catalyst in the higher oxidation state and generate Cu-I
   activator in Situ. SR\&NI and ICAR ATRP generally differ in the amount
   of catalyst used and in the rate of catalyst reduction. Commonly, SR\&NI
   ATRP requires high catalyst loadings and a quick initial reduction of
   Cu-II, while ICAR ATRP relies on slow and continuous reduction of
   smaller catalyst loadings. However, these criteria might not be
   sufficient to universally distinguish among both techniques. This
   article investigates both methods through kinetic simulations and
   establishes a borderline kinetic criterion. If the polymerization rate
   depends on the rate of decomposition of the radical initiator, the
   system follows ICAR ATRP kinetics, and if it depends on the ATRP
   equilibrium constant, it follows SR\&NI ATRP. The transition from one to
   the other mechanism occurred continuously with an inflection point at a
   ratio of rate coefficients of radical initiator decomposition to
   propagation of about k(dc)/k(p) approximate to 10(-7) M under typical
   conditions. For faster initiator decomposition and slower propagation
   ATRP follows SR\&NI ATRP, and for slower decomposition and faster
   propagation it obeys ICAR ATRP kinetics. The analysis to verify which
   mechanism is in operation is helpful for designing reaction conditions
   in order to obtain well-defined products.}},

Title = {{How much electricity can we save by using direct current circuits in
   homes? Understanding the potential for electricity savings and assessing
   feasibility of a transition towards DC powered buildings}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Advances in semiconductor-based power electronics and growing direct
   current loads in buildings have led researchers to reconsider whether
   buildings should be wired with DC circuits to reduce power conversions
   and facilitate a transition to efficient DC appliances. The feasibility,
   energy savings, and economics of such systems have been assessed and
   proven in data centers and commercial buildings, but the outcomes are
   still uncertain for the residential sector.
   In this work, we assess the technical and economic feasibility of DC
   circuits using data for 120 traditionally-wired AC homes in Austin,
   Texas to understand the effect of highly variable demand profiles on
   DC-powered residences, using appliance-level use and solar generation
   data, and performing a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify costs and
   benefits.
   Results show site energy savings between 9\% and 20\% when solar PV is
   distributed to all home appliances. When battery storage for excess
   solar energy is considered, these savings increase to 14-25\%. At
   present DC equipment prices, converting all equipment to DC causes
   levelized annual costs of electricity to homeowners to roughly double.
   However, by converting only homes' air conditioning condensing units to
   DC, the costs of direct-DC are greatly reduced and home site energy
   savings of 7-16\% are generated.
   In addition to quantifying savings, we find major nontechnical barriers
   to implementing direct-DC in homes. These include a lack of standards
   for such systems, a relatively small market for DC appliances and
   components, utility programs designed for AC power, and a workforce
   unfamiliar with DC. Experience with DC is growing in other sectors, and
   with time this will be transitioned to a broader audience of engineers,
   electricians, and building inspectors to ensure that not only are the
   systems themselves safe, but that the image of direct current circuits
   becomes less foreign over time. Direct current may very well have a
   place in the residential sector, and research and development should
   continue to explore other potential benefits that might make a stronger
   case for a more widespread transition to what now appears a promising
   technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   on Strain Competition and Development of QSI Resistance}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{As understanding of bacterial regulatory systems and pathogenesis
   continues to increase, QSI has been a major focus of research. However,
   recent studies have shown that mechanisms of resistance to quorum
   sensing (QS) inhibitors (QSIs) exist, calling into question their
   clinical value. We propose a computational framework that considers
   bacteria genotypes relative to QS genes and QS-regulated products
   including private, quasi-public, and public goods according to their
   impacts on bacterial fitness. Our results show (1) QSI resistance
   spreads when QS positively regulates the expression of private or
   quasi-public goods. (2) Resistance to drugs targeting secreted compounds
   downstream of QS for a mix of private, public, and quasi-public goods
   also spreads. (3) Changing the micro-environment during treatment with
   QSIs may decrease the spread of resistance. At fundamental-level, our
   simulation framework allows us to directly quantify cell-cell
   interactions and biofilm dynamics. Practically, the model provides a
   valuable tool for the study of QSI-based therapies, and the simulations
   reveal experimental paths that may guide QSI-based therapies in a manner
   that avoids or decreases the spread of QSI resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Shape-programmable matter is a class of active materials whose geometry
   can be controlled to potentially achieve mechanical functionalities
   beyond those of traditional machines. Among these materials,
   magnetically actuated matter is particularly promising for achieving
   complex time-varying shapes at small scale (overall dimensions smaller
   than 1 cm). However, previous work can only program these materials for
   limited applications, as they rely solely on human intuition to
   approximate the required magnetization profile and actuating magnetic
   fields for their materials. Here, we propose a universal programming
   methodology that can automatically generate the required magnetization
   profile and actuating fields for soft matter to achieve new time-varying
   shapes. The universality of the proposed method can therefore inspire a
   vast number of miniature soft devices that are critical in robotics,
   smart engineering surfaces and materials, and biomedical devices. Our
   proposed method includes theoretical formulations, computational
   strategies, and fabrication procedures for programming magnetic soft
   matter. The presented theory and computational method are universal for
   programming 2D or 3D time-varying shapes, whereas the fabrication
   technique is generic only for creating planar beams. Based on the
   proposed programming method, we created a jellyfish-like robot, a
   spermatozoid-like undulating swimmer, and an artificial cilium that
   couldmimic the complex beating patterns of its biological counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{Subspace learning aims to learn a projection matrix from a given
   training set so that a transformation of raw data to a low-dimensional
   representation can be obtained. In practice, the labels of some training
   samples are available, which can be used to improve the discrimination
   of low-dimensional representation. In this paper, we propose a
   semi-supervised learning method which is inspired by the biological
   observation of similar inputs having similar codes (SISC), i.e., the
   same collection of cortical columns of the mammal's visual cortex is
   always activated by the similar stimuli. More specifically, we propose a
   mathematical formulation of SISC which minimizes the distance among the
   data points with the same label while maximizing the separability
   between different subjects in the projection space. The proposed method,
   namely, semi-supervised L2graph (SeL2graph) has two advantages: (1)
   unlike the classical dimension reduction methods such as principle
   component analysis, SeL2graph can automatically determine the dimension
   of feature space. This remarkably reduces the effort to find an optimal
   feature dimension for a good performance; and (2) it fully exploits the
   prior knowledge carried by the labeled samples and thus the obtained
   features are with higher discrimination and compactness. Extensive
   experiments show that the proposed method outperforms 7 subspace
   learning algorithms on 15 data sets with respect to classification
   accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to noises and
   disguises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A parallel function evaluation approach for solution to large-scale
   equation-oriented models}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{309-322}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{The equation-oriented (EO) approach is widely used for process
   simulation and optimization. Nevertheless, large-scale EO models consist
   of a huge number of nonlinear equations and make the solution procedure
   a challenging and time-consuming task. For most gradient-based numerical
   algorithms, function evaluations are the dominant step during the
   solution procedure. Here, a parallel computation method is developed for
   function evaluations within EO optimization strategies. After dividing
   the equations into several groups, function evaluations are calculated
   by using multiple threads on a parallel hardware platform
   simultaneously. Theoretical analysis for the speedup ratio is conducted.
   The implementation of the proposed method on a multi-core processor
   platform as well as a graphics processing unit (GPU) platform is then
   presented with several case studies. Numerical results are compared and
   discussed to show that the multi-core processor implementation has good
   computational performance, whereas the GPU implementation only achieves
   computational acceleration under relatively specific conditions. (C)

Title = {{Increasing ankle push-off work with a powered prosthesis does not
   necessarily reduce metabolic rate for transtibial amputees}},

Abstract = {{Amputees using passive ankle-foot prostheses tend to expend more
   metabolic energy during walking than non-amputees, and reducing this
   cost has been a central motivation for the development of active
   ankle-foot prostheses. Increased push-off work at the end of stance has
   been proposed as a way to reduce metabolic energy use, but the effects
   of push-off work have not been tested in isolation. In this experiment,
   participants with unilateral transtibial amputation (N=6) walked on a
   treadmill at a constant speed while wearing a powered prosthesis
   emulator. The prosthesis delivered different levels of ankle push-off
   work across conditions, ranging from the value for passive prostheses to
   double the value for non-amputee walking, while all other prosthesis
   mechanics were held constant. Participants completed six acclimation
   sessions prior to a data collection in which metabolic rate, kinematics,
   kinetics, muscle activity and user satisfaction were recorded. Metabolic
   rate was not affected by net prosthesis work rate (p=0.5; R-2=0.007).
   Metabolic rate, gait mechanics and muscle activity varied widely across
   participants, but no participant had lower metabolic rate with higher
   levels of push-off work. User satisfaction was affected by push-off work
   (p=0.002), with participants preferring values of ankle push off
   slightly higher than in non-amputee walking, possibly indicating other
   benefits. Restoring or augmenting ankle push-off work is not sufficient
   to improve energy economy for lower-limb amputees. Additional necessary
   conditions might include alternate timing or control, individualized
   tuning, or particular subject characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In today's world, individuals interact with each other in more
   complicated patterns than ever. Some individuals engage through online
   social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), while some communicate only
   through conventional ways (e.g., face-to-face). Therefore, understanding
   the dynamics of information propagation among humans calls for a
   multi-layer network model where an online social network is conjoined
   with a physical network. In this work, we initiate a study of
   information diffusion in a clustered multi-layer network model, where
   all constituent layers are random networks with high clustering. We
   assume that information propagates according to the SIR model and with
   different information transmissibility across the networks. We give
   results for the conditions, probability, and size of information
   epidemics, i.e., cases where information starts from a single individual
   and reaches a positive fraction of the population. We show that
   increasing the level of clustering in either one of the layers increases
   the epidemic threshold and decreases the final epidemic size in the
   whole system. An interesting finding is that information with low
   transmissibility spreads more effectively with a small but densely
   connected social network, whereas highly transmissible information
   spreads better with the help of a large but loosely connected social
   network.}},

Abstract = {{The water demands of power plant cooling systems may strain water supply
   and make power generation vulnerable to water scarcity. Cooling systems
   range in their rates of water use, capital investment, and annual costs.
   Using Texas as a case study, we examined the cost of retrofitting
   existing coal and natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) power plants with
   alternative cooling systems, either wet recirculating towers or
   air-cooled condensers for dry cooling. Weapplied a power plant
   assessment tool to model existing power plants in terms of their key
   plant attributes and site-specific meteorological conditions and then
   estimated operation characteristics of retrofitted plants and retrofit
   costs. Wedetermined the anticipated annual reductions in water
   withdrawals and the costper- gallon of water saved by retrofits in both
   deterministic and probabilistic forms. The results demonstrate that
   replacing once-through cooling at coal-fired power plants with wet
   recirculating towers has the lowest cost per reduced water withdrawals,
   on average. The average marginal cost of water withdrawal savings for
   dry-cooling retrofits at coal-fired plants is approximately 0.68 cents
   per gallon, while the marginal recirculating retrofit cost is 0.008
   cents per gallon. ForNGCCplants, the average marginal costs of water
   withdrawal savings for dry-cooling and recirculating towers are 1.78 and
   0.037 cents per gallon, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Singular optimal control problems arise frequently on a broad range of
   chemical engineering applications. Determination of the accurate dynamic
   structure of the optimal solution profile and the junctions between
   optimal nonsingular and singular arcs is essential for operating
   strategies, as well as equipment designs for many processes. In a
   previous study (Chen, Shao, and Biegler, AIChE J. 60(3), pp. 966-979,
   2014) a nested optimization formulation that finds the optimal mesh
   distribution and determines exact control profiles for nonsingular
   optimal control problems without state constraints is developed. This
   study extends this approach to singular optimal control problems. To
   satisfy the necessary optimality conditions for singular optimal control
   problems with a well-defined solution strategy, the overall nonlinear
   programming formulation resulting from direct transcription is
   decomposed into inner and outer problems. The key feature of this
   algorithm is that it converges to a solution that satisfies the
   discretized Euler-Lagrange equations of the original singular optimal
   control problem; we prove this under suitable assumptions. This is
   obtained through the introduction of pseudomultipliers that reconstruct
   the necessary optimality conditions for singular optimal control in the
   outer problem. We demonstrate this approach on eight classical singular
   control problems with known solutions, as well as three larger singular
   control problems derived from chemical engineering applications. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a study of the bilateral symmetry of human breast hemoglobin
   saturation maps measured with a broadband optical mammography
   instrument. We have imaged 21 patients with unilateral breast cancer, 32
   patients with unilateral benign lesions, and 27 healthy patients. An
   image registration process was applied to the bilateral hemoglobin
   saturation (SO2) images by assigning each pixel to the low, middle, or
   high range of SO2 values, where the thresholds for the categories were
   the 15th and 85th percentiles of the individual saturation range. The
   Dice coefficient, which is a measure of similarity, was calculated for
   each patient's pair of right and left breast SO2 images. The invasive
   cancer patients were found to have an average Dice coefficient value of
   0.55 +/- 0.07, which was significantly lower than the benign and healthy
   groups (0.61 +/- 0.11 and 0.62 +/- 0.12, respectively). Although

Abstract = {{We present a quantitative analysis of dynamic diffuse optical
   measurements to obtain oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in volume
   oscillating compartments. We used a phasor representation of oscillatory
   hemodynamics at the heart rate and respiration frequency to separate the
   oscillations of tissue concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (O) and
   deoxyhemoglobin (D) into components due to blood volume (subscript V)
   and blood flow (subscript F): O = O-V + O-F, D = D-V + D-F. This is
   achieved by setting the phase angle Arg(O-F) - Arg(O), which can be
   estimated by a hemodynamic model that we recently developed. We found
   this angle to be -72 deg for the cardiac pulsation at 1 Hz, and -7 deg
   for paced breathing at 0.1 Hz. Setting this angle, we can obtain the
   oxygen saturation of hemoglobin of the volume-oscillating vascular
   compartment, S-V - vertical bar O-V vertical bar/(vertical bar O-V
   vertical bar + vertical bar D-V vertical bar). We demonstrate this
   approach with cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy measurements on
   healthy volunteers at rest (n = 4) and during 0.1 Hz paced breathing (n
   = 3) with a 24-channel system. Rest data at the cardiac frequency were
   used to calculate the arterial saturation, S-(a); over all subjects and
   channels, we found < S-V > = < S-(a)> = 0.96 +/- 0.02. In the case of
   paced breathing, we found < S-V > = 0.66 +/- 0.14, which reflects
   venous-dominated hemodynamics at the respiratory frequency. (C) The

Abstract = {{We present a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study of local
   hemodynamics in the breast and the brain (prefrontal cortex) of healthy
   volunteers in a protocol involving periodic perturbations to the
   systemic arterial blood pressure. These periodic perturbations were
   achieved by cyclic inflation (to a pressure of 200 mmHg) and deflation
   (at frequencies of 0.046, 0.056, 0.063, 0.071, and 0.083 Hz) of two
   pneumatic cuffs wrapped around the subject's thighs. As a result of
   these systemic perturbations, the concentrations of deoxy-and
   oxyhemoglobin in tissue (D and O, respectively) oscillate at the set
   frequency. We found that the oscillations of D and O in breast tissue
   are in-phase at all frequencies considered, a result that we attribute
   to dominant contributions from blood volume oscillations. In contrast, D
   and O oscillations in brain tissue feature a frequency-dependent phase
   difference, which we attribute to significant contributions from
   cerebral blood flow oscillations. Frequency-resolved measurements of D
   and O oscillations are exploited by the technique of coherent
   hemodynamics spectroscopy for the assessment of cerebrovascular
   parameters and cerebral autoregulation. We show the relevant
   physiological information content of NIRS measurements of oscillatory
   hemodynamics, which have qualitatively distinct features in the healthy
   breast and healthy brain. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Abstract = {{Recent findings about the role of the grain boundary energy in
   complexion transitions are reviewed. Grain boundary energy distributions
   are most commonly evaluated using measurements of grain boundary thermal
   grooves. The measurements demonstrate that when a stable high
   temperature complexion co-exists with a metastable low temperature
   complexion, the stable complexion has a lower energy. It has also been
   found that the changes in the grain boundary energy lead to changes in
   the grain boundary character distribution. Finally, recent experimental
   observations are consistent with the theoretical prediction that higher
   energy grain boundaries transform at lower temperatures than relatively
   lower energy grain boundaries. To better control microstructures
   developed through grain growth, it is necessary to learn more about the
   mechanism and kinetics of complexion transitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries and other interfaces can undergo complexion transitions
   from one thermodynamic state to another, resulting in discontinuous
   changes in interface properties such as diffusivity, mobility, and
   cohesive strength. The kinetics of such complexion transitions has been
   largely overlooked until recently. Just as with bulk phase
   transformations, complexion transition kinetics can be represented on
   time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams. An experimental
   complexion TTT diagram is presented here for polycrystalline Eu-doped
   spinel annealed at 1400-1800 degrees C. This material developed a
   microstructure with a bimodal grain size distribution, indicating that a
   complexion transition occurs within this temperature range. The time and
   temperature dependence of this complexion transition was analyzed and
   used to produce a grain-boundary complexion TTT diagram for this system.
   Complexion TTT diagrams have the potential to be remarkably useful tools
   for manipulating the properties of internal interfaces in
   polycrystalline metals and ceramics. The development of experimental
   complexion TTT diagrams is likely to have an important impact on the
   field of grain-boundary engineering, and hence the development of these
   experimental diagrams should be an intense area of focus in the coming
   years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Injected CO2 from geologic carbon storage is expected to impact the
   microbial communities of proposed storage sites, such as depleted oil
   reservoirs and deep saline aquifers, as well as overlying freshwater
   aquifers at risk of receiving leaking CO2. Microbial community change in
   these subsurface sites may affect injectivity of CO2, permanence of
   stored CO2, and shallow subsurface water quality. The effect of CO2
   concentration on the microbial communities in fluid collected from a
   depleted oil reservoir and a freshwater aquifer was examined at
   subsurface pressures and temperatures. The community was exposed to 0\%,
   1\%, 10\%, and 100\% pCO(2) for 56 days. Bacterial community structure
   was analyzed through 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and total bacterial
   abundance was estimated through quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
   Changes in the microbial community observed in the depleted oil
   reservoir samples and freshwater samples were compared to previous
   results from CO2-exposed deep saline aquifer fluids. Overall, results
   suggest that CO2 exposure to microbial communities will result in
   pH-dependent population change, and the CO2-selected microbial
   communities will vary among sites. This is the first study to compare
   the response of multiple subsurface microbial communities at conditions
   expected during geologic carbon storage, increasing the understanding of
   environmental drivers for microbial community changes in CO2-exposed
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we integrate switchgrass and algae in order to operate a
   biorefinery with no need for fossil based raw materials in the
   production of biodiesel (FAME). A superstructure optimization approach
   is used to select the optimal integrated topology, gasification, and
   reforming technologies, that provide the thermal energy and the methanol
   that biodiesel production requires. The excess of methanol can be sold
   as biofuel or it can be further processed to gasoline. The optimal
   integrated process involves indirect gasification followed by steam
   reforming based on the need for a high H-2 to CO ratio to produce
   methanol and to avoid the use of oxygen. The integrated process produces
   776 ML/year (205 Mgal/year) of biofuels, 34\% FAME, at 0.14 (sic)/L
   (0.53 (sic)/gal). The plant does not emit CO2, but captures 1.27 kg of

Abstract = {{We present an efficient approach of Finite Element Method (FEM)-based
   nonrigid image registration, in which the spatial transformation is
   constructed using truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines). The
   image registration framework minimizes an energy functional using an
   FEM-based method and thus involves solving a large system of linear
   equations. This framework is carried out on a set of successively
   refined grids. However, due to the increased number of control points
   during subdivision, large linear systems are generated which are
   generally demanding to solve. Instead of using uniform subdivision, an
   adaptive local refinement scheme is carried out, only refining the areas
   of large change in deformation of the image. By incorporating the key
   advantages of THB-spline basis functions such as linear independence,
   partition of unity and reduced overlap into the FEM-based framework, we
   improve the matrix sparsity and computational efficiency. The
   performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on 2D synthetic and
   medical images. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Islet cell quantification and function is important for developing novel
   therapeutic interventions for diabetes. Existing methods of pancreatic
   islet segmentation in histopathological images depend strongly on
   cell/nuclei detection, and thus are limited due to a wide variance in
   the appearance of pancreatic islets. In this paper, we propose a
   supervised learning pipeline to segment pancreatic islets in
   histopathological images, which does not require cell detection. The
   proposed framework firstly partitions images into superpixels, and then
   extracts multi-scale color-texture features from each superpixel and
   processes these features using rolling guidance filters, in order to
   simultaneously reduce inter-class ambiguity and intra-class variation.
   Finally, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is trained and applied to
   segment the testing images. A total of 23 hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained
   histopathological images with pancreatic islets are used for verifying
   the framework. With an average accuracy of 95\%, training time of 20 min
   and testing time of 1 min per image, the proposed framework outperforms
   existing approaches with better segmentation performance and lower
   computational cost. (c) 2016 International Society for Advancement of

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanocomposites, annealed under stress, are investigated for
   application in inductive devices. Stress annealed Co-based
   metal/amorphous nanocomposites (MANCs) previously demonstrated induced
   magnetic anisotropies greater than an order of magnitude larger than
   field annealed Co-based MANCs and response to applied stress twice that
   of Fe-based MANCs. Transverse magnetic anisotropies and switching by
   rotational processes impact anomalous eddy current losses at high
   frequencies. Here we review induced anisotropies in soft magnetic
   materials and show new Co-based MANCs having seven times the response to
   stress annealing as compared to Fe-based MANC systems. This response
   correlates with the alloying of early transition metal elements (TE)
   that affect both induced anisotropies and resistivities. At optimal
   alloy compositions, these alloys exhibit a nearly linear B-H loop, with
   tunable permeabilities. The electrical resistivity is not a function of
   processing stress but trends in electrical resistivity and induced
   anisotropy with choice and concentration of TE content are clearly
   resolved. Previously reported and record-level induced anisotropies,
   K-u, approximate to 20 kJ/m(3) (anisotropy fields, H-K approximate to
   500 Oe), in stress annealed Co-rich MANCs are increased to K-u
   approximate to 70 kJ/m(3) (H-K > 1800 Oe) in new systems.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition and excitation form two fundamental modes of neuronal
   interaction, yet we understand relatively little about their distinct
   roles in service of perceptual and cognitive processes. We developed a
   multidimensional waveform analysis to identify fast-spiking (putative
   inhibitory) and regular-spiking (putative excitatory) neurons in vivo
   and used this method to analyze how attention affects these two cell
   classes in visual area V4 of the extrastriate cortex of rhesus macaques.
   We found that putative inhibitory neurons had both greater increases in
   firing rate and decreases in correlated variability with attention
   compared with putative excitatory neurons. Moreover, the time course of
   attention effects for putative inhibitory neurons more closely tracked
   the temporal statistics of target probability in our task. Finally, the
   session-to-session variability in a behavioral measure of attention
   covaried with the magnitude of this effect. Together, these results
   suggest that selective targeting of inhibitory neurons and networks is a
   critical mechanism for attentional modulation.}},

Title = {{Known unknowns: indirect energy effects of information and communication
   technology}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background. There has been sustained and growing interest in
   characterizing the net energy impact of information and communication
   technology (ICT), which results from indirect effects offsetting (or
   amplifying) the energy directly consumed by ICT equipment. These
   indirect effects may be either positive or negative, and there is
   considerable disagreement as to the direction of this sign as well as
   the effect magnitude. Literature in this area ranges from studies
   focused on a single service (such as e-commerce versus traditional
   retail) to macroeconomic studies attempting to characterize the overall
   impact of ICT. Methods. We review the literature on the indirect energy
   effect of ICT found via Google Scholar, our own research, and input from
   other researchers in the field. The various studies are linked to an
   effect taxonomy, which is synthesized from several different hierarchies
   present in the literature. References are further grouped according to
   ICT service (e.g., e-commerce, telework) and summarized by scope,
   method, and quantitative and qualitative findings. Review results.
   Uncertainty persists in understanding the net energy effects of ICT.
   Results of indirect energy effect studies are highly sensitive to
   scoping decisions and assumptions made by the analyst. Uncertainty
   increases as the impact scope broadens, due to complex and
   interconnected effects. However, there is general agreement that ICT has
   large energy savings potential, but that the realization of this
   potential is highly dependent on deployment details and user behavior.
   Discussion. While the overall net effect of ICT is likely to remain
   unknown, this review suggests several guidelines for improving research
   quality in this area, including increased data collection, enhancing
   traditional modeling studies with sensitivity analysis, greater care in
   scoping, less confidence in characterizing aggregate impacts, more
   effort on understanding user behavior, and more contextual integration
   across the different levels of the effect taxonomy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have characterized copper-based nanoparticles (CBNPs) as
   relatively insoluble, raising potential persistence, accumulation, and
   toxicological concerns about their long-term application as agricultural
   pesticides. The dissolution rates of two CBNPs were measured in natural

   with respect to CuO(s) (total Cu, <1 mg/kg). Kocide 3000, an
   agricultural pesticide formulation with nanoscale Cu(OH)(2) particles,
   rapidly dissolved with an experimental half-life of <8 h in natural
   water. Copper oxide nanoparticles were longer-lived, with an
   experimental half-life of 73 h in natural water. In contrast to prior
   reports of CuONP dissolution, our results suggest that even in
   moderately alkaline waters, CuO and Cu(OH)(2) NPs may persist as

Abstract = {{A compact and robust grating-based monolithic optical pulse compressor
   is proposed. By integrating diffraction gratings onto opposite surfaces
   of a solid fused-silica block whose index of refraction is larger than
   that of air, one reduces the effective physical optical path length and
   hence the requisite longitudinal separation between the gratings.
   Furthermore, appropriate distributed Bragg reflectors coated on the two
   transverse surfaces of the block are used to fold the physical distance
   diffracted light travels between the gratings; this is accomplished by
   multiple reflections within the block before the beam impinges on the
   second grating. Ultimately, the combined effects of the Bragg reflectors
   and the optically dense solid block contribute to reducing the physical
   volume of the compressor. Two approaches for analyzing the function of
   the proposed compressor are presented. Parameters from a conventional
   compressor are used to validate the method for a comparative calculation
   of the volumes of the new and conventional compressor system. (C) 2016

Title = {{3D Printing PDMS Elastomer in a Hydrophilic Support Bath via Freeform

Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of
   biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture
   substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has
   proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low
   elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here
   we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins
   within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible
   embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts
   as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of
   the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS
   extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of
   hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS
   prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while
   maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the
   Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using
   phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress.
   As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and
   helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical
   tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D
   printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that
   hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D
   printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials
   that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the
   technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the
   FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Power systems need to have sufficient generation capacity to support the
   demand at all times. In addition, dispatchable generation resources
   should be capable of adjusting their power output on a short term basis
   not only to alleviate uncertainties of nondispatchable generation and
   load fluctuations but also to correct for forecast errors. This paper
   presents a long-term planning approach to co-optimize capacities of
   energy storages and fast-ramping generation. We model and integrate the
   capability of the storage to provide multiple services for the system.
   Our formulation takes into account wind generation and demand forecast
   errors as well as short-term fluctuations. A stochastic optimization
   problem is formulated consisting of hourly and intrahour time scales.
   The approach determines the optimal size of newly deployed generation
   and storage resources to provide adequate generation capacity and
   ramping needed to support hourly demand. Additionally, our method
   ensures that the system is capable of following the net load in
   intrahour time intervals, as well as mitigating the impact of short-term
   wind power and load fluctuations. In this formulation, power balance,
   network security, and system ramping capability are stochastic
   constraints being modeled as chance constraints. A 3-bus and the IEEE
   24-bus test systems are studied to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Suicide rates are highest in adults of middle and older age. Research
   with psychiatric patients has shown that proneness to feel regret about
   past decisions can grow so intense that suicide becomes a tempting
   escape. Here, we examine the additional role of individual differences
   in maximizing, or the tendency to strive for the best decision, rather
   than one that is good enough. We provided individual-difference measures
   of maximizing, regret proneness, and negative life decision outcomes (as
   reported on the Decision Outcome Inventory) to a nonpsychiatric control
   group, as well as three groups of psychiatric patients in treatment for
   suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, or non-suicidal depression. We
   found that scores on the three individual-difference measures were worse
   for psychiatric patients than for nonpsychiatric controls and were
   correlated to clinical assessments of depression, hopelessness, and
   suicidal ideation. More importantly, maximizing was associated with
   these clinical assessments, even after taking into account maximizers'
   worse life decision outcomes. Regret proneness significantly mediated
   those relationships, suggesting that maximizers could be at risk for
   clinical depression because of their proneness to regret. We discuss the
   theoretical relevance of our findings and their promise for clinical
   practice. Ultimately, late-life depression and suicidal ideation may be
   treated with interventions that promote better decision making and
   regret regulation. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{48-54}},

Abstract = {{The applications of laser scanning technology are rapidly expanding in
   the civil engineering domain. LiDAR technology is now commonly used in
   the surveying and monitoring of large infrastructures. In particular,
   tunnels have become key transport infrastructures, subjected to
   maintenance processes that allow quality checks for tunnel modifications
   or tunnel clearance and profile checks.
   The research described in this paper targets developing an approach to
   semi-automatically retrieve the tunnel vertical clearance based on
   ground based mobile LiDAR data. The steps of this approach include
   extraction of cross sections orthogonal to the vehicle trajectory and
   road markings based on radiometric information, and conversion of cross
   section to a two-dimensional profile to estimate the vertical clearance.
   The validation of the developed approach is done using real-life case
   study, a road tunnel in southern Galicia, Spain. An accuracy of 100\% in
   detection of cross sections is achieved. Only one of the cross sections
   shows a relative error in vertical clearance measurement higher than
   1\%. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed
   approach for computing vertical clearances and demonstrating that tunnel
   management activities can definitely benefit from using mobile LiDAR by
   minimizing survey time and increasing productivity in dangerous
   environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of the cryoprotective agent (CPA) cocktail DP6
   in combination with synthetic ice modulators (SIMs) is measured in this
   study, using a transient hot-wire method. DP6 is a mixture of 3 M
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 3 M propylene glycol, which received
   significant attention in the cryobiology community in recent years.
   Tested SIMs include 6\% 1,3Cyclohexanediol, 6\% 2,3Butanediol, and 12\%
   PEG400 (percentage by volume). This study integrates the scanning
   cryomacroscope for visual verification of crystallization and
   vitrification events. It is demonstrated that the thermal conductivity
   of the vitrifying CPA cocktail decreases monotonically with the
   decreasing temperature down to -180 degrees C. By contrast, the thermal
   conductivity of the crystalline material increases with decreasing
   temperature in the same temperature range. Results of this study
   demonstrate that the thermal conductivity may vary by three fold between
   the amorphous and crystalline phases of DP6 below the glass transition
   temperature of DP6 (T-g = -119 degrees C). The selected SIMs demonstrate
   the ability to inhibit crystallization in DP6, even at subcritical
   cooling rates. An additional ice suppression capability is observed by
   the Euro-Collins as a vehicle solution, disproportionate to its volume
   ratio in the cocktail. The implication of the observed thermal
   conductivity differences between the amorphous and crystalline phases of
   the same cocktail on cryopreservation simulations is significant in some
   cases and must be taken into account in thermal analyses of
   cryopreservation protocols. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Cryomacroscopy is an effective means to observe physical events
   affecting cryopreservation success in large-size specimens. The current
   study aims at integrating polarized-light in the study of large-size
   cryopreservation, using the scanning cryomacroscope as a development
   platform. Results of this study demonstrate polarized light as a
   visualization enhancement means, including the following effects:
   contaminants in the CPA solution, crystallization, fracture formation,
   thermal contraction, and solute precipitation. In addition,
   photoelasticity effects are used to demonstrate the development of
   residual stresses and the potential for stress relaxation above the
   glass transition temperature. Furthermore, this study suggests that the
   ability to periodically switch between non-polarized light and polarized
   light is an essential feature of investigation. When using polarized
   light for example, a dark region may represent a free-of-stress and
   free-of-crystals material, or fully crystallized material, which may
   potentially experience mechanical stress; switching to a non-polarized
   light would help to distinguish between the different cases. The
   analysis of thermo-mechanical stress in cryopreservation is essentially
   based on four key elements: identification of physical events, knowledge
   of physical properties, thermal analysis of the specimen, and
   description of the mechanical behavior of the cryopreserved material
   (also known as the constitutive law). With the above knowledge, one can
   investigate the conditions to preserve structural integrity. While the
   current study aims at identification of physical events, critical
   knowledge on physical properties and mechanical behavior has already
   been developed in previous studies. The companion manuscript (Part II)
   aims at providing means for thermal analysis in the specimen, which will
   serve as the basis for a multi-scale analysis of thermomechanical stress
   in large-size specimens. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at developing thermal analysis tools and explaining
   experimental observations made by means of polarized-light
   cryomacroscopy (Part I). Thermal modeling is based on finite elements
   analysis (FEA), where two model parameters are extracted from thermal
   measurements: (i) the overall heat transfer coefficient between the
   cuvette and the cooling chamber, and (ii) the effective thermal
   conductivity within the cryoprotective agent (CPA) at the upper part of
   the cryogenic temperature range. The effective thermal conductivity
   takes into account enhanced heat transfer due to convection currents
   within the CPA, creating the so-called Benard cells. Comparison of
   experimental results with simulation data indicates that the uncertainty
   in simulations due to the propagation of uncertainty in measured
   physical properties exceeds the uncertainty in experimental
   measurements, which validates the modeling approach. It is shown in this
   study that while a cavity may form in the upper-center portion of the
   vitrified CPA, it has very little effect on estimating the temperature
   distribution within the domain. This cavity is driven by thermal
   contraction of the CPA, with the upper-center of the domain
   transitioning to glass last. Finally, it is demonstrated in this study
   that additional stresses may develop within the glass transition
   temperature range due to nonlinear behavior of the thermal expansion
   coefficient. This effect is reported here for the first time in the
   context of cryobiology, using the capabilities of polarized-light
   cryomacroscopy. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Ten-Year Monitored Natural Recovery of Lead-Contaminated Mine Tailing in
   Klity Creek, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Klity Creek has become Thailand's first official remediation
   ordered by the court in 2013, 15 years after the spill of lead
   (Pb)-contaminated mine tailing into the creek. The Pollution Control
   Department (PCD) decided to restore the creek through monitored natural
   recovery (MNR) since 2006 but has not been successful. Interestingly,
   the most recent remediation plan in 2015 will still apply MNR to five
   out of the seven portions of the creek, despite no scientific
   feasibility evaluation of using MNR to restore the creek.
   OBJECTIVE: This study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the
   feasibility of using MNR to clean up the creek in order to protect the
   Klity children from excess Pb exposure.
   METHODS: We analyzed the physical and chemical transformation of Pb
   contaminated sediment in the creek and developed a remedial action goal
   and cleanup level using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic model
   (IEUBK). We empirically determined the natural recovery (NR) potentials
   and rates using 10 years of data monitoring the water and sediment
   samples from eight monitoring stations (KC1 to KC8).
   RESULTS: Klity Creek has NR potential for water except at KC2, which is
   closest to the spill and the other improperly managed Pb sources.
   However, the creek has no NR potential for sediment except at the KC8
   location (NR rate = 11.1 +/- 3.0 x 10(-3) month(-1)) farthest from the
   spill.
   CONCLUSION: The MNR method is not suitable to use as the sole remedial
   approach for Klity Creek (KC2 to KC7). Although MNR is applicable at
   KC8, it may require up to 377 +/- 76 years to restore the sediment to
   the background Pb concentration.}},

Abstract = {{In a multicore system, applications running on different cores interfere
   at main memory. This inter-application interference degrades overall
   system performance and unfairly slows down applications. Prior works
   have developed application-aware memory request schedulers to tackle
   this problem. State-of-the-art application-aware memory request
   schedulers prioritize memory requests of applications that are
   vulnerable to interference, by ranking individual applications based on
   their memory access characteristics and enforcing a total rank order. In
   this paper, we observe that state-of-the-art application-aware memory
   schedulers have two major shortcomings. First, such schedulers trade off
   hardware complexity in order to achieve high performance or fairness,
   since ranking applications individually with a total order based on
   memory access characteristics leads to high hardware cost and
   complexity. Such complexity could prevent the scheduler from meeting the
   stringent timing requirements of state-of-the-art DDR protocols. Second,
   ranking can unfairly slow down applications that are at the bottom of
   the ranking stack, thereby sometimes leading to high slowdowns and low
   overall system performance. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose
   the Blacklisting Memory Scheduler (BLISS), which achieves high system
   performance and fairness while incurring low hardware cost and
   complexity. BLISS design is based on two new observations. First, we
   find that, to mitigate interference, it is sufficient to separate
   applications into only two groups, one containing applications that are
   vulnerable to interference and another containing applications that
   cause interference, instead of ranking individual applications with a
   total order. Vulnerable-to-interference group is prioritized over the
   interference-causing group. Second, we show that this grouping can be
   efficiently performed by simply counting the number of consecutive
   requests served from each application. We evaluate BLISS across a wide
   variety of workloads and system configurations and compare its
   performance and hardware complexity (via RTL implementations), with five
   state-of-the-art memory schedulers. Our evaluations show that BLISS
   achieves 5 percent better system performance and 25 percent better
   fairness than the best-performing previous memory scheduler while
   greatly reducing critical path latency and hardware area cost of the
   memory scheduler (by 79 and 43 percent, respectively), thereby achieving
   a good trade-off between performance, fairness and hardware complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Two photon polymerization (TPP) based 3D direct laser writing (3D-DLW)
   finds application in a wide range of research areas ranging from
   photonic and mechanical metamaterials to micro-devices. Most common
   structures are either single lines or formed by a set of interconnected
   lines as in the case of crystals. In order to increase the fidelity of
   these structures and reach the ultimate resolution, the laser power and
   scan speed used in the writing process should be chosen carefully.
   However, the optimization of these writing parameters is an iterative
   and time consuming process in the absence of a model for the estimation
   of line dimensions. To this end, we report a semi-empirical analytic
   model through simulations and fitting, and demonstrate that it can be
   used for estimating the line dimensions mostly within one standard
   deviation of the average values over a wide range of laser power and
   scan speed combinations. The model delimits the trend in onset of
   micro-explosions in the photoresist due to over-exposure and of low
   degree of conversion due to under-exposure. The model guides setting of
   high-fidelity and robust writing parameters of a photonic crystal
   structure without iteration and in close agreement with the estimated
   line dimensions. The proposed methodology is generalizable by adapting
   the model coefficients to any 3D-DLW setup and corresponding photoresist
   as a means to estimate the line dimensions for tuning the writing
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Many light-duty vehicle crashes occur due to human error and distracted
   driving. Partially-automated crash avoidance features offer the
   potential to reduce the frequency and severity of vehicle crashes that
   occur due to distracted driving and/or human error by assisting in
   maintaining control of the vehicle or issuing alerts if a potentially
   dangerous situation is detected. This paper evaluates the benefits and
   costs of fleet-wide deployment of blind spot monitoring, lane departure
   warning, and forward collision warning crash avoidance systems within
   the US light-duty vehicle fleet. The three crash avoidance technologies
   could collectively prevent or reduce the severity of as many as 1.3
   million U.S. crashes a year including 133,000 injury crashes and 10,100
   fatal crashes. For this paper we made two estimates of potential
   benefits in the United States: (1) the upper bound fleet-wide technology
   diffusion benefits by assuming all relevant crashes are avoided and (2)
   the lower bound fleet-wide benefits of the three technologies based on
   observed insurance data. The latter represents a lower bound as
   technology is improved over time and cost reduced with scale economies
   and technology improvement. All three technologies could collectively
   provide a lower bound annual benefit of about \$18 billion if equipped
   on all light-duty vehicles. With 2015 pricing of safety options, the
   total annual costs to equip all light-duty vehicles with the three
   technologies would be about \$13 billion, resulting in an annual net
   benefit of about \$4 billion or a \$20 per vehicle net benefit. By
   assuming all relevant crashes are avoided, the total upper bound annual
   net benefit from all three technologies combined is about \$202 billion
   or an \$861 per vehicle net benefit, at current technology costs. The
   technologies we are exploring in this paper represent an early form of
   vehicle automation and a positive net benefit suggests the fleet-wide
   adoption of these technologies would be beneficial from an economic and
   social perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-film solar cells based on polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 absorbers
   exhibit record conversion efficiencies of up to 22.6\%. There is still a
   lack of a quantitative connection between the grain-boundary character
   distribution (GBCD) and the corresponding electrical and optoelectronic
   properties. The present work uses microstructural data from a CuInSe2
   thin film acquired by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to
   evaluate the GBCD. The most prominent features of the GBCD of CuInSe2
   are Sigma 3 twin boundaries and the Sigma 9 and Sigma 27a symmetric tilt
   grain boundaries. Moreover, combining EBSD with electron-beam-induced
   current and cathodoluminescence (measurements on the same identical
   area) on a CuInSe2/Moiglass stack provide the means to relate the
   grain-boundary character with the corresponding electrical and
   optoelectronic signals across the grain boundary. In part, determining
   this relationship is accomplished by means of correlation analysis using
   measurement data from more than 100 grain boundaries. However, the
   crystallographic, electrical and optoelectronic data showed no strong
   correlations, which is attributed to atomic reconstruction found in
   atomic planes adjacent to planar defects in polycrystalline CuInSe2 thin
   films and corresponding reductions of excess charge densities at these
   defects. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A systematic method to customize an efficient organic Rankine cycle
   (ORC) to recover waste heat in refineries}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{302-315}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) convert low temperature waste heat into
   power. When there are multiple waste heat sources in a refinery,
   operability and safety considerations may make it more practical to use
   hot water as the medium to recover waste heat. The hot water stream can
   then release the heat to the organic working fluid in an ORC system. In
   this paper, how to customize an efficient ORC for a heat exchanger
   network (HEN) to optimally recover multiple strands of waste heat is
   investigated. Because the heat exchanger network structure, the hot
   water loop, and ORC system interact with each other, the coordination
   and synthesis of these systems ought to be considered simultaneously to
   maximize the energy performance. A methodology is proposed using the
   waste heat composite curve (WHCC) and grand composite curve (GCC) to
   diagnose inefficiencies in an existing heat exchanger network. In
   addition, the WHCC can be used to solve the problem of the tradeoff
   between waste heat quality and quantity recovered with an intermediate
   stream. WHCCs are classified into two types, and procedures for
   designing the recovery network for each type are presented while
   considering the interaction with working fluid selection. The methods
   proposed in this paper can help engineers diagnose problems with the
   original heat exchanger network, and determine the flowrate of hot
   water, the structure of the waste heat recovery network, the best
   working fluid and the operating conditions of ORC system in an
   integrated manner. The ideas are applied to an illustrative case study
   in collaboration with Sinopec. The case study shows the effectiveness of
   this method and compares different extents of heat exchanger network
   modification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{When most designers set out to develop a new product, they solicit
   feedback from potential consumers. These data are incorporated into the
   design process in an effort to more effectively meet customer
   requirements. Often these data are used to construct a model of consumer
   preference capable of evaluating candidate designs. Although the
   mechanics of these models have been extensively studied, there are still
   some open questions, particularly with respect to models of aesthetic
   preference. When constructing preference models, simplistic product
   representations are often favored over high fidelity product models in
   order to save time and expense. This work investigates how choice of
   product representation can affect model performance in visual conjoint
   analysis. Preference models for a single product, a table knife, are
   derived using three different representation schemes: simple sketches,
   solid models, and three dimensional (3D)-printed models. Each of these
   representations is used in a separate conjoint analysis survey. The
   results from this study show that the choice model based on 3D-printed
   photopolymer prototypes underperformed. Additionally, consumer responses
   were inconsistent and potentially contradictory between different
   representations. Consequently, when using conjoint analysis for product
   innovation, obtaining a true understanding of consumer preference
   requires selecting representations based on how accurately they convey
   the product details in question.}},

Title = {{Bridging the gap between impact assessment methods and climate science}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{129-140}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Life-cycle assessment and carbon footprint studies are widely used by
   decision makers to identify climate change mitigation options and
   priorities at corporate and public levels. These applications, including
   the vast majority of emission accounting schemes and policy frameworks,
   traditionally quantify climate impacts of human activities by
   aggregating greenhouse gas emissions into the so-called CO2-equivalents
   using the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) as the default
   emission metric. The practice was established in the early nineties and
   has not been coupled with progresses in climate science, other than
   simply updating numerical values for GWP100. We review the key insights
   from the literature surrounding climate science that are at odds with
   existing climate impact methods and we identify possible improvement
   options. Issues with the existing approach lie in the use of a single
   metric that cannot represent the climate system complexity for all
   possible research and policy contexts, and in the default exclusion of
   near-term climate forcers such as aerosols or ozone precursors and
   changes in the Earth's energy balance associated with land cover
   changes. Failure to acknowledge the complexity of climate change drivers
   and the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of their climate system
   responses can lead to the deployment of suboptimal, and potentially even
   counterproductive, mitigation strategies. We argue for an active
   consideration of these aspects to bridge the gap between climate impact
   methods used in environmental impact analysis and climate science. (C)

Abstract = {{Durability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells in automotive applications
   can be severely affected by hydrogen starvation arising due to
   transients during the drive-cycle. It causes individual cell voltage
   reversal, yielding water electrolysis and carbon corrosion reactions at
   the anode, ultimately leading to catastrophic cell failure. A popular
   material-based mitigation strategy is to employ a reversal tolerant
   anode (RTA) that includes oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst
   (e.g., IrO2) to promote water electrolysis over carbon corrosion. Here
   we report that RTA performance surprisingly drops under not only
   water-deficient but also water-excess conditions. This presents a
   significant technical challenge since the most common triggers for cell
   reversal involve excess liquid water. Our findings from detailed
   electro-chemical diagnostics and nano-scale X-ray computed tomography
   provide insight into how automotive fuel cells can overcome critical
   vulnerabilities using material-based solutions. Our work also highlights
   the need for improved materials, electrode designs, and operation
   strategies for robust RTAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates how the value of information (VoI) metric can
   guide information collection and optimal sensor placement in spatially
   distributed systems. VoI incorporates relevant features to decision
   making, such as uncertainty about the state of the system, precision of
   measurements, the availability of intervention actions, and the overall
   cost of managing the system. Spatially distributed systems also allow
   for information propagation, i.e. measurements collected at one location
   can be used to update knowledge at other related locations. In this
   paper, while restricting our attention to Gaussian random field and
   binary state models, we illustrate first how sensor placements depend on
   the decision-making problem to be addressed, as encoded in a
   problem-specific loss function, and second how the complexity of VoI
   computations is impacted by this loss function's characteristics. In
   doing so, we consider several loss functions and present computational
   techniques for evaluating VoI under them. Finally, we apply these
   techniques to efficiently optimize sensor placements by the VoI metric
   in two example applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fast Fourier transform algorithms on large data sets achieve poor
   performance on various platforms because of the inefficient strided
   memory access patterns. These inefficient access patterns need to be
   reshaped to achieve high performance implementations. In this paper we
   formally restructure 1D, 2D and 3D FFTs targeting a generic machine
   model with a two-level memory hierarchy requiring block data transfers,
   and derive memory access pattern efficient algorithms using custom block
   data layouts. These algorithms need to be carefully mapped to the
   targeted platform's architecture, particularly the memory subsystem, to
   fully utilize performance and energy efficiency potentials. Using the
   Kronecker product formalism, we integrate our optimizations into Spiral
   framework and evaluate a family of DRAM-optimized FFT algorithms and
   their hardware implementation design space via automated techniques. In
   our evaluations, we demonstrate DRAM-optimized accelerator designs over
   a large tradeoff space given various problem (single/double precision
   1D, 2D and 3D FFTs) and hardware platform (off-chip DRAM, 3D-stacked
   DRAM, ASIC, FPGA, etc.) parameters. We show that Spiral generated pareto
   optimal designs can achieve close to theoretical peak performance of the
   targeted platform offering 6x and 6.5x system performance and power
   efficiency improvements respectively over conventional row-column FFT
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The development of new electrolytes is a centerpiece of many strategies
   to improve electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) devices. We
   present here a computational screening-based rational design approach to
   find new electrolyte materials. As an example application, the known
   chemical space of almost 70 million compounds is investigated in search
   of electrochemically more stable solvents. Cyano esters are identified
   as especially promising new compound class. Theoretical predictions are
   validated with subsequent experimental studies on a selected case. These
   studies show that based on theoretical predictions only, a previously
   untested, but very well performing compound class was identified. We
   thus find that our rational design strategy is indeed able to
   successfully identify completely new materials with substantially
   improved properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organolead halide perovskites are a family of hybrid organic-inorganic
   compounds whose remarkable optoelectronic properties have been under

   scattering to study low-energy lattice excitations in single crystals of

   the displacive nature of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition, which
   is further shown, using neutron and x-ray diffraction, to be close to a
   tricritical point. Lastly, we detect quasistatic symmetry-breaking
   nanodomains persisting well into the high-temperature cubic phase,
   possibly stabilized by local defects. These findings reveal key
   structural properties of these materials, and also bear important
   implications for carrier dynamics across an extended temperature range

Abstract = {{The presence of bromide in rivers does not affect ecosystems or present
   a human health risk; however, elevated concentrations of bromide in
   drinking water sources can lead to difficulty meeting drinking water
   disinfection byproduct (DBP) regulations. Recent attention has focused
   on oil and gas wastewater and coal-fired power plant wet flue gas
   desulfurization (FGD) wastewater bromide discharges. Bromide can be
   added to coal to enhance mercury removal, and increased use of bromide
   at some power plants is expected. Evaluation of potential increases in
   bromide concentrations from bromide addition for mercury control is
   lacking. The present work utilizes bromide monitoring data in the
   Allegheny River and a mass-balance approach to elucidate bromide
   contributions from anthropogenic and natural sources under current and
   future scenarios. For the Allegheny River, current bromide is associated
   approximately 49\% with oil- and gas-produced water discharges and 33\%
   with coal-fired power plants operating wet FGD, with 18\% derived from
   natural sources during mean flow conditions in August. Median wet FGD
   bromide loads could increase 3-fold from 610 to 1900 kg/day if all
   plants implement bromide addition for mercury control. Median bromide
   concentrations in the lower Allegheny River in August would rise to 410,
   200, and 180 mu g/L under low-, mean-, and high-flow conditions,
   respectively, for the bromide-addition scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission expansion planning (TEP) is an important and
   computationally expensive decision-making process in power systems.
   Expression of the power flows using power transfer distribution factors
   (PTDFs) could potentially reduce the size and computational cost of the
   TEP. However, this formulation does not lend itself easily for this
   problem as the system topology changes in the course of the optimisation
   procedure. This study presents a PTDF-based TEP model devoid of voltage
   angles and nodal power balances, while producing the same solution as
   angle-based TEP models. The proposed model is capable of monitoring a
   limited number of transmission lines that have significant impact on the
   system's reliable and optimal operation. It thus considerably reduces
   the number of constraints and results in a scalable optimisation
   problem. The proposed model is highly advantageous especially for the
   TEP of large-scale power systems. The numerical results provide an
   indication for the effectiveness of the proposed model.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{256-272}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{We address the inventory planning problem in process networks under
   uncertainty through stochastic programming models. Inventory planning
   requires the formulation of multiperiod models to represent the
   time-varying conditions of industrial process, but multistage stochastic
   programming formulations are often too large to solve. We propose a
   policy-based approximation of the multistage stochastic model that
   avoids anticipativity by enforcing the same decision rule for all
   scenarios. The proposed formulation includes the logic that models
   inventory policies, and it is used to find the parameters that offer the
   best expected performance. We propose policies for inventory planning in
   process networks with arrangements of inventories in parallel and in
   series. We compare the inventory planning strategies obtained from the
   policy-based formulation and the analogous two-stage approximation of
   the multistage stochastic program. Sequential implementation of the
   planning strategies in receding horizon simulations shows the advantages
   of the policy-based model, despite the increase in computational
   complexity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Thin film wrinkling by strain mismatch on 3D surfaces}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{107-113}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wrinkling of thin films in micro-and nanoscale has found wide
   applications in stretchable electronics, optical gratings, material
   characterization, and biology. However, most wrinkling work is in planar
   fashion and only limited work on 3D wrinkling has been reported. In this
   paper, we present experimental demonstration of 3D Cr film wrinkling on
   PDMS micro-ridges induced by strain mismatch. We first fabricated PDMS
   micro-ridges using replication from a silicon mold, prepared by
   conventional microfabrication processes. While pre-stretching the PDMS
   specimen along the ridge direction, thin Cr film was deposited through
   physical sputtering. After releasing the prestrain, two wrinkling waves
   formed on the two inclined surfaces of the PDMS ridges with the same
   wavelength but opposite phases. These two wrinkling waves twist the top
   of the ridge into a wavy shape, forming wrinkling waves oscillating in
   the direction parallel to the substrate plane. In contrast, 2D wrinkling
   waves oscillate in the direction perpendicular to the substrate plane.
   Using finite element simulations, we demonstrate that the 180 degrees
   phase shift between the two sides is favored by the dominant buckling
   modes. While the 3D wrinkling wavelength is consistent with 2D
   theoretical prediction, wrinkles on the ridge feature non-uniform
   wrinkling wave amplitude along the width of the inclined surface. This
   3D wrinkling work opens new opportunities in manufacturing curved-shape
   mold for contact printing and increases surface to volume ratio for
   wetting and battery applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{184-190}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Using a newly developed in-situ platform combined with high-speed
   imaging up to 200,000 frames per second, we measure friction versus
   velocity in a micromachined interface from 0.1 to 3000 mu m/s. The
   steady-state friction coefficient (friction at constant velocity) of a
   boundary lubricant-coated interface decreases up to 300 mu m/s, then
   increases. The friction increase is confirmed in an independent test in
   which velocity is increased instantaneously. Previous single asperity
   molecular dynamics simulations of monolayer boundary lubricants indicate
   that friction is independent of velocity, while experiments and
   simulations of periodic potentials indicate a monotonically increasing
   trend. We directly bridge spatial and temporal scales using rate-state
   constitutive laws, and attribute the decrease in friction to the
   decrease in asperity lifetime (a state effect), and the increase to the
   emerging dominance of interfacial viscosity (a rate effect). (C) 2016

Abstract = {{According to socioemotional selectivity theory, older adults' emotional
   well-being stems from having a limited future time perspective that
   motivates them to maximize well-being in the ``here and now.{''}
   Presumably, then, older adults' time horizons are associated with
   emotional competencies that boost positive affect and dampen negative
   affect, but little research has addressed this. Using a U.S. adult
   life-span sample (N = 3,933; 18-93 years), we found that a 2-factor
   model of future time perspective (future opportunities; limited time)
   fit the data better than a 1-factor model. Through middle age, people
   perceived the life-span hourglass as half full-they focused more on
   future opportunities than limited time. Around Age 60, the balance
   changed to increasingly perceiving the life-span hourglass as half
   empty-they focused less on future opportunities and more on limited
   time, even after accounting for perceived health, self-reported
   decision-making ability, and retirement status. At all ages, women's
   time horizons focused more on future opportunities compared with men's,
   and men's focused more on limited time. Focusing on future opportunities
   was associated with reporting less preoccupation with negative events,
   whereas focusing on limited time was associated with reporting more
   preoccupation. Older adults reported less preoccupation with negative
   events, and this association was stronger after controlling for their
   perceptions of limited time and fewer future opportunities, suggesting
   that other pathways may explain older adults' reports of their ability
   to disengage from negative events. Insights gained and questions raised
   by measuring future time perspective as 2 dimensions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Peer ratings have become increasingly important sources of product
   information, particularly in markets for information goods. However, in
   spite of the increasing prevalence of this information, there are
   relatively few academic studies that analyze the impact of peer ratings
   on consumers transacting in ``real-world{''} marketplaces. In this
   paper, we partner with a major telecommunications company to analyze the
   impact of peer ratings in a real-world video-on-demand market where
   consumer participation is organic and where movies are costly and well
   known to consumers. After experimentally changing the initial conditions
   of product information displayed to consumers, we find that, consistent
   with the prior literature, peer ratings influence consumer behavior
   independently from underlying product quality. However, we also find
   that, in contrast to the prior literature, there is little evidence of
   long-term bias as a result of herding effects, at least in our setting.
   Specifically, when movies are artificially promoted or demoted in peer
   rating lists, subsequent reviews cause them to return to their true
   quality position relatively quickly. One explanation for this difference
   is that consumers in our empirical setting likely had more outside
   information about the true quality of the products they were evaluating
   than did consumers in the studies reported in prior literature. Although
   tentative, this explanation suggests that in real-world marketplaces
   where consumers have sufficient access to outside information about true
   product quality, peer ratings may be more robust to herding effects and
   thus provide more reliable signals of true product quality than
   previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter estimation of reaction kinetics from spectroscopic data
   remains an important and challenging problem. This study describes a
   unified framework to address this challenge. The presented framework is
   based on maximum likelihood principles, nonlinear optimization
   techniques, and the use of collocation methods to solve the differential
   equations involved. To solve the overall parameter estimation problem,
   we first develop an iterative optimization-based procedure to estimate
   the variances of the noise in system variables (eg, concentrations) and
   spectral measurements. Once these variances are estimated, we then
   determine the concentration profiles and kinetic parameters
   simultaneously. From the properties of the nonlinear programming solver
   and solution sensitivity, we also obtain the covariance matrix and
   standard deviations for the estimated kinetic parameters. Our proposed
   approach is demonstrated on 7 case studies that include simulated data
   as well as actual experimental data. Moreover, our numerical results
   compare well with the multivariate curve resolution alternating least
   squares approach.
   We present a unified framework for parameter estimation of reaction
   kinetics from spectroscopic data, based on maximum likelihood, nonlinear
   programming (NLP), and collocation methods for the
   differential-algebraic model. An iterative procedure estimates the noise
   variance in state variables and spectral measurements. Then,
   concentration profiles and kinetic parameters are determined
   simultaneously by the NLP solver. Finally, NLP sensitivity recovers the
   covariance and standard deviations for the estimated kinetic parameters.
   Seven case studies demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework.}},

Title = {{Enabling Accurate and Practical Online Flash Channel Modeling for Modern
   MLC NAND Flash Memory}},

Abstract = {{NAND flash memory is a widely used storage medium that can be treated as
   a noisy channel. Each flash memory cell stores data as the threshold
   voltage of a floating gate transistor. The threshold voltage can shift
   as a result of various types of circuit-level noise, introducing errors
   when data are read from the channel and ultimately reducing flash
   lifetime. An accurate model of the threshold voltage distribution across
   flash cells can enable mechanisms within the flash controller that
   improve channel reliability and device lifetime. Unfortunately, existing
   threshold voltage distribution models are either not accurate enough or
   have high computational complexity, which makes them unsuitable for
   online implementation within the controller.
   We propose a new low-complexity flash memory model, built upon a
   modified version of the Student's t-distribution and the power law,
   which captures the threshold voltage distribution and predicts future
   distribution shifts as wear increases. Using our experimental
   characterization of the state-of-the-art 1X-nm (i.e., 15-19 nm)
   multi-level cell NAND flash chips, we show that our model is highly
   accurate (with an average modeling error of 0.68\%), and also simple to
   compute within the flash controller (requiring 4.41 times less
   computation time than the most accurate prior model, with negligible
   decrease in accuracy). Our model also predicts future threshold voltage
   distribution shifts with a 2.72\% modeling error. We demonstrate several
   example applications of our model in the flash controller, which improve
   flash channel reliability significantly, including a new mechanism to
   predict the remaining lifetime of a flash device. Our evaluations for
   two of these applications show that our model: 1) helps improve flash
   memory lifetime by 48.9\% and/or (2) enables the flash device to safely
   sustain 69.9\% more write operations than manufacturer specifications.
   We hope and believe that the analyses and models developed in this paper
   can inspire other novel approaches to flash memory reliability and
   modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Shingled bit-patterned media (BPM) recording is a promising candidate to
   improve the magnetic recording density above 1 Tb/in(2) while keeping
   the conventional writer design. However, shingled magnetic recording
   (SMR) leads to a narrower track pitch, and thus increased inter-track
   interference motivating the investigation of array readers and 2-D
   sectors. In this paper, we investigate SMR on BPM with 2-D sectors at
   the channel density of 3.71 Tb/in(2). Use of 2-D sectors allows the
   possibility of using either hard or soft information from already
   detected tracks in that 2-D sector to improve the detection performance
   on the current track. An important question in this context is whether
   all tracks in a 2-D sector should be of the same nominal width or if
   there is a potential benefit to using different widths for adjacent
   tracks. Based on our investigation, we show that alternating track
   widths {[}i.e., one less-trimmed (fat) track followed by one
   more-trimmed (narrow) track] are beneficial to a bit error rate (BER)
   perspective. In particular, we propose and investigate the use of a
   bidirectional decision feedback modified Viterbi (BD-DFMV) detector to
   improve the BER performance. Our simulations indicate that for a
   hypothetical 2-D sector with 13 tracks and 5\% media noise and at the
   target BER of 10(-2), using alternating track widths and readback with a
   single reader, the BD-DFMV algorithm can provide about 1.6 dB
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain, compared with using the same detection
   algorithm but on a 2-D sector with uniform track widths. When using a
   reader array instead of a single reader, this SNR gain improves to about
   2.0 dB. The alternating track width structure also appears to provide
   more robustness to track mis-registration compared with the 2-D uniform
   track width case.}},

Abstract = {{Resistive memories, such as phase change memories and resistive random
   access memories, have attracted significant research interest because of
   their scalability, non-volatility, fast speed, and rewritability.
   However, their write endurance needs to be improved substantially for
   large-scale deployment of resistive memories. In addition, their write
   power consumption is much higher than the power consumption of read
   operation. Inspired by locally repairable codes (LRCs) recently
   introduced for distributed storage systems, we propose locally
   rewritable codes (LWCs) for resistive memories. We define a novel
   parameter of rewriting locality, which can be connected to repair
   locality of LRC. As small values of repair locality of LRC enable fast
   repair in distributed storage systems, small values of rewriting
   locality of LWC are able to reduce the problems of write endurance and
   write power consumption. We show how a small value of rewriting locality
   can improve write endurance and power consumption by deriving the upper
   bounds on writing cost. Also, we point out the dual relation of LRC and
   LWC, which indicates that the existing construction methods of LRC can
   be applied to construct LWC. Finally, we investigate the construction of
   LWC with error correcting capability for random errors.}},

Title = {{Variability of the Wind Turbine Power Curve}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wind turbine power curves are calibrated by turbine manufacturers under
   requirements stipulated by the International Electrotechnical Commission
   to provide a functional mapping between the mean wind speed and the mean
   turbine power output . Wind plant operators employ these power curves to
   estimate or forecast wind power generation under given wind conditions.
   However, it is general knowledge that wide variability exists in these
   mean calibration values. We first analyse how the standard deviation in
   wind speed and the standard deviation of wind power. We find that the
   magnitude of wind power fluctuations scales as the square of the mean
   wind speed. Using data from three planetary locations, we find that the
   wind speed standard deviation systematically varies with mean wind speed
   , and in some instances, follows a scaling of the form ; C being a
   constant and a fractional power. We show that, when applicable, this
   scaling form provides a minimal parameter description of the power curve
   in terms of alone. Wind data from different locations establishes that
   (in instances when this scaling exists) the exponent varies with
   location, owing to the influence of local environmental conditions on
   wind speed variability. Since manufacturer-calibrated power curves
   cannot account for variability influenced by local conditions, this
   variability translates to forecast uncertainty in power generation. We
   close with a proposal for operators to perform post-installation
   recalibration of their turbine power curves to account for the influence
   of local environmental factors on wind speed variability in order to
   reduce the uncertainty of wind power forecasts. Understanding the
   relationship between wind's speed and its variability is likely to lead
   to lower costs for the integration of wind power into the electric grid.}},

Abstract = {{This article and this issue of the AIChE Journal, is a tribute to
   Professor Roger Sargent who, as pioneer and intellectual leader of
   process systems engineering, has had a profound impact on the discipline
   of chemical engineering. Spanning more than five decades, his work has
   provided a strong mathematical foundation to process systems engineering
   through the development of sophisticated mathematical and computational
   tools for the simulation, design, control, operation and optimization of
   chemical processes. In this article we first give a brief overview of
   his career that included several leadership positions and the
   establishment of the Centre for Process Systems Engineering (CPSE) at
   Imperial College London. We next review his research contributions in
   the areas of process modeling, differential algebraic systems, process
   dynamics and control, nonlinear optimization and optimal control, design
   under uncertainty, and process scheduling. We highlight the tremendous
   impact that he has had through his students, students' students, and his
   entire academic family tree, which at present contains over 2000 names,
   probably one of the largest among the academic leaders of chemical
   engineering. Finally, we provide a brief overview of him as a modest and
   charming individual with a wonderful sense of humor. He is without doubt
   a true intellectual giant who has helped to expand the scope of chemical
   engineering by providing a strong systems component to it, and by
   establishing strong multidisciplinary links with other fields. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Flexibility analysis and robust optimization are two approaches to
   solving optimization problems under uncertainty that share some
   fundamental concepts, such as the use of polyhedral uncertainty sets and
   the worst-case approach to guarantee feasibility. The connection between
   these two approaches has not been sufficiently acknowledged and examined
   in the literature. In this context, the contributions of this work are
   fourfold: (1) a comparison between flexibility analysis and robust
   optimization from a historical perspective is presented; (2) for linear
   systems, new formulations for the three classical flexibility analysis
   problems-flexibility test, flexibility index, and design under
   uncertainty-based on duality theory and the affinely adjustable robust
   optimization (AARO) approach are proposed; (3) the AARO approach is
   shown to be generally more restrictive such that it may lead to overly
   conservative solutions; (4) numerical examples show the improved
   computational performance from the proposed formulations compared to the
   traditional flexibility analysis models. (C) 2016 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Modern nonlinear programming solvers can be utilized to solve very large
   scale problems in chemical engineering. However, these methods require
   fully open models with accurate derivatives. In this article, we address
   the hybrid glass box/black box optimization problem, in which part of a
   system is modeled with open, equation based models and part is black
   box. When equation based reduced models are used in place of the black
   box, NLP solvers may be applied directly but an accurate solution is not
   guaranteed. In this work, a trust region filter algorithm for glass
   box/black box optimization is presented. By combining concepts from
   trust region filter methods and derivative free optimization, the method
   guarantees convergence to first-order critical points of the original
   glass box/black box problem. The algorithm is demonstrated on three
   comprehensive examples in chemical process optimization. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Air Liquide operates several industrial gas pipeline networks around the
   world, connecting air separation plants to customers of industrial
   gases. The operation of such a network of plants, pipelines, and

   customer demands. We describe a complex industrial problem for real-time
   optimization of network operations in the presence of these challenges.
   We then summarize a concerted modeling and algorithmic effort toward
   global optimization of this model. The resulting advances include
   development of a regression-based fully-deterministic nonconvex
   optimization model, a tool for diagnosing infeasibilities during model
   development, reformulations and scaling to make the model more amenable
   for optimization, and development of strengthened relaxations for its
   efficient solution. We provide details on the development of these tools
   and techniques that facilitated the solution of this model in a
   reasonable computational time with the global solver BARON. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The recent explosion of capabilities to fabricate nanostructured

   an optimization problem, which can be addressed via established

Abstract = {{An ensemble of machine learning classifiers usually improves
   generalization performance and is useful for many applications. However,
   the extra memory storage and computational cost incurred from the
   combined models often limits their potential applications. In this
   article, we propose a new ensemble reduction method called CANOPY that
   significantly reduces memory storage and computations. CANOPY uses a
   technique from logic minimization for digital circuits to select and
   combine particular classification models from an initial pool in the
   form of a Boolean function, through which the reduced ensemble performs
   classification. Experiments on 20 UCI datasets demonstrate that CANOPY
   either outperforms or is very competitive with the initial ensemble and
   one state-of-the-art ensemble reduction method in terms of
   generalization error, and is superior to all existing reduction methods
   surveyed for identifying the smallest numbers of models in the reduced

Abstract = {{Accurately estimating the failure region of rare events for memory-cell
   and analog circuit blocks under process variations is a challenging
   task. In this article, we propose a new statistical method, called
   EliteScope, to estimate the circuit failure rates in rare-event regions
   and to provide conditions of parameters to achieve targeted performance.
   The new method is based on the iterative blockade framework to reduce
   the number of samples, but consists of two new techniques to improve
   existingmethods. First, the new approach employs an elite-learning
   sample-selection scheme, which can consider the effectiveness of samples
   and well coverage for the parameter space. As a result, it can reduce
   additional simulation costs by pruning less effective samples while
   keeping the accuracy of failure estimation. Second, the EliteScope
   identifies the failure regions in terms of parameter spaces to provide a
   good design guidance to accomplish the performance target. It applies
   variance-based feature selection to find the dominant parameters and
   then determine the in-spec boundaries of those parameters. We
   demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method using several memory
   and analog circuits with different numbers of process parameters.
   Experiments on four circuit examples show that EliteScope achieves a
   significant improvement on failure-region estimation in terms of
   accuracy and simulation cost over traditional approaches. The 16b
   6T-SRAM column example also demonstrates that the new method is scalable
   for handling large problems with large numbers of process variables.}},

Abstract = {{Near infrared (NIR) microscopy enables noninvasive imaging in tissue,
   particularly in the NIR-II spectral range (1000-1400 nm) where
   attenuation due to tissue scattering and absorption is minimized.
   Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanocrystals are promising deep-tissue
   imaging probes due to their photostable emission in the visible and NIR,
   but these materials are not efficiently excited at NIR-II wavelengths
   due to the dearth of lanthanide ground-state absorption transitions in
   this window. Here, we develop a class of lanthanide doped imaging probes
   that harness an energy-looping mechanism that facilitates excitation at
   NIR-II wavelengths, such as 1064 nm, that are resonant with
   excited-state absorption transitions but not ground-state absorption.
   Using computational methods and combinatorial screening, we have
   identified Tm3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles as efficient looping systems
   that emit at 800 nm under continuous-wave excitation at 1064 nm. Using
   this benign excitation with standard confocal microscopy, energy-looping
   nanoparticles (ELNPs) are imaged in cultured mammalian cells and through
   brain tissue without autofluorescence. The 1 nun imaging depths and 2 pm
   feature sizes are comparable to those demonstrated by state-of-the-art
   multiphoton techniques, illustrating that ELNPs are a promising class of
   NIR probes for high-fidelity visualization in cells and tissue.}},

Abstract = {{We show how the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS)
   framework, which provides a more detailed layering of the GotoBLAS (now

   matrix-matrix multiplication. This is of both practical and scientific
   importance, as it greatly reduces the development effort required for
   the implementation of the level-3 BLAS while also advancing our

   high-performance software. This allows the community to move on from
   valuable engineering solutions (empirically autotuning) to scientific

   derive the autocorrelation coefficient, bias, and bit rate for RTN-based
   TRNGs. Two representative RTN-based TRNG schemes are simulated to verify
   the proposed randomness models. An oscillator-based TRNG is also studied
   based on the theoretical randomness model of multiple traps-induced RTN.
   We also provide basic guidelines for designing RTN-based TRNGs.}},

Abstract = {{Heat waves can cause death, illness, and discomfort, and are expected to
   become more frequent as a result of climate change. Yet, United Kingdom
   residents have positive feelings about hot summers that may undermine
   their willingness to protect themselves against heat. We randomly
   assigned United Kingdom participants to 1 of 3 intervention strategies
   intended to promote heat protection, or to a control group. The first
   strategy aimed to build on the availability heuristic by asking
   participants to remember high summer temperatures, but it elicited
   thoughts of pleasantly hot summer weather. The second strategy aimed to
   build on the affect heuristic by evoking negative affect about summer
   temperatures, but it evoked thoughts of unpleasantly cold summer
   weather. The third strategy combined these 2 approaches and succeeded in
   evoking thoughts of unpleasantly hot summer weather. Across 2
   experiments, the third ( combined) strategy increased participants'
   expressed intentions to protect against heat compared with the control
   group, while performing at least as well as the 2 component strategies.
   We discuss implications for developing interventions about other

Abstract = {{The elevated infection rise associated with indwelling devices can
   compromise the performance of percutaneous devices and increase the risk
   of complications. High infection rates are associated with both the high
   bacterial load on the skin and epidermal downgrowth at the interface of
   the indwelling material. Here, we propose a drug-eluting material that
   promotes local dermal regeneration to reduce epidermal downgrowth.
   Mesoporous elastomeric matrices composed of naturally occurring monomers
   were prepared by a combination of photo- and thermal-crosslinking.
   Elastomeric devices loaded with conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), a class
   of small molecules that promote local anti-inflammatory responses, can
   deliver these compounds for 7 d (DCLA-elastomer = 3.94 X 10(-9) cm(2)/s,
   95\% CI {[}3.12 X 10(-9), 4.61 x 10(-9)]). In a mouse model, CLA-eluting
   elastomeric matrices increase the M2 population (5.0 x 10(3) +/- 1.4 X
   10(3) cells/cm(2)), compared to blank devices (3.8 X 10(3) +/- 2.2 x
   10(3) cells/cm(2)), and also reduce skin contraction (98.9 +/- 6.4\%),
   compared to blank devices (70.9 +/- 9.3\%) at 7 d. Dermal downgrowth is
   also attenuated at 14 d (60.4 +/- 32.4 mu m) compared to blank devices
   (171.7 +/- 93.8 mu m). CLA-eluting elastomers are therefore a viable
   strategy to reduce epidermal downgrowth in percutaneous devices.}},

   Oxidation of (AlxFeyNi1-x-y)(similar to 0.8)Cr-similar to 0.2}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Composition spread alloy films (CSAFs) are commonly used as libraries
   for high-throughput screening of composition-property relationships in
   multicomponent materials science. Because lateral gradients afford two
   degrees of freedom, an n-component CSAF can, in principle, contain any
   composition range falling on a continuous two-dimensional surface
   through an (n - 1)-dimensional composition space. However, depending on
   the complexity of the CSAF gradients, characterizing and graphically
   representing this composition range may not be straightforward when n >=
   4. The standard approach for combinatorial studies performed using
   quaternary or higher-order CSAFs has been to use fixed stoichiometric
   ratios of one or more components to force the composition range to fall
   on some well-defined plane in the composition space. In this work, we
   explore the synthesis of quaternary Al-Fe-Ni-Cr CSAFs with a rotatable
   shadow mask CSAF deposition tool, in which none of the component ratios
   are fixed. On the basis of the unique gradient geometry produced by the
   tool, we show that the continuous quaternary composition range of the
   CSAF can be rigorously represented using a set of two-dimensional
   ``pseudoternary{''} composition diagrams. We then perform a case study
   of (AlxFeyNi1-x-y)(similar to 0.8)Cr-similar to 0.2 oxidation in dry air
   at 427 +/- C to demonstrate how such CSAFs can be used to screen an
   alloy property across a continuous two-dimensional subspace of a
   quaternary composition space. We identify a continuous boundary through
   the (AlxFeyNi1-x-y)(similar to 0.8)Cr-similar to 0.2 subspace at which
   the oxygen uptake into the CSAF between 1 and 16 h oxidation time
   increases abruptly with decreasing Al content. The results are compared
   to a previous study of the oxidation of AlxFeyNi1-x-y CSAFs in dry air
   at 427 +/- C.}},

Title = {{An Unsupervised Learning Approach for Analyzing Traffic Impacts under
   Arterial Road Closures: Case Study of East Liberty in Pittsburgh}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper adopts an unsupervised learning approach, k-means clustering,
   to analyze the arterial traffic flow data over a high-dimensional
   spatiotemporal feature space. As part of the adaptive traffic control
   system deployed around the East Liberty area in Pittsburgh,
   high-resolution traffic occupancies and counts are available at the lane
   level in virtually any time resolution. The k-means clustering method is
   used to analyze those data to understand the traffic patterns before and
   after the closure and reopening of an arterial bridge. The modeling
   framework also holds great potentials for predicting traffic flow and
   detect incidents. The main findings are that clustering on
   high-dimensional spatiotemporal features can effectively distinguish
   flow patterns before and after road closure and reopening and between
   weekends and weekdays. On arterial streets, clustering based on 5-min
   data is sufficient to eliminate potential distortion on measurements
   caused by signals. Either of the two, count or occupancy, is adequate to
   serve as a feature for effective pattern clustering. It is plausible to
   use data from only selected locations and time periods to infer
   representative flow patterns and detect arterial incidents, which allows
   applications in large-scale networks with cheap sensing. In addition,
   for some lanes, there exists a transitional time period (1 week in this
   case study) immediately following the closure and reopening when traffic
   flow is transformed to a new type of daily pattern.}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference therapeutics have been limited, in large part, by the
   lack of efficient, non-toxic, non-immunogenic delivery systems. Among
   previously established methods, lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs) show
   particular promise in delivering siRNA to diverse cell and organ targets
   in vitro and in vivo. However, a better understanding of
   structure-function relationships is needed to facilitate broad
   translation to clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate the critical
   role of tail chemistry in conferring delivery efficacy to lipidoid
   molecules with three or four aliphatic tails. Tail length and structure
   significantly affected siRNA transfection in HeLa cells, with
   methacrylate (vs. acrylate) tails and tails containing ethers causing
   reductions in efficacy. Notably, we report a novel tail precursor,
   isodecyl acrylate, that conveyed marked siRNA delivery ability in vitro
   and in vivo. LNPs with isodecyl acrylate lipidoids uniformly induced
   greater than 90\% gene silencing, both in vitro and in mice
   (hepatocytes), at 40 nM and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, we
   found that tail chemistry significantly influenced the surface pKa
   values of formulated LNPs, with tails that conferred higher pKa
   facilitating higher levels of gene knockdown. Together, these data
   underscore the importance of lipidoid tail structure and provide
   guidance for the development of next generation lipid nanoparticle siRNA
   delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on historical methods, this study assesses the conventional
   cyber-sovereignty framework, which has been used to capture and
   interpret China's stance toward global Internet governance. This
   framework focuses on political control and tends to reduce China's
   policies to the attempts by an authoritarian state to elevate
   governments and intergovernmental organizations to be the only
   legitimate governors of global cyberspace. As it traces the evolution of
   China's relationship with the global Internet in the past three decades,
   the study demonstrates that China's stance is more complex than the
   prevalent framework allows and that it is both built upon and different
   from the US-centric, market-oriented Internet governance scheme. This
   study recognizes the inadequacy of the conventional framework and
   invokes a theory of critical political economy of communication, thereby
   offering an alternative model to explicate the complex power dynamics
   behind China's changing strategies. The alternative model advanced in
   this study is based on the understanding of China's evolving approach as
   the product of multifaceted interactions among a group of power-holders
   that include both state agencies and business units on the transnational
   level.}},

Title = {{Should we build wind farms close to load or invest in transmission to

Abstract = {{Wind speeds in remote areas are sometimes very high, but transmission
   costs to access these locations can be prohibitive. We present a
   conceptual model to estimate the economics of accessing high quality
   wind resources in remote areas to comply with renewable energy policy
   targets, and apply the model to the Midwestern grid (MISO) as a case
   study. We assess the goal of providing 40 TWh of new wind generation
   while minimizing costs, and include temporal aspects of wind power
   (variability costs and correlation to market prices) as well as total
   wind power produced from different farms. We find that building wind
   farms in North/South Dakota (windiest states) compared to Illinois (less
   windy, but close to load) would only be economical if the incremental
   transmission costs to access them were below \$360/kW of wind capacity
   (break-even value). Historically, the incremental transmission costs for
   wind development in North/South Dakota compared to in Illinois are about
   twice this value. However, the break-even incremental transmission cost
   for wind farms in Minnesota/Iowa (also windy states) is \$250/kW, which
   is consistent with historical costs. We conclude that wind development
   in Minnesota/Iowa is likely more economical to meet MISO renewable
   targets compared to North/South Dakota or Illinois. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{A Bayesian Model to Predict Right Ventricular Failure Following Left
   Ventricular Assist Device Therapy}},
Journal = {{JACC-HEART FAILURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{711-721}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES This study investigates the use of a Bayesian statistical
   model to address the limited predictive capacity of existing risk scores
   derived from multivariate analyses. This is based on the hypothesis that
   it is necessary to consider the interrelationships and conditional
   probabilities among independent variables to achieve sufficient
   statistical accuracy.
   BACKGROUND Right ventricular failure (RVF) continues to be a major
   adverse event following left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
   implantation.
   METHODS Data used for this study were derived from 10,909 adult patients
   from the Inter-Agency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
   Support (INTERMACS) who had a primary LVAD implanted between December
   2006 and March 2014. An initial set of 176 pre-implantation variables
   were considered. RVF post-implant was categorized as acute (<48 h),
   early (48 h to 14 daysays), and late (>14 days) in onset. For each of
   these endpoints, a separate tree-augmented naive Bayes model was
   constructed using the most predictive variables employing an open source
   Bayesian inference engine.
   RESULTS The acute RVF model consisted of 33 variables including systolic
   pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), white blood cell count, left
   ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac index, sodium levels, and
   lymphocyte percentage. The early RVF model consisted of 34 variables,
   including systolic PAP, pre-albumin, lactate dehydrogenase level,
   INTERMACS profile, right ventricular ejection fraction, pro-B-type
   natriuretic peptide, age, heart rate, tricuspid regurgitation, and body
   mass index. The late RVF model included 33 variables and was predicted
   mostly by peripheral vascular resistance, model for end-stage liver
   disease score, albumin level, lymphocyte percentage, and mean and
   diastolic PAP. The accuracy of all Bayesian models was between 91\% and
   97\%, with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve
   between 0.83 and 0.90, sensitivity of 90\%, and specificity between 98\%
   and 99\%, significantly outperforming previously published risk scores.
   CONCLUSIONS A Bayesian prognostic model of RVF based on the large,
   multicenter INTERMACS registry provided highly accurate predictions of
   acute, early, and late RVF on the basis of pre-operative variables.
   These models may facilitate clinical decision making while screening
   candidates for LVAD therapy. (C) 2016 by the American College of

Pages = {{43-50}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The study of link prediction in graph theory has received more and more
   attention in recent years. Considering the attributes of nodes in online
   social networks are generally inaccurate, it is very important and
   efficient to use the network structure characteristics rather than
   nodes' information to predict edges in networks. In this paper, we
   present a simple but effective similarity-based prediction strategy
   based on label propagation, which mimics the communication between
   people naturally. We perform an experimental comparison of the proposed
   method against four classic local similarity-based link prediction
   algorithms using real-world networks. The experimental results show that
   our method offers higher precision than these well-known approaches.
   Hence, we can provide more accurate friend recommendations for online
   social networks and reduce experimental costs in the fields of biology,
   and better understand the evolution mechanism of complex networks. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding the individual-level factors relating to consumer
   financial behaviors during periods of distinct pressure to spend may
   provide new insights as to the particular barriers people face in
   maintaining better control over their finances. Using Christmas as a
   focal example of a financially and psychologically pressured time, we
   collected survey data (N = 294) in the post-Christmas 2013 period, and
   investigated the extent to which levels of reported spending and
   borrowing in relation to Christmas could be predicted by
   sociodemographics, money management behaviors, and psychological factors
   such as coping style, locus of control, materialism, and spendthrift
   tendencies. A separate analysis examined the kinds of factors relating
   more specifically to money management behaviors. Spending was predicted
   by factors including external locus of control and spendthrift tendency.
   Emotional coping and denial coping predicted borrowing behavior, as did
   external locus of control. Money management behaviors predicted who
   borrowed, but were not related to amount borrowed. Spendthrif tendencies
   and materialistic values were predictive of less active money
   management. Our findings suggest that interventions to improve financial
   decision making might prove more effective if increased emphasis is
   placed on psychological issues such as developing coping skills and
   buffering agency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work develops a model for the mechanical response of trabecular
   bone including plasticity, damage and fracture. It features a resultant
   lamellar orientation that captures trabecular strut anisotropic
   elasticity, and introduces asymmetric J2 plasticity with isotropic
   hardening to capture evolving strut tensile and compressive dissipative
   properties. A continuum compatibility based damage and fracture
   criterion is also proposed to model fracture surface generation. We
   investigated fracture of a trabecular bone network under a compressive
   load, for which failure modes of both tension and compression were
   identified at the strut level. The predicted trabecular network response
   was found to fall within the range of experimental results reported in
   literature. We also investigated the response of idealized struts under
   compression, tension and bending using our model. Individual struts were
   found to exhibit micro-buckling under compression and micro-necking
   under tension. These instabilities are however masked by the
   multiplicity and complexity of strut orientations at the trabecular
   network level.}},

Title = {{Compliance signaling games: toward modeling the deterrence of insider

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{In a typical workplace, organizational policies and their compliance
   requirements set the stage upon which the behavioral patterns of
   individual agents evolve. The agents' personal utilities, access to
   information, and strategic deceptions shape the signaling systems of an
   intricate information-asymmetric game, thus mystifying assessment and
   management of organizational risks, which are primarily due to
   unintentional insider threats. Compliance games, as discussed here,
   model a rudimentary version of this signaling game between a sender
   (employee) and a receiver (organization). The analysis of these games'
   equilibria as well as their dynamics in repeated game settings
   illuminate the effectiveness or risks of an organizational policy. These
   questions are explored via a repeated and agent-based simulation of
   compliance signaling games, leading to the following: (1) a simple but
   broadly applicable model for interactions between sender agents
   (employees) and receiver agents (principals in the organization), (2) an
   investigation of how the game theoretic approach yields the plausible
   dynamics of compliance, and (3) design of experiments to estimate
   parameters of the systems: evolutionary learning rates of agents, the
   efficacy of auditing using a trembling hand strategy, effects of
   non-stationary and multiple principal agents, and ultimately, the
   robustness of the system under perturbation of various related
   parameters (costs, penalties, benefits, etc.). The paper concludes with
   a number of empirical studies, illustrating a battery of compliance
   games under varying environments designed to investigate agent based
   learning, system control, and optimization. The studies indicate how
   agents through limited interactions described by behavior traces may
   learn and optimize responses to a stationary defense, expose sensitive
   parameters and emergent properties and indicate the possibility of
   controlling interventions which actuate game parameters. We believe that
   the work is of practical importance-for example, in constraining the
   vulnerability surfaces arising from compliance games.}},

Abstract = {{System management includes the selection of maintenance actions
   depending on the available observations: when a system is made up by
   components known to be similar, data collected on one is also relevant
   for the management of others. This is typically the case of wind farms,
   which are made up by similar turbines. Optimal management of wind farms
   is an important task due to high cost of turbines' operation and
   maintenance: in this context, we recently proposed a method for planning
   and learning at system-level, called PLUS, built upon the Partially
   Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, which treats
   transition and emission probabilities as random variables, and is
   therefore suitable for including model uncertainty. PLUS models the
   components as independent or identical. In this paper, we extend that
   formulation, allowing for a weaker similarity among components. The
   proposed approach, called Multiple Uncertain POMDP (MU-POMDP), models
   the components as POMDPs, and assumes the corresponding parameters as
   dependent random variables. Through this framework, we can calibrate
   specific degradation and emission models for each component while, at
   the same time, process observations at system-level. We compare the
   performance of the proposed MU-POMDP with PLUS, and discuss its
   potential and computational complexity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Despite significant advantages in terms of portability and cost,
   near-infrared (NIR) gas sensing still remains a great challenge due to
   its relatively weak overtone absorption from the fundamental vibrational
   bond absorption at the mid-IR frequency. In this paper, we demonstrated
   ultra-sensitive NIR gas sensing for carbon dioxide (CO2) at 1.57 mu m
   wavelength through nanoporous Cu-BTC (BTC =
   benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) metal-organic framework (MOF) coated
   single-mode optical fiber. For the first time, we obtained
   high-resolution NIR spectroscopy of CO2 sorbed in MOF without seeing any
   rotational side band, indicating that the tightly confined gas molecules
   in the MOF pores do not have any freedom of rotation. Real-time
   measurement of the mixed gas flow of CO2 and Ar showed different
   response time depending on the concentration of CO2, which is attributed
   to the complex sorption mechanism of CO2 in Cu-BTC MOF. Most
   importantly, we realized ultra-low detection limit of CO2 (<20 ppm) with
   only 5 cm long Cu-BTC MOF thin film coated on single-mode optical
   fibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a Lagrangean relaxation of the
   hull-reformulation of discrete-continuous optimization problems
   formulated as linear generalized disjunctive programs (GDP). The
   proposed Lagrangean relaxation has three important properties. The first
   property is that it can be applied to any linear GDP. The second
   property is that the solution to its continuous relaxation always yields
   0-1 values for the binary variables of the hull-reformulation. Finally,
   it is simpler to solve than the continuous relaxation of the
   hull-reformulation. The proposed Lagrangean relaxation can be used in
   different GDP solution methods. In this work, we explore its use as
   primal heuristic to find feasible solutions in a disjunctive branch and
   bound algorithm. The modified disjunctive branch and bound is tested
   with several instances with up to 300 variables. The results show that
   the proposed disjunctive branch and bound performs faster than other
   versions of the algorithm that do not include this primal heuristic. (C)

Abstract = {{Mechanobiology involves the investigation of mechanical forces and their
   effect on the development, physiology, and pathology of biological
   systems. The human body has garnered much attention from many groups in
   the field,, as mechanical forces have been shown to influence almost all
   aspects of human life ranging from breathing to cancer metastasis.
   Beyond being influential in human systems, mechanical forces have also
   been shown to impact nonhuman systems such as algae and,zebrafish.
   Studies of nonhuman and human systems at the cellular level have
   primarily been done in two-dimensional (2D) environments, but most of
   these systems reside in three-dimensional (3D) environments.
   Furthermore, outcomes obtained from 3D studies are often quite different
   than those from 2D studies. We present here an overview of a select
   group of human and nonhuman systems in 2D and 3D environments. We also
   highlight mechanobiological approaches and their respective implications

Abstract = {{In ferromagnet-normal-metal heterostructures, spin pumping and
   spin-transfer torques are two reciprocal processes that occur
   concomitantly. Their interplay introduces a dynamic feedback effect
   interconnecting energy dissipation channels of both magnetization and
   current. By solving the spin diffusion process in the presence of the
   spin Hall effect in the normal metal, we show that the dynamic feedback
   gives rise to (i) a nonlinear magnetic damping that is crucial to
   sustain uniform steady-state oscillations of a spin Hall oscillator at
   large angles and (ii) a frequency-dependent spin Hall magneto-impedance
   that reduces to the spin Hall magnetoresistance in the dc limit.}},

Abstract = {{Copolymer-templated nitrogen-doped carbon (CTNC) films deposited on
   glassy carbon were used as electrodes to study electrochemically driven
   hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The activity of these
   materials was extremely enhanced when a platinum counter electrode was
   used instead of a graphite rod and reached the level of commercial Pt/C
   electrodes. Postreaction scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of electrode surfaces
   revealed that incorporation of even extremely low amounts of Pt resulted
   in this considerable gain of HER activity. High resolution XPS analysis
   and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that
   pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as active sites for Pt coordination and
   deposition. The Pt can be incorporated in both molecular (Pt2+) and
   metallic (Pt-0) form. This study shows that great caution must be taken
   when designing metal-free HER catalysts based on N-doped carbons.}},

Title = {{Chemotaxis of bio-hybrid multiple bacteria-driven microswimmers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{In this study, in a bio-hybrid microswimmer system driven by multiple
   Serratia marcescens bacteria, we quantify the chemotactic drift of a
   large number of microswimmers towards L-serine and elucidate the
   associated collective chemotaxis behavior by statistical analysis of
   over a thousand swimming trajectories of the microswimmers. The results
   show that the microswimmers have a strong heading preference for moving
   up the L-serine gradient, while their speed does not change considerably
   when moving up and down the gradient; therefore, the heading bias
   constitutes the major factor that produces the chemotactic drift. The
   heading direction of a microswimmer is found to be significantly more
   persistent when it moves up the L-serine gradient than when it travels
   down the gradient; this effect causes the apparent heading preference of
   the microswimmers and is the crucial reason that enables the seemingly
   cooperative chemotaxis of multiple bacteria on a microswimmer. In
   addition, we find that their chemotactic drift velocity increases
   superquadratically with their mean swimming speed, suggesting that
   chemotaxis of bio-hybrid microsystems can be enhanced by designing and
   building faster microswimmers. Such bio-hybrid microswimmers with
   chemotactic steering capability may find future applications in targeted
   drug delivery, bioengineering, and lab-on-a-chip devices.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled radical polymerization of acrylonitrile (AN) in concentrated
   aqueous solutions of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, 50 wt \%) and zinc
   chloride (ZnCl2, 60 wt \%) is reported. Reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was
   successfully accomplished with
   4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio)pentanoic acid (CPAD) as a chain
   transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as a radical initiator at 65 degrees C.
   First-order linear kinetic plots were observed in aqueous NaSCN with
   molecular weights (MW) between 3000 and 60 000 and relatively narrow
   molecular weight distributions (M-w/M-n = 1.2-1.4). Chain extension of
   the synthesized PAN macroinitiator with AN in aqueous NaSCN showed a
   clear shift in MWs which indicated high retention of chain end
   functionality. Furthermore, RAFT polymerization of AN in aqueous ZnCl2
   (60 wt \%) was conducted with CPAD and
   2,2'-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (V-70) as radical
   initiator at 30 degrees C. This system also exhibited linear kinetics
   and produced PAN with M-n = 13 300 but slightly higher dispersity
   (M-w/M-n = 1.38).}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyurea (HU) has been used clinically to reduce the frequency of
   painful crisis and the need for blood transfusion in sickle cell disease
   (SCD) patients. However, the mechanisms underlying such beneficial
   effects of HU treatment are still not fully understood. Studies have
   indicated a weak correlation between clinical outcome and molecular
   markers, and the scientific quest to develop companion biophysical
   markers have mostly targeted studies of blood properties under hypoxia.
   Using a common-path interferometric technique, we measure biomechanical
   andmorphological properties of individual red blood cells in SCD
   patients as a function of cell density, and investigate the correlation
   of these biophysical properties with drug intake as well as other
   clinically measured parameters. Our results show that patient-specific
   HU effects on the cellular biophysical properties are detectable at
   normoxia, and that these properties are strongly correlated with the
   clinically measured mean cellular volume rather than fetal hemoglobin
   level.}},

Abstract = {{The particle formation scheme within PMCAMx-UF, a three-dimensional
   chemical transport model, was updated with particle formation rates for
   the ternary H2SO4-NH3-H2O pathway simulated by the Atmospheric Cluster
   Dynamics Code (ACDC) using quantum chemical input data. The model was
   applied over Europe for May 2008, during which the EUCAARI-LONGREX
   (European Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality Interactions-Long-Range
   Experiment) campaign was carried out, providing aircraft vertical
   profiles of aerosol number concentrations. The updated model reproduces
   the observed number concentrations of particles larger than 4 nm within
   1 order of magnitude throughout the atmospheric column. This agreement
   is encouraging considering the fact that no semi-empirical fitting was
   needed to obtain realistic particle formation rates. The cloud
   adjustment scheme for modifying the photolysis rate profiles within
   PMCAMx-UF was also updated with the TUV (Tropospheric Ultraviolet and
   Visible) radiative-transfer model. Results show that, although the
   effect of the new cloud adjustment scheme on total number concentrations
   is small, enhanced new-particle formation is predicted near cloudy
   regions. This is due to the enhanced radiation above and in the vicinity
   of the clouds, which in turn leads to higher production of sulfuric
   acid. The sensitivity of the results to including emissions from natural
   sources is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{MUC1 is a shared tumor antigen expressed on >80\% of human cancers. We
   completed the first prophylactic cancer vaccine clinical trial based on
   a non-viral antigen, MUC1, in healthy individuals at-risk for colon
   cancer. This trial provided a unique source of potentially effective and
   safe immunotherapeutic drugs, fully-human antibodies affinity-matured in
   a healthy host to a tumor antigen. We purified, cloned, and
   characterized 13 IgGs specific for several tumor-associated MUC1
   epitopes with a wide range of binding affinities. These antibodies bind
   hypoglycosylated MUC1 on human cancer cell lines and tumor tissues but
   show no reactivity against fully-glycosylated MUC1 on normal cells and
   tissues. We found that several antibodies activate complement-mediated
   cytotoxicity and that T cells carrying chimeric antigen receptors with
   the antibody variable regions kill MUC1(+) target cells, express
   activation markers, and produce interferon gamma. Fully-human and
   tumor-specific, these antibodies are candidates for further testing and
   development as immunotherapeutic drugs.}},

Title = {{Quantification of uncertainty in first-principles predicted mechanical
   properties of solids: Application to solid ion conductors}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Computationally-guided material discovery is being increasingly employed
   using a descriptor-based screening through the calculation of a few
   properties of interest. A precise understanding of the uncertainty
   associated with first-principles density functional theory calculated
   property values is important for the success of descriptor-based
   screening. The Bayesian error estimation approach has been built in to
   several recently developed exchange-correlation functionals, which
   allows an estimate of the uncertainty associated with properties related
   to the ground state energy, for example, adsorption energies. Here, we
   propose a robust and computationally efficient method for quantifying
   uncertainty in mechanical properties, which depend on the derivatives of
   the energy. The procedure involves calculating energies around the
   equilibrium cell volume with different strains and fitting the obtained
   energies to the corresponding energy-strain relationship. At each
   strain, we use instead of a single energy, an ensemble of energies,
   giving us an ensemble of fits and thereby, an ensemble of mechanical
   properties associated with each fit, whose spread can be used to
   quantify its uncertainty. The generation of ensemble of energies is only
   a post-processing step involving a perturbation of parameters of the
   exchange-correlation functional and solving for the energy
   non-self-consistently. The proposed method is computationally efficient
   and provides a more robust uncertainty estimate compared to the approach
   of self-consistent calculations employing several different
   exchange-correlation functionals. We demonstrate the method by
   calculating the uncertainty bounds for several materials belonging to
   different classes and having different structures using the developed
   method. We show that the calculated uncertainty bounds the property
   values obtained using three different GGA functionals: PBE, PBEsol, and
   RPBE. Finally, we apply the approach to calculate the uncertainty
   associated with the DFT-calculated elastic properties of solid state
   Li-ion and Na-ion conductors.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{1160-1166}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Abundant natural gas at low prices has prompted industry and politicians
   to welcome gas as a `bridge fuel' between today's coal-intensive
   electric power generation and a future low-carbon grid. We used existing
   national datasets and publicly available models to investigate the upper
   limit to the emission benefits of natural gas in the USA power sector.
   As a limiting case, we analyzed a switch of all USA coal plants to
   natural, gas plants, occurring in 2016. The human health benefits of
   such a switch are substantial: SO2 emissions are reduced from the
   baseline (MATS (Mercury and Air Toxics Standard) retrofits by 2016) by
   more than 90\%, and NOx emissions by more than 60\%, reducing total
   national annual health damages by \$20 - \$50 billion annually. While
   the effect on global temperatures is small out to 2040, the USA power
   plant fleet's contribution could be changed by as much as -50\% to +5\%
   depending on the rate of fugitive CH4 emissions and efficiency of
   replacement gas plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been significantly
   extended, while in long-term large-scale WSN applications, the
   increasing sensor drift has become a key problem affecting the
   reliability of sensory data. In this paper, we propose a blind online
   drift calibration framework based on subspace projection and sparse
   recovery for sensor networks in general-purpose monitoring. Temporal
   sparse Bayesian learning is used in the proposed method to estimate the
   sensor drift from under-sampled observations. The proposed method needs
   neither dense deployment nor the presence of a prior data model. Both
   simulated and real-world data set are used to evaluate the proposed
   method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   detect and recover the sensor drift when the number of drifted sensors
   are less than 20\%, and when 40\% sensors are drifted, the recovery rate
   is 80\%.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Crystal orientation mapping in the transmission electron microscope was
   used to quantify the twin boundary length fraction per unit area for
   five Ta38Si14N48/SiO2 encapsulated Cu films with thicknesses in the
   range of 26-111 nm. The length fraction was found to be higher for a
   given twin-excluded grain size for these films compared with previously
   investigated SiO2 and Ta/SiO2 encapsulated films. The quantification of
   the twin length fraction per unit area allowed the contribution of the
   twin boundaries to the size effect resistivity to be assessed. It is
   shown that the increased resistivity of the Ta38Si14N48 encapsulated Cu
   films compared with the SiO2 and Ta/SiO2 encapsulated films is not a
   result of increased surface scattering, but it is a result of the
   increase in the density of twin boundaries. With twin boundaries
   included in the determination of grain size as a mean-intercept length,
   the resistivity data are well described by 2-parameter Matthiessen's
   rule summation of the Fuchs-Sondheimer and Mayadas Shatzkes models, with
   p and R parameters that are within experimental error equal to those in
   prior reports and are p = 0.48(+0.33/-0.31) and R = 0.27+/-0.03. (C)

Abstract = {{We present data on the filament size and temperature distribution
   Hf0.82Al0.18Ox-based Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) devices
   obtained by transient thermometry and high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM). The thermometry shows that the temperature
   of the nonvolatile conducting filament can reach temperatures as high as
   1600 K at the onset of RESET at voltage of 0.8 V and power of 40 mu W.
   The size of the filament was estimated at about 1 mn in diameter. Hot
   filament increases the temperature of the surrounding high resistivity
   oxide, causing it to conduct and carry a significant fraction of the
   total current. The current spreading results in slowing down the
   filament temperature increase at higher power. The results of
   thermometry have been corroborated by HRTEM analysis of the
   as-fabricated and switched RRAM devices. The functional HfAlOx layer in
   as-fabricated devices is amorphous. In devices that were switched, we
   detected a small crystalline region of 10-15 nm in size. The
   crystallization temperature of the HfAlOx was determined to be 850 K in
   an independent annealing experiment. The size of the crystalline region
   agrees with thermal modeling based on the thermometry data. Scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coordinated with electron energy
   loss spectroscopy could not detect changes in the chemical makeup of the
   filament.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization under uncertainty has been an active area of research for
   many years. However, its application in Process Systems Engineering has
   faced a number of important barriers that have prevented its effective
   application. Barriers include availability of information on the
   uncertainty of the data (ad-hoc or historical), determination of the
   nature of the uncertainties (exogenous vs. endogenous), selection of an
   appropriate strategy for hedging against uncertainty (robust/chance
   constrained optimization vs. stochastic programming), large
   computational expense (often orders of magnitude larger than
   deterministic models), and difficulty of interpretation of the results
   by non-expert users. In this paper, we describe recent advances that
   have addressed some of these barriers for mostly linear models. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Compared to port fuel injection (PFI) engine exhaust, gasoline direct
   injection (GDI) engine exhaust has higher emissions of black carbon
   (BC), a climate-warming pollutant. However, the relative increase in BC
   emissions and climate trade-offs of replacing PFI vehicles with more
   fuel efficient GDI vehicles remain uncertain. In this study, BC
   emissions from GDI and PFI vehicles were compiled and BC emissions
   scenarios were developed to evaluate the climate impact of GDI vehicles
   using global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential
   (GTP) metrics. From a 20 year time horizon GWP analysis, average fuel
   economy improvements ranging from 0.14 to 14\% with GDI vehicles are
   required to offset BC-induced warming. For all but the lowest BC
   scenario, installing a gasoline particulate filter with an 80\% BC
   removal efficiency and <1\% fuel penalty is climate beneficial. From the
   GTP-based analysis, it was also determined that GDI vehicles are climate
   beneficial within <1-20 years; longer time horizons were associated with
   higher BC scenarios. The GDI BC emissions spanned 2 orders of magnitude
   and varied by ambient temperature, engine operation, and fuel
   composition. More work is needed to understand BC formation mechanisms
   in GDI engines to ensure that the climate impacts of this engine
   technology are minimal.}},

   adhesive: implications for the natural system}},
Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{The adhesive system of geckos has inspired hundreds of synthetic
   adhesives. While this system has been used relentlessly as a source of
   inspiration, less work has been done in reverse, where synthetics are
   used to test questions and hypotheses about the natural system. Here we
   take such an approach. We tested shear adhesion of a mushroom-tipped
   synthetic gecko adhesive under conditions that produced perplexing
   results in the natural adhesive system. Synthetic samples were tested at
   two temperatures (12 degrees C and 32 degrees C) and four different
   humidity levels (30\%, 55\%, 70\%, and 80\% RH). Surprisingly, adhesive
   performance of the synthetic samples matched that of living geckos,
   suggesting that uncontrolled parameters in the natural system, such as
   surface chemistry and material changes, may not be as influential in
   whole-animal performance as previously thought. There was one
   difference, however, when comparing natural and synthetic adhesive
   performance. At 12 degrees C and 80\% RH, adhesion of the synthetic
   structures was lower than expected based on the natural system's
   performance. Our approach highlights a unique opportunity for both
   biologists and material scientists, where new questions and hypotheses
   can be fueled by joint comparisons of the natural and synthetic systems,
   ultimately improving knowledge of both.}},

Title = {{A Patient-Centered Approach to Informed Consent: Results from a Survey
   and Randomized Trial}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{726-740}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. Traditional informed consent documents tend to be too lengthy
   and technical to facilitate proper patient engagement. Patient-centered,
   short informed consent content could be equally informative, while
   minimizing patient burden and producing greater patient engagement. This
   study aimed to develop and evaluate patient-centered, patient-designed
   paper and video informed consent formats. Methods. Two studies were
   conducted. In study 1, 118 self-identifying asthma patients recruited
   from a national, online pool completed survey tasks from their personal
   computers. Participants in study 1 were randomly assigned to examine
   sections of a standard informed consent document for an asthma trial and
   to select information they deemed critical to their decision making. In
   study 2, a sample of 83 self-identifying asthma patients completed
   experimental tasks in a university laboratory. Participants in study 2
   were randomly assigned to a full informed consent document; a shortened,
   patient-designed informed consent document created from study 1; or a
   video with content matched to the shortened paper form. Results. Study 1
   yielded a more readable, concise version of a standard informed consent
   document (5 v. 17 pages). This shortened, patient-designed form closely
   met normative criteria for good clinical practice. In study 2,
   participants who viewed either the shortened paper consent or video
   reported greater engagement than those viewing the standard paper
   consent, without lowered performance on any other decision-relevant
   variables (i.e., comprehension, judged risk/benefit, feelings of trust).
   The video consent format did not cause increased enrollment.
   Conclusions. Results suggest that providing concise informed consent
   content, systematically developed from patients' self-reported
   information needs, may be more effective at engaging and informing
   clinical trial participants than the traditional consent approach,
   without detriment to trial comprehension, risk assessment, or
   enrollment.}},

Title = {{On the streaming potential arising from flows having axial symmetry and
   the determination of zeta potential therefrom}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN COLLOID \& INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{91-98}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Determining the zeta potential of macroscopic surfaces helps predict the
   surfaces' attractiveness to charged particles or cells, or tells whether
   the surface is clean or contaminated, among other applications.
   Typically, one pumps the test solution through a narrow channel formed
   by the test surface and measures the streaming current or streaming
   potential engendered thereby. It is worth considering alternative
   geometries: 1. The ``spincoat{''} design, in which the test liquid is
   directed as a narrow jet to the axis of a disk-shaped sample rotating on
   its axis, offers a large signal with a small liquid flow rate, e.g. 1
   mL/min. The validity of assumptions underlying the simplest analysis of
   this design improves as the flow rate decreases at constant rotation
   rate. 2. The ``rotating disk{''}, in which the sample is spun on its
   axis while immersed in solution, offers much reduced surface conductance
   and uniform accessibility to charged entities in solution. This design
   also provides a means for determining the zeta potential of open porous
   structures without requiring compression of the sample into a plug. 3.
   The ``impinging jet,{''} in which a jet of liquid is directed to a
   nonrotating sample, allows an arbitrary sample shape and detection of
   spatial variations of zeta potential. Deceleration of the radially
   expanding film causes a ``hydraulic jump instability{''} some distance
   from the axis; the radius of the jump defines the probed area. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Electrochemically-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (eATRP)
   of oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl ether methacrylate in water is
   investigated on glassy carbon, Au, Ti, Ni, NiCr and SS304. eATRPs are
   performed both in divided and undivided electrochemical cells operating
   under either potentiostatic or galvanostatic mode. The reaction is fast,
   reaching high conversions in approximate to 4 h, and yields polymers
   with dispersity <1.2 and molecular weights close to the theoretical
   values. Most importantly, eATRP in a highly simplified setup (undivided
   cell under galvanostatic mode) with inexpensive nonnoble metals, such as

Abstract = {{High-resolution (or ``cross-correlation{''}) electron backscatter
   diffraction analysis (HR-EBSD) utilizes cross-correlation techniques to
   determine relative orientation and distortion of an experimental
   electron backscatter diffraction pattern with respect to a reference
   pattern. The integrity of absolute strain and tetragonality measurements
   of a standard Si/SiGe material have previously been analyzed using
   reference patterns produced by kinematical simulation. Although the
   results were promising, the noise levels were significantly higher for
   kinematically produced patterns, compared with real patterns taken from
   the Si region of the sample. This paper applies HR-EBSD techniques to
   analyze lattice distortion in an Si/SiGe sample, using recently
   developed dynamically simulated patterns. The results are compared with
   those from experimental and kinematically simulated patterns. Dynamical
   patterns provide significantly more precision than kinematical patterns.
   Dynamical patterns also provide better estimates of tetragonality at low
   levels of distortion relative to the reference pattern; kinematical
   patterns can perform better at large values of relative tetragonality
   due to the ability to rapidly generate patterns relating to a distorted
   lattice. A library of dynamically generated patterns with different
   lattice parameters might be used to achieve a similar advantage. The
   convergence of the cross-correlation approach is also assessed for the
   different reference pattern types.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid approach combining life cycle assessment and input-output
   analysis was used to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits
   of current and future improvements in agricultural and industrial
   technologies for ethanol production in Brazilian biorefineries. In this
   article, three main scenarios were evaluated: first-generation ethanol
   production with the average current technology; the improved current
   technology; and the integration of improved first- and second-generation
   ethanol production. For the improved first-generation scenario, a US\$1
   million increase in ethanol demand can give rise to US\$2.5 million of
   total economic activity in the Brazilian economy when direct and
   indirect purchases of inputs are considered. This value is slightly
   higher than the economic activity (US\$1.8 million) for an energy
   equivalent amount of gasoline. The integration of first- and
   second-generation technologies significantly reduces the total
   greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol production: 14.6 versus 86.4 grams
   of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (g CO2-eq/MJ) for gasoline.
   Moreover, emissions of ethanol can be negative (-10.5 g CO2-eq/MJ) when
   the system boundary is expanded to account for surplus bioelectricity by
   displacement of natural gas thermal electricity generation considering
   electricity produced in first-generation optimized biorefineries.}},

Abstract = {{Kernel regression as a data-driven and rigorous nonparametric
   statistical technique to predict properties of atomic crystals is
   proposed. A key feature of the proposed approach is the possibility of
   treating predictors not only as continuous, but also as categorical
   data. The latter specifically allows the predictive model to capture the
   discrete nature of crystals with regards to composition (number of atoms
   in the chemical formula) and spatial configuration (finite number of
   crystallographic space groups). Another important aspect of using kernel
   regression is the direct access to its explicit mathematical form, which
   can be directly embedded in optimal inverse problems to design new
   crystalline materials with given target properties. The property
   prediction approach is illustrated by training models to predict
   electronic properties of 746 binary metal oxides and elastic properties
   of 1173 crystals. As a first approach to solving the inverse problem, an
   exhaustive enumeration algorithm is described. (C) 2016 American

   best performance in terms of wall-clock time and required memory in
   comparison to implicit techniques and Predici. In the case of the ARGET
   technique, the model predictions show good agreement with experimental

   of the initiator on the MWD using ARGET has been carried out, indicating

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs), specifically Battery EVs (BEVs), can offer
   significant energy and emission savings over internal combustion engine
   vehicles. Norway has a long history of research and government
   incentives for BEVs. The BEV market in Norway allows us to fully examine
   consumers' BEV choices influenced by car specifications, prices and
   government incentives (public bus lanes access, toll waiver and charging
   stations). The Random-Coefficient Discrete Choice Model (referred to as
   the BLP model) is applied to understand the choices of heterogeneous
   personal consumers and business buyers. Our study is instantiated on the
   entire EV sales data in Norway from 2011 to 2013, as well as a set of
   demographics at the municipality level. The results suggest significant
   positive effects of BEV technology improvement, space, toll waiver and
   charging station density on EV demand for both personal consumers and
   business buyers. However, the effects on business buyers may be
   generally less pronounced than on personal consumers. Interestingly, bus
   lanes access demonstrates a negative impact for personal consumers,
   possibly due to consumers' concern regarding bus lane congestion. In
   addition, preferences on the BEV price can vary statistically among
   consumers with different income levels. Compared to the BEV technology
   development, demographical features and municipal incentives may have
   generally less impacts on market shares within the BEV market. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important electrochemical
   reaction and a major bottleneck for fuel cells. Due to the existence of
   a scaling relation between the adsorption energies of two key
   intermediates involved in ORR, OOH{*}, and OH{*}, the electrocatalytic
   activity for the ORR, to a first approximation, is determined by a
   single descriptor. This descriptor-based approach has been used to
   screen for electrocatalyst materials that have an optimal binding energy
   of oxygen intermediates. However, given that this descriptor-based
   search relies on several approximations, it is crucial to determine the
   overall predictability of the descriptor-based model to determine the
   activity of a catalyst. In this work, we develop a formalism for
   estimating uncertainty for the activity of a catalyst in an
   electrocatalytic reaction scheme and apply this framework to determine
   errors involved in describing the ORR activity. We perform density
   functional theory calculations using the Bayesian Error Estimation
   Functional with van der Waals exchange correlation functional to
   determine the adsorption energies of ORR intermediates on
   transition-metal fcc(111) and fcc(100) facets. We show that the error
   estimates for the adsorption energies calculated with a reference metal
   surface, chosen here to be Pt(111), are much smaller than those
   calculated with gas-phase molecules as reference. We demonstrate that
   Delta G(OH)., and Delta G(OOH) are the optimal descriptors for the 4e(-)
   and the 2e(-) ORR, respectively. We show that for the 4e(-) ORR with
   Delta G(OH) as the descriptor, the uncertainty in activity is determined
   by the error associated with the adsorption energy of OH{*} (similar to
   0.1 eV) for materials that lie on the strong binding leg, and the error
   involved in the scaling relation between OOH{*} and OH{*} (similar to
   0.2 eV) determines the uncertainty in activity for the weak binding leg.
   We propose a parameter, the expected limiting potential, U-EL, which is
   the expected value of U-L. The deviation of the expected limiting
   potential, U-EL, from the thermodynamic limiting potential, U-L,
   provides a qualitative estimate of the prediction error and can be used
   to identify trends in predictability. We believe that the concept of the
   expected limiting potential will be crucial in descriptor-based
   screening studies for multielectron electrochemical reactions.}},

   study apoptosis after hypothermic storage by comparing Unisol with
   Belzer's machine perfusion solution (BMPS) and the University of
   Wisconsin (UW) solution. The objective was to determine which of these
   solutions provided the best support for t3 cells and which solution
   demonstrated the least amount of apoptotic activity. Several apoptosis
   markers were measured that included the translocation of
   phosphatidylserine, caspase activity, and the formation of DNA
   laddering. In addition, metabolic activity and membrane integrity were
   also measured. The results demonstrated that the three solutions behaved
   similarly during overnight cold storage at 4 degrees C. However, Unisol
   was consistently better than UW solution and BMPS, demonstrating better
   cell viability and recovery, and lower levels of apoptotic activity when
   all three parameters were measured. These results demonstrated that
   apoptosis plays an important role in the survival of cells and tissues
   during cold storage. Development of solutions to help prevent or
   decrease the levels of apoptosis after cold storage will likely improve
   overall cell and tissue recovery and survival in a clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new random key predistribution scheme for securing
   heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. Each of the n sensors in the
   network is classified into r classes according to some probability
   distribution mu = \{mu(1), ..., mu(r)\}. Before deployment, a class-i
   sensor is assigned K-i cryptographic keys that are selected uniformly at
   random from a common pool of P keys. Once deployed, a pair of sensors
   can communicate securely if and only if they have a key in common. We
   model the communication topology of this network by a newly defined
   inhomogeneous random key graph. We establish scaling conditions on the
   parameters P and \{K-1, ..., K-r\} so that this graph: 1) has no
   isolated nodes and 2) is connected, both with high probability. The
   results are given in the form of zero-one laws with the number of
   sensors n growing unboundedly large; critical scalings are identified
   and shown to coincide for both graph properties. Our results are shown
   to complement and improve those given by Godehardt et al. and Zhao et
   al. for the same model, therein referred to as the general random
   intersection graph.}},

   the throughput optimal offline data scheduling problem in an energy
   harvesting transmitter, such that the resulting temperature remains
   below a critical level. We model the temperature dynamics of the
   transmitter as a linear system and determine the optimal transmit power
   policy under such temperature constraints as well as energy harvesting
   constraints over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We first
   derive the structural properties of the solution for the general case
   with multiple energy arrivals. We show that the optimal power policy is
   piecewise monotone decreasing with possible jumps at the energy
   harvesting instants. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal
   solution in the single energy arrival case. We show that, in the single
   energy arrival case, the optimal power is monotone decreasing, the
   resulting temperature is monotone increasing, and both remain constant
   after the temperature hits the critical level. We then generalize the
   solution for the multiple energy arrival case.}},

Title = {{Implications of environmental regulation and coal plant retirements in
   systems with large scale penetration of wind power}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{196-210}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Over the last decade there have been a growing number of federal and
   state regulations aimed at controlling air emissions at power plants
   and/or increasing the penetration of renewable resources in the grid.
   Environmental Protection Agency regulations will likely lead to the
   retrofit, retirement, or replacement of coal-fired power plants while
   the state Renewable Portfolio Standards will continue to drive
   large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources, primarily wind.
   Combined, these changes in the generation fleet could have profound
   implications for the operations of the power system. In this paper, we
   aim to better understand the interaction between coal plant retirements
   and increased levels of wind power. We extensively analyze the
   operations of the PJM electricity system under a broad set of scenarios
   that include varying levels of wind penetration and coal plant
   retirements. Not surprisingly, we find that without transmission
   upgrades, retirement of coal-fired power plants will likely result in
   considerable transmission congestion and higher energy prices. Increased
   wind penetration, with high geographic diversity, could mitigate some of
   the negative effects of coal plant retirement and lead to a significant
   reduction in air emissions, but wind forecast error might impose
   operational constraints on the system at times of peak load. (C) 2016

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{411-420}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite significant public attentions to green supply chain management,
   few studies have explicitly addressed the energy implications of
   consumer-goods supply surplus, especially in developing countries like
   China. This study explored the energy-saving potential from improving
   supply chain efficiencies and reducing excess inventory in China's
   retail system from a life-cycle perspective. Through embodied energy
   analysis, we found that energy invested pre-manufacture contributed
   80-95\% of the total energy embodied in consumer products. Although
   embodied energy intensities had declined by 60-90\% since the mid-1990s,
   the lessened marginal improvements implied that ``low hanging fruits{''}
   have largely been captured, and the search for new opportunities for
   energy-saving is in demand. Positive correlations between total economic
   inputs and embodied energy in consumer goods indicated possible synergy
   effect between cost-reduction and energy-saving in supply system
   management. And structural path analysis identified sector-specific
   energy management priorities for each retail-related sector. This study
   suggested that improving supply chain efficiencies provides a promising
   supplement to China's current industrial energy-efficient projects which
   target reducing direct energy use per se as an intra-firm cost saving
   measure. From the life-cycle perspective, the definition of ``green
   sector{''} might have to be reconsidered in China towards a more
   energy-efficient economy and society. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The sixth blind test of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP)
   methods has been held, with five target systems: a small nearly rigid
   molecule, a polymorphic former drug candidate, a chloride salt hydrate,
   a co-crystal and a bulky flexible molecule. This blind test has seen
   substantial growth in the number of participants, with the broad range
   of prediction methods giving a unique insight into the state of the art
   in the field. Significant progress has been seen in treating flexible
   molecules, usage of hierarchical approaches to ranking structures, the
   application of density-functional approximations, and the establishment
   of new workflows and `best practices' for performing CSP calculations.
   All of the targets, apart from a single potentially disordered Z' = 2
   polymorph of the drug candidate, were predicted by at least one
   submission. Despite many remaining challenges, it is clear that CSP
   methods are becoming more applicable to a wider range of real systems,
   including salts, hydrates and larger flexible molecules. The results
   also highlight the potential for CSP calculations to complement and
   augment experimental studies of organic solid forms.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of putative structures of
   tricyano-1,4-dithiino{[}c]-isothiazole (TCS3), generated within the
   sixth crystal structure prediction blind test. Typical packing motifs
   are identified and characterized in terms of distinct patterns of close
   contacts and regions of electrostatic and dispersion interactions. We
   find that different dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)
   methods systematically favor specific packing motifs, which may affect
   the outcome of crystal structure prediction efforts. The effect of
   crystal packing on the electronic and optical properties of TCS3 is
   investigated using many-body perturbation theory within the GW
   approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We find that a
   structure with Pna2(1) symmetry and a bilayer packing motif exhibits
   intermolecular bonding patterns reminiscent of pi-pi stacking and has
   markedly different electronic and optical properties than the
   experimentally observed P2(1)/n structure with a cyclic dimer motif,
   including a narrower band gap, enhanced band dispersion and broader
   optical absorption. The Pna2(1) bilayer structure is close in energy to
   the observed structure and may be feasible to grow.}},

   physiological hemostasis and platelet function in vivo, yet current
   diagnostic and monitoring devices do not fully incorporate endothelial
   function under flow in their assessment and, therefore, they can be
   unreliable and inaccurate. It is challenging to include the endothelium
   in assays for clinical laboratories or point-of-care settings because
   living cell cultures are not sufficiently robust. Here, we describe a
   microfluidic device that is lined by a human endothelium that is
   chemically fixed, but still retains its ability to modulate hemostasis
   under continuous flow in vitro even after few days of storage. This
   device lined with a fixed endothelium supports formation of
   platelet-rich thrombi in the presence of physiological shear, similar to
   a living arterial vessel. We demonstrate the potential clinical value of
   this device by showing that thrombus formation and platelet function can
   be measured within minutes using a small volume (0.5 mL) of whole blood
   taken from subjects receiving antiplatelet medications. The inclusion of
   a fixed endothelial microvessel will lead to biomimetic analytical
   devices that can potentially be used for diagnostics and point-of-care
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The success of China's transition to a low-carbon energy system will be
   key to achieve the global level of emissions reductions needed to avoid
   large negative consequences from climate change. China is undergoing an
   impressive build up of renewable capacity, in particular wind. Using
   data from the Clean Mechanism Development project database between 2004
   and 2012, this study shows that while China made progress in bringing
   down the levelized cost of wind electricity and cost of carbon
   mitigation (CCM), serious grid-connection issues and high wind
   curtailment rates resulted in a levelized cost of wind electricity that
   is one-half to two times higher than expected, and a CCM that is four to
   six times higher. Sharp drop in electricity demand, utilization rate,
   and coal prices in recent years may lead to even higher results.}},

Title = {{Energetic molding of chiral magnetic bubbles}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Topologically protected magnetic structures such as skyrmions and
   domainwalls (DWs) have drawn a great deal of attention recently due to
   their thermal stability and potential for manipulation by spin current,
   which is the result of chiral magnetic configurations induced by the
   interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Designing devices
   that incorporate DMI necessitates a thorough understanding of how the
   interaction presents and can be measured. One approach is to measure
   growth asymmetry of chiral bubble domains in perpendicularly magnetized
   thin films, which has been described elsewhere by thermally activated DW
   motion. Here, we demonstrate that the anisotropic angular dependence of
   DW energy originating from the DMI is critical to understanding this
   behavior. Domains in Co/Ni multilayers are observed to preferentially
   grow into nonelliptical teardrop shapes, which vary with the magnitude
   of an applied in-plane field. We model the domain profile using
   energetic calculations of equilibrium shape via the Wulff construction,
   which serves as a new paradigm for describing chiral domains that
   explains both the teardrop shape and the reversal of growth symmetry at
   large fields.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using graphene as
   a synthesis platform for polymers, zero-dimensional (0D) materials,
   one-dimensional materials (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) materials.
   Here, we report the investigation of the growth of germanium nanowires
   (GeNWs) and germanium nanocrawlers (GeNCs) on single layer graphene
   surfaces. GeNWs and GeNCs are synthesized on graphene films by gold
   nanoparticles catalyzed vapor liquid solid growth mechanism. The
   addition of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) at the nucleation step increased
   the propensity toward GeNCs growth on the surface. As the time lag
   before HCl introduction during the nucleation step increased, a
   significant change in the number of out-of-plane GeNWs versus in-plane
   GeNCs was observed. The nucleation temperature and time played a key
   role in the formation of GeNCs as well. The fraction of GeNCs (chi(NCs))
   decreased from 0.95 +/- 0.01 to 0.66 +/- 0.07 when the temperature was
   kept at 305 degrees C for 15 s versus maintained at 305 degrees C
   throughout the process, respectively. GeNCs exhibit < 112 > as the
   preferred growth direction whereas GeNWs exhibit both < 112 > and < 111
   > as the preferred growth directions. Finally, our growth model suggests
   a possible mechanism for the preference of an in-plane GeNC growth on
   graphene versus GeNW on SiO2. These findings open up unique
   opportunities for fundamental studies of crystal growth on graphene, as
   well as enable exploration of new electronic interfaces between group IV
   materials and graphene, potentially toward designing new geometries for
   hybrid materials sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient performance modeling of today's analog and mixed-signal
   circuits is an important yet challenging task, due to the
   high-dimensional variation space and expensive circuit simulation. In
   this paper, we propose a novel performance modeling algorithm that is
   referred to as Bayesian model fusion (BMF) to address this challenge.
   The key idea of BMF is to borrow the information collected from an early
   stage (e.g., schematic level) to facilitate efficient performance
   modeling at a late stage (e.g., post layout). Such a goal is achieved by
   statistically modeling the performance correlation between early and
   late stages through Bayesian inference. Furthermore, to make the
   proposed BMF method of practical utility, four implementation issues,
   including: 1) prior mapping; 2) missing prior knowledge; 3) fast solver;
   and 4) prior and hyper-parameter selection, are carefully considered in
   this paper. Two circuit examples designed in a commercial 32 nm CMOS
   silicon on insulator process demonstrate that the proposed BMF method
   achieves up to 9x runtime speedup over the traditional modeling
   technique without surrendering any accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Near-threshold computing has emerged as a promising solution to
   significantly increase the energy efficiency of next-generation
   multicore systems. This paper evaluates and analyzes the behavior of
   dynamic voltage and frequency scaling for multicore systems operating
   under extended range: including near-threshold, nominal, and turbo
   modes. We adapt the model selection technique from machine learning to
   determine the relationship between performance and power. The
   theoretical results show that the resulting models satisfy convexity,
   which efficiently determines the optimal voltage/frequency operating
   points for: 1) minimizing energy consumption under throughput
   constraints or 2) maximizing throughput under a given power budget. We
   validate our models on FinFET-based chip-multiprocessors. Considering
   process variations (PVs), experimental results show that at 30\% PV
   levels, our proposed method: 1) reduces energy consumption by 31.09\% at
   iso-performance condition and 2) increases throughput by 11.46\% at

Abstract = {{New opportunities in design surface with scientific advances: however,
   the rapid pace of scientific discoveries combined with the complexity of
   technical barriers often impedes new product development. Bio-based
   technologies, for instance, typically require decisions across complex
   multiscale system organizations that are difficult for humans to
   understand and formalize computationally. This paper addresses such
   challenges in science and design by weaving phases of empirical
   discovery, analytical description, and technological development in an
   integrative ``D3 Methodology.{''} The phases are bridged with
   human-guided computational processes suitable for human-in-the-loop
   design approaches. Optimization of biolibraries, which are sets of
   standardized biological parts for adaptation into new products, is used
   as a characteristic design problem for demonstrating the methodology.
   Results from this test case suggest that biolibraries with synthetic
   biological components can promote the development of high-performance
   bio-based products. These new products motivate further scientific
   studies to characterize designed synthetic biological components, thus
   illustrating reciprocity among science and design. Successes in
   implementing each phase suggest the D3 Methodology is a feasible route
   for bio-based research and development and for driving the scientific
   inquiries of today toward the novel technologies of tomorrow.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of magnesium addition on the evolution of
   inclusions in Al-Ti deoxidized melts, both thermodynamic calculations
   and deoxidized experiments were carried out in the present work. The
   samples took from the melts were polished and analyzed by field scanning
   electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX).
   The results showed that the addition of magnesium significantly
   influenced the size of oxide inclusions in Al-Ti deoxidized melts.
   Superfluous MgO raised the melting point of these complex inclusions,
   and then degraded the steel castability. Therefore, the amount of
   magnesium addition should be carefully controlled. Based on
   thermodynamic calculations and experimental results, the recommended
   range of {[}Mg] is 1 similar to 5 ppm. All inclusions observed in the
   sample were nearly spherical except for solid titanium aluminate
   inclusions. Oxide inclusions were modified quickly after magnesium
   addition. Meanwhile, magnesium could also modify solid titanium
   aluminate inclusions in the melts similarly, but there were unreacted
   cores in the inclusions at the initial stage. The evolution mechanisms
   of inclusions were comprehensively discussed, and models for the
   formation of oxide inclusions were set up. As for the production
   practice, the addition amount of magnesium and titanium should be
   considered simultaneously to liquefy inclusions in molten steel.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, structural and catalytic properties of
   La1-xCaxMn0.5Co0.5O3 and La1-xSrxMn0.5Co0.5O3 nano catalysts in the
   concentration range of 0.00 <= x <= 1.00 are investigated. The
   structural characterization of the compounds obtained by X-ray powder
   diffraction and using X'Pert package and Fullprof program is an evidence
   for structural phase transition of the samples that can be described by
   variation of tolerance factor. The obtained results also have been
   confirmed by FTIR measurements. The structural results, and the
   non-uniformly changes of activation energy, band gap energy and
   electrical conductivity values suggest the presence of different
   concentration of various cations Co+2, Co+3, Mn+4 and Mn+3 in the
   compounds studied. The decrease of the crystallite size with increasing
   Ca and Sr substitution for x up to 0.5 in La1-x(Sr, Ca)(x)Mn0.5Co0.5O3
   can be related to the increase and decrease of micro-strain,
   respectively. Substituting Sr having higher ionic radius with respect to
   La in LaMn0.05Co0.5O3 shifts the catalytic activity of CO oxidation to
   lower temperature, whereas, for Ca substitution the catalytic activity
   shifts to higher temperature. The trend of catalytic activity observed
   for Ca- and Sr-substituted samples can be related to different
   morphology observed in SEM micrographs due to different types of micro
   strain. La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Co0.5O3 nano-catalyst exhibits excellent CO
   conversion rate of 95\% at 175 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and

Title = {{The role of vdW interactions in coverage dependent adsorption energies

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{650}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption, a fundamental process in heterogeneous catalysis is known to
   be dependent on the adsorbate adsorbate and surface-adsorbate bonds. van
   der Waals (vdW) interactions are one of the types of interactions that
   have not been examined thoroughly as a function of adsorbate coverage.
   In this work we quantify the vdW interactions for atomic adsorbates on
   late transition metal surfaces, and determine how these long range
   forces affect the coverage dependent adsorption energies. We calculate
   the adsorption energies of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, fluorine,
   bromine and chlorine species on Pt(111) and Pd(111) at coverages ranging
   from 1/4 to 1 ML using the BEEF-vdW functional. We observe that
   adsorption energies remain coverage dependent, and this coverage
   dependence is shown to be statistically significant. vdW interactions
   are found to be coverage dependent, but more significantly, they are
   found to be dependent on molecular properties such as adsorbate size,
   and consequently, correlate with the adsorbate effective nuclear charge.
   We observe that these interactions account for a reduction in the
   binding energy of the system, due to the destabilizing attractive
   interactions between the adsorbates which weaken its bond with the
   surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantifying sources of uncertainty in reanalysis derived wind speed}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{157-165}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Reanalysis data are attractive for wind-power studies because they can
   offer wind speed data for large areas and long time periods and in
   locations where historical data are not available. However, reanalysis
   predicted wind speeds can have significant uncertainties and biases
   relative to measured wind speeds. In this work we develop a model of the
   bias and uncertainty of CFS reanalysis wind speed than can be used to
   correct the data and identify sources of error. We find the CFS
   reanalysis data underestimate wind speeds at high elevations, at high
   measurement heights, and in unstable atmospheric conditions. For
   example, at a site with an elevation of 500 m and hub height of 80 m, a
   CFS reanalysis wind speed of 8 m/s is 0.2 mis higher to 13 mis lower
   than the measured wind speed. We also find a seasonal bias that
   correlates with surface roughness length used by the reanalysis model
   during the spring season. The corrections we propose reduce the average
   bias of reanalysis wind speed extrapolated to hub height to nearly zero,
   an improvement of 03-0.9 mis. These corrections also reduce the RMS
   error by 0.1-0.4 m/s, a small improvement compared to the uncorrected
   RMS errors of 1.5-2.4 m/s. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Membrane properties required for post-combustion CO2 capture at
   coal-fired power plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{511}},
Pages = {{250-264}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the identification of membrane properties required
   to enable cost-competitive post-combustion CO2 capture from a coal power
   plant using membrane-based processes. In order to identify such
   properties, a numerical version of the attainable region approach
   proposed by Lindqvist et al., built as part of the of the iCCS tool
   developed by SINTEF Energy Research, is used to identify and assess the
   technical and cost performances of the optimal membrane process for a
   given set of membrane properties (selectivity and permeance). This
   numerical model is used to assess the cost performances of 1600 sets of
   membrane properties (selectivity and permeance) for post-combustion CO2
   capture from a coal power plant as defined by the European Benchmarking
   Task Force and compare it with the reference commercial solvent concept
   (MEA) to identify the membrane properties required in a base case that
   treats both membrane- and MEA-based processes as mature and developed.
   The results show that to reach this competiveness with simple process
   configurations requires a permeance of at least 3 m(3)(STP)/(m(2).h.bar)
   with high selectivity, or alternatively a selectivity of at least 65
   with high permeances. These limits can be reduced to permeances as low
   as 1 m(3)(STP)/(m(2).h.bar) with high selectivity, or selectivities as
   low as 30 with high permeances, when advanced membrane process
   configurations are being considered. The assessments of five additional
   cases quantify how additional costs associated with demonstration
   projects and higher membrane module costs can significantly increase the
   selectivities and permeances required to compete with MEA based capture.
   In order to link the membrane development works to the results presented
   in this paper, the constraint introduced by Robeson's upper bound
   limitation, as well as data available in the literature on membrane
   modules and polymeric materials, are compared with the results obtained.
   The inclusion of the upper bound shows that the capacity to generate
   thin membrane film layers is important in order to avoid reducing the
   range of membrane properties, in which diffusion governed membrane can
   be interesting in term of cost performances, especially in cases that
   take demonstration and/or higher module costs into consideration. The
   comparison with literature data shows that while several membranes and
   polymeric materials have the potential to be cost-competitive with
   further properties improvements, and once membrane-based CO2 capture
   becomes mature and demonstrated, financial support will be required to
   demonstrate and help mature the technology.
   Finally, ways to use the results presented here for membrane development
   by membrane development experts, for membrane selection by industrial
   users, and for technology development and demonstration support by
   decision-makers are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper addresses an integrated framework for deciding about the
   supplier selection in the processed food industry under uncertainty. The
   relevance of including tactical production and distribution planning in
   this procurement decision is assessed. The contribution of this paper is
   three-fold. Firstly, we propose a new two-stage stochastic mixed-integer
   programming model for the supplier selection in the process food
   industry that maximizes profit and minimizes risk of low customer
   service. Secondly, we reiterate the importance of considering main
   complexities of food supply chain management such as: perishability of
   both raw materials and final products; uncertainty at both downstream
   and upstream parameters; and age dependent demand. Thirdly, we develop a
   solution method based on a multi-cut Benders decomposition and
   generalized disjunctive programming. Results indicate that sourcing and
   branding actions vary significantly between using an integrated and a
   decoupled approach. The proposed multi-cut Benders decomposition
   algorithm improved the solutions of the larger instances of this problem
   when compared with a classical Benders decomposition algorithm and with
   the solution of the monolithic model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Temperature dependent thermal conductivities and thermal interface
   resistances of pentacene (Pn) thin films deposited on silicon substrates
   and self-assembled monolayer-modified {[}octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)
   and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)] silicon substrates were
   measured using frequency domain thermoreflectance. Atomic force
   microscopy images were used to derive an effective film thickness for
   thermal transport that accounts for surface roughness. Data taken over a
   temperature range of 77300 K for various morphologies and film
   thicknesses show that the thermal conductivity increases with increasing
   Pn grain size. The sum of the substrate-Pn and Pn-gold thermal interface
   resistances was isolated from the intrinsic thermal resistance of the Pn
   films and found to be independent of surface chemistry. Corresponding
   Kapitza lengths of approximately 150 nm are larger than the physical
   thicknesses of typical Pn thin films and indicate that the interfaces
   play a dominant role in the total thermal resistance. This study has
   implications for increasing the performance and effective thermal
   management of small molecule electronic and energy conversion devices.}},

Abstract = {{Mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) chemistry was employed for the
   surface modification of ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs), improving the
   hydrophilicity, binding ability toward uranium ions, as well as
   enriching chemical reactivity for diverse postfunctionalization by
   either surface grafting or surface-initiated polymerization. Uniform PDA
   coating was deposited on the surface of CMK-3 type OMCs via
   self-polymerization of dopamine under mild conditions. Surface
   properties and morphology of the PDA-coated CMK-3 can be tailored by
   adjusting the dopamine concentration and coating time, without
   compromising the meso-structural regularity and the accessibility of the
   mesopores. Due to high density of -NH groups (4.7 mu mol/m(2) or 2.8
   group/nm(2)) and -OH groups (9.3 mu mol/m(2) or 5.6 group/nm(2)) of the
   PDA coating, the modified CMK-3 showed improved hydrophilicity and
   superior adsorption ability toward uranyl ions (93.6 mg/g) in aqueous
   solution. Moreover, with the introduction of alpha-bromoisobutyryl
   bromide (BIBB) initiator to the PDA-coated CMK-3, we demonstrated for
   the first time that activators regenerated by electron transfer for atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP) can be conducted for
   controlled growth of polymer brushes from the surface of OMCs. Thus, PDA
   chemistry paves a new way for surface modification of OMCs to create a
   versatile, multifunctional nanoplatform, capable of further
   modifications toward various applications, such as environmental
   decontamination, catalysis, and other areas.}},

Abstract = {{SrTiO3(111) surfaces have been heated in air at 1250 degrees C, either
   alone or with reservoirs of TiO2 and SrTiO3 powders. The surface
   structure and properties were measured by atomic force microscopy,
   scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), and photochemical marker reactions that leave solid products on
   the surface at the site of the photochemical reaction. All of the
   surfaces are made up of atomically flat terraces of two distinguishable
   types. One terrace has a relatively higher surface potential and
   promotes the photochemical reduction of Ag+. The other terrace has a
   relatively lower positive potential and promotes the photochemical
   oxidation of Pb2+. XPS measurements show that the concentration of
   titanium at the surface increases with the fraction of TiO2 in the
   powder reservoir during annealing, and marker reactions show the
   fraction of terraces that promote oxidation increases with the titanium
   content. The fractional area of terraces that promote oxidation was
   controlled between 45\% and 86\% of the total area.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATING MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING INNOVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Computing the mechanical response of materials requires accurate
   constitutive descriptions, especially their plastic behavior.
   Furthermore, the ability of a model to be used as a predictive, rather
   than a descriptive, tool motivates the development of physically based
   constitutive models. This work investigates combining a homogenized
   viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) approach to reduce the development
   time for a high-resolution viscoplastic model based on the fast Fourier
   transform (FFT). An optimization scheme based on a least-squares
   algorithm is presented. The constitutive responses of copper,
   interstitial-free steel, and pearlite are investigated, and the model
   parameters are presented. Optimized parameters from the low-fidelity
   model provide close agreement (<2 MPa, similar to 1 \% error) with
   stress-strain data at low strains (<10 \%) in the high-fidelity FFT
   model. Simple adjustments to constitutive law parameters bring the FFT
   stress-strain curve in alignment with experimental data at strains
   greater than 10 \%. A two-phase constitutive law is developed for a
   pearlitic steel using a single stress-strain curve, supplemented by data
   for the constituent phases. Sources of error and methods of using
   material information are discussed that lead to optimal estimates of
   initial parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and characterization of the first active
   matrix light-emitting diode (AMLED) microdisplay with an embedded
   visible light communication (VLC) transmitter, enabling LED digital
   signage for location-based applications such as information broadcasters
   and indoor positioning beacons. The driver system-on-a-chip (SoC)
   integrates four identical macro-cells, each containing a pixel driver
   array, a row driver, a column driver, and a first-in first-out memory,
   to drive a wide quarter-VGA (WQVGA) display featuring 400 x 240 blue
   micro-LED (mu LED) pixels fabricated on a single gallium nitride (GaN)
   substrate. The size of each mu LED pixel is 30 x 30 mu m(2). At the
   system level, pulse-width modulation (PWM) superimposed with ON-OFF
   keying modulation is proposed to accomplish grayscale control for
   display and simultaneously transmit VLC signal by modulating the mu LED
   array. At the circuit level, a pixel driver cell composed of three
   transistors and one capacitor (3T1C) with a novel VLC function is
   employed to implement the control scheme. Flip-Chip bonding is adopted
   to establish connections between the WQVGA microdisplay and the AMLED
   driver SoC. Implemented in a 0.5-mu m 2P3M CMOS process, the driver SoC
   enables a high-resolution microdisplay module to achieve 4-bit grayscale
   at a 100-Hz frame rate, while supporting 1.25-Mb/s VLC for a bit error
   rate <10(-5) up to 25-cm distance without a lens. When using optical
   lenses, the VLC distance is extended to >500 cm.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and analyze an online algorithm for reconstructing a sequence
   of signals from a limited number of linear measurements. The signals are
   assumed sparse, with unknown support, and evolve over time according to
   a generic nonlinear dynamical model. Our algorithm, based on recent
   theoretical results for l(1) - l(1) minimization, is recursive and
   computes the number of measurements to be taken at each time on-the-fly.
   As an example, we apply the algorithm to online compressive video
   foreground extraction, a problem stated as follows: given a set of
   measurements of a sequence of images with a static background,
   simultaneously reconstruct each image while separating its foreground
   from the background. The performance of our method is illustrated on
   sequences of real images. We observe that it allows a dramatic reduction
   in the number of measurements or reconstruction error with respect to
   state-of-the-art compressive background subtraction schemes.}},

Abstract = {{As lithium ion batteries become more common in electric vehicles and
   other storage applications, concerns about the cost of their namesake
   material, and its impact on the cost of these batteries, will continue.
   However, examining the constituent materials of these devices shows that
   lithium is a relatively small contributor to both the battery mass and
   manufacturing cost. The use of more expensive lithium precursor
   materials results in less than 1\% increases in the cost of lithium ion
   cells considered. Similarly, larger fluctuations in the global lithium
   price (from \$0 to \$25/kg from a baseline of \$7.50 per kg of Li2CO3)
   do not change the cost of lithium ion cells by more than 10\%. While
   this small cost increase will not have a substantial impact on
   consumers, it could affect the manufacturers of these lithium ion cells,
   who already operate with small profit margins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Red blood cells (RBCs) can be cleared from circulation when alterations
   in their size, shape, and deformability are detected. This function is
   modulated by the spleen-specific structure of the interendothelial slit
   (IES). Here, we present a unique physiological framework for development
   of prognostic markers in RBC diseases by quantifying biophysical limits
   for RBCs to pass through the IES, using computational simulations based
   on dissipative particle dynamics. The results show that the spleen
   selects RBCs for continued circulation based on their geometry,
   consistent with prior in vivo observations. A companion analysis
   provides critical bounds relating surface area and volume for healthy
   RBCs beyond which the RBCs fail the ``physical fitness test{''} to pass
   through the IES, supporting independent experiments. Our results suggest
   that the spleen plays an important role in determining distributions of
   size and shape of healthy RBCs. Because mechanical retention of infected
   RBC impacts malaria pathogenesis, we studied key biophysical parameters
   for RBCs infected with Plasmodium falciparum as they cross the IES. In
   agreement with experimental results, surface area loss of an infected
   RBC is found to be a more important determinant of splenic retention
   than its membrane stiffness. The simulations provide insights into the
   effects of pressure gradient across the IES on RBC retention. By
   providing quantitative biophysical limits for RBCs to pass through the
   IES, the narrowest circulatory bottleneck in the spleen, our results
   offer a broad approach for developing quantitative markers for diseases
   such as hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and malaria.}},

Title = {{Cutting planes for improved global logic-based outer-approximation for
   the synthesis of process networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{201-221}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we present an improved global logic-based
   outer-approximation method (GLBOA) for the solution of nonconvex
   generalized disjunctive programs (GDP). The GLBOA allows the solution of
   non convex GDP models, and is particularly useful for optimizing the
   synthesis of process networks, which yields MINLP models that can be
   highly nonconvex. However, in many cases the NLP that results from
   fixing the discrete decisions is much simpler to solve than the original
   problem. The proposed method exploits this property. Two enhancements to
   the basic GLBOA are presented. The first enhancement seeks to obtain
   feasible solutions faster by dividing the basic algorithm into two
   stages. The first stage seeks to find feasible solutions faster by
   restricting the solution time of the problems and diversifying the
   search. The second stage guarantees the convergence by solving the
   original algorithm. The second enhancement seeks to tighten the lower
   bound of the algorithm by the use of cutting planes. The proposed method
   for obtaining cutting planes, the main contribution of this work, is a
   separation problem based on the convex hull of the feasible region of a
   subset of the constraints. Results and comparison with other global
   solvers show that the enhancements improve the performance of the
   algorithm, and that it is more effective in the tested problems at
   finding near optimal solutions compared to general-purpose global
   solvers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{We quantify the dynamics of a prolate leaky dielectric drop upon removal
   of a uniform dc electric field. Experiments consisting of a castor oil
   drop suspended in silicone oil are compared against axisymmetric
   boundary integral computations that account for transient charging, or
   charge relaxation, of the interface. A temporal asymmetry between the
   drop deformation and relaxation processes is observed in the experiments
   and computations: The drop relaxes back to its spherical equilibrium
   shape faster than the time taken to achieve its steady-state
   deformation. During the deformation process, the electrical (Maxwell)
   stress deforms the drop along the direction of the applied field; it is
   counteracted by the capillary stress. During the relaxation process,
   i.e., after the field is removed, the electrical stress acts together
   with the capillary stress to quickly restore the drop back to
   equilibrium. This change in action of the electrical stress is
   responsible for the asymmetry between the drop deformation and
   relaxation. Notably, the electrical stress acts over the charge
   relaxation time scales of the fluids: Thus, counterintuitively, longer
   charging time scales yield faster drop relaxation. That is, the longer
   it takes for the interface to discharge, the faster the drop shape
   relaxes. We also present computational results for a drop that does not
   relax back to its initial spherical shape upon removal of the electric
   field; rather, the drop breaks up via an end-pinching mechanism.}},

Title = {{Discharging dynamics in an electrolytic cell}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{We analyze the dynamics of a discharging electrolytic cell comprised of
   a binary symmetric electrolyte between two planar, parallel blocking
   electrodes. When a voltage is initially applied, ions in the electrolyte
   migrate towards the electrodes, forming electrical double layers. After
   the system reaches steady state and the external current decays to zero,
   the applied voltage is switched off and the cell discharges, with the
   ions eventually returning to a uniform spatial concentration. At
   voltages on the order of the thermal voltage V-T = k(B)T/q similar or
   equal to 25 mV, where k(B) is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature,
   and q is the charge of a proton, experiments on surfactant-doped
   nonpolar fluids observe that the temporal evolution of the external
   current during charging and discharging is not symmetric {[}V. Novotny
   and M. A. Hopper, J. Electrochem. Soc. 126, 925 (1979); P. Kornilovitch
   and Y. Jeon, J. Appl. Phys. 109, 064509 (2011)]. In fact, at
   sufficiently large voltages (several V-T), the current during
   discharging is no longer monotonic: it displays a ``reverse peak{''}
   before decaying in magnitude to zero. We analyze the dynamics of
   discharging by solving the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations governing ion
   transport via asymptotic and numerical techniques in three regimes.
   First, in the ``linear regime{''} when the applied voltage V is formally
   much less than V-T, the charging and discharging currents are
   antisymmetric in time; however, the potential and charge density
   profiles during charging and discharging are asymmetric. The current
   evolution is on the RC timescale of the cell, lambda L-D/D, where L is
   the width of the cell, D is the diffusivity of ions, and lambda(D) is
   the Debye length. Second, in the (experimentally relevant)
   thin-double-layer limit epsilon = lambda(D)/L << 1, there is a ``weakly
   nonlinear{''} regime defined by V-T less than or similar to V less than
   or similar to V-T ln(1/epsilon), where the bulk salt concentration is
   uniform; thus the RC timescale of the evolution of the current magnitude
   persists. However, nonlinear, voltage-dependent, capacitance of the
   double layer is responsible for a break in temporal antisymmetry of the
   charging and discharging currents. Third, the reverse peak in the
   discharging current develops in a ``strongly nonlinear{''} regime V
   greater than or similar to V-T ln(1/epsilon), driven by neutral salt
   adsorption into the double layers and consequent bulk depletion during
   charging. The strongly nonlinear regime features current evolution over
   three timescales. The current decays in magnitude on the double layer
   relaxation timescale, lambda(2)(D)/D; then grows exponentially in time
   towards the reverse peak on the diffusion timescale, L-2/D, indicating
   that the reverse peak is the results of fast diffusion of ions from the
   double layer layer to the bulk. Following the reverse peak, the current
   decays exponentially to zero on the RC timescale. Notably, the current
   at the reverse peak and the time of the reverse peak saturate at large
   voltages V >> V-T ln(1/epsilon). We provide semi-analytic expressions
   for the saturated reverse peak time and current, which can be used to
   infer charge carrier diffusivity and concentration from experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied how ReaxFF and Behler-Parrinello neural network (BPNN)
   atomistic potentials should be trained to be accurate and tractable
   across multiple structural regimes of Au as a representative example of
   a single-component material. We trained these potentials using subsets
   of 9,972 Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations and then
   validated their predictions against the untrained data. Our best ReaxFF
   potential was trained from 848 data points and could reliably predict
   surface and bulk data; however, it was substantially less accurate for
   molecular clusters of 126 atoms or fewer. Training the ReaxFF potential
   to more data also resulted in overfitting and lower accuracy. In
   contrast, BPNN could be fit to 9,734 calculations, and this potential
   performed comparably or better than ReaxFF across all regimes. However,
   the BPNN potential in this implementation brings significantly higher
   computational cost. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Universality in Nonaqueous Alkali Oxygen Reduction on Metal Surfaces:
   Implications for Li-O-2 and Na-O-2 Batteries}},
Journal = {{ACS ENERGY LETTERS}},

Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Nonaqueous metal-oxygen batteries, particularly lithium oxygen and
   sodium-oxygen, have emerged as possible high energy density alternatives
   to Li-ion batteries that could address the limited driving range issues
   faced by electric vehicles. Many fundamental questions remain
   unanswered, including the origin of the differences in the discharge
   product formed, i.e., Li2O2 versus Li2O in Li-O-2 batteries and NaO2
   versus Na2O2 in Na-O-2 batteries. In this Letter, we analyze the role of
   the electrode (electrocatalyst) in determining the selectivity of the
   discharge product through a tuning of the nucleation overpotential for a
   given electrolyte. On the basis of a thermodynamic analysis using
   density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the free
   energy of adsorbed LiO2{*} is a descriptor determining the nucleation
   overpotential for the formation of lithium peroxide, Li2O2, the primary
   discharge product in Li-O-2 batteries. Our analysis suggests that
   Au(100), Ag(111), and Au(111) are capable of nucleating Li2O2 with very
   low overpotentials. We also show that the free energy of adsorbed
   NaO2{*} is a descriptor determining the nucleation rate for sodium
   superoxide, NaO2, the primary discharge product in Na-O-2 batteries. We
   explore trends in selectivity between 2e(-) and 4e(-) oxygen reduction
   for nucleating Li2O2 and Li2O, respectively, and show that to a first
   approximation, the selectivity can be determined by a single descriptor,
   the free energy of adsorbed LiO2{*}. This is due to the existence of
   linear scaling between LiO2{*} and LiO{*} similar to that observed for
   OOH{*} and OH{*} for aqueous oxygen reduction. This analysis shows that
   for all materials that possess low nucleation overpotentials, the
   nucleation overpotential for 2e(-) oxygen reduction is smaller than that
   for the 4e(-) oxygen reduction. In the case of Na-O-2, we find that the
   trends in selectivity between nucleating NaO2 and Na2O2 are determined
   by the free energy of adsorbed NaO2 and the reorganization energy
   associated with sodium-ion coupled electron transfer. This analysis
   provides a rational basis for the selection of the electrode
   (electrocatalyst) for tuning the nucleation and thereby potentially
   controlling the discharge product.}},

Abstract = {{The orientation dependence of the visible-light stimulated photochemical
   reduction of aqueous Ag+ on polycrystalline hematite Fe2O3 was
   determined by observing the relative amount of reduced Ag-0 on crystals

   the most active and surfaces close to the ( 0001) plane are the least
   active. A strong correlation is observed between the
   orientation-dependent activity and the orientation-dependent surface
   potential measured by scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy. Surfaces
   near the most active ( 1102) plane and the least active ( 0001) plane
   are, respectively, at the most positive and the least positive ends of

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{In this survey, we review several approaches for predicting performance
   of Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based multicore systems, starting from the
   traffic models to the complex NoC models for latency evaluation. We
   first review typical traffic models to represent the application
   workloads in NoC. Specifically, we review Markovian and non-Markovian
   (e.g., self-similar or long-range memory-dependent) traffic models and
   discuss their applications on multicore platform design. Then, we review
   the analytical techniques to predict NoC performance under given input
   traffic. We investigate analytical models for average as well as maximum
   delay evaluation. We also review the developments and design challenges
   of NoC simulators. One interesting research direction in NoC performance
   evaluation consists of combining simulation and analytical models in
   order to exploit their advantages together. Toward this end, we discuss
   several newly proposed approaches that use hardware-based or
   learning-based techniques. Finally, we summarize several open problems
   and our perspective to address these challenges.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The FinFET technology is regarded as a better alternative for modern
   high-performance and low-power integrated-circuit design due to more
   effective channel control and lower power consumption. However, the
   gate-misalignment problem resulting from process variation and the
   parasitic resistance resulting from interconnecting wires based on the
   FinFET technology becomes even more severe compared with the
   conventional planar CMOS technology. Such gate misalignment and unwanted
   parasitic resistance may increase the threshold voltage and decrease the
   drain current of transistors. When applying the FinFET technology to
   analog circuit design, the variation of drain currents can destroy
   current-ratio matching among transistors and degrade circuit
   performance. In this article, we present the first FinFET placement and
   routing algorithms for layout generation of a common-centroid FinFET
   array to precisely match the current ratios among transistors.
   Experimental results show that the proposed matching-driven FinFET
   placement and routing algorithms can obtain the best current-ratio
   matching compared with the state-of-the-art common-centroid placer.}},

Abstract = {{The development of an automated and optimal conflict predicting and
   resolution strategy is one of the most important components in
   successfully implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System
   concept. The conflict resolution problem, which occurs between multiple
   aircraft described by a three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear point-mass
   model, is the focus of this study. A novel method for handling
   nondifferentiable disjunctive conflict avoidance constraints is
   developed by using smoothing functions, which are constructed by
   integrating a probability density function. Thus, the conflict
   resolution problem is posed as an optimal control problem and
   discretized into a nonlinear programming problem via the direct
   transcription approach with a Radau collocation point. The approximation
   error obtained using the smoothing functions is examined through
   sensitivity analysis. An estimable linear relationship is established
   between the approximation error and the smoothing parameter, which
   indicates that the approximation error is controllable. Numerical
   results show that the proposed approach efficiently produces
   conflict-free and feasible maneuvers. The approximation errors are also
   evaluated and found to be minimal and negligible.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the temperature dependent behavior of silica based
   optical fibers upon exposure to high temperatures in hydrogen and
   ambient air. The hydroxyl absorption bands in the wavelength range of
   1000-2500 nm of commercially available multimode fibers with pure silica
   and germanium doped cores were examined in the temperature range of
   20-800 degrees C. Two hydroxyl-related infrared absorption bands were
   observed: similar to 2200 nm assigned to the combination of the
   vibration mode of Si-OH bending and the fundamental hydroxyl stretching
   mode, and similar to 1390 nm assigned to the first overtone of the
   hydroxyl stretching. The absorption in the 2200 nm band decreased in
   intensity, while the 1390 nm absorption band shifted to longer
   wavelengths with an increase in temperature. The observed phenomena were
   reversible with temperature and suspected to be due, in part, to the
   conversion of the OH spectral components into each other and structural
   relaxation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   water management strategies that minimize financial cost, minimize HHE
   cost, and minimize combined financial and HHE costs. The model was
   applied to a 14 wellpad case study that is representative of shale gas

   control vector parameterization (CVP) as implemented in gPROMS (3.7.1).
   In order to accomplish this objective, we describe and propose for the
   nonconventional batch configuration, two dynamic models that involve
   stage-by-stage calculations for the time varying column profiles. Case
   studies with and without reaction are presented in order to compare the

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of suction feeding is critical for the survival of
   fish larvae; failure to capture food during the onset of autonomous
   feeding can rapidly lead to starvation and mortality. Fluid mechanics
   experiments that investigate the suction feeding of suspended particles
   are limited to adult fishes, which operate at large Reynolds numbers.
   This manuscript presents the first literature results in which the
   external velocity fields generated during suction feeding of early
   zebrafish larvae (2500-20,000 mu m total length) are reported using
   time-resolved microscopic particle image velocimetry. For the larval
   stages studied, the maximum peak suction velocity of the inflow bolus is
   measured at a finite distance from the mouth tip and ranges from 1 to 8
   mm/s. The average pressure gradient and the velocity profile proximal to
   the buccal (mouth) cavity are calculated, and two distinct trends are
   identified. External recirculation regions and reverse flow feeding
   cycles are also observed and quantified. One of the unresolved questions
   in fish suction feeding is the shape and dynamics of the buccal cavity
   during suction feeding; optical coherence tomography imaging is found to
   be useful for reconstructing the mouth kinematics. The projected area of
   the mouth cavity during the feeding cycle varies up to 160 and 22 \% for
   the transverse and mid-sagittal planes, respectively. These findings can
   inspire novel hydrodynamically efficient biomedical and microfluidic
   devices.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Formation and speciation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) depend on
   source water constituents. Many studies have sought to model the
   formation of DBPs using both source water and in-plant operational data,
   and although sometimes highly predictive of DBP formation, these models
   are limited in their applicability. To create regional models that could
   apply to multiple plants within a watershed, classification trees were
   used to predict finished water DBP parameters from source water
   constituents collected at multiple locations in a watershed. Data were
   from a field study conducted in the Monongahela River in southwestern PA
   from May, 2010 to September, 2012, incorporating six different sites.
   Classification trees were used to predict violation of, or compliance
   with, four threshold values that have regulatory and operational
   significance, namely, the total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) maximum
   contaminant level (MCL) (regulatory standard of 80 mu g/L), 80\% of the
   TTHMs MCL (64 mu g/L), a bromine incorporation factor of 0.75, and 50\%
   brominated THMs by mass. The classification trees demonstrated
   accuracies of 76-83\%. Fluorescence measurements were selected in all
   classification trees, demonstrating their utility in DBP predictive
   models. Furthermore, model validation using data from each collection
   site demonstrated the potential use of classification models across this
   spatially variable region for drinking water plants unable to collect
   their own source water data. Thus, classification trees provide a
   valuable tool for creating watershed-level source water-based DBP
   models.}},

   the best conditions utilized 50 ppm of CuBr2/TPMA as the catalyst and
   2-bromopropionitrile (BPN) as the initiator. This combination resulted
   in 46\% conversion in 10 h and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with the
   narrowest molecular weight distribution (M-w/M-n = 1.11-1.21). Excellent
   control was maintained after lowering the catalyst loading to 10 ppm,

Abstract = {{Accurate representations of cellular organization for multiple
   eukaryotic cell types are required for creating predictive models of
   dynamic cellular function. To this end, we have previously developed the
   CellOrganizer platform, an open source system for generative modeling of
   cellular components from microscopy images. CellOrganizer models capture
   the inherent heterogeneity in the spatial distribution, size, and
   quantity of different components among a cell population. Furthermore,
   CellOrganizer can generate quantitatively realistic synthetic images
   that reflect the underlying cell population. A current focus of the
   project is to model the complex, interdependent nature of organelle
   localization. We built upon previous work on developing multiple
   non-parametric models of organelles or structures that show punctate
   patterns. The previous models described the relationships between the
   subcellular localization of puncta and the positions of cell and nuclear
   membranes and microtubules. We extend these models to consider the
   relationship to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and to consider the
   relationship between the positions of different puncta of the same type.
   Our results do not suggest that the punctate patterns we examined are
   dependent on ER position or inter- and intra-class proximity. With these
   results, we built classifiers to update previous assignments of proteins
   to one of 11 patterns in three distinct cell lines. Our generative
   models demonstrate the ability to construct statistically accurate
   representations of puncta localization from simple cellular markers in
   distinct cell types, capturing the complex phenomena of cellular
   structure interaction with little human input. This protocol represents
   a novel approach to vesicular protein annotation, a field that is often
   neglected in high-throughput microscopy. These results suggest that
   spatial point process models provide useful insight with respect to the
   spatial dependence between cellular structures. (c) 2016 International

Abstract = {{By averaging multiple writes of opposite polarity waveforms captured
   synchronously from heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media, we
   distinguish random noise of the HAMR writing process from the spatially
   anti-correlated repeatable noise due to media microstructure variations.
   We show both analytically and experimentally how the normalized cross
   correlation coefficient, R, of two opposite polarity waveforms
   quantifies the random and repeatable dc-noise fractions, showing where
   dc-noise reduction efforts should be concentrated. The value of R also
   reflects the degree of media saturation. At optimal recording conditions
   for the head and media studied here, the total dc-noise comprises
   appreciable fractions of both random and repeatable noise. The
   experimental results are supplemented with micromagnetic modeling and

   magnetoelectric (ME) sensor with high-permeability Fe-based
   nanocrystalline soft-magnetic alloy FeCuNbSiB, ferromagnetic alloy with
   constant elasticity FeNi and piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconium
   titanate (PZT). A built-in magnetic field induced by a spatially varying
   magnetization within the heterostructure leads to a zero-biased ME
   response. The corresponding zero-biased ME coefficient reaches as high
   as 43.75 V/cm . Oe (3.5 V/Oe). Meanwhile, an additional stress produced
   by FeCuNbSiB is transferred to FeNi, which enhances the effective
   resonant strain coefficient for FeCuNbSiB/FeNi at low magnetic bias and
   decreases the required optimum dc magnetic bias H-opt,H- dc. Hence, the
   maximum resonant ME coefficient is found to reach 51.5 V/cm . Oe (4.12
   V/Oe) at H-opt,H- dc of only 33 Oe. H-opt,H- dc for our proposed ME

Abstract = {{We measure the effect on surface plasmon resonance of introducing Cr in
   a range of thicknesses between 0 and 6.4 nm at the interface between
   SiO2 and Au using attenuated total reflectance at a free space
   wavelength of 658 nm. The measured curves were fit to the equations for
   reflectivity of a three-interface system to extract a thickness and
   effective epsilon(r) for the Cr interface layer. For a 1.2 nm Cr
   interface layer, we extracted epsilon(r) = 4.4 - j 56, while for a 6.4
   nm Cr layer, epsilon(r) = -8.5 - j41. The real part of the adhesion
   layer's complex dielectric function is allowed to be positive during
   fitting. We consider the positive real part of the dielectric constants
   at low thicknesses for Cr to be an effective value that must be taken
   together with the Au overlayer to describe the overall system.
   Simulations of plasmonic propagation with these effective constants
   indicate that even at 1.2 nm in thickness, Cr will reduce the plasmon
   propagation distance in relevant structures to one-fifth the propagation
   distance of the interface without the presence of Cr. This behavior was
   compared to Cu, a metal with plasmonic properties comparable with Au,
   and it was found that a Cu interface layer has very little effect on
   plasmon propagation at the Au/SiO2 interface, as expected.}},

Abstract = {{During the intermittent contact between the head and the disk of the
   hard disk drive (HDD), the perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricant
   experiences shear/ elongation deformation. Therefore, the molecular
   rheology of PFPE becomes critically important in designing optimal
   lubricants that control the friction and wear. In this paper, we
   examine, for the first time, the rheological responses of nanoblended
   PFPEs, including storage and loss moduli (G' and G `'), by monitoring
   the time-dependent stress-strain relationship via nonequilibrium
   molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that the nonfunctional PFPEs
   (Fomblin Z-type) exhibit liquid-like behavior, while agglomeration
   behavior was observed for the functional PFPEs (Fomblin Zdol-type). In
   addition, strong endgroup couplings due to functional endgroup weaken as
   the temperature increases. For binary blended PFPEs, we also observed
   similar phenomena, which strongly depends on the blend ratio and imposed
   condition (e.g., temperature and oscillatory frequency). We established
   a finger print analysis via G'-G `' plots for different blend ratios and
   temperatures. By analyzing the blended PFPE relaxation processes, our
   results provide the optimal parameters for lubricant selection criteria
   to enhance the HDD performance.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent advances, data storage industries are pushing the limits
   of recording devices by heating the media with a pulsing laser. Although
   high-temperature operations may be favorable for the magnetic recording
   process, it increases the instability of the whole system. Lubricant
   molecules on the media surface can greatly be affected by this change.
   Previous experiments have reported signs of unknown substances
   contaminating the head component during the operation of heat-assisted
   magnetic recording (HAMR) which hinders the read/write capabilities of
   the device. In this paper, we have analyzed the nanoscale physical
   phenomena of several lubricant/organic molecules in the head-disk
   interface under the harsh conditions of HAMR via molecular dynamics
   simulation using the united atom model, coarse-grained, bead-spring
   model, and simple reactive sphere model. Our models simulated extreme
   temperature, high magnetic field strength, and effects of different
   media for two different perfluoropolyether molecules. Our preliminary
   simulation results provided few possible sources of the unknown
   materials and of those possibilities, evaporation seemed to be dominant.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetic recording is a promising candidate to further
   extend the areal density above 1 Tb/in(2) density while using a
   conventional writer and media. During the writing process, a shingled
   writer is usually used to write narrow tracks by overlapping previous
   tracks, which brings severe intertrack interference (ITI), fewer grains
   per channel bit and corresponding lower signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). As a
   consequence, for the current shingled magnetic recording system, a
   normally oriented head array (NHA) is usually implemented to detect a
   single track by using 2-D signal processing to mitigate the ITI and
   media noise. Then, a rotated head array (RHA) has been found to
   effectively avoid the ITI and regain the lost down-track resolution
   using signal processing. Correspondingly, in this paper, the RHA is
   investigated to simultaneously detect three tracks with 1-D and joint
   pattern-dependent noise-predictive (PDNP) Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv
   (BCJR) detectors. Simulation indicates that, for the perfect writing at
   the 6 nm Voronoi grains, if the 1-D PDNP BCJR detector is implemented,
   the RHA combined with a designed 2-D equalizer producing multiple
   equalized waveforms can provide 16\% density gains compared with the NHA
   with a 2-D equalizer and 1-D target at the target bit error rate (BER)
   of 10(-2). If the joint PDNP BCJR detector is implemented, the RHA can
   provide 25\% density gain compared with that for the NHA with the same
   detection algorithm at the target BER of 10(-2). With respect to error
   correction, a longer codeword length of binary low density parity check
   code can be used for decoding of the multi-track detection compared with
   that for the single-track detection, which provides an extra SNR gain.}},

   piezoelectric substrates showed higher acoustic power radiated in either
   forward or backward wave propagation direction depending on their

   piezoelectric substrates, we report directionality in the c-axis tilted
   44\% scandium doped aluminum nitride thin piezoelectric film-based SAW
   devices on sapphire. It is worth noting that our observance of
   directionality is specifically in Sezawa mode. We produced a c-axis tilt
   up to 5.5. over the single wafer and examined the directionality by
   comparing the forward and backward insertion loss utilizing split finger
   electrodes as a receiver. The wave propagation direction and c-axis tilt
   angle influence on the performance of SAW devices is evaluated.
   Furthermore, return loss and insertion loss data are presented for
   various SAW propagation directions and c-axis tilt angles. Finally, the
   comparison for both acoustic modes, i.e., Rayleigh and Sezawa, is

Abstract = {{The high-temperature oxidation of multicomponent metal alloys exhibits
   complex dependencies on composition, which are not fully understood for
   many systems. Combinatorial screening of the oxidation of many different
   compositions of a given alloy offers an ideal means for gaining
   fundamental insights into such systems. We have previously developed a
   high throughput methodology for studying AlxFeyNi1-x-y oxidation using
   similar to 100 nm thick composition spread alloy films (CSAFs). In this
   work, we critically assess two aspects of this methodology: the
   sensitivity of CSAF oxidation behavior to variations in AlxFeyNi1-x-y
   composition and the differences between the oxidation behavior of
   similar to 100 nm thick CSAFs and that of bulk AlxFeyNi1-x-y alloys.
   This was done by focusing specifically on AlxFe1-x and AlxNi1-x
   oxidation in dry air at 427 degrees C. Transitions between
   phenomenologically distinguishable types of oxidation behavior are found
   to occur over CSAF compositional ranges of <2 at. \%. The oxidation of
   AlxFe1-x CSAFs is found to be very similar to that of bulk AlxFe1-x
   alloys, but some minor differences between CSAF and bulk behavior are
   observed for AlxNi1-x oxidation. On the basis of our assessment,
   high-throughput studies of CSAF oxidation appear to be an effective
   method for gaining fundamental insights into the composition dependence

Abstract = {{This paper presents a system of modeling advances that can be applied in
   the computational optimization of wind plants. These modeling advances
   include accurate cost and power modeling, partial wake interaction, and
   the effects of varying atmospheric stability. To validate the use of
   this advanced modeling system, it is employed within an Extended Pattern
   Search (EPS)-Multi-Agent System (MAS) optimization approach for multiple
   wind scenarios. The wind farm layout optimization problem involves
   optimizing the position and size of wind turbines such that the
   aerodynamic effects of upstream turbines are reduced, which increases
   the effective wind speed and resultant power at each turbine. The
   EPS-MAS optimization algorithm employs a profit objective, and an
   overarching search determines individual turbine positions, with a
   concurrent EPS-MAS determining the optimal hub height and rotor diameter
   for each turbine. Two wind cases are considered: (1) constant,
   unidirectional wind, and (2) three discrete wind speeds and varying wind
   directions, each of which have a probability of occurrence. Results show
   the advantages of applying the series of advanced models compared to
   previous application of an EPS with less advanced models to wind farm
   layout optimization, and imply best practices for computational
   optimization of wind farms with improved accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A multiscale analysis of the electromechanical coupling in elastic
   dielectrics is conducted, starting from the discrete monomer level
   through the polymer chain and up to the macroscopic level. Three models
   for the local relations between the molecular dipoles and the electric
   field that can fit a variety of dipolar monomers are considered. The
   entropy of the network is accounted for within the framework of
   statistical mechanics with appropriate kinematic and energetic
   constraints. At the macroscopic level closed-form explicit expressions
   for the behaviors of amorphous dielectrics and isotropic polymer
   networks are determined, none of which admits the commonly assumed
   linear relation between the polarization and the electric field. The
   analysis reveals the dependence of the macroscopic coupled behavior on
   three primary microscopic parameters: the model assumed for the local
   behavior, the intensity of the local dipole, and the length of the
   chain. We show how these parameters influence the directional
   distributions of the monomers and the hence the resulting overall
   response of the network. In particular, the dependences of the
   polarization and the polarization induced stress on the deformation of
   the dielectric are illustrated. More surprisingly, we also reveal a
   dependence of the stress on the electric field which stems from the
   kinematic constraint imposed on the chains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Magnetic skyrmions belong to a set of topologically nontrivial spin
   textures at the nanoscale that have received increased attention due to
   their emergent behavior and novel potential spintronic applications.
   Discovering materials systems that can host skyrmions at room
   temperature in the absence of external magnetic field is of crucial
   importance not only from a fundamental aspect, but also from a
   technological point of view. So far, the observations of skyrmions in
   bulk metallic ferromagnets have been limited to low temperatures and to
   materials that exhibit strong chiral interactions. Here we show the
   formation of nanoscale skyrmions in a nonchiral multiferroic material,
   which is ferromagnetic and ferroelastic, Ni2MnGa at room temperature
   without the presence of external magnetic fields. By using Lorentz
   transmission electron microscopy in combination with micromagnetic
   simulations, we elucidate their formation, behavior, and stability under
   applied magnetic fields at room temperature. The formation of skyrmions
   in a multiferroic material with no broken inversion symmetry presents
   new exciting opportunities for the exploration of the fundamental
   physics of topologically nontrivial spin textures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the electrical characterization of the
   nonlinear tapping mode of the nanorelays capacitively transduced. Such a
   characterization is carried out utilizing three-terminal tungsten
   CMOS-NEM relays. Exciting electrostatically the switching devices near
   its resonance and detecting its movement by means of capacitive
   detection, we reveal double-side frequency dynamic-contact
   characteristics when the displacement is large and the tapping occur in
   the nonlinear regime. In this way, we take advantage of this periodic
   contact to evaluate the switching characteristics of the device. We
   report that the switch stands more than 10 billion of tapping cycles (in
   a cold switching scenario) without showing any failure. Moreover, we
   measure current-voltage (I-V) curves before and after the cycling test
   in order to evaluate the changes produced in the ON-state contact
   resistance and in the pull-in and pull-out voltages. This test reveals
   that the characterized switch has a consistent and repetitive pull-in
   voltage without changing its elastic properties. In addition, we observe
   that the pull-out voltage decreases slightly and the contact resistance
   diminishes (from an initial value of 2 G Omega to a minimum value of 735
   M Omega). We eventually attribute this result to the fact that the
   superficial oxide is broken down due to the continuous tapping of the
   cantilever tip on the contact electrode.}},

Title = {{Visualization and analysis of biomaterial-centered thrombus formation
   within a defined crevice under flow}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{72-83}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The blood flow pathway within a device, together with the biomaterial
   surfaces and status of the patient's blood, are well-recognized factors
   in the development of thrombotic deposition and subsequent embolization.
   Blood flow patterns are of particular concern for devices such as blood
   pumps (i.e. ventricular assist devices, VADs) where shearing forces can
   be high, volumes are relatively large, and the flow fields can be
   complex. However, few studies have examined the effect of geometric
   irregularities on thrombus formation on clinically relevant opaque
   materials under flow. The objective of this study was to quantify human
   platelet deposition onto Ti6Al4V alloys, as well as positive and
   negative control surfaces, in the region of defined crevices (similar to
   50-150 mu m in width) that might be encountered in many VADs or other
   cardiovascular devices. To achieve this, reconstituted fresh human blood
   with hemoglobin depleted red blood cells (to achieve optical clarity
   while maintaining relevant rheology), long working optics, and a custom
   designed parallel plate flow chamber were employed. The results showed
   that the least amount of platelet deposition occurred in the largest
   crevice size examined, which was counter-intuitive. The greatest levels
   of deposition occurred in the 90 mu m and 53 mu m crevices at the lower
   wall shear rate. The results suggest that while crevices may be
   unavoidable in device manufacturing, the crevice size might be tailored,

Abstract = {{The implementation of waste heat recovery units on oil and gas offshore
   platforms demands advances in both design methods and control systems.
   Model-based control algorithms can play an important role in the
   operation of offshore power stations. A novel regulator based on a
   linear model predictive control (MPC) coupled with a steadystate
   performance optimizer has been developed in the SIMULINK language and is
   documented in the paper. The test case is the regulation of a power
   system serving an oil and gas platform in the Norwegian Sea. One of the
   three gas turbines is combined with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC)
   turbogenerator to increase the energy conversion efficiency. Results
   show a potential reduction of frequency drop up to 40\% for a step in
   the load setpoint of 4 MW, compared to proportional-integral control
   systems. Fuel savings in the range of 2-3\% are also expected by
   optimizing on-the-fly the thermal efficiency of the plant.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A method has been developed and demonstrated to quantify the degree of
   carbide network connectivity in ultrahigh carbon steels through digital
   image processing and analysis of experimental micrographs. It was shown
   that the network connectivity and carbon content can be correlated to
   toughness for various ultrahigh carbon steel specimens. The image
   analysis approach first involved segmenting the carbide network and
   pearlite matrix into binary contrast representations via a grayscale
   intensity thresholding operation. Next, the carbide network pixels were
   skeletonized and parceled into braches and nodes, allowing the
   determination of a connectivity index for the carbide network.
   Intermediate image processing steps to remove noise and fill voids in
   the network are also detailed. The connectivity indexes of scanning
   electron micrographs were consistent in both secondary and backscattered
   electron imaging modes, as well as across two different (50x and 100x)
   magnifications. Results from ultrahigh carbon steels reported here along
   with other results from the literature generally showed lower
   connectivity indexes correlated with higher Charpy impact energy
   (toughness). A deviation from this trend was observed at higher
   connectivity indexes, consistent with a percolation threshold for crack
   propagation across the carbide network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Battery Electric vehicles (BEVs) shift pollution off the road and to
   potentially less damaging and more varied sources than petroleum.
   Depending on the source of electricity, a transition to electrified
   personal transportation can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions
   and air pollutants. However current EVs tend to be more expensive and
   have shorter range, which can hinder public adoption. Government
   incentives can be used to alleviate these factors and encourage
   adoption. Norway has a long history incentivizing BEV adoption including
   measures such as exemption from roadway tolls, access to charging
   infrastructure, point of sale tax incentives, and usage of public bus
   use limited lanes. This paper analyzed the sales of electric vehicles on
   a regional and municipal basis in Norway and then cross analyzed these
   with the corresponding local demographic data and incentive measures to
   attempt to ascertain which factors lead to higher BEV adoption. It was
   concluded that access to BEV charging infrastructure, being adjacent to
   major cities, and regional incomes had the greatest predictive power for
   the growth of BEV sales. It was also concluded that short-range vehicles
   showed somewhat more income and unemployment sensitivity than long-range
   vehicles. Toll exemptions and the right to use bus designated lanes do
   not seem to have statistically significant predictive power for BEV
   sales in our linear municipal-level models, but this could be due to
   neighboring major cities containing those incentive features. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this work we address the long-term, quality-sensitive shale gas
   development problem. This problem involves planning, design, and
   strategic decisions such as where, when, and how many shale gas wells to
   drill, where to lay out gathering pipelines, as well as which delivery
   agreements to arrange. Our objective is to use computational models to
   identify the most profitable shale gas development strategies. For this
   purpose we propose a large-scale, nonconvex, mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming model. We rely on generalized disjunctive programming to
   systematically derive the building blocks of this model. Based on a
   tailor-designed solution strategy we identify near-global solutions to
   the resulting large-scale problems. Finally, we apply the proposed
   modeling framework to two case studies based on real data to quantify
   the value of optimization models for shale gas development. Our results
   suggest that the proposed models can increase upstream operators'
   profitability by several million U.S. dollars. (c) 2016 American

Abstract = {{The cellular structures and mechanical properties of human mesenchymal
   stem cells (hMSCs) vary significantly during culture and with
   differentiation. Previously, studies to measure mechanics have provided
   divergent results using different quantitative parameters and mechanical
   models of deformation. Here, we examine hMSCs prepared for clinical use
   and subject them to mechanical testing conducive to the relevant
   deformability associated with clinical injection procedures.
   Micropipette aspiration of hMSCs shows deformation as a viscoelastic
   fluid, with little variation from cell to cell within a population.
   After two passages, hMSCs deform as viscoelastic solids. Further, for
   clinical applicability during stem cell migration in vivo, we
   investigated the ability of hMSCs to invade into micropillar arrays of
   increasing confinement from 12 to 8 mu m spacing between adjacent
   micropillars. We find that hMSC samples with reduced deformability and
   cells that are more solid-like with passage are more easily able to
   enter the micropillar arrays. Increased cell fluidity is an advantage
   for injection procedures and optimization of cell selection based on
   mechanical properties may enhance efficacy of injected hMSC populations.
   However, the ability to invade and migrate within tight interstitial
   spaces appears to be increased with a more solidified cytoskeleton,
   likely from increased force generation and contractility. Thus, there
   may be a balance between optimal injection survival and in situ tissue
   invasion.}},

Abstract = {{It is challenging to estimate the public health costs of fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5) and its precursor emissions accurately and
   quickly for policy research because of their complex physical and
   chemical processes occurring over a large downwind area. We developed a
   method for building statistical regressions that estimate public health
   cost of emissions accurately like a state-of-the-art chemical transport
   model (CTM) but without its high computational cost. This method
   achieves detailed spatial resolution according to the location of the
   emission source, accounting for differences in the exposed population
   downwind. Using tagged CTM simulations, our method builds a large
   dataset of air quality public health costs from marginal emissions
   throughout the United States. Two methods were developed to describe
   exposed population, one that assumes a generic downwind plume
   concentration profile derived from CTM outputs and a simpler method that
   uses the size of population within certain distances as variables. Using
   the former method, we parameterized marginal public health cost {[}\$/t]
   and intake fraction {[}ppm] as a function of exposed population and key
   atmospheric variables. We derived models for elemental carbon, sulfur
   dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ammonia. Compared to estimates calculated
   directly using CTM outputs, our models generally show mean fractional
   errors of only 10\%-30\% and up to 50\% for NOx in some seasons, which
   are generally similar to or less than CTM's performance. Our results
   show that the public health costs of emissions can be efficiently
   parameterized for policy analyses based on state-of-the-art CTMs. (C)

   power-law nonlinearity that replaces the traditional log nonlinearity
   used in MFCC coefficients, a noise-suppression algorithm based on
   asymmetric filtering that suppresses background excitation, and a module
   that accomplishes temporal masking. We also propose the use of
   medium-time power analysis in which environmental parameters are
   estimated over a longer duration than is commonly used for speech, as
   well as frequency smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate that PNCC
   processing provides substantial improvements in recognition accuracy
   compared to MFCC and PLP processing for speech in the presence of
   various types of additive noise and in reverberant environments, with
   only slightly greater computational cost than conventional MFCC
   processing, and without degrading the recognition accuracy that is
   observed while training and testing using clean speech. PNCC processing
   also provides better recognition accuracy in noisy environments than
   techniques such as vector Taylor series (VTS) and the ETSI advanced
   front end (AFE) while requiring much less computation. We describe an
   implementation of PNCC using ``online processing{''} that does not
   require future knowledge of the input.}},

Abstract = {{We find large deviations rates for consensus-based distributed inference
   for directed networks. When the topology is deterministic, we establish
   the large deviations principle and find exactly the corresponding rate
   function, equal at all nodes. We show that the dependence of the rate
   function on the stochastic weight matrix associated with the network is
   fully captured by its left eigenvector corresponding to the unit
   eigenvalue. Further, when the sensors' observations are Gaussian, the
   rate function admits a closed-form expression. Motivated by these
   observations, we formulate the optimal network design problem of finding
   the left eigenvector that achieves the highest value of the rate
   function, for a given target accuracy. This eigenvector therefore
   minimizes the time that the inference algorithm needs to reach the
   desired accuracy. For Gaussian observations, we show that the network
   design problem can be formulated as a semidefinite (convex) program, and
   hence can be solved efficiently. When observations are identically
   distributed across agents, the system exhibits an interesting property:
   the graph of the rate function always lies between the graphs of the
   rate function of an isolated node and the rate function of a fusion
   center that has access to all observations. We prove that this
   fundamental property holds even when the topology and the associated
   system matrices change randomly over time, with arbitrary distribution.
   Due to the generality of its assumptions, the latter result requires
   more subtle techniques than the standard large deviations tools,
   contributing to the general theory of large deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Self-powered systems that interact with the physical world require
   computing platforms with predictable timing behavior and a low energy
   demand. Energy consumption can be reduced by choosing energy-efficient
   designs for both hardware and software components of the platform. We
   leverage the state-of-the-art in hardware design by adopting
   Heterogeneous Multi-core Processors with support for Dynamic Voltage and
   Frequency Scaling and Dynamic Power Management. Through experiments on
   one such platform, we expose the hardware characteristics that violate
   assumptions of conventional energy models and propose a revised model
   suitable for identifying the energy-efficient frequency range. We then
   address the problem of allocating real-time software components onto
   heterogeneous cores such that total energy is minimized. Our approach is
   to start from an analytically justified target load distribution and
   find a task assignment heuristic that approximates it. Our analysis
   shows that neither balancing the load nor assigning all load to the
   ``cheapest{''} core is the best load distribution strategy, unless the
   cores are extremely alike or extremely different. The optimal load
   distribution is then formulated as a solution to a convex optimization
   problem. A heuristic that approximates this load distribution and an
   alternative method that leverages the solution explicitly are proposed
   as viable task assignment methods. The proposed methods are compared to
   state-of-the-art on simulated problem instances and in a case study of a
   soft-real-time application on an off-the-shelf ARM big.LITTLE

Abstract = {{Erythrocytes have been described as advantageous drug delivery vehicles.
   In order to ensure an adequate circulation half-life, erythrocytes may
   benefit from protective enhancements that maintain membrane integrity
   and neutralize oxidative damage of membrane proteins that otherwise
   facilitate their premature clearance from circulation. Surface
   modification of erythrocytes using rationally designed polymers,
   synthesized via atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), may further
   expand the field of membrane-engineered red blood cells. This study
   describes the fate of ATRP-synthesized polymers that were covalently
   attached to human erythrocytes as well as the effect of membrane
   engineering on cell stability under physiological and oxidative
   conditions in vitro. The biocompatible, membrane-reactive polymers were
   homogenously retained on the periphery of modified erythrocytes for at
   least 24 hours. Membrane engineering stabilized the erythrocyte membrane
   and effectively neutralized oxidative species, even in the absence of
   free-radical scavenger-containing polymers. The targeted
   functionalization of Band 3 protein by NHS-pDMAA-Cy3 polymers stabilized
   its monomeric form preventing aggregation in the presence of the
   crosslinking reagent, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3). A free
   radical scavenging polymer, NHS-pDMAA-TEMPO, provided additional
   protection of surface modified erythrocytes in an in vitro model of
   oxidative stress. Preserving or augmenting cytoprotective mechanisms
   that extend circulation half-life is an important consideration for the
   use of red blood cells for drug delivery in various pathologies, as they
   are likely to encounter areas of imbalanced oxidative stress as they
   circuit the vascular system.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of coated ferroelectric photo catalysts represents a
   promising pathway toward competitive efficiencies. Here, we present a
   computational model that is used to predict the internal quantum
   efficiency (IQE) of individual coated ferroelectric domains. Criteria
   are identified that enable increased efficiencies. The, net current
   favored on a negatively polarized domain of BaTiO3 coated with a 20 nm
   TiO2 (anatase) film is shown to be oxidation, whereas reduction is
   favored on positively polarized coated BaTiO3 domains. The results
   indicate that the IQE of the minority carrier reaction (oxidation) at
   physical conditions reported in the literature is less than 1\%. By
   increasing the carrier lifetime to approximately 100 ns, increasing the
   reduction reaction kinetics, and optimizing the potential, complementary
   electron and hole reactions of equal magnitude can occur separately on
   positive and negative domains with an IQE of over 90\% (45\% if operated
   in a Z-scheme). This analysis can be applied to heterostructured
   photocatalysts with various sources of charge-separating internal
   fields, including those that also absorb visible light, to ultimately
   maximize the solar to hydrogen efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerization of acidic monomers is one of the biggest challenges for
   atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). An intramolecular
   cyclization reaction- leading to the loss of the C X chain-end

   termination of the growing polymer chains. Three approaches were used to
   overcome this problem: using Cl as the chain-end halogen, lowering the
   pH (to 0.9), and increasing polymerization rate. Methacrylic acid (MAA)
   was polymerized by both electrochemically mediated ATRP and supplemental
   activator and reducing agent ATRP up to high conversion (>90\%), in t <=
   4 h at 25 degrees C, using inexpensive and nontoxic reagents (NaCl,
   diluted HCl, water). Control over molecular weight (MW) dispersity was
   satisfactory, and MVVs were in agreement with theoretical values. The
   ``livingness{''} of the process was confirmed by an electrochemical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel automatic polycube construction algorithm
   using centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) based surface segmentation.
   Given a smooth surface triangle mesh, we segment triangles into six
   clusters in the surface normal space while satisfying the constraints of
   polycube construction. A bijective mapping between the input mesh and
   polycube surfaces is then built via a planar domain parameterization. We
   develop a new harmonic boundary-enhanced centroidal Voronoi tessellation
   (HBECVT) method by including local neighbouring information in the
   energy function. Improving upon the classic CVT method, the HBECVT
   algorithm can not only overcome the sensitivity to the initialization
   and noise, but also improve the segmentation results and the resulting
   polycubes by reducing non-monotone boundaries. Based on the constructed
   polycube, we then generate quality all-hexahedral (all-hex) meshes. The
   uniform all-hex mesh and volumetric T-mesh can be obtained through the
   octree subdivision and mapping. We can also generate adaptive all-hex
   meshes by extracting the dual mesh from a hybrid octree, which consists
   of polyhedral cells and each grid point is always shared by eight cells.
   Several examples are presented in this paper to show the robustness of
   our algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   anoxic brines on dissolution of arsenic from arsenopyrite merits
   examination. Arsenopyrite dissolution was studied using anoxic Na-Ca-Cl
   brines in the presence and absence of CO2, at both ambient and high
   temperature and pressure conditions. Results revealed that the
   dissolution rate of arsenic ranged from 10(-10) to 10(-12) mol/m(2) s,
   with an average dissolution rate of 10(-10.7) +/- 0.2 mol/m(2) s in the
   absence of CO2. Understanding effects of particular brine constituents
   on arsenopyrite dissolution requires further investigation, however. The
   observed arsenopyrite dissolution rates under anoxic conditions are
   about two orders of magnitude lower than those observed under oxidizing
   conditions. The presence of dissolved CO2 in brines resulted in
   dissolution rates marginally lower than those observed in the absence of
   CO2, with an average dissolution rate of 10(-11.2) +/- 0.5 mol/m(2) s,
   even though a reduction in pH to approximately 3.5 was observed.
   Increase in temperature and pressure from 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C,
   and 1 bar to 100 bars respectively, increased As dissolution rate from
   arsenopyrite by 1 log unit. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The role of polymeric tethers on the effective thermal conductivity of
   polymer nanocomposites is evaluated for the particular case of silica
   particle fillers dispersed within poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The
   effective thermal conductivity of both thin film and bulk composites is
   found to sensitively depend on the interaction between tethered and
   matrix chains. In particular, tethering of polymeric chains exhibiting
   favorable interactions with the matrix (such as
   poly(styrene-r-acrylonitrile), PSAN with molar composition S: AN = 3: 1)
   is shown to raise the effective thermal conductivity. The results point
   to the relevance of the `ligand phase' (constituted of the tethered
   chains) as well as the tether/matrix interface in determining the
   thermal transport in polymer nanocomposites and suggest opportunities to
   raise the thermal conductivity of nanocomposite materials by the
   deliberate design of polymeric tethers to facilitate attractive
   ligand/matrix interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy recovery is a process strategy seeking to improve process
   efficiency through the capture, recycle and deployment of normally
   neglected low energy content sources or streams. By proper optimal
   process design, such low-temperature energy sources can be a feasible
   and economical manner of approaching the energy recovery issue. In
   particular, when Rankine cycles with mixtures as working fluids are
   used, the amount of energy recovery can be improved. The formulation and
   systematic solution of this problem has shown better results when all
   the variables of the Rankine cycle and the compositions of the working
   fluid are considered simultaneously. Another interesting approach is the
   implementation of multiple cycles coupled together. In this work we
   propose a nonlinear optimization formulation of two general multistage
   approaches for the Rankine cycle with mixtures: the cascade and series
   configurations. As main decision variables, we have considered the heat
   source conditions and the mixture components. Then, the resulting
   optimization problem is solved in a deterministic approach as a
   nonlinear program. The results shown that for some cases the multistage
   configurations are useful but limited in terms of cost in comparison to
   the single stage cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current methods of estimating the public health effects of emissions are
   computationally too expensive or do not fully address complex
   atmospheric processes, frequently limiting their applications to policy
   research. Using a reduced-form model derived from tagged chemical
   transport model (CTM) simulations, we present PM2.5 mortality costs per
   tonne of inorganic air pollutants with the 36 km x 36 km spatial
   resolution of source location in the United States, providing the most
   comprehensive set of such estimates comparable to CTM-based estimates.
   Our estimates vary by 2 orders of magnitude. Emission-weighted seasonal
   averages were estimated at \$88,000-130,000/t PM2.5 (inert primary),
   \$14,000-24,000/t SO2, \$3,800-14,000/t NOx, and \$23,000-66,000/t NH3.
   The aggregate social costs for year 2005 emissions were estimated at
   \$1.0 trillion dollars. Compared to other studies, our estimates have
   similar magnitudes and spatial distributions for primary PM2.5 but
   substantially different spatial patterns for precursor species where
   secondary chemistry is important. For example, differences of more than
   a factor of 10 were found in many areas of Texas, New Mexico, and New
   England states for NOx and of California, Texas, and Maine for NH3. Our
   method allows for updates as emissions inventories and CTMs improve,
   enhancing the potential to link policy research to up-to-date

Abstract = {{Hydrophobins are amphiphilic proteins produced by fungi. Cerato-ulmin
   (CU) is a hydrophobin that has been associated with Dutch elm disease.
   Like other hydrophobins, CU stabilizes air bubbles and oil droplets
   through the formation of a persistent protein film at the interface. The
   behavior of hydrophobins at surfaces has raised interest in their
   potential applications, including use in surface coatings, food foams,
   and emulsions and as dispersants. The practical use of hydrophobins
   requires an improved understanding of the interfacial behavior of these
   proteins, alone and in the presence of added surfactants. In this study,
   the adsorption behavior of CU at air/water interfaces is characterized
   by measuring the surface tension and interfacial theology as a function
   of adsorption time. CU is found to adsorb irreversibly at air/water
   interfaces. The magnitude of the dilatational modulus increases with
   adsorption time and surface pressure until CU eventually forms a rigid
   film. The persistence of this film is tested through the sequential
   addition of strong surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the bulk
   liquid adjacent to the interface. SDS is found to coadsorb to interfaces
   precoated with a CU film. At high concentrations, the addition of SDS
   significantly decreases the dilatational modulus, indicating disruption
   and displacement of CU by SDS. Sequential adsorption results in mixed
   layers with properties not observed in interfaces generated from
   complexes formed in the bulk. These results lend insight to the complex
   interfacial interactions between hydrophobins and surfactants.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate estimation of contact angle and surface wettability for
   various degrees of hydrophobicity becomes increasingly important in the
   molecular design of solid surfaces. In this study, we develop a simple,
   yet physically realistic, model for estimating contact angle via
   hybridizing molecular dynamics and pseudocontinuum theory. Molecular
   dynamics simulations were carried out to compute the macroscale contact
   angle between a water droplet and smooth walls from the nanoscale
   calculations. A macrolevel droplet including numerous degrees of freedom
   due to a large number of molecules cannot be directly studied using
   atomistic simulations. To resolve this issue, we employed two approaches
   consisting of the pseudocontinuum approximation and the modified
   Young-Laplace equation. The former involves the 9-3 Lennard-Jones
   potential and can drastically reduce the degrees of freedom in molecular
   simulations, while the latter relates the mesoscale contact angle to the
   realistic one. We altered different parameters, including the
   liquid-surface potential characteristics and the temperature, and
   calculated the water contact angle by leveraging the mass density
   profile fitting method to predict a broad spectrum of hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic substrates. The computational results were compared with
   experimental data for various materials, including graphite, silicon,
   and metals. This study suggests that pseudocontinuum modeling is an
   accurate approach to probe surface wettability for various processes at
   a low computational cost.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Shape transformation in three dimensional (3D) structures is of interest
   in the design of engineered systems capable of accomplishing particular
   tasks that are unachievable by two dimensional (2D) architectures or
   static 3D ones. One approach involves the incorporation of stimuli
   responsive materials into the structural assembly to induce such
   transformations. In this work, we investigate the transformation of a
   curved bilayer ribbon supported by a flexible assembly that belongs to a
   family of complex three dimensional architectures. Through finite
   element analysis, we identified key design parameters and their effects
   on the deformation behavior of the assembly when it is subjected to an
   external stimuli in the form of a mismatch strain. Our results show that
   the behavior of the curved bilayer in response to the stimuli could be
   tuned by controlling the structural properties of the assembly. Our
   calculations also reveal a diverse set of deformation mechanisms
   including gradual flipping, snapping and creasing of the curved bilayer
   under specific circumstances. The design principles established in this
   work could be used to engineer 3D sensors, actuators for traditional and
   soft robotics, electronic device components, metamaterials, energy
   storage and harvesting devices with on-demand functional capabilities
   enabled by 3D transformations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An integrated strain-based optical modulator driven by a piezoelectric
   laterally vibrating resonator is demonstrated. The composite structure
   consists of an acoustic Lamb wave resonator, in which a photonic
   racetrack resonator is internally embedded to enable overlap of the
   guided optical mode with the induced strain field. Both types of
   resonators are defined in an aluminum nitride (AlN) thin film, which
   rests upon a layer of silicon dioxide in order to simultaneously define
   optical waveguides, and the structure is released from a silicon
   substrate. Lateral vibrations produced by the acoustic resonator are
   transferred through a partially etched layer of AlN, producing a change
   in the effective index of the guided wave through the interaction of the
   strain components with the AlN elasto-optic (p) coefficients. Optical
   modulation through the elasto-optic effect is demonstrated at
   electromechanically actuated frequencies of 173 MHz and 843 MHz. This
   device geometry further enables the development of MEMS-based optical
   modulators in addition to studying elasto-optic interactions in
   suspended piezoelectric thin films. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Energy-autonomous computing devices have the potential to extend the
   reach of computing to a scale beyond either wired or battery-powered
   systems. However, these devices pose a unique set of challenges to
   application developers who lack both hardware and software support
   tools. Energy harvesting devices experience power intermittence which
   causes the system to reset and power-cycle unpredictably, tens to
   hundreds of times per second. This can result in code execution errors
   that are not possible in continuously-powered systems and cannot be
   diagnosed with conventional debugging tools such as JTAG and/or
   oscilloscopes.
   We propose the Energy-interference-free Debugger, a hardware and
   software platform for monitoring and debugging intermittent systems
   without adversely effecting their energy state. The
   Energy-interference-free Debugger re-creates a familiar debugging
   environment for intermittent software and augments it with debugging
   primitives for effective diagnosis of intermittence bugs. Our evaluation
   of the Energy-interference-free Debugger quantifies its
   energy-interference-freedom and shows its value in a set of debugging
   tasks in complex test programs and several real applications, including
   RFID code and a machine-learning-based activity recognition system.}},

Abstract = {{Prior work has shown that a biologically inspired approach can solve
   some of the fundamental transportation problems in urban areas. As one
   instance of this approach, it was shown that vehicles equipped with
   dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) radios can manage traffic in
   urban areas in a completely self-organized manner similar to
   self-organizing biological systems (e.g., ants, birds, and fish). This
   scheme is known as virtual traffic lights, and its success is enabled by
   the design of local rules which allow vehicles approaching an
   intersection to resolve the ensuing conflict in a seamless and
   self-organized manner without the need for any infrastructure. One
   important safety issue in urban traffic is how to manage the presence of
   emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks. In this article,
   it is shown that by designing a different set of local rules, one can
   give priority to emergency vehicles at every intersection, thus
   expediting their response times.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral image classification is a challenging problem as obtaining
   complete and representative training sets is costly, pixels can belong
   to unknown classes, and it is generally an ill-posed problem. The need
   to achieve high classification accuracy may surpass the need to classify
   the entire image. To account for this scenario, we use classification
   with rejection by providing the classifier with an option not to
   classify a pixel and consequently reject it. We present and analyze two
   approaches for supervised hyperspectral image classification that
   combine the use of contextual priors with classification with rejection:
   1) by jointly computing context and rejection and 2) by sequentially
   computing context and rejection. In the joint approach, rejection is
   introduced as an extra class that models the probability of classifier
   failure. In the sequential approach, rejection results from the hidden
   field associated with a marginal maximum a posteriori classification of
   the image. We validate both approaches on real hyperspectral data.}},

Abstract = {{Physical models of the human body are important tools in teaching
   anatomy, training medical professionals, planning complex surgeries,
   educating patients, and demonstrating medical devices. We present a
   patient-specific clubfoot model with rigid foot bones suspended
   independently in a transparent gel matrix that reveals the internal
   skeletal structure. Compared to cadavers and prosections, our model is a
   clean and convenient alternative. It offers continuous visual feedback
   through the transparent skin layer (ideal for training purposes), can be
   manufactured at demand and reused, and does not require expensive
   storage and handling facilities. As opposed to other models, which are
   either purely rigid or flexible, our model is flexible yet with
   underlying rigid skeletal structure. We believe it has the highest
   fidelity to human clubfoot in terms of both anatomical structures and
   material properties. To make this clubfoot model, the knee-to-toe
   skeleton was first 3D printed using data segmented from a patient's CT
   data. Then, ballistic gel was melted and cast over the skeleton to
   create the transparent and flexible skin layer. The flexibility of this
   clubfoot model permits its recovery to normal foot shape. In addition,
   the ability of the gel to be repaired with significant recovery of
   ductility (2.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.2, p<0.05) enables reuse of the
   model. Ductility of the finished model can be significantly increased by
   applying an additional elastic coating (4.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.2,
   p<0.05). This clubfoot model opens up the possibility of making other
   high-fidelity models with complex anatomies and/or material structures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive study of the downlink performance in a
   heterogeneous cellular network (or HetNet) is conducted via stochastic
   geometry. A general HetNet model is considered consisting of an
   arbitrary number of open-access and closed-access tiers of base stations
   (BSs) arranged according to independent homogeneous Poisson point
   processes. The BSs within each tier have a constant transmission power,
   random fading factors with an arbitrary distribution and arbitrary
   path-loss exponent of the power-law path-loss model. For such a system,
   analytical characterizations for the coverage probability are derived
   for the max-SINR connectivity and nearest-BS connectivity models. Using
   stochastic ordering, interesting properties and simplifications for the
   HetNet downlink performance are derived by relating these two
   connectivity models to the maximum instantaneous received power (MIRP)
   connectivity model and the maximum biased received power (MBRP)
   connectivity models, providing good insights about HetNets and their
   downlink performance in these complex networks. Furthermore, the results
   also demonstrate the effectiveness and analytical tractability of the
   stochastic geometric approach to study the HetNet performance.}},

Abstract = {{Manufactured nanoparticles (MNP) rapidly undergo aging processes once
   released from products. Silver sulfide (Ag2S) is the major
   transformation product formed during the wastewater treatment process
   for Ag-MNP. We examined toxicogenomic responses of pristine Ag-MNP,
   sulfidized Ag-MNP (sAg-MNP), and AgNO3 to a model soil organism,
   Caenorhabditis elegans. Transcriptomic profiling of nematodes which were
   exposed at the EC30 for reproduction for AgNO3, Ag-MNP, and sAg-MNP
   resulted in 571 differentially expressed genes. We independently
   verified expression of 4 genes (numr-1, rol-8, col-158, and grl-20)
   using qRT-PCR. Only 11\% of differentially expressed genes were common
   among the three treatments. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also
   revealed that Ag-MNP and sAg-MNP had distinct toxicity mechanisms and
   did not share any of the biological processes. The processes most
   affected by Ag-MNP relate to metabolism, while those processes most
   affected by sAg-MNP relate to molting and the cuticle, and the most
   impacted processes for AgNO3 exposed nematodes was stress related.
   Additionally, as observed from qRT-PCR and mutant experiments, the
   responses to sAg-MNP were distinct from AgNO3 while some of the effects
   of pristine MNP were similar to AgNO3, suggesting that effects from
   Ag-MNP is partially due to dissolved silver ions. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{With the increasing trend of solving more complex and integrated
   optimization problems, there is a need for developing process models
   that are sufficiently accurate as well as computationally efficient. In
   this work, we develop an algorithm for the data-driven construction of a
   type of surrogate model that can be formulated as a set of mixed-integer
   linear constraints, yet still provide good approximations of
   nonlinearities and nonconvexities. In such a surrogate model, which we
   refer to as Convex Region Surrogate (CRS), the feasible region is given
   by the union of convex regions in the form of polytopes, and for each
   region, the corresponding cost function can be approximated by a linear
   function. The general problem is as follows: given a set of data points
   in the parameter space and a scalar cost value associated with each data
   point, find a CRS model that approximates the feasible region and cost
   function indicated by the given data points. We present a two-phase
   algorithm to solve this problem and demonstrate its effectiveness with
   an extensive computational study as well as a real-world case study.}},

Title = {{From Twitter to detector: Real-time traffic incident detection using
   social media data}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{321-342}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The effectiveness of traditional incident detection is often limited by
   sparse sensor coverage, and reporting incidents to emergency response
   systems is labor-intensive. We propose to mine tweet texts to extract
   incident information on both highways and arterials as an efficient and
   cost-effective alternative to existing data sources. This paper presents
   a methodology to crawl, process and filter tweets that are accessible by
   the public for free. Tweets are acquired from Twitter using the REST API
   in real time. The process of adaptive data acquisition establishes a
   dictionary of important keywords and their combinations that can imply
   traffic incidents (TI). A tweet is then mapped into a high dimensional
   binary vector in a feature space formed by the dictionary, and
   classified into either TI related or not. All the TI tweets are then
   geocoded to determine their locations, and further classified into one
   of the five incident categories.
   We apply the methodology in two regions, the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
   Metropolitan Areas. Overall, mining tweets holds great potentials to
   complement existing traffic incident data in a very cheap way. A small
   sample of tweets acquired from the Twitter API cover most of the
   incidents reported in the existing data set, and additional incidents
   can be identified through analyzing tweets text. Twitter also provides
   ample additional information with a reasonable coverage on arterials. A
   tweet that is related to TI and geocodable accounts for approximately
   5\% of all the acquired tweets. Of those geocodable TI tweets, 60-70\%
   are posted by influential users (IU), namely public Twitter accounts
   mostly owned by public agencies and media, while the rest is contributed
   by individual users. There is more incident information provided by
   Twitter on weekends than on weekdays. Within the same day, both
   individuals and IUs tend to report incidents more frequently during the
   day time than at night, especially during traffic peak hours. Individual
   tweets are more likely to report incidents near the center of a city,
   and the volume of information significantly decays outwards from the
   center. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Optimizing seed selection is an important problem in read
   mapping. The number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines
   the sensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected
   seeds determines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers
   usually select seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or
   with an inflexible placement scheme, both of which limit the ability of
   the mapper in selecting less frequent seeds to speed up the mapping
   process. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a new algorithm that can
   adjust both the individual seed length and the seed placement, as well
   as derive less frequent seeds.
   Results: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming
   algorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds
   in an L-base-pair read in O(X x L) operations on average and in O(X x
   L-2) operations in the worst case, while generating a maximum of O(L-2)
   seed frequency database lookups. We compare OSS against four
   state-of-the-art seed selection schemes and observe that OSS provides a
   3-fold reduction in average seed frequency over the best previous seed
   selection optimizations.}},

Title = {{A Bayesian Approach for Assessing Seismic Transitions Associated with

Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying transitions in seismic activity related to wastewater
   injection is an important step for accurate seismic-hazard assessment.
   It is also a challenging task due to the uncertainty in the relationship
   between injections and transitions; however, a consistent statistical
   analysis of instrumental seismic records allows for detecting and
   quantifying induced seismicity. In this study, we develop a statistical
   method for modeling a seismic sequence involving non-stationary-induced
   seismicity. It is composed of two steps: first, we select a model for
   the integrated seismicity (i.e., natural and induced) within the
   framework of the epidemic-type aftershock sequence via the Bayesian
   Model Comparison section. Second, we perform Bayesian inference within
   that model to assess the seismic activity and associated parameters. The
   method is applied to the analysis of the events from Oklahoma,
   demonstrating that it is able to provide a consistent representation of
   the occurrence of the dataset. Results show that the overall seismic
   rate (including mainshock and aftershock events) for events with local
   magnitudes (M-L) above 2.5 has been escalated by a factor of more than
   100, from 0.05 to more than five events per day, between January 1975
   and August 2014. For this overall increase, the contribution of the
   mainshock events is estimated to be similar to 56\%. Assuming the
   b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law is 1.0, the probability of
   exceeding M-L 5.0 in a 2-month period is predicted to have increased
   from about 0.05 to more than 0.5 during the study period. A sensitivity
   analysis is presented to show how the probabilistic inference is
   affected by the assumed b-value and the assumed maximum event magnitude.
   The proposed method can provide a statistical basis for quantitatively
   assessing the process of induced seismicity. In addition, it can be
   employed as a decision-support tool to identify areas with increasing
   levels of hazard and to guide strategies for risk mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{The view of the cell nucleus has evolved from an isolated, static
   organelle to a dynamic structure integrated with other mechanical
   elements of the cell. Both dynamics and integration appear to contribute
   to a mechanical regulation of genome expression. Here, we review
   physical structures inside the nucleus at different length scales and
   the dynamic reorganization modulated by cellular forces. First, we
   discuss nuclear organization focusing on self-assembly and disassembly
   of DNA structures and various nuclear bodies. We then discuss the
   importance of connections from the chromatin fiber through the nuclear
   envelope to the rest of the cell as they relate to mechanobiology.
   Finally, we discuss how cell stimulation, both chemical and physical,
   can alter nuclear structures and ultimately cellular function in healthy
   cells and in some model diseases. The view of chromatin and nuclear
   bodies as mechanical entities integrated with force generation from the
   cytoskeleton combines polymer physics with cell biology and medicine.}},

Title = {{Effects of Emulsion Composition on Pulmonary Tobramycin Delivery During
   Antibacterial Perfluorocarbon Ventilation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL MEDICINE AND PULMONARY DRUG DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{251-259}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The effectiveness of inhaled aerosolized antibiotics is
   limited by poor ventilation of infected airways. Pulmonary delivery of
   antibiotics emulsified within liquid perfluorocarbon {[}antibacterial
   perfluorocarbon ventilation (APV)] may solve this problem through better
   airway penetration and improved spatial uniformity. However, little work
   has been done to explore emulsion formulation and the corresponding
   effects on drug delivery during APV. This study investigated the effects
   of emulsion formulation on emulsion stability and the pharmacokinetics
   of antibiotic delivery via APV.
   Methods: Gravity-driven phase separation was examined in vitro by
   measuring emulsion tobramycin concentrations at varying heights within a
   column of emulsion over 4 hours for varying values of fluorosurfactant
   concentration (C-fs = 5-48 mg/mL H2O). Serum and pulmonary tobramycin
   concentrations in rats were then evaluated following pulmonary
   tobramycin delivery via aerosol or APV utilizing sufficiently stable
   emulsions of varying aqueous volume percentage (V-aq = 1\%-5\%), aqueous
   tobramycin concentration (C-t = 20-100mg/mL), and C-fs (15 and 48 mg/mL
   H2O).
   Results: In vitro assessment showed sufficient spatial and temporal
   uniformity of tobramycin dispersion within emulsion for C-fs >= 15 mg/mL
   H2O, while lower C-fs values showed insufficient emulsification even
   immediately following preparation. APV with stable emulsion formulations
   resulted in 5-22 times greater pulmonary tobramycin concentrations at 4
   hours post-delivery relative to aerosolized delivery. Concentrations
   increased with emulsion formulations utilizing increased V(a)q (with
   decreased C-t) and, to a lesser extent, increased C-fs.
   Conclusions: The emulsion stability necessary for effective delivery is
   retained at C-fs values as low as 15 mg/mL H2O. Additionally, the
   pulmonary retention of antibiotic delivered via APV is significantly
   greater than that of aerosolized delivery and can be most effectively
   increased by increasing Vaq and decreasing Ct. APV has been further
   proven as an effective means of pulmonary drug delivery with the
   potential to significantly improve antibiotic therapy for lung disease
   patients.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents and experimentally validates two different
   approaches to describe the quality factor (Q) due to anchor losses in
   65-MHz aluminum nitride (AlN) contour mode resonators (CMRs). The first
   method is an approach that can be considered qualitative in nature, as
   it consists of a simplified analytical model that assumes quasi-static
   anchor conditions and a semi-infinite substrate. Despite its simplicity,
   it effectively provides designers with some guidelines on how to layout
   resonator anchors. The second approach is quantitative and consists of a
   numerical technique that can be considered as an alternative to the use
   of perfectly matched layers (PMLs). The new finite-element method
   imposes fixed-constraint (FC) boundary conditions at the edges of the
   released regions, and the Q is calculated as the ratio of strain energy
   in both resonator and anchors and the total acoustic energy transferred
   to the substrate. The two approaches (analytical and numerical) are
   experimentally validated through measurements of 216 AlN CMRs operating
   at their fundamental resonance frequency (around 65 MHz). The proposed
   numerical approach is also compared with the results obtained using PML.
   This comparison shows that the FC technique has a similar accuracy to
   PML in predicting Q, but it is superior to the latter when reflections
   from the clamped boundaries become relevant.}},

Abstract = {{In October 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
   announced that it would put in place a market-based mechanism to cap net
   greenhouse gas emissions from international civil aviation at 2020
   levels. This paper analyses the obligations that would be placed on real
   airlines under an initial draft ``Strawman{''} proposal that was
   originally formulated as a starting point for discussions within ICAO,
   and the extent to which such a proposal would succeed in keeping
   emissions at or below the desired level. The provisions of the ICAO
   proposal were then applied to more than 100 existing airlines. In order
   to protect commercial sensitivities, we used hierarchical cluster
   analysis to identify groups of different types of airlines. We report
   the results for these groups rather than for individual airlines. While
   ambiguities in the Strawman proposal complicated the analysis, we found
   that, depending on their size and rate of growth, airlines will be
   required to offset very different proportions of their emissions from
   international flights. A system of de minimis exemptions, as currently
   proposed, would benefit some rich countries as well as poor ones.
   Targeting such exemptions more narrowly would raise practical
   difficulties, which we describe. We conclude by recommending that ICAO
   design and implement a much simpler system; and propose one alternative.

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle lost through trauma or disease has proven difficult to
   regenerate due to the challenge of differentiating human myoblasts into
   aligned, contractile tissue. To address this, we investigated
   microenvironmental cues that drive myoblast differentiation into aligned
   myotubes for potential applications in skeletal muscle repair,
   organ-on-chip disease models and actuators for soft robotics. We used a
   2D in vitro system to systematically evaluate the role of extracellular
   matrix (ECM) protein composition and geometric patterning for
   controlling the formation of highly aligned myotubes. Specifically, we
   analyzed myotubes differentiated from murine C2C12 cells and human
   skeletal muscle derived cells (SkMDCs) on micropatterned lines of
   laminin compared to fibronectin, collagen type I, and collagen type IV.
   Results showed that laminin supported significantly greater myotube
   formation from both cells types, resulting in greater than twofold
   increase in myotube area on these surfaces compared to the other ECM
   proteins. Species specific differences revealed that human SkMDCs
   uniaxially aligned over a wide range of micropatterned line dimensions,
   while C2C12s required specific line widths and spacings to do the same.
   Future work will incorporate these results to engineer aligned human
   skeletal muscle tissue in 2D for in vitro applications in disease
   modeling, drug discovery and toxicity screening.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel spatial variation modeling method
   based on hidden Markov tree (HMT) for nanoscale integrated circuits,
   which could efficiently improve the accuracy of full-wafer/chip spatial
   variations recovery at extremely low measurement cost. Applying this
   method, HMT is introduced to set up a statistical model for coefficients
   after exploring the underlying correlated representation of the spatial
   variation in the frequency domain. Accordingly, two key inherent
   properties of the modeling coefficients, i. e., correlations and sparse
   presentations in the frequency domain, can be captured exactly and the
   modeling accuracy can be improved evidently. Then, maximum-a-posteriori
   estimation is applied to formulate the original problem as a convex
   optimization that could be solved efficiently and robustly. Numerical
   results based on industrial data demonstrate that the proposed method
   can achieve superior accuracy over other existing approaches including
   orthogonal matching pursuit, l(1)-norm regularization, and reweighted
   l(1)-norm regularization.}},

Abstract = {{In a machining system, accurate tool wear condition monitoring is
   paramount for guaranteeing the quality of the workpiece and tool life.
   Cutting force signal is the most commonly used signal to depict the tool
   wear variation during the machining process. In this paper, a novel
   approach for tool wear condition monitoring is proposed, which is based
   on the multi-scale hybrid hidden Markov model (HHMM) analysis of cutting
   force signal. The proposed approach captures the deeply mined
   information of tool wear states and holds an accurate tool wear value
   monitoring performance from both local and global analyses point of
   view. The local model deals with the wavelet coefficients of cutting
   force in different frequencies as a cross-twist Markov depended
   structure within instant time resolution, which reflects the tool wear
   state feature from frequency dimension. The global model depicts the
   long time dynamical degradation of tool wear condition combined with the
   local model as a composite structure. Experimental studies on CNC
   turning of nickel alloy, Inconel 718, show that the proposed HHMM
   approach is efficient in tool wear monitoring and outperforms the single
   hidden Markov model (HMM).}},

Abstract = {{The social and behavioural sciences are critical for informing climate-
   and energy-related policies. We describe a decision science approach to
   applying those sciences. It has three stages: formal analysis of
   decisions, characterizing how well-informed actors should view them;
   descriptive research, examining how people actually behave in such
   circumstances; and interventions, informed by formal analysis and
   descriptive research, designed to create attractive options and help
   decision-makers choose among them. Each stage requires collaboration
   with technical experts (for example, climate scientists, geologists,
   power systems engineers and regulatory analysts), as well as continuing
   engagement with decision-makers. We illustrate the approach with
   examples from our own research in three domains related to mitigating
   climate change or adapting to its effects: preparing for sea-level rise,
   adopting smart grid technologies in homes, and investing in energy
   efficiency for office buildings. The decision science approach can
   facilitate creating climate-and energy-related policies that are
   behaviourally informed, realistic and respectful of the people whom they
   seek to aid.}},

Abstract = {{Operation and maintenance of an infrastructure system rely on

   maker with an accurate assessment of their condition states. However,
   resources to be invested in data gathering are usually limited and
   observations should be collected based on their Value of Information
   (VoI). Assessing the VoI is computationally intractable for most
   applications involving sequential decisions, such as long-term
   infrastructure maintenance. In this article, we propose an approach for
   integrating adaptive maintenance planning based on Partially Observable
   Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and inspection scheduling based on a
   tractable approximation of VoI. Two alternative myopic approaches,
   namely pessimistic and optimistic, are introduced, and compared
   theoretically and by numerical examples.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{796}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The self-propulsion of a spherical squirmer - a model swimming organism
   that achieves locomotion via steady tangential movement of its surface -
   is quantified across the transition from viscously to inertially
   dominated flow. Specifically, the flow around a squirmer is computed for
   Reynolds numbers (Re) between 0.01 and 1000 by numerical solution of the
   Navier-Stokes equations. A squirmer with a fixed swimming stroke and
   fixed swimming direction is considered. We find that fluid inertia leads
   to profound differences in the locomotion of pusher (propelled from the
   rear) versus puller (propelled from the front) squirmers. Specifically,
   pushers have a swimming speed that increases monotonically with Re, and
   efficient convection of vorticity past their surface leads to steady
   axisymmetric flow that remains stable up to at least Re = 1000. In
   contrast, pullers have a swimming speed that is non-monotonic with Re.
   Moreover, they trap vorticity within their wake, which leads to flow
   instabilities that cause a decrease in the time-averaged swimming speed
   at large Re. The power expenditure and swimming efficiency are also
   computed. We show that pushers are more efficient at large Re, mainly
   because the flow around them can remain stable to much greater Re than
   is the case for pullers. Interestingly, if unstable axisymmetric flows
   at large Re are considered, pullers are more efficient due to the
   development of a Hill's vortex-like wake structure.}},

Abstract = {{We study a class of design problems in solid mechanics, leading to a
   variation on the classical question of equi-dimensional embeddability of
   Riemannian manifolds. In this general new context, we derive a necessary
   and sufficient existence condition, given through a system of total
   differential equations, and discuss its integrability. In the classical
   context, the same approach yields conditions of immersibility of a given
   metric in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor. In the present
   situation, the equations do not close in a straightforward manner, and
   successive differentiation of the compatibility conditions leads to a
   new algebraic description of integrability. We also recast the problem
   in a variational setting and analyze the infimum of the appropriate
   incompatibility energy, resembling the non-Euclidean elasticity. We then
   derive a Gamma-convergence result for dimension reduction from 3d to 2d
   in the Kirchhoff energy scaling regime.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Commercially pure alpha-Ti was serial sectioned using a Xe plasma
   focused ion beam (PFIB) scanning electron microscope and orientation
   maps were obtained on the parallel layers by electron backscatter
   diffraction. The orientations and shapes of 13,900 grains and 92,100
   grain faces were characterized. The mean number of faces per grain was
   14.2. The grain boundaries were classified according to the three
   misorientation parameters and two grain boundary orientation parameters.
   There were more grain boundaries with 180 degrees-twist and 180
   degrees-tilt character than expected in a random distribution.
   Furthermore, grain boundary planes with prismatic orientations were more
   common than those with basal orientations. The grain boundary with the
   greatest relative area had a 28 degrees/{[}0001] misorientation and (31
   (4) over bar0) and (7 (25) over bar0) grain boundary planes. Compared to
   earlier instruments with Ga-ion sources, the milling speed of the PFIB
   makes it possible to collect ten times more data in a comparable time.

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{A method is proposed to quantitatively compare 3-D microstructural data
   using the Hellinger distance. Statistics from an experimentally observed
   3-D IN100 microstructure are used to generate six synthetic
   microstructures. These are compared quantitatively to the experimental
   microstructure by computing the Hellinger distances between
   distributions of microstructural descriptors, such as the volume, the
   aspect ratio, and the affine moment invariant (Omega) over bar (3). The
   synthetic microstructures use three starting shape classes, namely
   ellipsoids, superellipsoids, and shapes generated by truncating a cube
   with an octahedron; this latter shape class is proposed here for use in
   microstructure generation, and we derive relevant morphological
   descriptors. Synthetic microstructures are generated using either random
   grain placement or by constraining the grain placement to the
   experimental grain centroids. We present a method for determining
   microstructure similarity by random sampling from a reference
   microstructure as well as quantitative shape comparisons between
   synthetic and experimental microstructures. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Due to their unique physicochemical properties, nanomaterials have the
   potential to interact with living organisms in novel ways. Nanomaterial
   variants are too numerous to be screened for toxicity individually by
   traditional animal testing. Existing data on the toxicity of inhaled
   nanomaterials in animal models are sparse in comparison to the number of
   potential factors that may affect toxicity. This paper presents
   meta-analysis-based risk models developed with the machine-learning
   technique, random forests (RFs), to determine the relative contribution
   of different physical and chemical attributes on observed toxicity. The
   findings from this analysis indicate that carbon nanotube (CNT)
   impurities explain at most 30\% of the variance in pulmonary toxicity as
   measured by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) count. Titanium dioxide
   nanoparticle size and aggregation affected the observed toxic response
   by less than 10\%. Differences in observed effects for a group of metal
   oxide nanoparticles associated with differences in Gibbs free energy on
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations amount to only 4\% to the
   total variance.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide optimal solutions to two different (but
   related) input/output design problems involving large-scale linear
   dynamical systems, where the cost associated to each directly
   actuated/measured state variable can take different values, but is
   independent of the input/output performing the task. Under these
   conditions, we first aim to determine and characterize the input/output
   placement that incurs in the minimum cost while ensuring that the
   resulting placement achieves structural controllability/observability.
   Further, we address a constrained variant of the above problem, in which
   we seek to determine the minimum cost placement configuration, among all
   possible input/output placement configurations that ensures structural
   controllability/observability, with the lowest number of directly
   actuated/measured state variables. We develop new graph-theoretical
   characterizations of cost-constrained input selections for structural
   controllability and properties that enable us to address both problems
   by reduction to a weighted maximum matching problem efficiently
   addressed by algorithms with polynomial time complexity (in the number
   of state variables). Finally, we illustrate the obtained results with an
   example. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Extracellular voltage threshold settings can be tuned for optimal
   encoding of movement and stimulus parameters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective. A traditional goal of neural recording with extracellular
   electrodes is to isolate action potential waveforms of an individual
   neuron. Recently, in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), it has been
   recognized that threshold crossing events of the voltage waveform also
   convey rich information. To date, the threshold for detecting threshold
   crossings has been selected to preserve single-neuron isolation.
   However, the optimal threshold for single-neuron identification is not
   necessarily the optimal threshold for information extraction. Here we
   introduce a procedure to determine the best threshold for extracting
   information from extracellular recordings. We apply this procedure in
   two distinct contexts: the encoding of kinematic parameters from neural
   activity in primary motor cortex (M1), and visual stimulus parameters
   from neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1). Approach. We record
   extracellularly from multi-electrode arrays implanted in M1 or V1 in
   monkeys. Then, we systematically sweep the voltage detection threshold
   and quantify the information conveyed by the corresponding threshold
   crossings. Main Results. The optimal threshold depends on the desired
   information. In M1, velocity is optimally encoded at higher thresholds
   than speed; in both cases the optimal thresholds are lower than are
   typically used in BCI applications. In V1, information about the
   orientation of a visual stimulus is optimally encoded at higher
   thresholds than is visual contrast. A conceptual model explains these
   results as a consequence of cortical topography. Significance. How
   neural signals are processed impacts the information that can be
   extracted from them. Both the type and quality of information contained
   in threshold crossings depend on the threshold setting. There is more
   information available in these signals than is typically extracted.
   Adjusting the detection threshold to the parameter of interest in a BCI
   context should improve our ability to decode motor intent, and thus
   enhance BCI control. Further, by sweeping the detection threshold, one
   can gain insights into the topographic organization of the nearby neural
   tissue.}},

   electricity price. The purpose of this paper is to analyze a
   representative set of countries, including Australia, Brazil, China,
   Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Portugal, South Africa, Spain,
   United Kingdom, and the United States of America, to identify the ones
   with the best investment opportunities considering the new regulations.
   Two case studies are included in this paper with different sizes of
   solar photovoltaic systems (1 kW and 5 kW). Each case study includes
   four different consumption scenarios ranging from 100\% self-consumption
   to 30\%. Overall, the results show that the most profit can be made in
   Australia, Germany, and Italy. In these countries, it is possible to
   quadruple the investment during the 25-year period with a 5 kW PV system
   which is roughly 13\% higher than most European countries. Furthermore,
   this study explores the current policies and conditions of small-scale
   solar PV industry in the selected countries, providing enormous benefit
   to various entities namely policy makers, investors, and researchers who
   are working under the solar energy domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Particulate Matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) algorithm
   is used together with PMCAMx, a regional chemical transport model, to
   develop a simple observation-based method (OBM) for the estimation of
   local and regional contributions of sources of primary and secondary
   pollutants in urban areas. We test the hypothesis that the minimum of
   the diurnal average concentration profile of the pollutant is a good
   estimate of the average contribution of long range transport levels. We
   use PMCAMx to generate ``pseudo-observations{''} for four different
   European cities (Paris, London, Milan, and Dusseldorf) and PSAT to
   estimate the corresponding ``true{''} local and regional contributions.
   The predictions of the proposed OBM are compared to the ``true{''}
   values for different definitions of the source area.
   During winter, the estimates by the OBM for the local contributions to
   the concentrations of total PM2.5, primary pollutants, and sulfate are
   within 25\% of the ``true{''} contributions of the urban area sources.
   For secondary organic aerosol the OBM overestimates the importance of
   the local sources and it actually estimates the contributions of sources
   within 200 km from the receptor.
   During summer for primary pollutants and cities with low nearby
   emissions (ratio of emissions in an area extending 100 km from the city
   over local emissions lower than 10) the OBM estimates correspond to the
   city emissions within 25\% or so. For cities with relatively high nearby
   emissions the OBM estimates correspond to emissions within 100 km from
   the receptor. For secondary PM2.5 components like sulfate and secondary
   organic aerosol the OBM's estimates correspond to sources within 200 km
   from the receptor. Finally, for total PM2.5 the OBM provides
   approximately the contribution of city emissions during the winter and
   the contribution of sources within 100 km from the receptor during the
   summer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This letter describes a preprocessing method called subband-based
   stationary-component suppression method using harmonics and power ratio
   (SHARP) processing for reverberant speech recognition. SHARP processing
   extends a previous algorithm called Suppression of Slowly varying
   components and the Falling edge (SSF), which suppresses the steady-state
   portions of subband spectral envelopes. The SSF algorithm tends to
   over-subtract these envelopes in highly reverberant environments when
   there are high levels of power in previous analysis frames. The proposed
   SHARP method prevents excessive suppression both by boosting the floor
   value using the harmonics in voiced speech segments and by inhibiting
   the subtraction for unvoiced speech by detecting frames in which power
   is concentrated in high-frequency channels. These modifications enable
   the SHARP algorithm to improve recognition accuracy by further reducing
   the mismatch between power contours of clean and reverberated speech.
   Experimental results indicate that the SHARP method provides better
   recognition accuracy in highly reverberant environments compared to the
   SSF algorithm. It is also shown that the performance of the SHARP method
   can be further improved by combining it with feature-space maximum
   likelihood linear regression (fMLLR).}},

   heaters}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{412-421}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose a novel inverse scheme, which allows for estimation of
   thermal parameters of internal Joule heaters through measurements of
   surface temperature distributions during a Joule heating process. The
   inverse scheme is based on the governing nonlinear, inhomogeneous heat
   conduction and generation equation and solely assumes knowledge of the
   electric resistivity of the Joule heater. Polynomial forms are assumed
   for the thermal conductivity K = K(T) and c(p)rho =: lambda = lambda(T),
   while the method can be easily generalized to estimate parameters of any
   suitable form. Both the sensitivity and the adjoint methods are
   developed and compared. Owing to the ill-conditioning of the inverse
   scheme, the performance of relaxation methods and regularization schemes
   are analyzed (to improve numerical conditioning). A verification was
   conducted using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) embedded with a strip of
   conductive propylene-based elastomer (cPBE). Good agreement was achieved
   between theoretical predictions by the inverse scheme and experimental
   measurements regardless of the approximated effective potential
   difference across the cPBE. While constant parameter estimations
   sufficed to approximate one reference temperature, the inclusion of
   multiple instants of time required an increase in the polynomial order.
   The improved parameter estimation is shown to remain of the same order
   of magnitude for the temperature range encountered when compared with
   the constant approximation, i.e. K = 10.7 and 12.0 W m(-1) K-1, and
   lambda = 19.9 and 162 J m(-1) K-1, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   prior work using propylene oxide as a test chiral probe, by using the
   crystalline THH Au NPs with well-defined facets to separate a real

   with a density separation method such as centrifugation, could be used
   for enantiomeric purification of real pharmaceuticals. A simple robust

Pages = {{23-33}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel joint formulation of feature-based
   active contour (FAC) and prior shape constraints (CS) for lips/mouth
   segmentation in the wild. Our proposed SC-FAC model is able to robustly
   segment the lips/mouth that belongs to a given mouth shape space while
   minimizing the energy functional. The shape space is defined by a 2D
   Modified Active Shape Model (MASM) whereas the active contour model is
   based on the Chan-Vese functional. Our SC-FAC energy functional is able
   to overcome the drawback of noise while minimizing the fitting forces
   under the shape constraints. We conducted our experiments on images
   captured under challenging conditions such as varying illumination, low
   contrast, facial expression, low resolution, blurring, wearing
   beard/moustache and cosmetic affection from the MBGC, VidTIMIT, JAFFE,
   and LFW databases. The results from our studies indicate that the
   proposed SC-FAC model is reliable and accurately perform prior shape
   weak object segmentation. The average performance of the mouth
   segmentation using proposed SC-FAC on 1918 images from the MBGC database
   under different illuminations, expressions, and complex background
   reaches to a Precision of 91.30\%, a Recall of 91.32\% and an F-measure

Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{427}},
Pages = {{73-82}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Oxidative dissolution experiments were carried out on pyrite from
   multiple petrogenetic environments (hydrothermal, sedimentary, and
   coal-related nodules) to investigate possible variations in the iron
   isotopic composition of pyrite and the products of pyrite dissolution.
   The experimental materials were leached under carefully controlled
   abiotic conditions, and a subset of leachates and starting materials
   from these experiments was analyzed for Fe-56/Fe-54 by multicollector
   ICP-MS. Bulk pyrite delta Fe-56 values (relative to IRMM-014) ranged
   from-0.1 to + 1.3 parts per thousand, with hydrothermal bulk pyrite
   values <+0.5 parts per thousand and those of coal and sedimentary
   nodular pyrite >=+0.5 parts per thousand, higher than most previously
   measured values for Phanerozoic sedimentary pyrite. We suggest that this
   reflects precipitation of coal pyrite from a high-delta Fe-56
   continental source, such as Fe derived from dissolution of Fe(III)
   oxides. This interpretation is consistent with pyrite rare earth element
   (REE) patterns. This could allow differentiation of Fe contributed from
   coal-and shale-related pyrite at abandoned mine drainage sites.
   Leachates from oxidative dissolution of the pyrite at pH = 3 yielded,
   with few exceptions, delta Fe-56 values equal to or lower than those of
   the coexisting bulk pyrite, by up to about 1 parts per thousand. These
   shifts are consistent in direction (but not magnitude) with equilibrium
   isotope fractionation predictions from theory, with possible second
   order effects from isotopic heterogeneity within individual natural
   pyrite samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomorphic mineral replacement reactions involve one mineral phase
   replacing another, while preserving the original mineral's size and
   texture. Macroscopically, these transformations are driven by
   system-wide equilibration through dissolution and precipitation
   reactions. It is unclear, however, how replacement occurs on the
   molecular scale and what role dissolved ion transport plays. Here, we
   develop a new quantitative framework to explain the pseudomorphic
   replacement of KBr crystal in a saturated KCl solution through a
   combination of microscopic, spectroscopic, and modeling techniques. Our
   observations reveal that pseudomorphic mineral replacement (pMRR) is
   transport-controlled for this system and that convective fluid flows,
   caused by diffusioosmosis, play a key role in the ion transport process
   across the reaction-induced pores in the product phase. Our findings
   have important implications for understanding mineral transformations in
   natural environments and suggest that replacement could be exploited in
   commercial and laboratory applications.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of polymer conjugation on the interactions between proteins
   in solution is evaluated by systematic analysis of the second virial
   coefficient (A(2)) for the particular example of single- and
   double-PEGylated bovine serum albumin (PEG-BSA) in dilute PBS solution.
   The effect of PEGylation on A(2) is found to sensitively depend on both
   the composition and the distribution of PEG segments within the
   conjugate. Most importantly, at a given PEG volume fraction, A(2)
   significantly increases with the degree of polymerization of tethered
   chains. Hence, a lesser number of long chains is more effective in
   solubilizing BSA than a correspondingly larger number of short chains.
   Analysis of the hydrodynamic radii of protein-PEG conjugates suggests
   that the increased solubility is concurrent with a structural transition
   in the case of high molecular PEG grafts that results in compact
   core-shell-type structures. The results reveal a link between the
   composition, structure, and solubility of polymer conjugates that might
   benefit the understanding of their biochemical characteristics and their
   design for functional material applications.}},

Abstract = {{The controlled organization of nanoparticle (NP) constituents into
   superstructures of well-defined shape, composition, and connectivity
   represents a continuing challenge in the development of novel hybrid
   materials for many technological applications. We show that the phase
   separation of polymer tethered nanoparticles immersed in a matrix of a
   chemically different polymer provides an effective and scalable method
   for fabricating well-defined submicron-sized amorphous NP domains in
   melt polymer thin films. We investigate this phenomenon with a view
   toward a better understanding and control of the phase separation
   process in these novel ``blends{''}. In particular, we consider
   isothermally annealed thin films of polystyrene-grafted gold
   nanoparticles (AuPS) dispersed in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
   matrix. A morphology transition from discrete AuPS domains to
   bicontinuous to inverse domain structure is observed with increasing
   nanoparticle loading, consistent with composition dependence of classic
   binary polymer blends phase separation. However, the phase separation
   kinetics of the NP polymer blends exhibit unique features compared to
   the parent PS/PMMA homopolyiner blends. We further illustrate how to
   manipulate the AuPS nanoparticle domain shape, size, and location
   through the imposition of an external symmetry-breaking perturbation.
   Specifically, topographically patterned elastomer confinement is
   introduced to direct the nanoparticles into long-range ordered
   submicron-sized domains having a dense and well-dispersed distribution
   of noncrystallizing nanoparticles. The simplicity, versatility, and
   roll-to-roll adaptability of this novel method for controlled
   nanoparticle assembly should make it useful in creating desirable
   patterned nanoparticle domains for a variety of functional materials and
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning coefficients of organic compounds between water and
   supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) are necessary to assess the risk of migration
   of these chemicals from subsurface CO2 storage sites. Despite the large
   number of potential organic contaminants, the current data set of
   published water sc-CO2 partitioning coefficients is very limited. Here,
   the partitioning coefficients of thiophene, pyrrole, and anisole were
   measured in situ over a range of temperatures and pressures using a
   novel pressurized batch-reactor system with dual spectroscopic
   detectors: a near-infrared spectrometer for measuring the organic
   analyte in the CO2 phase and a UV detector for quantifying the analyte
   in the aqueous phase. Our measured partitioning coefficients followed
   expected trends based on volatility and aqueous solubility. The
   partitioning coefficients and literature data were then used to update a
   published poly parameter linear free-energy relationship and to develop
   five new linear free-energy relationships for predicting water sc-CO2
   partitioning coefficients. A total of four of the models targeted a
   single class of organic compounds. Unlike models that utilize Abraham
   solvation parameters, the new relationships use vapor pressure and
   aqueous solubility of the organic compound at 25 degrees C and CO2
   density to predict partitioning coefficients over a range of temperature
   and pressure conditions. The compound class models provide better
   estimates of partitioning behavior for compounds in that class than does
   the model built for the entire data set.}},

Abstract = {{Downstream processing of biofuels and bio-based chemicals represents a
   challenging problem for process synthesis and optimization, due to the
   intrinsic nonideal thermodynamics of the liquid mixtures derived from
   the (bio) chemical conversion of biomass. In this work, we propose a new
   interface between the process simulator PRO/II (SimSci,
   Schneider-Electric) and the optimization environment of GAMS for the
   structural and parameter optimization of this type of flowsheets with
   rigorous and detailed models. The optimization problem is formulated
   within the Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) framework and the
   solution of the reformulated MINLP problem is approached with a
   decomposition strategy based on the Outer-Approximation algorithm, where
   NLP subproblems are solved with the derivative free optimizer belonging
   to the BzzMath library, and MILP master problems are solved with
   CPLEX/GAMS. Several validation examples are proposed spanning from the
   economic optimization of two different distillation columns, the
   dewatering task of diluted bio-mixtures, up to the distillation
   sequencing with simultaneous mixed-integer design of each distillation
   column for a quaternary mixture in the presence of azeotropes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The influence of particle adsorption on liquid/liquid interfacial
   tension is not well understood, and much previous research has suggested
   conflicting behaviors. In this paper we investigate the surface activity
   and adsorption kinetics of charge stabilized and pH-responsive polymer
   stabilized colloids at oil/water interfaces using two tensiometry
   techniques: (i) pendant drop and (ii) microtensiometer. We found, using
   both techniques, that charge stabilized particles had little or no
   influence on the (dynamic) interfacial tension, although dense silica
   particles affected the ``apparent{''} measured tension in the pendent
   drop, due to gravity driven elongation of the droplet profile.
   Nevertheless, this apparent change additionally allowed the study of
   adsorption kinetics, which was related qualitatively between particle
   systems by estimated diffusion coefficients. Significant and real
   interfacial tension responses were measured using similar to 53 nm
   core-shell latex particles with a pH-responsive polymer stabilizer of
   poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)
   (pMMA-b-pDMAEMA) diblock copolymer. At pH 2, where the polymer is
   strongly charged, behavior was similar to that of the bare
   charge-stabilized particles, showing little change in the interfacial
   tension. At pH 10, where the polymer is discharged and poorly soluble in
   water, a significant decrease in the measured interfacial tension
   commensurate with strong adsorption at the oil water interface was seen,
   which was similar in magnitude to the surface activity of the free
   polymer. These results were both confirmed through droplet profile and
   microtensiometry experiments. Dilational elasticity measurements were
   also performed by oscillation of the droplet; again, changes in
   interfacial tension with droplet oscillation were only seen with the
   responsive particles at pH 10. Frequency sweeps were performed to
   ascertain the dilational elasticity modulus, with measured values being
   significantly higher than previously reported for nanoparticle and
   surfactant systems, and similar in magnitude to protein stabilized
   droplets.}},

   Integration of two-degree-of-freedom MEMS actuators with two-dimensional
   nanoprobe arrays as well as preliminary results for simultaneous
   generation of multiple submicrometer patterns using such devices is
   reported. Electrical cross talk between the fully silicon fabricated
   actuators along X-and Y-axes has been eliminated by optimizing the
   design. Scratchmarks as narrow as 250 nm and as long as 42 mu m have
   been generated on a thin photoresist layer, which was spin-coated on a
   silicon substrate using the electrothermal MEMS structure carrying up to
   25 nanotips. Furthermore, the submicrometer patterns have been
   successfully transferred to the underlying silicon substrate via
   reactive ion etching. Patterns as narrow as 250 nm (similar to 60 nm in

   substrates made of SiOx, SiNx and TiNx. The templates have a depth of
   similar to 10 nm and a pitch of similar to 20 nm with 18 nm wide holes.
   FePt is sputtered on the nanohole arrays, then back-etched, leaving a
   highly ordered array of FePt nanodots behind. To promote phase
   transformation to the L1(0) phase, the samples are annealed at
   temperatures of 550-650 degrees C. During annealing, the FePt strongly
   dewets SiOx and SiNx substrates, causing sintering and coalescence of
   the FePt nanodots, but the nanodots remain highly ordered on the TiNx
   substrate. The nanodot arrays on TiNx are characterized magnetically
   before and after annealing. The out-of-plane coercivity increases by
   similar to 1 kOe, suggesting partial transformation to the L1(0) phase.
   We also show that a capping layer can be sputtered on top of the nanodot
   arrays prior to annealing to prevent dewetting. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoelectric(ME) coupling characteristics in multiferroic
   heterostructures with different thickness of nanocrystalline soft
   magnetic alloy has been investigated at low frequency. The ME response
   with obvious hysteresis, self-biased and dual-peak phenomenon is
   observed for multiferroic heterostructures, which results from strong
   magnetic interactions between two ferromagnetic materials with different
   magnetic properties, magnetostrictions and optimum bias magnetic fields
   H-dc,H-opti. The proposed multiferroic heterostructures not only enhance
   ME coupling significantly, but also broaden dc magnetic bias operating
   range and overcomes the limitations of narrow bias range. By optimizing
   the thickness of nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloy T-f, a
   significantly zero-biased ME voltage coefficient(MEVC) of 14.8mV/Oe (185
   mV/cm.Oe) at T-f = 0.09 mm can be obtained, which is about 10.8 times as
   large as that of traditional PZT/Terfenol-D composite with a weak ME
   coupling at zero bias H-dc,H-zero. Furthermore, when T-f increases from
   0.03 mm to 0.18 mm, the maximum MEVC increases nearly linearly with the
   increased T-f at H-dc,H-opti. Additionally, the experimental results
   demonstrate the ME response for multiferroic heterostructures spreads
   over a wide magnetic dc bias operating range. The excellent ME
   performance provides a promising and practicable application for both
   highly sensitive magnetic field sensors without bias and ME energy
   harvesters. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content, except where

Abstract = {{In this study, we analyze the stability of two-phase flow regimes and
   their transitions using chaotic and fractal statistics, and we report
   new measurements of dynamic two-phase pressure drop hysteresis that is
   related to flow regime stability and channel water content. Two-phase
   flow dynamics are relevant to a variety of real-world systems, and
   quantifying transient two-phase flow phenomena is important for
   efficient design. We recorded two-phase (air and water) pressure drops
   and flow images in a microchannel under both steady and transient
   conditions. Using Lyapunov exponents and Hurst exponents to characterize
   the steady-state pressure fluctuations, we develop a new, measurable
   regime identification criteria based on the dynamic stability of the
   two-phase pressure signal. We also applied a new experimental technique
   by continuously cycling the air flow rate to study dynamic hysteresis in
   two-phase pressure drops, which is separate from steady-state hysteresis
   and can be used to understand two-phase flow development time scales.
   Using recorded images of the two-phase flow, we show that the capacitive
   dynamic hysteresis is related to channel water content and flow regime
   stability. The mixed-wettability microchannel and in-channel water
   introduction used in this study simulate a polymer electrolyte fuel cell
   cathode air flow channel. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Complex chemical systems, such as living biological matter, are highly
   organized structures based on discrete molecules in constant dynamic
   interactions. These natural materials can evolve and adapt to their
   environment. By contrast, man-made materials exhibit simpler properties.
   In this Review, we highlight that most of the necessary elements for the
   development of more complex synthetic matter are available today. Using
   modern strategies, such as controlled radical polymerizations,
   supramolecular polymerizations or stepwise synthesis, polymers with
   precisely controlled molecular structures can be synthesized. Moreover,
   such tailored polymers can be folded or self-assembled into defined
   nanoscale morphologies. These self-organized macromolecular objects can
   be at thermal equilibrium or can be driven out of equilibrium. Recently,
   in the latter case, interesting dynamic materials have been developed.
   However, this is just a start, and more complex adaptive materials are
   anticipated.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional chemo-immunotherapy fails to cure the majority of mantle
   cell lymphoma patients and causes substantial toxicity. Resistant mantle
   cell lymphoma cells commonly overexpress and are dependent on the
   anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, for survival. In this study, we use
   potent lipidoid nanoparticles to deliver siRNA to silence Mcl-1
   expression. Studies were conducted using two different mantle cell
   lymphoma cell lines, a normal (JeKo-1) and an aggressive (MAVER-1) line,
   to assess the ability of lipidoid nanoparticles to be used broadly in
   the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. Mcl-1 mRNA silencing and protein
   knockdown was observed as early as one day after treatment and the
   lipidoid nanoparticles achieved sustained silencing of Mcl-1 mRNA for at
   least four days in both JeKo-1 and MAVER-1 cells. Eighty percent
   silencing was achieved at three days post-transfection in JeKo-1 cells
   while 50\% silencing was achieved in MAVER-1 cells, which are more
   resistant to transfection. Interestingly, silencing of Mcl-1 induced
   apoptosis in nearly 30\% of both JeKo-1 and MAVER-1 cells three days
   post-transfection. Additionally, Mcl-1 silencing and the resultant
   apoptosis in mantle cell lymphoma cells were dose dependent. These data
   suggest that lipidoid nanoparticles siRNA therapy targeting Mcl-1 has
   potential as a new treatment modality for mantle cell lymphoma and many
   other cancers that overexpress Mcl-1. The combination of anti-Mcl-1
   lipidoid nanoparticles with other forms of targeted therapy offers hope
   for reducing or replacing cytotoxic chemotherapy as standard treatment
   for mantle cell lymphoma.}},

Abstract = {{In this work lipid ordering phase changes arising in planar membrane
   bilayers is investigated both accounting for elasticity alone and for
   effective viscoelastic response of such assemblies. The mechanical
   response of such membranes is studied by minimizing the Gibbs free
   energy which penalizes perturbations of the changes of areal stretch and
   their gradients only (Deseri and Zurlo, 2013). As material instabilities
   arise whenever areal stretches characterizing homogeneous configurations
   lie inside the spinoidal zone of the free energy density, bifurcations
   from such configurations are shown to occur as oscillatory perturbations
   of the in-plane displacement. Experimental observations (Espinosa et
   al., 2011) show a power-law in-plane viscous behavior of lipid
   structures allowing for an effective viscoelastic behavior of lipid
   membranes, which falls in the framework of Fractional Hereditariness. A
   suitable generalization of the variational principle invoked for the
   elasticity is applied in this case, and the corresponding Euler Lagrange
   equation is found together with a set of boundary and initial
   conditions. Separation of variables allows for showing how Fractional
   Hereditariness owes bifurcated modes with a larger number of spatial
   oscillations than the corresponding elastic analog. Indeed, the
   available range of areal stresses for material instabilities is found to
   increase with respect to the purely elastic case. Nevertheless, the time
   evolution of the perturbations solving the Euler-Lagrange equation above
   exhibits time-decay and the large number of spatial oscillation slowly
   relaxes, thereby keeping the features of a long-tail type time-response.

Abstract = {{This work investigates the origin of creep dislocations in a Ni-base,
   single crystal superalloy subject to creep at an intermediate stress and
   temperature. Employing high angular resolution electron backscatter
   diffraction (HR-EBSD), electron channeling contrast imaging under
   controlled diffraction conditions (cECCI) and discrete dislocation
   dynamics (DDD) modelling, it is shown that low-angle boundaries-which
   correspond to dendrite boundaries or their residues after annealing are
   not the major sources of creep dislocations. At the onset of creep
   deformation, they are the only active sources. Creep dislocations are
   emitted from them and percolate into the dislocation-depleted crystal.
   However, the percolation is very slow. As creep deformation proceeds,
   before the boundary-originated dislocations move further than a few
   micrometers away from their source boundary, individual dislocations
   that are spread throughout the undeformed microstructure become active
   and emit avalanches of creep dislocations in boundary-free regions, i.e.
   regions farther than a few micrometer away from boundaries. Upon their
   activation, the density of creep dislocations in boundary-free regions
   soars by two orders of magnitude; and the entire microstructure becomes
   deluged with creep dislocations. The total area of boundary-free regions
   is several times the total area of regions covered by
   boundary-originated creep dislocations. Therefore, the main sources of
   creep dislocations are not low-angle boundaries but individual, isolated
   dislocations in boundary-free regions. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The subcomponents of the human superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)
   are disputed. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   segments, connectivity and asymmetry of the SLF. We performed high
   angular diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) analysis on ten healthy adults.
   We also conducted fiber tracking on a 30-subject DSI template (CMU-30)
   and 488-subject template from the Human Connectome Project (HCP-488). In
   addition, five normal brains obtained at autopsy were microdissected.
   Based on tractography and microdissection results, we show that the
   human SLF differs significantly from that of monkey. The fibers
   corresponding to SLF-I found in 6 out of 20 hemispheres proved to be
   part of the cingulum fiber system in all cases and confirmed on both DSI
   and HCP-488 template. The most common patterns of connectivity
   bilaterally were as follows: from angular gyrus to caudal middle frontal
   gyrus and dorsal precentral gyrus representing SLF-II (or dorsal SLF),
   and from supramarginal gyrus to ventral precentral gyrus and pars
   opercularis to form SLF-III (or ventral SLF). Some connectivity features
   were, however, clearly asymmetric. Thus, we identified a strong
   asymmetry of the dorsal SLF (SLF-II), where the connectivity between the
   supramarginal gyrus with the dorsal precentral gyrus and the caudal
   middle frontal gyrus was only present in the left hemisphere.
   Contrarily, the ventral SLF (SLF-III) showed fairly constant
   connectivity with pars triangularis only in the right hemisphere. The
   results provide a novel neuroanatomy of the SLF that may help to better
   understand its functional role in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-assessment models indicate that stream ecosystems receiving
   municipal wastewater effluent may have the greatest potential for
   exposure to manufactured nanoparticles. The authors determined the fate
   of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles in outdoor stream mesocosms using
   1) 1-time pulse addition of CeO2 nanoparticles, representative of
   accidental release, and 2) continuous, low-level press addition of CeO2
   nanoparticles, representative of exposure via wastewater effluent. The
   pulse addition led to rapid nanoparticle floc formation, which appeared
   to preferentially deposit on periphyton in low-energy areas downstream
   from the location of the input, likely as a result of gravitational
   sedimentation. Floc formation limited the concentration of suspended
   nanoparticles in stream water to < 5\% of target and subsequent
   downstream movement. In contrast, press addition of nanoparticles led to
   higher suspended nanoparticle concentrations (77\% of target) in stream
   water, possibly as a result of stabilization of suspended nanoparticles
   through interaction with dissolved organic carbon. Smaller nanoparticle
   aggregates appeared to preferentially adsorb to stream surfaces in
   turbulent sections, where Ce concentrations were highest in the press,
   likely a result of stochastic encounter with the surface. Streams
   receiving wastewater effluent containing nanoparticles may lead to
   exposure of aquatic organisms over a greater spatial extent than a
   similar amount of nanoparticles from an accidental release. Exposure
   models must take into account these mechanisms controlling transport and
   depositional processes. (C) 2015 SETAC}},

Abstract = {{We describe a cross-decomposition algorithm that combines Benders and
   scenario-based Lagrangean decomposition for two-stage stochastic
   programming investment planning problems with complete recourse, where
   the first-stage variables are mixed-integer and the second-stage
   variables are continuous. The algorithm is a novel cross-decomposition
   scheme and fully integrates primal and dual information in terms of
   primal-dual multi-cuts added to the Benders and the Lagrangean master
   problems for each scenario. The potential benefits of the
   cross-decomposition scheme are demonstrated with numerical experiments
   on a number of instances of a facility location problem under
   disruptions. In the original formulation, where the underlying LP
   relaxation is weak, the cross-decomposition method outperforms multi-cut
   Benders decomposition. If the formulation is improved with the addition
   of tightening constraints, the performance of both decomposition methods
   improves but cross-decomposition clearly remains the best method for
   large-scale problems.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in parameters such as processing times, yields, and
   availability of materials and utilities can have a detrimental effect in
   the optimality and/or feasibility of an otherwise ``optimal{''}

   adjustable robust optimization approach to alleviate the risk from such
   operational uncertainties during scheduling decisions. We derive a novel
   robust counterpart of a deterministic scheduling model, and we show how
   to obey the observability and non-anticipativity restrictions that are
   necessary for the resulting solution policy to be implementable in
   practice. We also develop decision-dependent uncertainty sets to model
   the endogenous uncertainty that is inherently present in process
   scheduling applications. A computational study reveals that, given a
   chosen level of robustness, adjusting decisions to past parameter
   realizations leads to significant improvements, both in terms of
   worst-case objective as well as objective in expectation, compared to
   the traditional robust scheduling approaches. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{We demonstrate four-terminal GeTe-based RF switches with independent
   thermal actuation (switching). These devices incorporate an AlN-based
   dielectric separating high-conductivity W micro-heaters from the RF

   barrier decreases the switch parasitic capacitance with minimal
   increases in the switching power. Decoupling these design variables,
   with the high thermal conductivity of the AlN, makes it possible to
   increase the electrical separation with a thicker AlN film for lower
   parasitic capacitance with minimal decrease in desirable thermal
   coupling. Increasing the AlN thickness from 105 to 170 nm results in
   switches with an improvement in cutoff frequency, f(CO) from 5.3 to 8
   THz, a C-OFF improvement from 15 to 10 fF, while maintaining the R-ON at
   2 Omega. This improvement was accompanied by normalized minimum power to

Abstract = {{The expected increase in the penetration of renewables in the
   approaching decade urges the electricity market to introduce new
   products-in particular, flexible ramping products-to accommodate the
   renewables' variability and intermittency. A risk-limiting economic
   dispatch scheme provides the means to optimize the dispatch and
   provision of these products. In this paper, we adopt the extended
   loss-of-load probability as the definition of risk. We first assess how
   the new products distort the optimal economic dispatch by comparing to
   the case without such products. Specifically, using parametric analysis,
   we establish the relationship between the minimal generation cost and
   the two key parameters of the new products: the up-and down-flexible
   ramping requirements. Such relationship yields a novel routine to
   efficiently solve the non-convex risk-limiting economic dispatch
   problem. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results suggest that
   our approach may substantially reduce the cost for incorporating the new
   products. We believe our approach can assist the ISOs with utilizing the
   ramping capacities in the system at the minimal cost.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed optimization techniques in electric power systems have drawn
   increased attention as they provide a scalable way to handle the
   increasingly complex and large-scale optimization problems associated
   with the optimal operation of the system. However, little effort has
   been reported on how to optimally partition the overall optimization
   problem into subproblems, which significantly affects the efficiency and
   convergence speed of distributed methods. To address this issue, this
   paper focuses on how to determine the optimal partition for a given
   system and optimization problem, and quantify the improvement obtained
   with the optimal partition in terms of number of iterations and
   convergence time for solving the ac optimal power flow problem. The
   proposed approach is based on spectral clustering using a combination of
   the Hessian matrix of the optimization problem and the admittance matrix
   as the affinity matrix. Simulation results for the IEEE test systems
   with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed partitioning method, and the robustness of the performance of a
   certain partition with respect to the operating point of the system.}},

Abstract = {{In smart grid, customers have access to the electricity consumption and
   the price data via smart meters; thus, they are able to participate in
   the demand response (DR) programs. In this paper, we address the
   interaction among multiple utility companies and multiple customers in
   smart grid by modeling the DR problem as two noncooperative games: the
   supplier and customer side games. In the first game, supply function
   bidding mechanism is employed to model the utility companies' profit
   maximization problem. In the proposed mechanism, the utility companies
   submit their bids to the data center, where the electricity price is
   computed and is sent to the customers. In the second game, the price
   anticipating customers determine optimal shiftable load profile to
   maximize their daily payoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash
   equilibrium in the mentioned games are studied and a computationally
   tractable distributed algorithm is designed to determine the
   equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of
   the proposed DR method in increasing the utility companies' profit and
   customers' payoff, as well as in reducing the peak-to-average ratio in
   the aggregate load demand. Finally, the algorithm performance is
   compared with a DR method in the literature to demonstrate the
   similarities and differences.}},

Abstract = {{Dams are continuing to age and deteriorate that affect the service life
   of the dams in the U.S. Risk assessment is required to understand the
   behavior of dams and to prioritize the remedial actions and maintenance,
   and yet it is quite challenging to do risk assessment since it requires
   extensive current and historical data from in situ instrumentation on
   dams and detailed design, construction, and operation information.
   Currently, the required data for risk assessment resides in various
   paper-based and digital documents that hinder the capabilities of risk
   assessors to gather, analyze, and visualize the data flexibly from
   various engineering perspectives such as geotechnical, hydrologic,
   geologic, and structural. As a result, getting a holistic view of a
   dam's current condition and its behavior over time becomes a time and
   resource intensive task. There is a need for an integrated shared
   knowledge repository for dams to streamline the risk assessment process.
   The research described in this paper provides requirements for
   developing such a shared knowledge repository for risk assessment of
   embankment dams that would support the information needs of various
   engineering domains and the means and methods for integrated assessment,
   visualization, and data analytics to understand the risk of internal
   erosion. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{HVAC mechanics need to know various information items about a facility
   and its building systems to troubleshoot HVAC-related problems. Whether
   HVAC mechanics can comprehend the situation and pinpoint the problem
   source in an efficient way is affected by how the required information
   is provided to them. This research study builds on the hypothesis that
   the visualization of the required information for HVAC mechanics can
   improve the time efficiency of the decision making for the
   troubleshooting process, and there is research needed to understand how
   much time efficiency can be achieved by visualization. Hence, this study
   utilizes a user-centered and iterative process to design and implement a
   visualization platform to support troubleshooting of HVAC-related
   problems. The final visualization platform is evaluated through user
   studies with quantitative metrics. The findings show that using the
   developed platform HVAC mechanics could save more than 50\% of the time
   to identify the cause for a reported HVAC-related problem. The research
   findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the area of
   information visualization support for facilities management (FM)
   activities, and can be beneficial for computer-aided FM solution vendors
   to consider when designing user interfaces for HVAC maintenance tasks.

Abstract = {{By assembling in a protein lattice on the host's plasma membrane, the
   retroviral Gag polyprotein triggers formation of the viral
   protein/membrane shell. The MA domain of Gag employs multiple
   signals-electrostatic, hydrophobic, and lipid-specific-to bring the
   protein to the plasma membrane, thereby complementing protein-protein
   interactions, located in full-length Gag, in lattice formation. We
   report the interaction of myristoylated and unmyristoylated HIV-1 Gag MA
   domains with bilayers composed of purified lipid components to dissect
   these complex membrane signals and quantify their contributions to the
   overall interaction. Surface plasmon resonance on well-defined planar
   membrane models is used to quantify binding affinities and amounts of
   protein and yields free binding energy contributions, Delta G, of the
   various signals. Charge-charge interactions in the absence of the
   phosphatidylinositide PI(4,5)P-2 attract the protein to acidic membrane
   surfaces, and myristoylation increases the affinity by a factor of 10;
   thus, our data do not provide evidence for a PI(4,5)P-2 trigger of
   myristate exposure. Lipid-specific interactions with PI(4,5)P-2, the
   major signal lipid in the inner plasma membrane, increase membrane
   attraction at a level similar to that of protein lipidation. While
   cholesterol does not directly engage in interactions, it augments
   protein affinity strongly by facilitating efficient myristate insertion
   and PI(4,5)P-2 binding. We thus observe that the isolated MA protein, in
   the absence of protein-protein interaction conferred by the full-length
   Gag, binds the membrane with submicromolar affinities.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-core systems, main memory is a major shared resource among
   processor cores. A task running on one core can be delayed by other
   tasks running simultaneously on other cores due to interference in the
   shared main memory system. Such memory interference delay can be large
   and highly variable, thereby posing a significant challenge for the
   design of predictable real-time systems. In this paper, we present
   techniques to reduce this interference and provide an upper bound on the
   worst-case interference on a multi-core platform that uses a
   commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM system. We explicitly model the
   major resources in the DRAM system, including banks, buses, and the
   memory controller. By considering their timing characteristics, we
   analyze the worst-case memory interference delay imposed on a task by
   other tasks running in parallel. We find that memory interference can be
   significantly reduced by (i) partitioning DRAM banks, and (ii)
   co-locating memory-intensive tasks on the same processing core. Based on
   these observations, we develop a memory interference-aware task
   allocation algorithm for reducing memory interference. We evaluate our
   approach on a COTS-based multi-core platform running Linux/RK.
   Experimental results show that the predictions made by our approach are
   close to the measured worst-case interference under workloads with both
   high and low memory contention. In addition, our memory
   interference-aware task allocation algorithm provides a significant
   improvement in task schedulability over previous work, with as much as

Abstract = {{Rollover crash is one of the major types of traffic crashes that induce
   fatal injuries. It is important to investigate the factors that affect
   rollover crashes and their influence on driver injury severity outcomes.
   This study employs support vector machine (SVM) models to investigate
   driver injury severity patterns in rollover crashes based on two-year
   crash data gathered in New Mexico. The impacts of various explanatory
   variables are examined in terms of crash and environmental information,
   vehicle features, and driver demographics and behavior characteristics.
   A classification and regression tree (CART) model is utilized to
   identify significant variables and SVM models with polynomial and
   Gaussian radius basis function (RBF) kernels are used for model
   performance evaluation. It is shown that the SVM models produce
   reasonable prediction performance and the polynomial kernel outperforms
   the Gaussian RBF kernel. Variable impact analysis reveals that factors
   including comfortable driving environment conditions, driver alcohol or
   drug involvement, seatbelt use, number of travel lanes, driver
   demographic features, maximum vehicle damages in crashes, crash time,
   and crash location are significantly associated with driver
   incapacitating injuries and fatalities. These findings provide insights
   for better understanding rollover crash causes and the impacts of
   various explanatory factors on driver injury severity patterns. (C) 2016

Title = {{Improving self-adaptation planning through software architecture-based
   stochastic modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{42-60}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The ever-growing complexity of software systems makes it increasingly
   challenging to foresee at design time all interactions between a system
   and its environment.
   Most self-adaptive systems trigger adaptations through operators that
   are statically configured for specific environment and system
   conditions. However, in the occurrence of uncertain conditions,
   self-adaptive decisions may not be effective and might lead to a
   disruption of the desired non-functional attributes.
   To address this, we propose an approach that improves the planning stage
   by predicting the outcome of each strategy. In detail, we automatically
   derive a stochastic model from a formal architecture description of the
   managed system with the changes imposed by each strategy. Such
   information is used to optimize the self-adaptation decisions to fulfill
   the desired quality goals.
   uTo assess the effectiveness of our approach we apply it to a
   cloud-based news system and predicted the reliability for each possible
   adaptation strategy. The results obtained from our approach are compared
   to a representative static planning algorithm as well as to an oracle
   that always makes the ideal decision. Experiments show that our method
   improves both availability and cost when compared to the static planning
   algorithm, while being close to the oracle.
   Our approach may therefore be used to optimize self-adaptation planning.

Abstract = {{The impedance of dodecane doped with sorbitan trioleate (Span 85),
   sorbitan monooleate (Span 80) and sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20) was
   measured as a function of frequency using a 10 mV amplitude sinusoidal
   voltage applied across a parallel plate cell with a 10 mu m spacing. The
   tested solutions varied in concentration from 1 mM to 100 mM and the
   frequency range was 10(-2)-10(4) Hz. Nyquist plots of all three
   surfactants showed the high frequency semicircle characteristic of
   parallel resistance and capacitance but often exhibited a second
   semicircle at low frequencies which was attributed to charge adsorption
   and desorption. The electrical conductivity of each surfactant was
   proportional to surfactant concentration for concentrations above 10 mM.
   Fitting the data to models for charge migration, differential
   capacitance, and adsorption allowed extraction of both charge
   concentration and two kinetic parameters that characterize the rate of
   adsorption and desorption. Above 10 mM the ratio of charge carriers per
   surfactant molecule was 22 ppm for Span 20, 3 ppm for Span 80, and 0.2
   ppm for Span 85. A higher number of charge carriers per molecule of
   surfactant was associated with larger micelles. The adsorption rate
   constants were independent of surfactant concentration while the
   desorption rate constants were proportional to the surfactant
   concentration. This dependence indicated that uncharged surfactant,
   whether in micelles or not, participated in the desorption of charge.
   Predictions of the adsorption/desorption model for large constant
   electric fields agreed qualitatively with data from the literature
   (Karvar et al., 2014). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{2569-2582}},

Abstract = {{COSMO-RS (conductor-like screening model for real solvents) and three
   different group-contribution methods were used to compute saturation
   (subcooled) liquid vapor pressures for 16 possible products of
   ozone-initiated alpha-pinene autoxidation, with elemental compositions
   C10H16O4-10 and C20H30O10-12. The saturation vapor pressures predicted
   by the different methods varied widely. COSMO-RS predicted relatively
   high saturation vapor pressures values in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-10)
   bar for the C10H16O4-10 ``monomers{''}, and 10(-11) to 10(-16) bar for
   the C20H30O10-12 ``dimers{''}. The group-contribution methods predicted
   significantly (up to 8 order of magnitude) lower saturation vapor
   pressures for most of the more highly oxidized monomers. For the
   differs, the COSMO-RS predictions were within the (wide) range spanned
   by the three group-contribution methods. The main reason for the
   discrepancies between the methods is likely that the group-contribution
   methods do not contain the necessary parameters to accurately treat
   autoxidation products containing multiple hydroperoxide, peroxy acid or
   peroxide functional groups, which form intramolecular hydrogen bonds
   with each other. While the COSMO-RS saturation vapor pressures for these
   systems may be overestimated, the results strongly indicate that despite
   their high O:C ratios, the volatilities of the autoxidation products of
   alpha-pinene (and possibly other atmospherically relevant alkenes) are
   not necessarily extremely low. In other words, while autoxidation
   products are able to, adsorb onto aerosol particles, their evaporation
   back into the gas phase cannot be assumed to be negligible, especially
   from the smallest nanometer-scale particles. Their observed effective
   contribution to aerosol particle growth may therefore involve rapid
   heterogeneous reactions (reactive uptake) rather than effectively
   irreversible physical absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Eumelanins are extended heterogeneous biopolymers composed of molecular
   subunits with ambiguous macromolecular topology. Here, an
   electrochemical fingerprinting technique is described, which suggests
   that natural eumelanin pigments contain indole-based tetramers that are
   arranged into porphyrin-like domains. Spectroscopy and density
   functional theory calculations suggest that sodium ions undergo
   occupancy-dependent stepwise insertion into the core of porphyrin-like
   tetramers in natural eumelanins at discrete potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA) ATRP is an efficient
   way to diminish the amount of Cu catalyst. A kinetic study of radical
   generation and termination in SARA ATRP was conducted to better
   understand and improve the ``livingness{''} of the process. Monomer
   conversions and Cu-II/L concentrations were concurrently determined by
   UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy during polymerization of methyl acrylate in
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or in acetonitrile (MeCN) with
   tris{[}2(dimethylamino)ethyl] amine (Me6TREN) or
   tris(2-pyridylmethypamine (TPMA) as ligands. The polymerization was well
   controlled in DMSO with either Me6TREN or TPMA and in MeCN with Me6TREN.
   However, when TPMA was used in MeCN, the rate of polymerization and the
   generation of Cu-II/L accelerated exponentially even using small surface
   area of Cu-0, rendering control over polymerization under such
   conditions difficult, plausibly due to excessive comproportionation. The
   study revealed that the rates of both activation of (macro)alkyl halide
   by Cu-0 and Cu-0 catalyzed radical termination remained constant during
   polymerization in low viscosity systems, with no chain length
   dependence.}},

Title = {{Intermediate Volatility Organic Compound Emissions from On-Road Gasoline
   Vehicles and Small Off-Road Gasoline Engines}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4554-4563}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Dynamometer experiments were conducted to characterize the intermediate
   volatility organic compound (IVOC) emissions from a fleet of on road
   gasoline vehicles and small off-road gasoline engines. IVOCs were
   quantified through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of
   adsorbent samples collected from a constant volume sampler. The dominant
   fraction (>80\%, on average) of IVOCs could not be resolved on a
   molecular level. These unspeciated IVOCs were quantified as two chemical
   classes (unspeciated branched alkanes and cyclic compounds) in 11
   retention-time based bins. IVOC emission factors (mg kg-fuel(-1)) from
   on-road vehicles varied widely from vehicle to vehicle, but showed a
   general trend of lower emissions for newer vehicles that met more
   stringent emission standards. IVOC emission factors for 2-stroke
   off-road engines were substantially higher than 4-stroke off road
   engines and on-road vehicles. Despite large variations in the magnitude
   of emissions, the IVOC volatility distribution and chemical
   characteristics were consistent across all tests and IVOC emissions were
   strongly correlated with nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), primary
   organic aerosol and speciated IVOCs. Although IVOC emissions only
   correspond to approximately 4\% of NMHC emissions from on-road vehicles
   over the cold-start unified cycle, they are estimated to produce as much
   or more SOA than single-ring aromatics. Our results clearly demonstrate
   that IVOCs from gasoline engines are an important class of SOA
   precursors and provide observational constraints on IVOC emission
   factors and chemical composition to facilitate their inclusion into
   atmospheric chemistry models.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence microscopy is one of the most important tools in cell
   biology research because it provides spatial and temporal information to
   investigate regulatory systems inside cells. This technique can generate
   data in the form of signal intensities at thousands of positions
   resolved inside individual live cells. However, given extensive
   cell-to-cell variation, these data cannot be readily assembled into
   three-or four-dimensional maps of protein concentration that can be
   compared across different cells and conditions. We have developed a
   method to enable comparison of imaging data from many cells and applied
   it to investigate actin dynamics in T cell activation. Antigen
   recognition in T cells by the T cell receptor (TCR) is amplified by
   engagement of the costimulatory receptor CD28. We imaged actin and eight
   core actin regulators to generate over a thousand movies of T cells
   under conditions in which CD28 was either engaged or blocked in the
   context of a strong TCR signal. Our computational analysis showed that
   the primary effect of costimulation blockade was to decrease recruitment
   of the activator of actin nucleation WAVE2 (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
   protein family verprolin-homologous protein 2) and the actin-severing
   protein cofilin to F-actin. Reconstitution of WAVE2 and cofilin activity
   restored the defect in actin signaling dynamics caused by costimulation
   blockade. Thus, we have developed and validated an approach to quantify
   protein distributions in time and space for the analysis of complex
   regulatory systems.}},

Abstract = {{This work formulates a rough surface contact model that accounts for
   adhesion through a Morse potential and plasticity through the
   Kogut-Etsion finite element-based approximation. Compared to the
   commonly used Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, the Morse potential provides
   a more accurate and generalized description for modeling covalent
   materials and surface interactions. An extension of this contact model
   to describe composite layered surfaces is presented and implemented to
   study a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) grown on a gold substrate placed
   in contact with a second gold substrate. Based on a comparison with
   prior experimental measurements of the thermal conductance of this SAM
   junction {[}Majumdar et al., Nano Lett. 15, 2985-2991 (2015)], the more
   general Morse potential-based contact model provides a better prediction
   of the percentage contact area than an equivalent LJ potential-based

Abstract = {{Noble metal nanoparticles are extensively used for sensitizing metal
   oxide chemical sensors through the catalytic spillover mechanism.
   However, due to earth-scarcity and high cost of noble metals, finding
   replacements presents a great economic benefit. Besides, high
   temperature and harsh environment sensor applications demand material
   stability under conditions approaching thermal and chemical stability
   limits of noble metals. In this study, we employed thermally stable
   perovskite-type La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSFO) nanoparticle surface decoration on
   Ga2O3 nanorod array gas sensors and discovered an order of magnitude
   enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide at 500 degrees C. The LSFO
   nanoparticle catalysts was of comparable performance to that achieved by
   Pt nanoparticles, with a much lower weight loading than Pt. Detailed
   electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies
   suggested the LSFO nanoparticle sensitization effect is attributed to a
   spillover-like effect associated with the gas-LSFO-Ga2O3 triple
   interfaces that spread the negatively charged surface oxygen ions from
   LSFO nanoparticles surfaces surfaces with faster surface CO oxidation
   reactions. over to beta-Ga2O3 nanorod surfaces with faster surface CO
   oxidation reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) depends on the
   rate constant of propagation (k(p)) and concentration of growing
   radicals. The latter is related to the ATRP equilibrium constant
   (K-ATRP) and concentrations of alkyl halides, activators, and
   deactivators. Activation of alkyl halides by Cu-I/L and deactivation of
   radicals by X-Cu-II/L are vital processes providing good control in
   ATRP. Rates of these reactions are typically identical throughout
   polymerization, since the ATRP equilibrium is maintained in essentially
   all ATRP systems. There are new ATRP processes carried out with ppm of
   Cu catalysts, such as activators regenerated by electron transfer
   (ARGET), initiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR),
   supplemental activators and reducing agents (SARA), and
   electrochemically or photochemically mediated ATRP (eATRP, photoATRP).
   In these processes, as in conventional radical polymerization (or in
   RAFT), concentration of radicals is established by balancing rates of
   radical generation (e.g., from thermal initiators, reduction rate or
   supplemental activation) and radical termination (i.e., reaching steady
   state). However, in these processes, the rate of activation of alkyl
   halides by Cu-I/L is still equal to the rate of deactivation of radicals
   by X-Cu-II/L. Can the rates of activation of alkyl halides (by Cu-I or
   by Cu-0) be directly related to the overall rate of ATRP? This report
   aims to clarify that rate of activation of alkyl halides by Cu species
   cannot be directly related to the overall rate of polymerization. There
   are many cases with the same rate of ATRP but dramatically different
   rates of activation and cases with similar activation rates but very
   different overall ATRP rates. Thus, both the analytical approach and
   PREDICI simulations clearly show that rates of normal ATRP with high
   catalyst loadings as well as rates of low ppm ATRP systems, such as ICAR
   ATRP and SARA ATRP, cannot be directly related with rates of activation
   of alkyl halides by Cu-I. In SARA ATRP, the activation of alkyl halides
   by Cu-I is always much faster than by Cu.}},

Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{In a collinear antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy, symmetry
   dictates that the spin wave modes must be doubly degenerate. Theses two
   modes, distinguished by their opposite polarization and available only
   in antiferromagnets, give rise to a novel degree of freedom to encode
   and process information. We show that the spin wave polarization can be
   manipulated by an electric field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
   interaction and magnetic anisotropy. We propose a prototype spin wave
   field-effect transistor which realizes a gate-tunable magnonic analog of
   the Faraday effect, and demonstrate its application in THz signal
   modulation. Our findings open up the exciting possibility of digital
   data processing utilizing antiferromagnetic spin waves and enable the
   direct projection of optical computing concepts onto the mesoscopic

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{13-35}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{The multiperiod blending problem involves binary variables and bilinear
   terms, yielding a nonconvex MINLP. In this work we present two major
   contributions for the global solution of the problem. The first one is
   an alternative formulation of the problem. This formulation makes use of
   redundant constraints that improve the MILP relaxation of the MINLP. The
   second contribution is an algorithm that decomposes the MINLP model into
   two levels. The first level, or master problem, is an MILP relaxation of
   the original MINLP. The second level, or subproblem, is a smaller MINLP
   in which some of the binary variables of the original problem are fixed.
   The results show that the new formulation can be solved faster than
   alternative models, and that the decomposition method can solve the
   problems faster than state of the art general purpose solvers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic Janus particles are currently receiving great attention as
   ``solid surfactants{''}. Previous studies have introduced such particles
   with a variety of shapes and functions, but there has so far been a
   strong emphasis on water-dispersible particles that mimic the molecular
   surfactants soluble in polar solvents; Here we present an example of
   lipophilic Janus particles which are selectively dispersible in very
   nonpolar solvents such as alkanes. Interfacial tension measurements
   between the alkane dispersions and pure water indicate that these
   particles do have interfacial activity, and like typical hydrophobic,
   nonionic surfactants, they do not partition to the aqueous bulk. We also
   show that the oil-borne particles, by retaining locally polar domains
   where charges can reside, generate electric conductivity in nonpolar
   liquids-another feature familiar from molecular surfactants and one
   commonly exploited to mitigate explosion hazards due to flow
   electrification during petroleum pumping and in the formulation of
   electronic inks.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) occurs as a myriad of species in environmental media, each
   with different physicochemical properties. The influence of Hg
   speciation on its transport in unsaturated soils is not well studied.
   Transport of four Hg species (dissolved inorganic Hg (II) species, a
   prepared Hg(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) complex, Hg(0), and
   HgS nanoparticles) was measured in sand and soil packed columns with
   partial water saturation under simulated rainfall (low ionic strength
   solution without DOM) and landfill leachate (high DOM content and high
   ionic strength) influent conditions. The Hg(II)-DOM species had the
   highest mobility among the four Hg species evaluated, and HgS particles
   (similar to 230 nm hydrodynamic diameter) had the poorest mobility, for
   all soil and influent conditions tested. The addition of 2 wt \% clay
   particles to sand greatly retarded the transport of all Hg species,
   especially under simulated rainfall. DOM in the column influent
   facilitated the transport of all four Hg species in model and natural
   soils. For simulated rainfall, the transport trends observed in model
   sands were consistent with those measured in a sandy soil, except that
   the mobility of dissolved inorganic Hg(II) species was significantly
   lower in natural soils. For simulated rainfall, Hg transport was
   negligible in a high organic content (similar to 3.72 wt \%) soil for
   all species except Hg-DOM. This work suggests that the Hg-DOM species
   presents the greatest potential for vertical migration to groundwater,
   especially with DOM in the influent solution.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced cooling systems can be deployed to enhance the resilience of
   thermoelectric power generation systems. This study developed and
   applied a new power plant modeling option for a hybrid cooling system at
   coal- or natural-gas-fired power plants with and without amine-based
   carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems. The results of the plant-level
   analyses show that the performance and cost of hybrid cooling systems
   are affected by a range of environmental, technical, and economic
   parameters. In general, when hot periods last the entire summer, the wet
   unit of a hybrid cooling system needs to share about 30\% of the total
   plant cooling load in order to minimize the overall system cost. CCS
   deployment can lead to a significant increase in the water use of hybrid
   cooling systems, depending on the level of CO2 capture. Compared to wet
   cooling systems, widespread applications of hybrid cooling systems can
   substantially reduce water use in the electric power sector with only a
   moderate increase in the plant-level cost of electricity generation.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-autonomous computing devices have the potential to extend the
   reach of computing to a scale beyond either wired or battery-powered
   systems. However, these devices pose a unique set of challenges to
   application developers who lack both hardware and software support
   tools. Energy harvesting devices experience power intermittence which
   causes the system to reset and power-cycle unpredictably, tens to
   hundreds of times per second. This can result in code execution errors
   that are not possible in continuously-powered systems and cannot be
   diagnosed with conventional debugging tools such as JTAG and/or
   oscilloscopes.
   We propose the Energy-interference-free Debugger, a hardware and
   software platform for monitoring and debugging intermittent systems
   without adversely effecting their energy state. The
   Energy-interference-free Debugger re-creates a familiar debugging
   environment for intermittent software and augments it with debugging
   primitives for effective diagnosis of intermittence bugs. Our evaluation
   of the Energy-interference-free Debugger quantifies its
   energy-interference-freedom and shows its value in a set of debugging
   tasks in complex test programs and several real applications, including
   RFID code and a machine-learning-based activity recognition system.}},

Abstract = {{After many decades of improvements in mechanical circulatory assist
   devices (CADs), blood damage remains a serious problem during support
   contributing to variety of adverse events, and consequently affecting
   patient survival and quality of life. The mechanisms of cumulative cell
   damage in continuous-flow blood pumps are still not fully understood
   despite numerous in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies of blood
   trauma. Previous investigations have almost exclusively focused on
   lethal blood damage, namely hemolysis, which is typically negligible
   during normal operation of current generation CADs. The measurement of
   plasma free hemoglobin (plfHb) concentration to characterize hemolysis
   is straightforward, however sublethal trauma is more difficult to detect
   and quantify since no simple direct test exists. Similarly, while
   multiple studies have focused on thrombosis within blood pumps and
   accessories, sublethal blood trauma and its sequelae have yet to be
   adequately documented or characterized. This review summarizes the
   current understanding of sublethal trauma to red blood cells (RBCs)
   produced by exposure of blood to flow parameters and conditions similar
   to those within CADs. It also suggests potential strategies to reduce
   and/or prevent RBC sublethal damage in a clinically-relevant context,
   and encourages new research into this relatively uncharted territory.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{53-58}},

Abstract = {{Sensorimotor control engages cognitive processes such as prediction,
   learning, and multisensory integration. Understanding the neural
   mechanisms underlying these cognitive processes with arm reaching is
   challenging because we currently record only a fraction of the relevant
   neurons, the arm has nonlinear dynamics, and multiple modalities of
   sensory feedback contribute to control. A brain-computer interface (BCI)
   is a well-defined sensorimotor loop with key simplifying advantages that
   address each of these challenges, while engaging similar cognitive
   processes. As a result, BCI is becoming recognized as a powerful tool
   for basic scientific studies of sensorimotor control. Here, we describe
   the benefits of BCI for basic scientific inquiries and review recent BCI
   studies that have uncovered new insights into the neural mechanisms
   underlying sensorimotor control.}},

Abstract = {{While most effective in aqueous environments, enzymes are also able to
   catalyze reactions in essentially anhydrous organic media. Enzyme
   activity in organic solvents is limited as a result of inefficient
   substrate binding, lack of solubility, and inactivation by hydrophilic
   anhydrous solvents. With these facts in mind, atom transfer radical
   polymerization was used to synthesize
   chymotrypsinpoly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (CT-pDMAEMA)
   conjugates designed to be soluble and active in acetonitrile. CT-pDMAEMA
   solubility in organic solvents and the rate of CT-pDMAEMA-catalyzed
   transesterification in acetonitrile were examined at a range of water
   (0-15 M) and propanol (0.01-5 M) concentrations. The conjugates were
   soluble at the molecular scale in several organic solvents, exhibited
   good substrate binding with N-acetyl L-phenylalanine thiophenylester
   (K-M as low as 17 mM), and had an activity (peak activity 330 mu
   M/min/mg enzyme) many orders of magnitude higher than that of the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{We compare life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from several
   light-duty passenger gasoline and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)
   across US counties by accounting for regional differences due to
   marginal grid mix, ambient temperature, patterns of vehicle miles
   traveled (VMT), and driving conditions (city versus highway). We find
   that PEVs can have larger or smaller carbon footprints than gasoline
   vehicles, depending on these regional factors and the specific vehicle
   models being compared. The Nissan Leaf battery electric vehicle has a
   smaller carbon footprint than the most efficient gasoline vehicle (the
   Toyota Prius) in the urban counties of California, Texas and Florida,
   whereas the Prius has a smaller carbon footprint in the Midwest and the
   South. The Leaf is lower emitting than the Mazda 3 conventional gasoline
   vehicle inmost urban counties, but the Mazda 3 is lower emitting in
   rural Midwest counties. The Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicle has a larger carbon footprint than the Prius throughout the
   continental US, though the Volt has a smaller carbon footprint than the
   Mazda 3 in many urban counties. Regional grid mix, temperature, driving
   conditions, and vehicle model all have substantial implications for
   identifying which technology has the lowest carbon footprint, whereas
   regional patterns of VMT have a much smaller effect. Given the variation
   in relative GHG implications, it is unlikely that blunt policy
   instruments that favor specific technology categories can ensure
   emission reductions universally.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic ethanol has potential for lower life cycle greenhouse
   gas emissions compared to gasoline and conventional grain-based ethanol.
   Ethanol production `pathways' need to meet economic and environmental
   goals. Numerous life cycle assessments of lignocellulosic ethanol have
   been published over the last 15 years, but gaps remain in understanding
   life cycle performance due to insufficient data, and model and
   methodological issues. We highlight key aspects of these issues, drawing
   on literature and a case study of corn stover ethanol. Challenges
   include the complexity of feedstock/ecosystems and market-mediated
   aspects and the short history of commercial lignocellulosic ethanol
   facilities, which collectively have led to uncertainty in GHG emissions
   estimates, and to debates on LCA methods and the role of uncertainty in
   decision making.}},

Volume = {{646}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{83-89}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The ideal structures of the Pt(111), Pt(221) and Pt(531) surfaces expose
   adsorption sites that can be qualitatively described as terrace sites on
   Pt(111), both step and terrace sites on Pt(221), and kink sites on
   Pt(531). The real surface structures of these surfaces can be
   complicated by imperfections such as misorientation, reconstruction and
   thermal roughening, all of which will influence their distributions of
   adsorption sites. Xe adsorption sites on the Pt(111), Pt(221) and
   Pt(531) surfaces have been probed using both photoemission of adsorbed
   Xe (PAX) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of Xe. Both PAX and
   Xe TPD are sensitive to the adsorption sites of the Xe and serve as
   complementary means of assessing the distributions of adsorption sites
   on these three Pt surfaces. The adsorption of Xe is sufficiently
   sensitive to detect the presence of residual steps on the Pt(111)
   surface at a density of similar to 1.5\% step atoms per Pt atom. On the
   Pt(221) surface, PM and Xe TPD reveal adsorption at both terrace and
   step sites simultaneously. Although the ideal structure of the Pt(531)
   surface has no well-defined steps or terraces, Xe adsorption indicates
   that its adsorption sites are best described as a distribution of both
   step and kink sites with roughly twice as many steps sites as kinks. (C)

Title = {{Bounding US electricity demand in 2050}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{215-223}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Limiting climate change requires a radical shift in energy supply and
   use. Because of time lags in capital investments, the political process,
   and the climate system, potential developments decades from now must be
   considered for energy policy decisions today. Traditionally, scenario
   analysis and forecasting are used to conceptualize the future; however,
   past energy demand forecasts have performed poorly displaying
   overconfidence, or a tendency to overly discount the tails of a
   distribution of possibilities under uncertainty. This study demonstrates
   a simple analytical approach to bound US electricity demand in 2050.
   Long-term electricity demand is parsed into two terms an expected, or
   ``business-as-usual,{''} term and a ``new demand{''} term estimated
   explicitly to account for possible technological changes in response to
   climate change. Under a variety of aggressive adaptation and mitigation
   conditions, low or high growth in GDP, and modest or substantial
   improvements in energy intensity, US electricity demand could be as
   little as 3100 TWh or as much as 17,000 TWh in 2050. Electrification of
   the US transportation sector could introduce the largest share of new
   electricity demand. Projections for expected electricity demand are most
   sensitive to assumptions about the rate of reduction of US electricity
   intensity per unit GDP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Insights uncovered by research in design cognition are often utilized to
   develop methods used by human designers; in this work, such insights are
   used to inform and improve computational methodologies. This paper
   introduces the heterogeneous simulated annealing team (HSAT) algorithm,
   a multiagent simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm. HSAT is based on a
   validated computational model of human-based engineering design and
   retains characteristics of the model that structure interaction between
   team members and allow for heterogeneous search strategies to be
   employed within a team. The performance of this new algorithm is
   compared to several other simulated annealing (SA) based algorithms on
   three carefully selected benchmarking functions. The HSAT algorithm
   provides terminal solutions that are better on average than other
   algorithms explored in this work.}},

Abstract = {{The first Organ Banking Summit was convened from Feb. 27 - March 1, 2015
   in Palo Alto, CA, with events at Stanford University, NASA Research
   Park, and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. Experts at the summit
   outlined the potential public health impact of organ banking, discussed
   the major remaining scientific challenges that need to be overcome in
   order to bank organs, and identified key opportunities to accelerate
   progress toward this goal. Many areas of public health could be
   revolutionized by the banking of organs and other complex tissues,
   including transplantation, oncofertility, tissue engineering, trauma
   medicine and emergency preparedness, basic biomedical research and drug
   discovery - and even space travel. Key remaining scientific
   sub-challenges were discussed including ice nucleation and growth,
   cryoprotectant and osmotic toxicities, chilling injury,
   thermo-mechanical stress, the need for rapid and uniform rewarming, and
   ischemia/reperfusion injury. A variety of opportunities to overcome
   these challenge areas were discussed, i.e. preconditioning for enhanced
   stress tolerance, nanoparticle rewarming, cyroprotectant screening
   strategies, and the use of cryoprotectant cocktails including ice
   binding agents.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) has been studied in the building science
   realm for about three decades. However, the following two aspects of the
   building control have not been studied thoroughly in MPC research. One
   is the impact of the mixed-mode cooling system on the active heating
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption, and the
   other is the differences of individual thermal comfort preference and
   its impact on energy. This paper proposes an occupant-oriented
   mixed-mode EnergyPlus predictive control system to optimize HVAC energy
   consumption while meeting the individual thermal comfort preference. A
   web-based dashboard is implemented in the test-bed building for three
   months to collect individual thermal comfort preference data. The data
   analysis results suggest that occupants have various tolerances and
   preferences about thermal comfort. The simulation results show that,
   during one week of a typical swing season, the mixed-mode system further
   reduces the active HVAC energy consumption, and the diversified occupant
   thermal comfort preference has significant impact on HVAC energy
   consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Benchmarking is a community-based and (preferably) community-driven
   activity involving consensus based decisions on how to make
   reproducible, fair, and relevant assessments. In catalysis science,
   important catalyst performance metrics include activity, selectivity,
   and the deactivation profile, which enable comparisons between new and
   standard catalysts. Benchmarking also requires careful documentation,
   archiving, and sharing of methods and measurements, to ensure that the
   full value of research data can be realized. Beyond these goals,
   benchmarking presents unique opportunities to advance and accelerate
   understanding of complex reaction systems by combining and comparing
   experimental information from multiple, in situ and operando techniques
   with theoretical insights derived from calculations characterizing model
   systems. This Perspective describes the origins and uses of benchmarking
   and its applications in computational catalysis, heterogeneous
   catalysis, molecular catalysis, and electrocatalysis. It also discusses
   opportunities and challenges for future developments in these fields.}},

Abstract = {{Even if humans stop discharging CO2 into the atmosphere, the average
   global temperature will still increase during this century. A lot of
   research has been devoted to prevent and reduce the amount of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere, in order to mitigate the
   effects of climate change. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is one
   of the technologies that might help to limit emissions. In complement,
   direct CO2 removal from the atmosphere has been proposed after the
   emissions have occurred. But, the removal of all the excess
   anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 will not be enough, due to the fact that
   CO2 outgases from the ocean as its solubility is dependent of its
   atmospheric partial pressure. Bringing back the Earth average surface
   temperature to pre-industrial levels would require the removal of all
   previously emitted CO2. Thus, the atmospheric removal of other
   greenhouse gases is necessary. This article proposes a combination of
   disrupting techniques to transform nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most
   important greenhouse gas (GHG) in terms of current radiative forcing,
   which is harmful for the ozone layer and possesses quite high global
   warming potential. Although several scientific publications cite
   ``greenhouse gas removal,{''} to our knowledge, it is the first time
   innovative solutions are proposed to effectively remove N2O or other
   GHGs from the atmosphere other than CO2.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers the development of optimization models for grade

   mathematical model is developed to capture the dynamics of the solution
   polymerization process. This includes time delay models for vapor and
   liquid recycle streams as well as a reduced, yet accurate, vapor-liquid
   equilibrium (VLE) model derived from rigorous VLE calculations.
   Simultaneous dynamic optimization approach is applied to solve the
   optimization problem to reduce off-spec production time and transition
   time. Two optimization formulations, single stage and multistage, are
   developed to deal with single-value target and specification bands of
   product properties, respectively. The results show significant
   reductions in grade transition time and off-spec production time. In
   addition, the multistage formulation designed for problems with
   specification bands outperforms its single stage counterpart. It
   minimizes transition time and off-spec production directly, and leads to
   higher performance control profiles. (c) 2015 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Several convex formulation methods have been proposed previously for
   statistical estimation with structured sparsity as the prior. These
   methods often require a carefully tuned regularization parameter, often
   a cumbersome or heuristic exercise. Furthermore, the estimate that these
   methods produce might not belong to the desired sparsity model, albeit
   accurately approximating the true parameter. Therefore, greedy-type
   algorithms could often be more desirable in estimating structured-sparse
   parameters. So far, these greedy methods have mostly focused on linear
   statistical models. In this paper, we study the projected gradient
   descent with a non-convex structured-sparse parameter model as the
   constraint set. Should the cost function have a stable model-restricted
   Hessian, the algorithm produces an approximation for the desired
   minimizer. As an example, we elaborate on application of the main
   results to estimation in generalized linear models.}},

   oxidation rate of two-phase alloys. Fe-Y alloys with Y contents between
   1.5 and 15 wt\% were employed as a model system. Alloys were prepared by
   arc-melting and the starting structures were as-solidified mixtures of
   Fe + Fe17Y2 intermetallic. An alloy with 1.5 wt\% Y was cold-rolled to
   alter the intermetallic morphology. Oxidation was conducted in an Fe-FeO
   Rhines pack at 600, 700, and 800 A degrees C up to 72 h. Pre- and
   post-oxidation microstructures were characterized with electron
   microscopy. Consistent with other studies, only the Fe17Y2 phase
   oxidized. Transmission electron microscopy showed the Fe17Y2 transformed
   into nanometer-scale oxides. Oxidation rates were always greater than
   those predicted by Wagner theory. Parabolic kinetics were obeyed until
   approximately 10 h. During this time the parabolic rate constants
   decreased with wt\% Y. The effect of alloy microstructure on oxidation
   kinetics was attributed to connectivity of the Fe17Y2 phase.}},

Title = {{An Information Exchange Framework Utilizing Smart Buildings for

Volume = {{104}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an information exchange framework to
   incorporate smart building demands into a microgrid operation. We
   especially focus on scheduling smart building demand along with other
   possibly highly uncertain microgrid generation resources a day ahead or
   shorter ahead of operation. Since every building demand has different
   energy consumption profiles and dynamics, it is inefficient for the grid
   operator to directly control a potentially large number of buildings. On
   the other hand, if the grid operator does not have sufficient
   information on the buildings and their resource potentials, smart
   buildings cannot be deployed to the full extent. Our proposed framework
   attempts to align these conflicting objectives in a reasonable way,
   taking into consideration the realistic limitations of communication
   time, various physical characteristics and dynamics of the buildings,
   and the building managers' economic objectives. This framework is in
   line with the concept of dynamic monitoring and decision systems
   (DYMONDS), where the economic objectives and physical dynamics of any
   flexible generation and loads on the grid are aggregated by load
   aggregators and incorporated in the optimal system operation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new 5-D localization method for an
   untetheredmeso-scalemagnetic robot, which is manipulated by a
   computer-controlled electromagnetic system. The developed magnetic
   localization setup is a 2D array (8 x 8) of mono-axial Hall-effect
   sensors, which measure the perpendicular magnetic fields at their given
   positions. We introduce two steps for localizing a magnetic robot more
   accurately. First, the dipole-modeled magnetic field of the
   electromagnet is subtracted from the measured data in order to determine
   the robot's magnetic field. Second, the subtracted magnetic field is
   twice differentiated in the perpendicular direction of the array, so
   that the effect of the electromagnetic field in the localization process
   is minimized. Five variables regarding the position and orientation of
   the robot are determined by minimizing the error between the measured
   magnetic field and the modeled-magnetic field in an optimization method.
   The resulting position error is 2.1 +/- 0.8 mm and angular error is 6.7
   +/- 4.3. within the applicable range (5 cm) of magnetic field sensors at
   200 Hz. The proposed localization method would be used for the position
   feedback control of untethered magnetic devices or robots for medical
   applications in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Networking research benefits from controlled, repeatable experimentation
   using simulation and emulation systems. Making simulations realistic is
   a challenge for wireless systems and is especially difficult for
   vehicular networks. This paper presents a general framework for modeling
   and reproducing environment-specific channel properties. We show that
   one can estimate localized environment information, and adding such
   information to state-of-the art channel models significantly increases
   accuracy. We describe the proposed framework and validate it for fading
   and line-of-sight effects in vehicle-to-vehicle channels. While suitable
   models can provide a close approximation of channel conditions, accuracy
   is limited by the quality of the input information about the environment
   being modeled. We present a systematic approach to estimating
   location-specific scattering properties using aerial photography. Using
   signal-level channel emulation, we show that the improved fading models
   produce more accurate results at the packet/link level. The error rates
   of the improved model are 45 and 22 percent lower than using previous
   state of the art, for Doppler spectrum similarity and packet delivery
   ratio, respectively. The proposed models-and their implementation-have
   been designed to minimize run-time complexity while preserving accuracy.
   The implementation is efficient gh to allow concurrent real-time
   simulation of many of channels.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the implementation of an efficient numerical
   technique for cryosurgery simulations on a graphics processing unit as
   an alternative means to accelerate runtime. This study is part of an
   ongoing effort to develop computerized training tools for cryosurgery,

   perform rapid simulations of various test cases is critical to
   facilitate sound decision making associated with medical training.
   Consistent with clinical practice, the training tool aims at correlating
   the frozen region contour and the corresponding temperature field with
   the target region shape. The current study focuses on the feasibility of
   graphics processing unit-based computation using C++ accelerated massive
   parallelism, as one possible implementation. Benchmark results on a
   variety of computation platforms display between 3-fold acceleration
   (laptop) and 13-fold acceleration (gaming computer) of cryosurgery
   simulation, in comparison with the more common implementation on a
   multicore central processing unit. While the general concept of graphics
   processing unit-based simulations is not new, its application to
   phase-change problems, combined with the unique requirements for

Abstract = {{As a part of an ongoing effort to develop computerized training tools
   for cryosurgery, the current study presents a proof of concept for a
   computerized tool for cryosurgery tutoring. The tutoring system lists
   geometrical constraints of cryoprobes placement, simulates cryoprobe
   insertion, displays a rendered shape of the prostate, enables distance
   measurements, simulates the corresponding thermal history, and evaluates
   the mismatch between the target region shape and a preselected planning
   isotherm. The quality of trainee planning is measured in comparison with
   a computer-generated planning, created for each case study by previously
   developed planning algorithms. The following two versions of the
   tutoring system have been tested in the current study: (1) an unguided
   version, where the trainee can practice cases in unstructured sessions
   and (2) an intelligent tutoring system, which forces the trainee to
   follow specific steps, believed by the authors to potentially shorten
   the learning curve. Although the tutoring level in this study aims only
   at geometrical constraints on cryoprobe placement and the resulting
   thermal histories, it creates a unique opportunity to gain insight into
   the process outside the operation room. Post-test results indicate that
   the intelligent tutoring system may be more beneficial than the
   nonintelligent tutoring system, but the proof of concept is demonstrated

Abstract = {{The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power
   reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs
   in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two
   decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007);
   Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Leveque (2015), study only 26\%
   of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an
   incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power
   construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight
   construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study
   substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the
   US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea,
   encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in
   costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era,

   characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find
   evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including
   absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new
   findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend

Abstract = {{This paper offers new insights into the role of firms versus individuals
   in driving technology directions, and the extent to which human capital
   may be lost during industrial shifts. We explore in particular whether
   (1) firms who move manufacturing offshore slow U.S.-based R\&D
   activities in an emerging technology and (2) the inventors originally
   within these offshoring firms, leave, and continue innovating in the
   emerging technology at different institutions. We focus on the 28
   leading U.S. optoelectronic component manufactures for
   telecommunications and the inventors who patent at these firms. In the
   case of U.S. optoelectronic component manufacturers for
   telecommunications, offshoring is associated with a decrease in
   innovation in the emerging technology, but an increase in all other
   types of patenting. The majority of inventors depart to firms outside
   the industry and stop work in the emerging technology. However, an
   important minority of emerging technology inventors at the offshoring
   firms go to a single onshore firm in the same industry (which gains from
   others' losses and subsequently dominates this space). Our results
   suggest a strong role for firms and firm strategy in driving innovation
   directions, and the corresponding opportunities faced by individuals.

Abstract = {{A class of trust-region algorithms is developed and analyzed for the
   solution of optimization problems with nonlinear equality and inequality
   constraints. These algorithms are developed for problem classes where
   the constraints are not available in an open, equation-based form, and
   constraint Jacobians are of high dimension and are expensive to
   calculate. Based on composite-step trust region methods and a filter
   approach, the resulting algorithms do not require the computation of
   exact Jacobians; only Jacobian vector products are used along with
   approximate Jacobian matrices. With these modifications, we show that
   the algorithm is globally convergent. Also, as demonstrated on numerical
   examples, our algorithm avoids direct computation of exact Jacobians and
   has significant potential benefits on problems where Jacobian
   calculations are expensive.}},

Abstract = {{Immobilization of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on surfaces
   has been proposed as a method to inhibit biofouling or as a possible
   route by which incidental releases of AgNPs may interfere with biofilms
   in the natural environment or in wastewater treatment. This study
   addresses the ability of planktonic Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria to
   colonize surfaces with pre-adsorbed AgNPs. The ability of the
   AgNP-coated surfaces to inhibit colonization was controlled by the
   dissolved silver in the system, with a strong dependence on the initial
   planktonic cell concentration in the suspension, i.e., a strong inoculum
   effect. This dependence was attributed to a decrease in dissolved silver
   ion bioavailability and toxicity caused by its binding to cells and/or
   cell byproducts. Therefore, when the initial cell concentration was high
   (similar to 1 x 10(7) CFU/mL), an excess of silver binding capacity
   removed most of the free silver and allowed both planktonic growth and
   surface colonization directly on the AgNP-coated surface. When the
   initial cell concentration was low (similar to 1 x 10(5) CFU/mL), 100\%
   killing of the planktonic cell inoculum occurred and prevented
   colonization. When an intermediate initial inoculum concentration
   (similar to-1 x 10(6) CFU/mL) was sufficiently large to prevent 100\%
   killing of planktonic cells, even with 99.97\% initial killing, the
   planktonic population recovered and bacteria colonized the AgNP-coated
   surface. In some conditions, colonization of AgNP-coated surfaces was
   enhanced relative to silver-free controls, and the bacteria demonstrated
   a preferential attachment to AgNP-coated, rather than bare, surface
   regions. The degree to which the bacterial concentration dictates
   whether or not surface-immobilized AgNPs can inhibit colonization has
   significant implications both for the design of antimicrobial surfaces
   and for the potential environmental impacts of AgNPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{467}},
Pages = {{105-114}},

Abstract = {{Complexation of surfactants and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is
   expected to alter Marangoni transport at a fluid interface compared to
   either single component system due to altered interfacial tension
   isotherms and mass transfer rates as well as adsorption irreversibility
   effects. We investigate Marangoni transport at the oil/water interface
   by passing mixtures of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS) and cationic polyelectrolyte poly(3-(2-methylpropionamide)propyl)
   trimethylammonium chloride-acrylamide (poly{[}AM-MAPTACj), or rinsing
   solutions, over an oil/water interface in a radial, stagnation point
   flow. The displacements of adsorbed tracer particles are recorded
   through optical microscopy. The net displacement, defined as the sum of
   the displacements occurring during the adsorption and desorption stages
   of one application and rinsing cycle, is up to 10 times greater for
   complexing surfactant/polymer mixtures compared to either single
   component system. The enhanced net displacement is largely determined by
   the enhanced transport upon adsorption, while the reverse displacement
   that would normally occur upon rinsing is partially suppressed by
   partially irreversible polymer adsorption at the oil/water interface. In
   addition to effects of complexation on interfacial tension gradient
   induced flow, complexation effects on the bulk, and possibly
   interfacial, viscosity also influence the interfacial transport. (C)

Abstract = {{Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are advanced materials with the
   potential for a myriad of diverse applications, including biological
   technologies and large-scale usage with the potential for environmental
   impacts. SWCNTs have been exposed to developing organisms to determine
   their effects on embryogenesis, and results have been inconsistent
   arising, in part, from differing material quality, dispersion status,
   material size, impurity from catalysts and stability. For this study, we
   utilized highly purified SWCNT samples with short, uniform lengths
   (14517nm) well dispersed in solution. To test high exposure doses, we
   microinjected>500 mu gml(-1) SWCNT concentrations into the
   well-established embryogenesis model, Xenopus laevis, and determined
   embryo compatibility and subcellular localization during development.
   SWCNTs localized within cellular progeny of the microinjected cells, but
   were heterogeneously distributed throughout the target-injected tissue.
   Co-registering unique Raman spectral intensity of SWCNTs with images of
   fluorescently labeled subcellular compartments demonstrated that even at
   regions of highest SWCNT concentration, there were no gross alterations
   to subcellular microstructures, including filamentous actin, endoplasmic
   reticulum and vesicles. Furthermore, SWCNTs did not aggregate and
   localized to the perinuclear subcellular region. Combined, these results
   suggest that purified and dispersed SWCNTs are not toxic to X. laevis
   animal cap ectoderm and may be suitable candidate materials for
   biological applications. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.
   Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have superlative properties for

   concentrations into the embryogenesis model, Xenopus laevis, and
   determined that SWCNTs were not toxic, remained individualized and

Abstract = {{Single wall carbon nanotubes are high aspect ratio nanomaterials being
   developed for use in materials, technological and biological
   applications due to their high mechanical stiffness, optical properties
   and chemical inertness. Because of their prevalence, it is inevitable
   that biological systems will be exposed to nanotubes, yet studies of the
   effects of nanotubes on developing embryos have been inconclusive and
   are lacking for single wall carbon nanotubes exposed to the widely
   studied model organism Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog).
   Microinjection of experimental substances into the Xenopus embryo is a
   standard technique for toxicology studies and cellular lineage tracing.
   Here we report the surprising finding that superficial (12.5 7.5 mu m
   below the membrane) microinjection of nanotubes dispersed with Pluronic
   F127 into one- to two-cell Xenopus embryos resulted in the formation and
   expulsion of compacted, nanotube-filled, punctate masses, at the
   blastula to mid-gastrula developmental stages, which we call boluses.
   Such expulsion of microinjected materials by Xenopus embryos has not
   been reported before and is dramatically different from the typical
   distribution of the materials throughout the progeny of the
   microinjected cells. Previous studies of microinjections of
   nanomaterials such as nanodiamonds, quantum dots or spherical
   nanoparticles report that nanomaterials often induce toxicity and remain
   localized within the embryos. In contrast, our results demonstrate an
   active recovery pathway for embryos after exposure to Pluronic
   F127-coated nanotubes, which we speculate is due to a combined effect of
   the membrane activity of the dispersing agent, Pluronic F127, and the
   large aspect ratio of nanotubes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the use of analysis-suitable T-splines of
   arbitrary degree in combination with isogeometric collocation methods
   for the solution of second-and fourth-order boundary-value problems. In
   fact, analysis-suitable T-splines appear to be a particularly efficient
   locally refinable basis for isogeometric collocation, able to conserve
   the cost of only one point evaluation per degree of freedom typical of
   standard NURBS-based isogeometric collocation. Furthermore, T-splines
   allow to easily create highly non-uniform meshes without introducing
   elements with high aspect ratios; this makes it possible to avoid the
   numerical instabilities that may arise in the case of problems
   characterized by reduced regularity when Neumann boundary conditions are
   imposed in strong form and elements with high aspect ratio are used. The
   local refinement properties of T-splines can be also successfully
   exploited to approximate problems where point loads are applied.
   Finally, several numerical tests are herein presented in order to
   confirm all the above-mentioned features, as well as the good overall
   convergence properties of the combination of isogeometric collocation
   and analysis-suitable T-splines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Multi-class Fukunaga Koontz discriminant analysis for enhanced face
   recognition}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{186-205}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Linear subspace learning methods such as Fisher's Linear Discriminant
   Analysis (LDA), Unsupervised Discriminant Projection (UDP), and Locality
   Preserving Projections (LPP) have been widely used in face recognition
   applications as a tool to capture low dimensional discriminant
   information. However, when these methods are applied in the context of
   face recognition, they often encounter the small-sample-size problem. In
   order to overcome this problem, a separate Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA) step is usually adopted to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
   However, such a step may discard dimensions that contain important
   discriminative information that can aid classification performance. In
   this work, we propose a new idea which we named Multi-class Fukunaga
   Koontz Discriminant Analysis (FKDA) by incorporating the Fukunaga Koontz
   Transform within the optimization for maximizing class separation
   criteria in LDA, UDP, and LPP. In contrast to traditional LDA, UDP, and
   LPP, our approach can work with very high dimensional data as input,
   without requiring a separate dimensionality reduction step to make the
   scatter matrices full rank. In addition, the FKDA formulation seeks
   optimal projection direction vectors that are orthogonal which the
   existing methods cannot guarantee, and it has the capability of finding
   the exact solutions to the ``trace ratio{''} objective in discriminant
   analysis problems while traditional methods can only deal with a relaxed
   and inexact ``ratio trace{''} objective. We have shown using six face
   database, in the context of large scale unconstrained face recognition,
   face recognition with occlusions, and illumination invariant face
   recognition, under ``closed set{''}, ``semi-open set{''}, and ``open
   set{''} recognition scenarios, that our proposed FKDA significantly
   outperforms traditional linear discriminant subspace learning methods as
   well as five other competing algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a conceptual design of optimal integrated
   processes for the production of dimethyl furfural (DMF) and furfural
   from biomass, switchgrass and algae. The processes consist of four
   stages: (1) biomass pretreatment into intermediates such as oil and
   glucose from algae and glucose and xylose from switchgrass; (2)
   dehydration of the sugars; (3) hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural
   purification; (4) synthesis of DMF out of HMF and fatty acid ethyl ester
   (FREE) from oil in the case of using algae. We formulate mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming models so as to simultaneously optimize and heat
   integrate the processing of both raw materials. For switchgrass, the use
   of Ammonia Fiber Explosion (AFEX) pretreatment is recommended for a
   production of cost of DMF and furfural of \$3/kg (\$570 MM of fixed
   investment cost). For algae, the composition, is 60\% oil, 30\% starch,
   and 10\% protein to obtain 98 MMgal/yr of biofuels, 16\% of DMF, at a
   cost of \$1.98/gal (\$693 MM of fixed investment). If the sugar
   concentration in the dehydration reactor increases from 10 to 30\%, we
   can reduce the production costs by 25\% and the investment costs up to
   50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining a high concentration of therapeutic agents in the brain is
   diffi cult due to the restrictions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and
   rapid removal from blood circulation. To enable controlled drug release
   and enhance the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-crossing effi ciency for brain
   tumor therapy, a new dual-targeting magnetic polydiacetylene
   nanocarriers (PDNCs) delivery system modifi ed with lactoferrin (Lf) is
   developed. The PDNCs are synthesized using the ultraviolet (UV)
   cross-linkable 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) monomers through
   spontaneous assembling onto the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide
   (SPIO) nanoparticles to form micelles-polymerized structures. The
   results demonstrate that PDNCs will reduce the drug leakage and further
   control the drug release, and display self-responsive fl uorescence upon
   intracellular uptake for cell traffi cking and imaging-guided tumor
   treatment. The magnetic Lf-modifi ed PDNCs with magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) and dual-targeting ability can enhance the transportation
   of the PDNCs across the BBB for tracking and targeting gliomas. An
   enhanced therapeutic effi ciency can be obtained using Lf-Cur
   (Curcumin)-PDNCs by improving the retention time of the encapsulated Cur
   and producing fourfold higher Cur amounts in the brain compared to free
   Cur. Animal studies also confi rm that Lf targeting and controlled
   release act synergistically to signifi cantly suppress tumors in
   orthotopic brain-bearing rats.}},

Abstract = {{The functions of anti-fouling, zwitterionic polycarboxybetaine (pCB)
   coating, and anti-platelet nitric oxide (NO) release replicate key
   anticoagulant properties of the endothelium. The two approaches, only
   tested separately thus far, are paired on gas permeable
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes and evaluated for fibrinogen (Fg)
   and platelet adsorption. Uncoated (control) and pCB-coated PDMS separate
   sheep plasma (10(8) platelets per milliliter) and gas flow chambers
   within bioreactors used in this study, and either 100 or 0 ppm of NO/N-2
   flows through the gas chamber so PDMS transfers NO into flowing plasma.
   Surface-adsorbed platelets are quantified using a lactate dehydrogenase
   assay after 8h plasma recirculation. Fg and platelet adsorption on
   pCB-coated PDMS are 10.40\% +/- 3.0\% of control (p < 0.01) and 23.3\%
   +/- 7.4\% (p < 0.01) of control, respectively. NO flux alone limits
   platelet adsorption to 79.0\% +/- 5.0\% (p < 0.05) of control. Together,
   NO and pCB reduce platelet adsorption to 6.90\% +/- 1.30\% of control (p
   < 0.001). The data suggest that pCB coating and NO act in concert to
   reduce platelet fouling at significantly higher levels than either pCB
   coating or NO release alone.}},

Abstract = {{We present a hybrid variational-collocation, immersed, and
   fully-implicit formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using
   unstructured T-splines. In our immersed methodology, we define an
   Eulerian mesh on the whole computational domain and a Lagrangian mesh on
   the solid domain, which moves arbitrarily on top of the Eulerian mesh.
   Mathematically, the problem reduces to solving three equations, namely,
   the linear momentum balance, mass conservation, and a condition of
   kinematic compatibility between the Lagrangian displacement and the
   Eulerian velocity. We use a weighted residual approach for the linear
   momentum and mass conservation equations, but we discretize directly the
   strong form of the kinematic relation, deriving a hybrid
   variational-collocation method. We use T-splines for both the spatial
   discretization and the information transfer between the Eulerian mesh
   and the Lagrangian mesh. T-splines offer us two main advantages against
   non-uniform rational B-splines: they can be locally refined and they are
   unstructured. The generalized- method is used for the time
   discretization. We validate our formulation with a common FSI benchmark
   problem achieving excellent agreement with the theoretical solution. An
   example involving a partially immersed solid is also solved. The
   numerical examples show how the use of T-junctions and extraordinary
   nodes results in an accurate, efficient, and flexible method. Copyright

Abstract = {{PIyC, a bacteriophage-encoded endolysin, lyses Streptococcus pyogenes
   (Spy) on contact. Here, we demonstrate that PIyC is a potent agent for
   controlling intracellular Spy that often underlies refractory
   infections. We show that the PIyC holoenzyme, mediated by its PIyCB
   subunit, crosses epithelial cell membranes and clears intracellular Spy
   in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative studies using model membranes
   establish that PIyCB interacts strongly with phosphatidylserine (PS),
   whereas its interaction with other lipids is weak, suggesting
   specificity for PS as its cellular receptor. Neutron reflection further
   substantiates that PIyC penetrates bilayers above a PS threshold
   concentration. Crystallography and docking studies identify key residues
   that mediate PIyCB PS interactions, which are validated by site-directed
   mutagenesis. This is the first report that a native endolysin can
   traverse epithelial membranes, thus substantiating the potential of PIyC
   as an antimicrobial for Spy in the extracellular and intracellular
   milieu and as a scaffold for engineering other functionalities.}},

Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{A systems-level lifetime cost-of-use optimization model was applied to a
   hypothetical hybrid off-grid power system to compare the impacts of
   different battery technologies. Specifically, a time-step battery
   degradation model was used to account for unit degradation over a
   20-year system lifetime for three different batteries. Variables
   examined included: battery type, allowed state of charge swing during
   cycling, number of battery replacements, fractional renewable energy
   requirements, and applied discount rate. Our analyses show that storage
   packs with high energy, low cost lithium-ion cells have the potential to
   compete with a non-renewable solution in some cases. The discount rate
   also proves to be significant in determining the cost competitiveness of
   the hybrid systems: at low discount rates, the levelized cost of
   electricity (LCOE) is only slightly higher than diesel generation, with
   costs diverging as the discount rate increases. The discount rate also
   determines which battery technology delivers the lowest cost of
   electricity: lead acid batteries are favorable at low rates, while
   high-energy lithium-ion batteries deliver lower cost electricity at
   higher rates. Similarly, market forces, like fuel or battery price
   changes, feed-in tariffs, or carbon taxes, required to trigger a switch
   to a hybrid system vary substantially with the discount rate. (C) 2016

Title = {{Microstructural quantification of collagen fiber orientations and its
   integration in constitutive modeling of the porcine carotid artery}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{183-193}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mechanical characteristics of vascular tissue may play a
   role in different arterial pathologies, which, amongst others, requires
   robust constitutive descriptions to capture the vessel wall's
   anisotropic and non-linear properties.Specifically, the complex 3D
   network of collagen and its interaction with other structural elements
   has a dominating effect of arterial properties at higher stress
   levels.The aim of this study is to collect quantitative collagen
   organization as well as mechanical properties to facilitate structural
   constitutive models for the porcine carotid artery.This helps the
   understanding of the mechanics of swine carotid arteries, being a
   standard in clinical hypothesis testing, in endovascular preclinical
   trials for example. Method: Porcine common carotid arteries (n = 10)
   were harvested and used to (i) characterize the collagen fiber
   organization with polarized light microscopy, and (ii) the biaxial
   mechanical properties by inflation testing.The collagen organization was
   quantified by the Bingham orientation density function (ODF), which in
   turn was integrated in a structural constitutive model of the vessel
   wall.A one-layered and thick-walled model was used to estimate
   mechanical constitutive parameters by least-square fitting the recorded
   in vitro inflation test results.Finally, uniaxial data published
   elsewhere were used to validate the mean collagen organization described
   by the Bingham ODF. Results: Thick collagen fibers, i.e.the most
   mechanically relevant structure, in the common carotid artery are
   dispersed around the circumferential direction.In addition, almost all
   samples showed two distinct families of collagen fibers at different
   elevation, but not azimuthal, angles.Collagen fiber organization could
   be accurately represented by the Bingham ODF (kappa(1,2,3) = {[}13.5,
   0.0, 25.2] and kappa(1,2,3) = {[}14.7, 0.0,26.6]; average error of about
   5\%), and their integration into a structural constitutive model
   captured the inflation characteristics of individual carotid artery
   samples.Specifically, only four mechanical parameters were required to
   reasonably (average error from 14\% to 38\%) cover the experimental data
   over a wide range of axial and circumferential stretches.However, it was
   critical to account for fibrilar links between thick collagen
   fibers.Finally, the mean Bingham ODF provide also good approximation to
   uniaxial experimental data. Conclusions: The applied structural
   constitutive model, based on individually measured collagen orientation
   densities, was able to capture the biaxial properties of the common
   carotid artery. Since the model required coupling amongst thick collagen
   fibers, the collagen fiber orientations measured from polarized light
   microscopy, alone, seem to be insufficient structural information.
   Alternatively, a larger dispersion of collagen fiber orientations, that
   is likely to arise from analyzing larger wall sections, could have had a
   similar effect, i.e. could have avoided coupling amongst thick collagen
   fibers.
   Statement of Significance
   The applied structural constitutive model, based on individually
   measured collagen orientation densities, was able to capture the biaxial
   and uniaxial properties of the common carotid artery. Since the model
   required coupling amongst thick collagen fibers, an effective
   orientation density that accounts for cross links between the main
   collagen fibers has been porposed. The model provides a good
   approximation to the experimental data. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Interest in biobased products has been motivated, in part, by the claim
   that these products have lower life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   than their fossil counterparts. This study investigates GHG emissions
   from U.S. production of three important biobased polymer families:
   polylactic acid (PLA), as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and
   bioethylene-based plastics. The model incorporates uncertainty into the
   life cycle emission estimates using Monte Carlo simulation. Results
   present a range of scenarios for feedstock choice (corn or switchgrass),
   treatment of coproducts, data sources, end of life assumptions, and
   displaced fossil polymer. Switchgrass pathways generally have lower
   emissions than corn pathways, and can even generate negative
   cradle-to-gate emissions if unfermented residues are used to coproduce
   energy. PHB (from either feedstock) is unlikely to have lower emissions
   than fossil polymers once end of life emissions are included. PLA
   generally has the lowest emissions when compared to high emission fossil
   polymers, such as polystyrene (mean GHG savings up to 1.4 kg CO(2)e/kg
   corn PLA and 2.9 kg CO(2)e/kg switchgrass PLA). In contrast, bioethylene
   is likely to achieve the greater emission reduction for ethylene
   intensive polymers, like polyethylene (mean GHG savings up to 0.60 kg
   CO(2)e/kg corn polyethylene and 3.4 kg CO(2)e/kg switchgrass
   polyethylene).}},

Abstract = {{Lignin is an abundant biopolymer that has native interfacial functions
   but aggregates strongly in aqueous media. Polyacrylamide was grafted
   onto kraft lignin nanoparticles using reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain transfer (RAFT) chemistry to form polymer-grafted lignin
   nanoparticles (PGLNs) that tune aggregation strength while retaining
   interfacial activities in forming Pickering emulsions. Polymer graft
   density on the particle surface, ionic strength, and initial water and
   cyclohexane volume fractions were varied and found to have profound
   effects on emulsion characteristics, including emulsion volume fraction,
   droplet size, and particle interfacial concentration that were
   attributed to changes in lignin aggregation and hydrophobic
   interactions. In particular, salt concentration was found to have a
   significant effect on aggregation, zeta potential, and interfacial
   tension, which was attributed to changes in solubility of both the kraft
   lignin and the polyacrylamide grafts. Dynamic light scattering, UV-vis
   spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and tensiometry were used to quantify
   emulsion properties and nanoparticle behavior. Under all conditions, the
   emulsions exhibited relatively fast creaming but were stable against
   coalescence and Ostwald ripening for a period of months. All emulsions
   were also oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions, as predicted by the Bancroft
   rule, and no catastrophic phase inversions were observed for any
   nanoparticle compositions. We conclude that lower grafting density of
   polyacrylamide on a lignin core resulted in high levels of interfacial
   activity, as characterized by higher concentration at the
   water-cyclohexane interface with a corresponding decrease in interfacial
   tension. These results indicate that the interfacial properties of
   polymer-grafted lignin nanoparticles are primarily due to the native
   hydrophobic interactions of the lignin core. These results suggest that
   the forces that drive aggregation are also correlated with interfacial
   activities, and polymer-nanoparticle interactions are critical for
   optimizing interfacial activities. Controlled radical polymerization is
   a powerful tool for polymer grafting that can leverage the intrinsic
   interfacial functions of lignin for the formation of Pickering

Abstract = {{Nano-enabled products (NEPs) are currently part of our life prompting
   for detailed investigation of potential nano-release across their
   life-cycle. Particularly interesting is their end-of-life thermal
   decomposition scenario. Here, we examine the thermal decomposition of
   widely used NEPs, namely thermoplastic nanocomposites, and assess the
   properties of the byproducts (released aerosol and residual ash) and
   possible environmental health and safety implications. We focus on
   establishing a fundamental understanding on the effect of thermal
   decomposition parameters, such as polymer matrix, nanofiller properties,
   decomposition temperature, on the properties of byproducts using a
   recently-developed lab based experimental integrated platform. Our
   results indicate that thermoplastic polymer matrix strongly influences
   size and morphology of released aerosol, while there was minimal but
   detectable nano-release, especially when inorganic nanofillers were
   used. The chemical composition of the released aerosol was found not to
   be strongly influenced by the presence of nanofiller at least for the
   low, industry-relevant loadings assessed here. Furthermore, the
   morphology and composition of residual ash was found to be strongly
   influenced by the presence of nanofiller. The findings presented here on
   thermal decomposition/incineration of NEPs raise important questions and
   concerns regarding the potential fate and transport of released
   engineered nanomaterials in environmental media and potential
   environmental health and safety implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper addresses industrial gases supply chains involving multiple
   products at multiple plants that must be coordinated with multiple
   depot-truck-routes in order to satisfy customer demands. The full-space
   optimization problem corresponds to a large-scale mixed-integer linear
   programming model (MILP). To, solve large-scale industrial problems,
   this paper proposes a rolling horizon approach with two aggregation
   strategies for solving the smaller subproblems. The first one relies on
   the linear programming (LP) relaxation for which the binary variables
   (complicating variables) of the distribution problem are treated as
   continuous, while the second one uses a novel tailored model for the
   distribution side constraints that leads to improved solutions. A real
   case study of an industrial gases supply chain has been addressed
   obtaining good results in both objective value and with lower
   computational effort compared with the full-space solution. The
   extension to longer time horizons through a receding horizon is also
   considered.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{33-47}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{We formulate the capacity expansion planning as a bilevel optimization
   to model the hierarchical decision structure involving industrial
   producers and consumers. The formulation is a mixed-integer bilevel
   linear program in which the upper level maximizes the profit of a
   producer and the lower level minimizes the cost paid by markets. The
   upper-level problem includes mixed-integer variables that establish the
   expansion plan; the lower level problem is an LP that decides demands
   assignments. We reformulate the bilevel optimization as a single-level
   problem using two different approaches: KKT reformulation and
   duality-based reformulation. We analyze the performance of these
   reformulations and compare their results with the expansion plans
   obtained from the traditional single-level formulation. For the solution
   of large-scale problems, we propose improvements on the duality-based
   reformulation that allows reducing the number of variables and
   constraints. The formulations and the solution methods are illustrated
   with examples from the air separation industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{90-105}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{For optimal operation of power-intensive plants, production scheduling
   and electricity procurement have to be considered simultaneously. In
   addition, uncertainty needs to be taken into account. For this purpose,
   an integrated stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is
   developed that considers the two most critical sources of uncertainty:
   spot electricity price, and product demand. Conditional value-at-risk is
   incorporated into the model as a measure of risk. Furthermore, scenario
   reduction and multicut Benders decomposition are implemented to solve
   large-scale real-world problems. The proposed model is applied to an
   illustrative example as well as an industrial air separation case. The
   results show the benefit from stochastic optimization and the effect of
   taking a risk-averse rather than a risk-neutral approach. An interesting
   insight from the analysis is that in risk-neutral optimization,
   accounting for electricity price uncertainty does not yield significant
   added value; however, in risk-averse optimization, modeling price
   uncertainty is crucial for obtaining good solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{106-119}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{To ensure the stability of the power grid, backup capacities are called
   upon when electricity supply does not meet demand due to unexpected
   changes in the grid. As part of the demand response efforts in recent
   years, large electricity consumers are encouraged by financial
   incentives to provide such operating reserve in the form of load
   reduction capacities (interruptible load). However, a major challenge
   lies in the uncertainty that one does not know in advance when load
   reduction will be requested. In this work, we develop a scheduling model
   for continuous industrial processes providing interruptible load. An
   adjustable robust optimization approach, which incorporates recourse
   decisions using linear decision rules, is applied to model the
   uncertainty. The proposed model is applied to an illustrative example as
   well as a real-world air separation case. The results show the benefits
   from selling interruptible load and the value of considering recourse in
   the decision-making. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alumina nanoparticles are widely used as nano fillers for polymer
   nanocomposites. Among several different polymorphs of alumina,
   alpha-alumina has the most desirable combination of physical properties.
   Hence, the attachment of polymer chains to alpha-alumina to enhance
   compatibility in polymeric matrixes is an important goal. However, the
   chemical inertness and low concentration of surface hydroxyl groups have
   rendered polymer modification of alpha-alumina a long-standing
   challenge. Herein, we report that activation of a-alumina in
   concentrated or molten NaOH as well as in molten K2S2O7 increased
   polymer graft density up to 50\%, thereby facilitating the synthesis of
   alpha-alumina brush particles with uniform grafting density of 0.05
   nm(-2) that are readily miscible or dispersible in organic solvents or

Abstract = {{Nitride films are promising for advanced optoelectronic and electronic

   These problems have severely limited the use of aluminum-rich nitride

   through use of a liquid-metal-enabled approach to molecular beam
   epitaxy. Although the presence of a liquid metal layer at the growth
   front is reminiscent of conventional liquid phase epitaxy, this approach
   is different in its details. Conventional liquid epitaxy is a
   near-thermodynamic equilibrium process which liquid-metal assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy is not. Growth of aluminum-rich nitrides is
   primarily driven by the kinetics of the molecular vapor fluxes, and the
   surface diffusion of adatoms through a liquid metal layer before
   incorporation. This paper reports on growth of high crystalline quality
   and highly doped aluminum-containing nitride films. Measured optical and
   electrical characterization data show that the approach is viable for
   growth of atomically smooth aluminum-containing nitride
   heterostructures. Extremely high p-type doping of up to 6 x 10(17)
   cm(-3) and n-type doping of up to 1 x 10(20) cm(-3) in Al0.7Ga0.3N films
   was achieved. Use of these metal-rich conditions is expected to have a
   significant impact on high efficiency and high power optoelectronic and
   electronic devices that require both high crystalline quality and highly
   doped (Al, Ga)N films. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{YinzCam is a cloud-hosted service that provides sports fans with
   real-time scores, news, photos, statistics, live radio, streaming video,
   etc., on their mobile devices. YinzCam's infrastructure is currently
   hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and supports over 30 million
   installs of the official mobile apps of 140+ NHL/NFL/NBA/NRL/NCAA sports
   teams and venues. YinzCam's workload is necessarily multi-modal (e.g.,
   pre-game, in-game, post-game, game-day, non-gameday), with normal
   game-time traffic being twenty-fold of that on non-game days. This paper
   describes the evolution of YinzCam's production architecture and
   distributed infrastructure, from its beginnings in 2009, when it was
   used to support thousands of concurrent users, to today's system that
   supports millions of concurrent users on any game day. We also discuss
   key new opportunities to improve the fan experience inside the stadium
   of the future, without impacting the available bandwidth, by
   crowd-sourcing the thousands of mobile devices that are in fans' hands
   inside these venues. We present Krowd, a novel distributed key-value
   store for promoting efficient content sharing, discovery and retrieval
   across the mobile devices inside a stadium. We present CHIPS, a system
   that ensures that users' privacy is maintained while their devices
   participate in the crowd sourced infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a set of deterministic 3-D ground motion simulations
   for the greater metropolitan area of Medellin in the Aburra Valley, an
   earthquake-prone region of the Colombian Andes that exhibits
   moderate-to-strong topographic irregularities. We created the velocity
   model of the Aburra Valley region (version 1) using the geological
   structures as a basis for determining the shear wave velocity. The
   irregular surficial topography is considered by means of a fictitious
   domain strategy. The simulations cover a 50 x 50 x 25 km(3) volume, and
   four M-w = 5 rupture scenarios along a segment of the Romeral fault, a
   significant source of seismic activity in Colombia. In order to examine
   the sensitivity of ground motion to the irregular topography and the 3-D
   effects of the valley, each earthquake scenario was simulated with three
   different models: (i) realistic 3-D velocity structure plus realistic
   topography, (ii) realistic 3-D velocity structure without topography,
   and (iii) homogeneous half-space with realistic topography. Our results
   show how surface topography affects the ground response. In particular,
   our findings highlight the importance of the combined interaction
   between source-effects, source-directivity, focusing, soft-soil
   conditions, and 3-D topography. We provide quantitative evidence of this
   interaction and show that topographic amplification factors can be as
   high as 500 per cent at some locations. In other areas within the
   valley, the topographic effects result in relative reductions, but these
   lie in the 0-150 per cent range.}},

Abstract = {{In electric power systems, multiple entities are responsible for
   ensuring an economic and reliable way of delivering power from producers
   to consumers. With the increase of variable renewable generation it is
   becoming increasingly important to take advantage of the individual
   entities' (and their areas') capabilities for balancing variability.
   Hence, in this paper, we employ and extend the approximate Newton
   directions method to optimally coordinate control areas leveraging
   storage available in one area to balance variable resources in another
   area with only minimal information exchange among the areas. The problem
   to be decomposed is a model predictive control problem including
   generation constraints, energy storage constraints, and AC power flow
   constraints. Singularity issues encountered when formulating the
   respective Newton-Raphson steps due to intertemporal constraints are
   addressed and extensions to the original decomposition method are
   proposed to improve the convergence rate and required communication of
   the method.}},

Abstract = {{Sustaining large open source development efforts requires recruiting new
   participants; however, a lack of architectural documentation might
   inhibit new participants since large amounts of project knowledge are
   unavailable to newcomers. We present the results of a multitrait,
   multimethod analysis of the effects of introducing architectural
   documentation into a substantial open source project-the Hadoop
   Distributed File System (HDFS). HDFS had only minimal architectural
   documentation, and we wanted to discover whether the putative benefits
   of architectural documentation could be observed over time. To do this,
   we created and publicized an architecture document and then monitored
   its usage and effects on the project. The results were somewhat
   ambiguous: by some measures the architecture documentation appeared to
   effect the project but not by others. Perhaps of equal importance is our
   discovery that the project maintained, in its web-accessible JIRA
   archive of software issues and fixes, enough architectural discussion to
   support architectural thinking and reasoning. This ``emergent{''}
   architecture documentation served an important purpose in recording core
   project members' architectural concerns and resolutions. However, this
   emergent architecture documentation did not serve all project members
   equally well; it appears that those on the periphery of the
   project-newcomers and adopters-still require explicit architecture
   documentation, as we will show.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless multicast multimedia streaming, every data block (i.e., a
   group of packets) needs to be delivered within a hard deadline. On the
   other hand, to provide multilevel services, the widely adopted scalable
   video coding (SVC) prioritizes a video bit stream into a base layer and
   several enhancement layers. In this paper, we combine SVC with the
   transmission delay constraint and focus on multicasting hard deadline
   constrained prioritized (HDCP) data over wireless erasure channels.
   Specifically, we first define the performance metric and formulate the
   optimization problem. Then, we focus on a new adaptive RNC encoding and
   scheduling scheme to maximize the effective network throughput.
   Particularly, we propose simple and efficient greedy scheduling
   technique, which not only obtains near-optimal performance with low-time
   complexity but also suits time-varying fading channels. In addition, we
   extend our discussion to the more practical scenario with erroneous
   feedback and propose sampling-based feedback mechanism to reduce the
   system overhead. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to
   corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.}},

Title = {{Performance Model for Evaluating Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC)
   Processes for CO2 Capture at Gas-Fired Power Plants}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an indirect combustion process in
   which a carbonaceous fuel is combusted without direct contact with air.
   Rather, transfer of oxygen between air and the fuel takes place with the
   aid of an oxygen-carrier (OC) material, yielding a CO2 stream of very
   high purity. This process is attractive for CO2-capture applications
   because it does not require additional energy to separate CO2 from N-2,
   as in postcombustion CO2-capture processes. In this work, a mass and
   energy balance model has been developed to estimate the performance of a
   CLC system using different OC materials. To simplify the calculations,
   the specific heats of all gases and solids were assumed to be constant
   over the range of temperatures considered. The model was then applied to
   evaluate the effects on system performance of several design and
   operating parameters using three different OC materials. Given input
   conditions such as fuel, reactor operating temperature, fuel and OC
   material, the model calculates the amount of OC required and the
   resulting temperature and system flow rates. The model can be applied to
   any gaseous fuel containing CH4, CO, and H-2. The CLC model, coupled
   with a plant-level systems model, was used to evaluate the performance
   of a conceptual CLC-based natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) power plant,
   using three different OC materials. Two configurations were studied for
   each case: (1) the low-pressure heat-recovery steam generator (LP-HRSG)
   case, where the flue gases from the fuel reactor are first expanded in
   an expander and then sent to a CO2 compressor after the water vapor has
   been condensed, and (2) the high-pressure HRSG (HP-HRSG) case, where the
   flue gases are cooled at high pressure and the CO, is compressed after
   the water vapor has been condensed. In general, the power output and
   efficiency {[}>50\%, on the basis of higher heating value (HHV)] of the
   CLC-NGCC plant were found to be comparable to or higher than those of a
   conventional NGCC power plant without CO, capture and storage (CCS),
   whose net plant efficiency is close to 50\% (HHV). The LP-HRSG
   configuration was found to have a higher net power output (about 10 MW)
   and net plant efficiency (about 2 percentage points) than the HP-HRSG
   configuration. Among the three OC materials, Ni-OC systems gave slightly
   better performance than Fe-OC and Cu-OC systems. Considering that CO2
   capture is inherent in CLC-NGCC plants, CLC appears to be a highly
   competitive CO2-capture technology, at least in terms of overall plant
   performance.}},

   acts as a top-sensing terminal, which is charge-gated. An analytical
   model of the device is given to elaborate how the output current varies
   with the applied force, and a numerical study is conducted to evaluate
   its sensitivity, noise, and dynamic range. The integrated sensor can be
   potentially pixelated to form a high-resolution tactile sensor array,
   promising for electronic skin applications.}},

Abstract = {{In computer architecture research and development, simulation is a
   powerful way of acquiring and predicting processor behaviors. While
   architectural simulation has been extensively utilized for computer
   performance evaluation, design space exploration, and computer
   architecture assessment, it still suffers from the high computational
   costs in practice. Specifically, the total simulation time is determined
   by the simulator's raw speed and the total number of simulated
   instructions. The simulator's speed can be improved by enhanced
   simulation infrastructures (e.g., simulators with high-level
   abstraction, parallel simulators, and hardware-assisted simulators).
   Orthogonal to these work, recent studies also managed to significantly
   reduce the total number of simulated instructions with a slight loss of
   accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that most of these work are built
   upon statistical techniques. This survey presents a comprehensive review
   to such studies and proposes a taxonomy based on the sources of
   reduction. In addition to identifying the similarities and differences
   of state-of-the-art approaches, we further discuss insights gained from
   these studies as well as implications for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-inspired or neuromorphic computing has been proposed as a method
   to overcome the limitations of the von-Neumann architecture.
   Neuromorphic computing relies on an array of neurons interconnected
   locally through synapses to perform computing functions such as pattern
   recognition and image processing. Neuromorphic computing with CMOS-based
   circuits has limited utility due to the relatively large area required
   by neurons and synapses, limiting the size of the neuromorphic network
   implementable on chip. In this paper, we present a novel ultracompact
   graphene variable resistor that can be used to implement both neurons
   and synapses. To illustrate the functionality of the proposed devices,
   we present a 3-bit digitally controlled synapse prototype that occupies
   3 mu m x 9.3 mu m. The proposed devices pave the way for
   high-performance large neuromorphic networks that can be integrated with
   CMOS to augment its functionality or for beyond CMOS computation.}},

Abstract = {{An asymptotic solution to the Giesekus constitutive model of polymeric
   fluids under homogenous, oscillatory simple shear flow at large
   Weissenberg number, Wi >> 1, and large strain amplitude, Wi/De >> 1, is
   constructed. Here, Wi = lambda{*}gamma(0){*}, where lambda{*} is the
   polymer relaxation time and yo is the shear rate amplitude, and De =
   co{*} is a Deborah number, where e is the oscillation frequency. Under
   these conditions, we show that the first normal stress difference is the
   dominant rheological signal, scaling as G{*}Wi(1/2), where G{*} is the
   elastic modulus. The shear stress and second normal stress difference
   are of order G{*}. The polymer stress exhibits pronounced nonlinear
   oscillations, which are partitioned into two temporal regions: (i) A
   ``core region,{''} on the time scale of r, reflecting a balance between
   anisotropic drag and orientation of polymers in the strong flow; and
   (ii) a ``turning region,{''} centered around times when the shear flow
   reverses, whose duration is on the hybrid time scale (lambda{*})(2/3)
   (gamma(0){*})(1/3), in which flow -driven orientation, anisotropic drag,
   and relaxation are all leading order effects. Our asymptotic solution is
   verified against numerical computations, and a qualitative comparison
   with relevant experimental observations is presented. Our results can,
   in principle, be employed to extract the nonlinearity (anisotropic drag)
   parameter, a, of the Giesekus model from experimental data, without the
   need to fit the stress waveform over a complete oscillation cycle.
   Finally, we discuss our findings in relation to recent work on shear
   banding in oscillatory flows. (C) 2016 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum hemicarbide (Mo2C), which is widely applied in steel and

   using a simple method of reducing MoO2 powders by CO. It was found that

   significantly different at lower and higher temperatures: at lower
   temperatures (1070 to 1342 K), reduction of MoO2 to Mo2C followed a
   one-step reaction (simultaneous reduction and carburization), while at
   higher temperatures (1423 to 1485 K), MoO2 was first reduced to metallic
   Mo, and then Mo was carburized to Mo2C. Mo2C particles obtained at
   higher temperatures contained micrometer-sized surface features which

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We test the notion that many microstructures have an underlying
   stationary probability distribution. The stationary probability
   distribution is ubiquitous: we know that different windows taken from a
   polycrystalline microstructure are generally `statistically similar'. To
   enable computation of such a probability distribution, microstructures
   are represented in the form of undirected probabilistic graphs called
   Markov Random Fields (MRFs). In the model, pixels take up integer or
   vector states and interact with multiple neighbors over a window. Using
   this lattice structure, algorithms are developed to sample the
   conditional probability density for the state of each pixel given the
   known states of its neighboring pixels. The sampling is performed using
   reference experimental images. 2D microstructures are artificially
   synthesized using the sampled probabilities. Statistical features such
   as grain size distribution and autocorrelation functions closely match
   with those of the experimental images. The mechanical properties of the
   synthesized microstructures were computed using the finite element
   method and were also found to match the experimental values.}},

Title = {{Development of a first-principles hybrid boiler model for oxy-combustion
   power generation system}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{136-157}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The design of an oxy-combustion system for CO2 capture involves the
   integration of multiple devices including air separation unit,
   coal-fired boiler, steam turbine, flue gas cleanup, recycle, and
   compression units. Thousands of design parameters for the entire system
   need to be optimized to achieve the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour of
   electricity generated. An appropriate first-principles based boiler
   model with short computer execution time but yet reasonable accuracy in
   both air-fired and oxy-fired configurations is highly desired. To this
   end, a hybrid boiler model with 1-D resolution for main flow and
   reaction related calculations and 3-D resolution for radiative heat
   transfer was developed as a part of the oxy-combustion subtask of the
   Carbon Capture and Simulation Initiative (CCSI) sponsored by U.S.
   Department of Energy. The developed model is able to automatically
   generate a 3-D mesh based on user-specified furnace shape for the
   calculation of radiative heat transfer using discrete ordinates method.
   The 3-D cells are assigned to individual regions along the furnace
   height, forming 1-D zones in which conservations of mass and energy in
   both gas and particle phases are enforced. The kinetics of heterogeneous
   reactions between char particles and gas reactants are modeled zone by
   zone in Lagrangian framework. Gas phase chemistry in each zone is
   simplified based on chemical equilibrium. The submodels for calculating
   the radiative properties of the gas and particle phases and those for
   calculating the heterogeneous char reactions are suitable for both
   air-fired and oxy-fired conditions. A typical boiler model can be
   converged in approximately 1 min on a personal computer and, therefore,
   is suitable for the generation of reduced order models in algebraic form
   which could be used for the large-scale multivariable optimization of
   the oxy-combustion systems. By modeling a utility boiler in both
   air-fired and oxy-fired configurations and comparing the results to
   those from computational fluid dynamics simulations, the hybrid boiler
   model was found to give very comparable predictions in major boiler
   performance parameters such as furnace exit gas temperature, heat losses
   to walls, and unburned carbon in fly ash. By modeling a small test
   furnace, it was found that with the adjustments on a ``mixedness{''}
   related effectiveness factor for the char combustion and gasification
   reactions, the boiler model is able to correctly predict the trends of
   incident radiation heat flux profile along the furnace axial length as
   well as the trend of the unburned carbon in both air-fired and oxy-fired
   configurations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   ConclusionsA hybrid position/force control system has been implemented
   that successfully attenuates forces and minimizes unwanted excursions
   during microsurgical procedures such as membrane peeling. Results also
   suggest that improvements in safety using this technique may be attained
   without increasing the duration of the procedure. Copyright (c) 2015

Title = {{Identifying Material and Device Targets for a Flare Gas Recovery System
   Utilizing Electrochemical Conversion of Methane to Methanol}},

Abstract = {{Natural gas flaring causes enormous damage to the environment, in
   addition to the wasted energy. The importance of this problem is
   highlighted by an initiative by the United Nations to end flaring by
   2030. There exists an immediate need for identifying routes for
   converting flare into usable energy. In this study, we propose a scheme
   that at the core utilizes an electrochemical cell to convert methane
   into methanol, an easily transportable fuel. The electrochemical cell
   uses electricity provided by solar photovoltaics to power the
   electrochemical cell. We carry out a detailed techno-economic analysis
   of the entire system and analyze the merits and demerits of the proposed
   approach as compared with other flare gas recovery systems,
   gas-to-liquid (GTL), electricity generation with gas turbine, gas
   compression system, and electricity generation by solid oxide fuel cell
   (SOFC). The developed model shows that the current state-of-the-art
   materials available for different system components, proton conductor,
   and electrocatalysts are inadequate to make the scheme practical. We
   outline the minimum performance metrics, i.e., input voltage at the cell
   level of similar to 0.5 V that corresponds to an overpotential of
   similar to 1 V and a current density of 0.5 A/cm(2) that requires a
   proton conductor that can conduct from 10(-1) to 10(-2) S/cm in the
   temperature range of 100-250 degrees C, required for the system to
   become financially competitive. Of note, improvements in the
   conductivity of proton conductors at intermediate temperatures and
   identification of active and selective electrocatalysts for the
   conversion of methane to methanol are the key parameters that determine
   the overall viability of the proposed scheme. We discuss the
   environmental impacts of the proposed scheme and provide an outlook on
   directions required in materials research that could meet the outlined
   performance metrics.}},

Title = {{Silencing TNF alpha with lipidoid nanoparticles downregulates both TNF
   alpha and MCP-1 in an in vitro co-culture model of diabetic foot ulcers}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{120-128}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Diabetes is one of the most formidable diseases facing the world today,
   with the number of patients growing every year. Poor glycemic control
   yields a host of complications, such as impaired wound healing. This
   often results in the formation of diabetic foot ulcers, which carry a
   poor prognosis because they are notoriously difficult to treat. Current
   therapies do not address the increased number of infiltrating
   macrophages to the wound bed that overproduce tumor necrosis factor
   alpha (TNF alpha), which increases fibroblast apoptosis and collagen
   dismantling and decreases angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated
   the potential of RNA interference therapy to reduce the inappropriately
   high levels of TNF alpha in the wound bed. Although TNF alpha is a
   challenging gene silencing target, our lipidoid nanoparticles potently
   silence TNFa mRNA and protein expression at siRNA doses of 5-100 nM
   without inducing vehicle-related gene silencing or cell death. We also
   describe the creation of an in vitro macrophage-fibroblast co-culture
   model, which reflects the TNF alpha and monocyte chemotactant protein-1
   (MCP-1/CCL2) cross-talk that exists in diabetic wounds. Because TNF
   alpha induces fibroblasts to produce MCP-1, we show that silencing TNF
   alpha results in a downregulation of MCP-1, which should inhibit the
   recruitment of additional macrophages to the wound. In co-culture
   experiments, a single lipidoid nanoparticle dose of 100 nM siTNF alpha
   downregulated TNF alpha and MCP-1 by 64\% and 32\%, respectively. These
   data underscore the potential of lipidoid nanoparticle RNAi treatment to
   inhibit a positive feedback cycle that fuels the pathogenesis of
   diabetic foot ulcers.
   Statement of significance
   Diabetic foot ulcers are a rapidly growing issue worldwide, with current
   ulcer treatments not as effective as desired. RNA interference therapy
   represents a largely untapped possible solution to impaired wound
   healing. We show that siRNA-loaded lipidoid nanoparticles silence the
   overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in
   inflammatory macrophages which leads to a subsequent downregulation of
   fibroblast produced macrophage chemotactant protein-1 (MCP-1). Both TNF
   alpha and MCP-1 are critical components of the inflammatory feedback
   loop that exists in chronic wounds. In contrast to the majority of wound
   drug delivery studies, our study utilizes macrophage/fibroblast
   co-culture experiments to recapitulate a multicellular wound environment
   in which cytokine signaling influences inflammation. Results underscore
   the therapeutic potential of siRNA nanoparticles directed against TNFa
   in inhibiting two key inflammatory targets in chronic wounds. (C) 2015

   A new approach for grain boundary engineering}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Bulk phase transformation kinetics were not well understood before
   Davenport and Bain developed time -temperature-transformation (TTT)
   diagrams for steel alloys in the 1930s. These powerful diagrams
   revolutionized the heat treatment of steel and other alloys. Grain
   boundaries and internal interfaces are now known to behave in a
   phase-like manner, referred to as `complexions', and their transitions
   can be represented on TIT diagrams. We present experimental grain
   boundary complexion TTT diagrams for polycrystalline Al2O3 and Y2O3.
   Grain boundary mobility discontinuities in Y2O3 occur at different
   temperatures for different annealing times, an unusual pattern that
   becomes understandable when viewed on a complexion TIT diagram.
   Similarly, the anisotropy of Al2O3 complexion kinetics can be visualized
   with these diagrams. Complexion TIT diagrams are a graphical tool to
   control interface-related phenomena such as diffusion, creep, oxidation,
   and microstructure evolution. They could explain why two-step sintering
   produces dense nanocrystalline ceramics and offer insight into other
   processes as well. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Motivation: Quantitative shape analysis is required by a wide range of
   biological studies across diverse scales, ranging from molecules to
   cells and organisms. In particular, high-throughput and systems-level
   studies of biological structures and functions have started to produce
   large volumes of complex high-dimensional shape data. Analysis and
   understanding of high-dimensional biological shape data require
   dimension-reduction techniques.
   Results: We have developed a technique for non-linear dimension
   reduction of 2D and 3D biological shape representations on their
   Riemannian spaces. A key feature of this technique is that it preserves
   distances between different shapes in an embedded low-dimensional shape
   space. We demonstrate an application of this technique by combining it
   with non-linear mean-shift clustering on the Riemannian spaces for
   unsupervised clustering of shapes of cellular organelles and proteins.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses air pollution emissions data for the years 2002, 2005,
   2008, and 2011 to estimate monetary damages due to air pollution
   exposure for PM2.3, SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOC from electric power
   generation, oil and gas extraction, coal mining, and oil refineries. In
   2011, damages associated with emissions from these sectors totaled 131
   billion dollars (in 2000\$), with SO2 emissions from power generation
   being the largest contributors to social damages. Further, damages have
   decreased significantly since 2002, even as energy production increased,
   suggesting that, among other factors, policies that have driven
   reductions in emissions have reduced damages. The results of this
   analysis highlight the spatial heterogeneity of the impacts associated
   with the emissions of a given pollutant. In the past, environmental
   regulations have assumed that the benefits of air emissions reductions
   are homogenous across source location. This analysis suggests that
   policy designs that account for spatial differences in the impacts of
   air emissions could result in more effective environmental regulation.
   Accounting for such spatial heterogeneity in the benefits of policies
   would be akin to accounting for differences in compliances costs across
   states, which the EPA did when establishing the state emissions
   standards for the Clean Power Plan rule. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Prompt response and troubleshooting of HVAC-related problems in
   facilities are vital to ensure a comfortable indoor environment for
   occupants. Two main challenges in the current practice result in an ad
   hoc troubleshooting process and waste of resources: the lack of access
   to the required facility and system information in a timely manner and
   the large search space of possible causes for a given HVAC-related
   problem. This paper presents a formalized approach to bring solutions to
   these problems. The approach reasons with a facility-specific
   model-based information repository in order to identify an accurate set
   of applicable causes for a reported HVAC-related problem in the large
   search space of possible causes and to retrieve related facility and
   system information. By eliminating the inapplicable HVAC components and
   space-related factors for a reported problem, the approach increases the
   efficiency of the troubleshooting process. The research enhances the
   existing body of knowledge in the facilities management (FM) domain by
   leveraging building information models (BIMs) to support troubleshooting
   of HVAC-related problems. HVAC mechanics in the practice can use the
   approach to reduce the search space of checking and tracing HVAC
   components and plan ahead of time for their field trip by focusing on
   the right set of components and facility information. (C) 2015 American
