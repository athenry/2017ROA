Abstract = {{There is an undisputed need for temperature-field reconstruction during
   minimally invasive cryosurgery. The current line of research focuses on
   developing miniature, wireless, implantable, temperature sensors to
   enable temperature-field reconstruction in real time. This project
   combines two parallel efforts: (i) to develop the hardware necessary for
   implantable sensors, and (ii) to develop mathematical techniques for
   temperature-field reconstruction in real time the subject matter of the
   current study. In particular, this study proposes an approach for
   temperature-field reconstruction combining data obtained from medical
   imaging, cryoprobe-embedded sensors, and miniature, wireless,
   implantable sensors, the development of which is currently underway.
   This study discusses possible strategies for laying out implantable
   sensors and approaches for data integration. In particular, prostate
   cryosurgery is presented as a developmental model and a two-dimensional
   proof-of-concept is discussed. It is demonstrated that the lethal
   temperature can be predicted to a significant degree of certainty with
   implantable sensors and the technique proposed in the current study, a
   capability that is yet unavailable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Finding Non-Overlapping Clusters for Generalized Inference Over

Abstract = {{Graphical models use graphs to compactly capture stochastic dependencies
   amongst a collection of random variables. Inference over graphical
   models corresponds to finding marginal probability distributions given
   joint probability distributions. In general, this is computationally
   intractable, which has led to a quest for finding efficient approximate
   inference algorithms. We propose a framework for generalized inference
   over graphical models that can be used as a wrapper for improving the
   estimates of approximate inference algorithms. Instead of applying an
   inference algorithm to the original graph, we apply the inference
   algorithm to a block-graph, defined as a graph in which the nodes are
   non-overlapping clusters of nodes from the original graph. This results
   in marginal estimates of a cluster of nodes, which we further
   marginalize to get the marginal estimates of each node. Our proposed
   block-graph construction algorithm is simple, efficient, and motivated
   by the observation that approximate inference is more accurate on graphs
   with longer cycles. We present extensive numerical simulations that
   illustrate our block-graph framework with a variety of inference
   algorithms (e. g., those in the libDAI software package). These
   simulations show the improvements provided by our framework.}},

Abstract = {{PdAgAu alloy films were prepared on porous stainless steel supports by
   sequential electroless deposition. Two specific compositions,
   Pd83Ag2Au15 and Pd74Ag14Au12, were studied for their sulfur tolerance.
   The alloys and a reference Pd foil were exposed to 1000H(2)S/H-2 at 623
   K for periods of 3 and 30 h. The microstructure, morphology and bulk
   composition of both non-exposed and H2S-exposed samples were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). XRD and SEM
   analysis revealed time-dependent growth of a bulk Pd4S phase on the Pd
   foil during H2S exposure. In contrast, the PdAgAu ternary alloys
   displayed the same FCC structure before and after H2S exposure. In
   agreement with the XRD and SEM results, sulfur was not detected in the
   bulk of either ternary alloy samples by EDS, even after 30 h of H2S
   exposure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles were
   acquired for both PdAgAu alloys after 3 and 30 h of exposure to
   characterize sulfur contamination near their surfaces. Very low S 2p and
   S 2s XPS signals were observed at the top-surfaces of the PdAgAu alloys,
   and those signals disappeared before the etch depth reached similar to
   10 nm, even for samples exposed to H2S for 30 h. The depth profile
   analyses also revealed silver and gold segregation to the surface of the
   alloys; preferential location of Au on the alloys surface may be related
   to their resistance to bulk sulfide formation. In preliminary tests, a
   PdAgAu alloy membrane displayed higher initial H-2 permeability than a
   similarly prepared pure Pd sample and, consistent with resistance to
   bulk sulfide formation, lower permeability loss in H2S than pure Pd.

Abstract = {{Neural prostheses translate neural activity from the brain into control
   signals for guiding prosthetic devices, such as computer cursors and
   robotic limbs, and thus offer individuals with disabilities greater
   interaction with the world. However, relatively low performance remains
   a critical barrier to successful clinical translation; current neural
   prostheses are considerably slower, with less accurate control, than the
   native arm. Here we present a new control algorithm, the recalibrated
   feedback intention-trained Kalman filter (ReFIT-KF) that incorporates
   assumptions about the nature of closed-loop neural prosthetic control.
   When tested in rhesus monkeys implanted with motor cortical electrode
   arrays, the ReFIT-KF algorithm outperformed existing neural prosthetic
   algorithms in all measured domains and halved target acquisition time.
   This control algorithm permits sustained, uninterrupted use for hours
   and generalizes to more challenging tasks without retraining. Using this
   algorithm, we demonstrate repeatable high performance for years after
   implantation in two monkeys, thereby increasing the clinical viability
   of neural prostheses.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is an efficient method for gas
   separation and is a potential candidate for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture
   from power plants. However, few PSA cycles have been designed for this
   purpose; the optimal design and operation of PSA cycles for CO2 capture,
   as well as other systems, remains a very challenging task. In this
   study, we present a systematic optimization-based formulation for the
   synthesis and design of novel PSA cycles for CO2 capture in IGCC power
   plants, which can simultaneously produce hydrogen (H2) and CO2 at high
   purity and high recovery. Here, we apply a superstructure-based approach
   to simultaneously determine optimal cycle configurations and design
   parameters for PSA units. This approach combines automatic
   differentiation, efficient ODE solvers for the state and sensitivity
   equations of the PSA model, and state of the art nonlinear programming
   solvers. Three optimization models are proposed, and two PSA case
   studies are considered. The first case study considers a binary
   separation of H2 and CO2 at high purity, where specific energy is
   minimized, whereas the second case study considers a larger five

Abstract = {{We present a decision support framework for science-based assessment and
   multi-stakeholder deliberation. The framework consists of two parts: a
   DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses) analysis to identify
   the important causal relationships among anthropogenic environmental
   stressors, processes, and outcomes; and a Decision Landscape analysis to
   depict the legal, social, and institutional dimensions of environmental
   decisions. The Decision Landscape incorporates interactions among
   government agencies, regulated businesses, non-government organizations,
   and other stakeholders. It also identifies where scientific information
   regarding environmental processes is collected and transmitted to
   improve knowledge about elements of the DPSIR and to improve the
   scientific basis for decisions. Our application of the decision support
   framework to coral reef protection and restoration in the Florida Keys
   focusing on anthropogenic stressors, such as wastewater, proved to be
   successful and offered several insights. Using information from a
   management plan, it was possible to capture the current state of the
   science with a DPSIR analysis as well as important decision options,
   decision makers and applicable laws with a the Decision Landscape
   analysis. A structured elicitation of values and beliefs conducted at a
   coral reef management workshop held in Key West, Florida provided a
   diversity of opinion and also indicated a prioritization of several
   environmental stressors affecting coral reef health. The integrated
   DPSIR/Decision landscape framework for the Florida Keys developed based
   on the elicited opinion and the DPSIR analysis can be used to inform
   management decisions, to reveal the role that further scientific
   information and research might play to populate the framework, and to
   facilitate better-informed agreement among participants.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analysis of SRAM has emerged as a challenging issue because
   the failure rate of SRAM cells is extremely small. In this paper, we
   develop an efficient importance sampling algorithm to capture the rare
   failure event of SRAM cells. In particular, we adapt the Gibbs sampling
   technique from the statistics community to find the optimal probability
   distribution for importance sampling with a low computational cost
   (i.e., a small number of transistor-level simulations). The proposed
   Gibbs sampling method applies an integrated optimization engine to
   adaptively explore the failure region in a Cartesian or spherical
   coordinate system by sampling a sequence of 1-D probability
   distributions. Several implementation issues such as 1-D random sampling
   and starting point selection are carefully studied to make the Gibbs
   sampling method efficient and accurate for SRAM failure rate prediction.
   Our experimental results of a 90nm SRAM cell demonstrate that the
   proposed Gibbs sampling method achieves 1.4-4.9x runtime speedup over
   other state-of-the-art techniques when a high prediction accuracy is
   required (e.g., the relative error defined by the 99\% confidence
   interval reaches 5\%). In addition, we further demonstrate an important
   example for which the proposed Gibbs sampling algorithm accurately
   estimates the correct failure probability, while the traditional
   techniques fail to work.}},

Abstract = {{Sheet specimens of aluminum alloy 5754 were deformed along a series of
   bi-linear, equal-biaxial and uniaxial, strain paths while simultaneously
   measuring stress-strain behavior. The Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent
   crystal plasticity model, which incorporates texture evolution, was used
   to simulate the flow stress and hardening behavior based in part on the
   measured crystallographic texture before deformation. The predicted
   crystallographic texture qualitatively captures the texture measured in
   the experiments. Including latent hardening of multiple slip planes
   allowed the model to explain the decrease in flow stress when changing
   from equal-biaxial to uniaxial deformation. However, the model captures
   neither the details of the drop in flow stress nor the magnitude of the
   plastic hardening after the change in deformation mode. This is likely
   due to room temperature recovery between the two segments of testing.

Abstract = {{The phosphatidylinositolphosphate phosphatase PTEN is the second most
   frequently mutated protein in human tumors. Its membrane association,
   allosteric activation and membrane dissociation are poorly understood.
   We recently reported PTEN binding affinities to membranes of different
   compositions (Shenoy et al., 2012, PLoS ONE 7, e32591) and a preliminary
   investigation of the protein-membrane complex with neutron reflectometry
   (NR). Here we use NR to validate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
   the protein and study conformational differences of the protein in
   solution and on anionic membranes. NR shows that full-length PTEN binds
   to such membranes roughly in the conformation and orientation suggested
   by the crystal structure of a truncated PTEN protein, in contrast with a
   recently presented model which suggested that membrane binding depends
   critically on the SUMOylation of the CBR3 loop of PTEN's C2 domain. Our
   MD simulations confirm that PTEN is peripherally bound to the bilayer
   surface and show slight differences of the protein structure in solution
   and in the membrane-bound state, where the protein body flattens against
   the bilayer surface. PTEN's C2 domain binds phosphatidylserine (PS)
   tightly through its CBR3 loop, and its phosphatase domain also forms
   electrostatic interactions with PS. NR and MD results show consistently
   that PTEN's unstructured, anionic C-terminal tail is repelled from the
   bilayer surface. In contrast, this tail is tightly tugged against the C2
   domain in solution, partially obstructing the membrane-binding interface
   of the protein. Arresting the C-terminal tail in this conformation by
   phosphorylation may provide a control mechanism for PTEN's membrane
   binding and activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Preparation of microfibre constructs of collagen by electrospinning has
   been problematic due to the instability of collagen in volatile
   solvents, such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, so that
   electrospinning leads to a substantial amount of gelatin fibres. In the
   present study we have demonstrated the production of collagen-based
   microfibre constructs by use of a layer-by-layer coating process onto a
   preformed synthetic polymer microfibre base. Soluble native collagen,
   which has a basic isoelectric point, has been used with modified
   triple-helical collagens that have acidic isoelectric points. These
   modified collagens have been prepared as deamidated, succinylated,
   maleylated and citraconylated derivatives. Together, the acidic and
   basic collagens have successfully coated polyacrylonitrile and
   poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) fibres, as shown by spectroscopy and
   microscopy. These coatings allow good cell attachment and spreading on
   the fibres. The native, triple helical form of the collagen has been
   confirmed through use of a conformation dependent monoclonal antibody.

Abstract = {{Adaptive body biasing (ABB) is a popularly used technique to mitigate
   the increasing impact of manufacturing process variations on leakage
   power dissipation. The efficacy of the ABB technique can be improved by
   partitioning a design into a number of ``body-bias islands,{''} each
   with its individual body-bias voltage. In this paper, we propose a
   system-level leakage variability mitigation technique to partition a
   multiprocessor system into body-bias islands at the processing element
   (PE) granularity at design time, and to optimally assign body-bias
   voltages to each island post-fabrication. As opposed to prior gate-and
   circuit-level partitioning techniques that constrain the global clock
   frequency of the system, we allow each island to run at a different
   speed and constrain only the relevant system performance metrics-in our
   case the execution deadlines. Experimental results show the efficacy of
   the proposed methodology; we demonstrate up to 40\% and 60\% reduction
   in the mean and standard deviation of leakage power dissipation
   respectively, compared to a baseline system without ABB. Furthermore,
   the proposed design-time partitioning is, on average, 38x faster than a
   previously proposed Monte Carlo-based technique, while providing similar
   reductions in leakage power dissipation.}},

   approaches to analyze the images and their use to improve annotation. We
   began by training classifiers to recognize the annotated patterns. By
   ranking proteins according to the confidence of the classifier, we
   generated a list of proteins that were strong candidates for
   reexamination. In parallel, we applied hierarchical clustering to group
   proteins and identified proteins whose annotations were inconsistent
   with the remainder of the proteins in their cluster. These proteins were
   reexamined by the original annotators, and a significant fraction had
   their annotations changed. The results demonstrate that automated

Title = {{Estimating Microtubule Distributions from 2D Immunofluorescence
   Microscopy Images Reveals Differences among Human Cultured Cell Lines}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are filamentous structures that are involved in several
   important cellular processes, including cell division, cellular
   structure and mechanics, and intracellular transportation. Little is
   known about potential differences in microtubule distributions within
   and across cell lines. Here we describe a method to estimate information
   pertaining to 3D microtubule distributions from 2D fluorescence images.
   Our method allows for quantitative comparisons of microtubule
   distribution parameters (number of microtubules, mean length) between
   different cell lines. Among eleven cell lines compared, some showed
   differences that could be accounted for by differences in the total
   amount of tubulin per cell while others showed statistically significant
   differences in the balance between number and length of microtubules. We
   also observed that some cell lines that visually appear different in
   their microtubule distributions are quite similar when the model
   parameters are considered. The method is expected to be generally useful
   for comparing microtubule distributions between cell lines and for a
   given cell line after various perturbations. The results are also
   expected to enable analysis of the differences in gene expression
   underlying the observed differences in microtubule distributions among
   cell types.}},

Abstract = {{Drosophila is one of the most important model organisms in biology.
   Knowledge derived from the recently sequenced 12 genomes of various
   Drosophila species can today be combined with the results of more than
   100 years of research to systematically investigate Drosophila biology
   at the molecular level. In order to enable automated, high-throughput
   manipulation of Drosophila embryos, we have developed a microfluidic
   system based on a Pyrex-silicon-Pyrex sandwich structure with
   integrated, surface-micromachined silicon nitride injector for automated
   injection of reagents. Our system automatically retrieves embryos from
   an external reservoir, separates potentially clustered embryos through a
   sheath flow mechanisms, passively aligns an embryo with the integrated
   injector through geometric constraints, and pushes the embryo onto the
   injector through flow drag forces. Automated detection of an embryo at
   injection position through an external camera triggers injection of
   reagents and subsequent ejection of the embryo to an external reservoir.
   Our technology can support automated screens based on Drosophila embryos
   as well as creation of transgenic Drosophila lines. Apart from
   Drosophila embryos, the layout of our system can be easily modified to
   accommodate injection of oocytes, embryos, larvae, or adults of other
   species and fills an important technological gap with regard to
   automated manipulation of multicellular organisms.}},

   carried out without an OH scavenger. SOA yields from OH oxidation of
   alpha-pinene are significantly higher than SOA yields from ozonolysis
   including an OH scavenger, and the SOA mass yields for unscavenged
   ozonolysis generally fall within the range of mass yields for
   alpha-pinene ozonolysis under various conditions. Taken together,
   first-generation product yields parametrized with a volatility basis set
   fit provide a starting point for atmospheric models designed to simulate

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{12687-12696}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the need to understand environmental risks posed by
   potentially biocidal engineered nanoparticles, the effects of silver
   nanoparticle (AgNP) exposure on viability in single species Pseudomonas
   fluorescens biofilms were determined via dye staining methods. AgNP
   dispersions, containing both particles and dissolved silver originating
   from the particles, negatively impacted biofilm viability in a
   dose-dependent manner. No silver treatments (up to 100 ppm AgNPs)
   resulted in 100\% biofilm viability loss, even though these same
   concentrations caused complete viability loss in planktonic culture,
   suggesting some biofilm tolerance to AgNP toxicity. Colloidally stable
   AgNP suspensions exhibited greater toxicity to biofilms than
   corresponding particle-free supernatants containing only dissolved
   silver released from the particles. This distinct nanoparticle-specific
   toxicity was not observed for less stable, highly aggregated particles,
   suggesting that biofilms were protected against nanoparticle aggregate
   toxicity. In both the stable and highly aggregated dispersions,
   dissolved silver made a significant contribution to overall toxicity.
   Therefore, despite increased colloidal stability when humic acid
   adsorbed to AgNPs, the presence of humic acid mitigated the toxicity of
   AgNP suspensions because it bound to silver ions in solution.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the dependence of adhesion on retraction speed in elastic
   fibrillar structures. The evolution of the real contact area and crack
   propagation speeds at the contact interface was characterized during
   retraction using a custom measurement system. The experimental results
   showed an increase in the average crack propagation speed and the rate
   of change of real contact area during pull-off, for increasing
   retraction speed. Our results indicate that during pull-off, the
   critical contact area does not have significant contribution to

   adhesion. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   `'-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), an excellent control over chain
   length and end-group functionality is possible, and copolymers with a
   good linear gradient quality at final conversion can be prepared.
   Moreover, for sufficiently high conversions and depending on the monomer
   reactivity ratios, a strong correlation exists between < GD > and the
   polydispersity index (PDI), allowing an approximate assessment of the
   linear gradient quality based on PDI. For higher targeted chain lengths,
   this correlation shifts toward lower < GD > values under controlled ATRP
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to extend a simple NPV (net present

   complex fiscal rules. In particular, we consider a recently proposed
   multifield site strategic planning model for offshore oil and gas fields
   as a basis to include the generic fiscal rules with ringfencing
   provisions. The reduction of this model to a variety of contracts is
   explained. The results on the realistic instances show improved
   investment and operations decisions due to the explicit consideration of
   the fiscal terms during planning. However, as the model can become
   computationally very expensive to solve with the extension to sliding
   scale fiscal rules, we also provide some reformulation/approximation
   techniques and solution strategies that yield orders of magnitude
   reduction in the solution time.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Cross-sectional geometry influences the pressure-controlled conductivity
   of liquid-phase metal channels embedded in an elastomer film. These soft
   microfluidic films may function as hyperelastic electric wiring or
   sensors that register the intensity of surface pressure. As pressure is
   applied to the elastomer, the cross-section of the embedded channel
   deforms, and the electrical resistance of the channel increases. In an
   effort to improve sensitivity and reduce sensor nonlinearity and
   hysteresis, we compare the electrical response of 0.25 mm(2) channels
   with different cross-sectional geometries. We demonstrate that channels
   with a triangular or concave cross-section exhibit the least
   nonlinearity and hysteresis over pressures ranging from 0 to 70 kPa.
   These experimental results are in reasonable agreement with predictions
   made by theoretical calculations that we derive from elasticity and
   Ohm's Law. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We describe a new technique that works from a set of concept sketches to
   support the exploration and engineering of products. Our approach allows
   the capture and reuse of geometric shape information contained in
   concept sketches, as a means to generate solutions that can concurrently
   satisfy aesthetic and functional requirements. At the heart of our
   approach is a graph-based representation of sketches that allows the
   determination of topological and geometric similarities in the input
   sketches. This analysis, when combined with a geometric deformation
   analysis, results in a design space from which new shapes can be
   synthesized, or a developing design can be optimized to satisfy
   prescribed objectives. Moreover, it facilitates a sketch-based,
   interactive editing of existing designs that preserves the shape
   characteristics captured in the design space. A key advantage of the
   proposed method is that shape features common to all sketches as well as
   those unique to each sketch can be separately identified, thus allowing
   a mixing of different sketches to generate a topologically and
   geometrically rich set of conceptual alternatives. We demonstrate our
   technique with 2D and 3D examples. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007147]}},

Abstract = {{Great design often results from intelligently balancing tradeoffs and
   leveraging of synergies between multiple product goals. While the
   engineering design community has numerous tools for managing the
   interface between functional goals in products, there are currently no
   formalized methods to concurrently optimize stylistic form and
   functional requirements. This research develops a method to coordinate
   seemingly disparate but highly related goals of stylistic form and
   functional constraints in computational design. An artificial neural
   network (ANN) based machine learning system was developed to model
   surveyed consumer judgments of stylistic form quantitatively. Coupling
   this quantitative model of stylistic form with a genetic algorithm (GA)
   enables computers to concurrently account for multiple objectives in the
   domains of stylistic form and more traditional functional performance
   evaluation within the same quantitative framework. This coupling then
   opens the door for computers to automatically generate products that not
   only work well but also convey desired styles to consumers. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Today's multi-million digital integrated circuit design highly depends
   on the quality of the standard cell library. In this study, an
   all-digital reconfigurable-array-based test structure is presented to
   test the quality (i.e. functionality and performance) of all types of
   logic gates in the standard cell library using the reconfigurable array
   of gate delay measurement cell. The gate delay is estimated using the
   least squares method with measured reconfigurable ring oscillator's (RO)
   period/frequency. As the least squares method averages out the random
   noise in the measured RO period, measured gate delay is estimated
   accurately. The reconfigurable-array structure can easily isolate a
   faulty standard cell from a non-faulty standard cell. The test structure
   is area efficient with a saving of 1.6x and 2x area compared with the
   normal RO-based delay measurement in 180 nm and 65 nm technology node,
   respectively. A subset of standard cells is tested using this
   reconfigurable-array structure. A test chip has been fabricated in an
   industrial 180 nm technology node to study the feasibility of the
   approach. The measured results from 20 chips are reported to show the

Abstract = {{Locating building components that need to be worked on during
   maintenance tasks is critical for timely repair of the component and
   mitigation of the damage. The process of locating a component or a
   person in a facility is called indoor localization. The objective of
   this research study is to analyze the feasibility of three indoor
   localization technologies for supporting operations and maintenance
   (O\&M) field tasks; namely, wireless local area network (WLAN), radio
   frequency identification (RFID) tags, and inertial measurement units
   (IMU). These technologies have been selected on the basis of the
   requirements of the localization needed for supporting O\&M field
   activities. A previous work has been extended, which tested RFID-based
   locations in an indoor environment, by testing the three selected
   technologies in the same test bed and using the same hypothesis and
   fingerprinting approach developed in the previous work. The two main
   motivations behind using the same test bed and same approach are to have
   the same baseline to evaluate the performance of the three technologies
   and to evaluate the performance of RFID-based localization over longer
   periods. The results in the present study show that RFID-based
   localization suffers from a decrease in signal strength levels over
   several years, and that WLAN-based localization suffers from variations
   in signal strength. They also show that IMU-based localization suffers
   from drift in the sensors of IMU. Prior knowledge of the layout of a
   facility can improve the performance of WLAN, RFID, and IMU-based
   localization. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000177. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Composition spread alloy films (CSAFs) are materials libraries used for
   high throughput investigations of multicomponent materials such as
   alloys, A(x)B(y)C(1-x-y). CSAFs are prepared such that the alloy film
   has a lateral spatial gradient in its local composition; thus, they
   include a set of alloy samples with a distribution of compositions that
   spans a continuous region of composition space (x,y). A tool based on
   the shadow mask concept has been developed for generating composition
   gradients, but modified to allow rotation of the shadow mask during CSAF
   deposition. The tool allows deposition of CSAFs containing up to four
   elements with rotatable shadow masks between each of the four electron
   beam evaporation sources and the deposition substrate. This allows
   codeposition of any combination of up to four components. In the case of
   the ternary A(x)B(y)C(1-x-y) CSAFs, the three components can be
   deposited such that the resulting CSAF spans the entire ternary alloy
   composition space (x = 0 -> 1, y = 0 -> 1 - x) and, furthermore,
   contains all three binary alloys A(x)B(1-x), A(x)C(1-x), and BxC1-x (x =
   0 -> 1) and all three pure components. The innovation of the rotatable
   shadow masks also allows preparation of CSAFs that magnify selected
   regions of the composition space (x = x(min) -> x(max), y = y(min) -> 1
   - x). Herein, we describe the design and performance of this new CSAF
   deposition tool and assess its merits and limitations with respect to
   other methods for CSAF preparation. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Title = {{Study of surface cleaning methods and pyrolysis temperatures on

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured carbon (ns-C) films fabricated by stabilization and
   pyrolysis of diblock copolymers are of interest for a variety of
   electrical/electronic applications due to their chemical inertness,
   high-temperature insensitivity, very high surface area, and tunable
   electrical resistivity over a wide range {[}Kulkarni , Synth. Met. 159,
   177 (2009)]. Because of their high porosity and associated high specific
   surface area, controlled surface cleaning studies are important for
   fabricating electronic devices from these films. In this study,
   quantification of surface composition and surface cleaning studies on
   ns-C films synthesized by carbonization of diblock copolymers of
   polyacrylonitrile-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate) at two different temperatures
   were carried out. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used for
   elemental analysis and to determine the efficacy of various surface
   cleaning methods for ns-C films and to examine the polymer residues in
   the films. The in-situ surface cleaning methods included HF vapor
   treatment, vacuum annealing, and exposure to UV-ozone. Quantitative
   analysis of high-resolution XPS scans showed 11 at. \% nitrogen was
   present in the films pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C, suggesting incomplete
   denitrogenation of the copolymer films. The nitrogen atomic
   concentration decreased significantly for films pyrolyzed at 900 degrees
   C confirming extensive denitrogenation at that temperature. Furthermore,
   quantitative analysis of nitrogen subpeaks indicated higher loss of
   nitrogen atoms residing at the edge of graphitic clusters relative to
   that of nitrogen atoms within the graphitic clusters, suggesting higher
   graphitization with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Of the surface
   cleaning methods investigated, in-situ annealing of the films at 300
   degrees C for 40 min was found to be the most efficacious in removing
   adventitious carbon and oxygen impurities from the surface. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The oxidation characteristics of tungsten line pattern during the
   carbon-based mask-layer removal process using oxygen plasmas have been
   investigated for sub-50 nm patterning processes, in addition to the
   reduction characteristics of the WOx layer formed on the tungsten line
   surface using hydrogen plasmas. The surface oxidation of tungsten lines
   during the mask layer removal process could be minimized by using
   low-temperature (300 K) plasma processing for the removal of the
   carbon-based material. Using this technique, the thickness of WOx on the
   tungsten line could be decreased to 25\% compared to results from
   high-temperature processing. The WOx layer could also be completely
   removed at a low temperature of 300 K using a hydrogen plasma by
   supplying bias power to the tungsten substrate to provide a activation
   energy for the reduction. When this oxidation and reduction technique
   was applied to actual 40-nm-CD device processing, the complete removal
   of WOx formed on the sidewall of tungsten line could be observed. (C)

Abstract = {{A new technique, combinatorial substrate epitaxy, has been used to study
   the polymorphic stability and orientation relationships (ORs) for TiO2
   thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition on polycrystalline BiFeO3 at
   600 degrees C. Electron backscatter diffraction data from 150
   substrate/film pairs were analyzed to determine that anatase (A) grew
   with the OR (1 1 2)(A)parallel to(1 1 1)(BFO) and {[}1 (1) over bar
   0](A) parallel to {[}1 (1) over bar 0](BFO) on BiFeO3 (BFO) substrates
   oriented within 35 degrees of {[}100]. Rutile (R) was found on all other
   substrate orientations with (100)(R)parallel to(1 1 1)(BFO). The

   rates and supersaturation for solids crystallized from solutions of

   data from a single experiment. Supersaturation and crystal growth rate
   obtained experimentally were in good agreement with model predictions.
   In particular, data indicated that for the system at hand, crystal
   growth rate is inversely proportional to crystals size. Further, the
   solute integration coefficient determined from supersaturation
   measurements can be slightly overestimated due to surface nucleation
   and/or agglomeration that can result from supersaturation spikes during
   antisolvent addition. Last, crystal growth data obtained at different
   temperatures indicated that slow growth rate observed at low
   temperatures is likely to be due in part to surface poisoning by the
   wrong conformer.}},

Abstract = {{Nature has demonstrated the ability to create highly efficient reactions
   on small scales by using dimensional constraints and geometric
   advantages in unique and powerful ways. Inspired by elegant nanoscale
   cytoskeletal reactions, we have demonstrated a novel method for
   accelerating the rates of reactions by controlling spatiotemporal
   relationships using synthetic templating for multifunctional
   nanoarchitectures. In our model system we used tetrameric
   beta-galactosidase, split into a pair of nonreactive dimers, and
   organized them to have a strong affinity for microtubules. This
   microtubule templating increases the concentration of the dimers to a
   level at which they will frequently reform into active tetramers. The
   reactive activity of the beta-galactosidase was monitored by X-gal,
   which enabled us to demonstrate a nearly 30-fold increase in the maximum
   rate of reaction. We have shown that the use of biologically inspired
   approaches will give us the ability to control some of the essential
   basics in biology and medical chemistry through increasing reaction
   rates. These results will have applications in a wide range of fields
   including nanotechnology, synthetic biology, chemistry, engineering, and
   polymer physics.}},

   transfer torque-driven domain wall motion, which programs the resistance
   state of a magnetic tunnel junction in an electrically-insulated but
   magnetically-coupled path. Despite the low switching ratios of the
   devices, limited by the tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, logic circuits
   independent of CMOS may be configured using current-based signaling.
   Micromagnetic analysis of device performance and the concepts of mLogic

Abstract = {{Recently, the demands for increasing memory capacities in hard disk
   drives (HDDs) has resulted in state-of-the-art technologies including
   heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) with significantly higher
   operating temperatures. HAMR results in swift degradation of current
   lubricant and carbon overcoat (COC) materials, leading to magnetic media
   corrosion which is detrimental to HDD operation. In addition, the lack
   of thorough understanding of the temperature profiles arising from the
   hotspot and energy management throughout these materials also
   exacerbates the problem. To address this issue, in this paper we will
   focus on the COC and investigate the transient heat transfer in various
   examples of nanoscale thin films when a hot spot is created via lattice
   Boltzmann method (LBM) since traditional conduction models like Fourier
   law are not accurate due to dominant sub-continuum effects. LBM
   originates from the Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) and is
   computationally efficient due to easy parallelization with convenient
   handling of complex geometries. Our results of the heat transfer
   mechanism and temperature profiles show that Fourier equation
   under-predicts the peak temperature rise at the center of the hot-spot
   as the system size approaches the nanoscale domain. Applying LBM to a
   multilayered system, we observe a temperature slip along the interface
   of two materials indicated by the broken isothermal contours, as the
   heat is confined to a single layer. Using LBM, we then explore a novel
   graphene overcoat which has outstanding thermo-mechanical properties,
   and thereby extremely compatible in HAMR applications.}},

Abstract = {{The critical issue facing head-disk interface (HDI) design is
   determining the optimal combination of lubricant and overcoat materials.
   A high performing lubricant should have sufficient adhesion to the
   carbon overcoat (COC) layer to prevent spin-off, while the COC material
   protects the magnetic media from corrosion and tribological damage. In
   this paper, we examine at the atomistic level COC material performance
   by calculating the adhesive interactions between various types of model
   perfluoropolyether (PFPE) functional lubricants and COC. The COC
   materials we investigated include industry standard diamond-like carbon
   (DLC), composed of graphitic (sp(2) bonded) and diamond (sp(3) bonded)
   type carbon. In addition, we investigated the atomically thin graphene
   and pure diamond COCs to determine the effect of carbon structure on
   PFPE adhesion. These pure diamond and graphene results support the
   observation that the PFPE interacts more strongly with the graphitic
   content in DLC. The difference between the results for diamond and
   graphene are due to the sp(2) bonding in graphene with delocalized
   electrons in the aromatic ring, whereas in the diamond structure,
   electrons are bound by the extra C-H bond. Our density functional theory
   study of PFPE interaction with these three COC materials shows that
   Ztetraol has the strongest adhesion on all of the COCs investigated.
   Based on our investigation, we would conclude that an ideal COC material
   should have high graphitic content to promote strong PFPE adhesion. We
   also evaluated the feasibility of pure graphene to promote PFPE
   adhesion. We extend our analysis to explore dimensional crossover to
   gauge the effect of COC thickness on adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{We establish the large deviations asymptotic performance (error
   exponent) of consensus+innovations distributed detection over random
   networks with generic (non-Gaussian) sensor observations. At each time
   instant, sensors 1) combine theirs with the decision variables of their
   neighbors (consensus) and 2) assimilate their new observations
   (innovations). This paper shows for general non-Gaussian distributions
   that consensus+innovations distributed detection exhibits a phase
   transition behavior with respect to the network degree of connectivity.
   Above a threshold, distributed is as good as centralized, with the same
   optimal asymptotic detection performance, but, below the threshold,
   distributed detection is suboptimal with respect to centralized
   detection. We determine this threshold and quantify the performance loss
   below threshold. Finally, we show the dependence of the threshold and of
   the performance on the distribution of the observations: the asymptotic
   performance of distributed detectors over the same random network with
   different observations' distributions, for example, Gaussian, Laplace,
   or quantized, may be different, even though the asymptotic performance
   of the corresponding centralized detectors is the same.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanoparticles on structured supports are used in a variety of
   technological applications including biosensing, energy harvesting, and
   electronics. In every case, the functions and properties of the metallic
   nanostructures depend on both their composition and structure (i.e.
   size, shape, and spatial distribution). Among the challenges to the
   development of metal nanoparticles for these applications is the
   characterization of relationships between their structure and their
   functional properties over multiple structural degrees of freedom
   spanning a large range of values. In this work, a method for creating a
   morphological gradient of metal nanoparticles on a substrate is
   described. The approach, suited for high-throughput fabrication and
   characterization, is based on spinodal dewetting of a metallic thin film
   from its substrate. Through control of initial film thickness, anneal
   temperature, and anneal time, spinodal dewetting results in supported
   nanoparticles with well-defined and controlled structure. The approach
   is demonstrated through its application to preparation of Pd
   nanoparticles on a silicon nitride substrate. The morphologies of the
   particles were characterized by scanning electron and atomic force
   microscopies. Free energy-based stability and topological analyses were
   used to confirm the dewetting mechanism. In addition, the stability
   theory provides a connection to the thermophysical properties of the
   resulting nanoparticle array. The dewetting approach is general to any
   metal/support system and provides an alternative, inexpensive, and
   robust means to rapidly create metal nanostructures with control of
   morphology. It shows promise for large scale production of metal
   nanoparticles structures, as well as understanding basic stability
   properties of thin metal films. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Total energy consumption of video game consoles has grown rapidly in the
   past few decades due to rapid increases in market penetration, power
   consumption of the devices, and increasing usage driven by new
   capabilities. Unfortunately, studies investigating the energy impacts of
   these devices have been limited and potential responses, such as ENERGY
   STAR requirements, have been difficult to define and implement. We
   estimate that the total electricity consumption of video game consoles
   in the US was around 11 TWh in 2007 and 16 TWh in 2010 (approximately 1
   \% of US residential electricity consumption), an increase of almost 50
   \% in 3 years. However, any estimate of total game console energy
   consumption is highly uncertain, and we have determined that the key
   uncertainty is the unknown consumer behavior with regards to powering
   down the system after use. Even under this uncertainty, we demonstrate
   that the most effective energy-saving modification is incorporation of a
   default auto power down feature, which could reduce electricity
   consumption of game consoles by 75 \% (10 TWh reduction of electricity
   in 2010), saving consumers over \$1 billion annually in electricity
   bills. We conclude that using an auto power down feature for game
   consoles is at least as effective for reducing energy consumption as
   implementing a strict set of energy efficiency improvements for the
   devices, is much easier to implement given the nature of the video game
   console industry, and could be applied retroactively to currently
   deployed consoles through firmware updates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers opportunistic primary-secondary spectrum sharing
   when the primary is a rotating radar. A secondary device is allowed to
   transmit when its resulting interference will not exceed the radar's
   tolerable level, in contrast to current approaches that prohibit
   secondary transmissions if radar signals are detected at any time. We
   consider the case where an OFDMA based secondary system operates in
   non-contiguous cells, as might occur with a broadband hotspot service,
   or a cellular system that uses spectrum shared with radar to supplement
   its dedicated spectrum. It is shown that even fairly close to a radar,
   extensive secondary transmissions are possible, although with some
   interruptions and fluctuations as the radar rotates. For example, at
   27\% of the distance at which secondary transmissions will not affect
   the radar, on average, the achievable secondary data rates in down- and
   upstreams are around 100\% and 63\% of the one that will be achieved in
   dedicated spectrum, respectively. Moreover, extensive secondary
   transmissions are still possible even at different values of key system
   parameters, including cell radius, transmit power, tolerable
   interference level, and radar rotating period. By evaluating quality of
   service, it is found that spectrum shared with radar could be used
   efficiently for applications such as non-interactive video on demand,
   peer-to-peer file sharing, file transfers, automatic meter reading, and
   web browsing, but not for applications such as real-time transfers of
   small files and VoIP.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic framework for the integration of short-term scheduling and
   dynamic optimization (DO) of batch processes is described. The state
   equipment network (SEN) is used to represent a process system, where it
   decomposes the process into two basic kinds of entities: process
   materials and process units. Mathematical modeling based on the SEN
   framework invokes both logical disjunctions and operational dynamics;
   thus the integrated formulation leads to a mixed-logic dynamic
   optimization (MLDO) problem. The integrated approach seeks to benefit
   the overall process performance by incorporating process dynamics into
   scheduling considerations. The solution procedure of an MLDO problem is
   also addressed in this article, where MLDO problems are translated into
   mixed-integer nonlinear programs using the Big M reformulation and the
   simultaneous collocation method. Finally, through two case studies, we
   show advantages of the integrated approach over the conventional
   recipe-based scheduling method. (c) 2012 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{A plethora of biochemical signals provides spatial and temporal cues
   that carefully orchestrate the complex process of vertebrate embryonic
   development. The embryonic vasculature develops not only in the context
   of these biochemical cues, but also in the context of the biomechanical
   forces imparted by blood flow. In the mature vasculature, different
   blood flow regimes induce distinct genetic programs, and significant
   progress has been made toward understanding how these forces are
   perceived by endothelial cells and transduced into biochemical signals.
   However, it cannot be assumed that paradigms that govern the mature
   vasculature are pertinent to the developing embryonic vasculature. The
   embryonic vasculature can respond to the mechanical forces of blood
   flow, and these responses are critical in vascular remodeling, certain
   aspects of sprouting angiogenesis, and maintenance of arterial-venous
   identity. Here, we review data regarding mechanistic aspects of
   endothelial cell mechanotransduction, with a focus on the response to
   shear stress, and elaborate upon the multifarious effects of shear
   stress on the embryonic vasculature. In addition, we discuss emerging
   predictive vascular growth models and highlight the prospect of
   combining signaling pathway information with computational modeling. We
   assert that correlation of precise measurements of hemodynamic
   parameters with effects on endothelial cell gene expression and cell
   behavior is required for fully understanding how blood flow-induced
   loading governs normal vascular development and shapes congenital
   cardiovascular abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{Jamming attacks are especially harmful to the reliability of wireless
   communication, as they can effectively disrupt communication between any
   node pairs. Existing jamming defenses primarily focus on repairing
   connectivity between adjacent nodes. In this paper, we address jamming
   at the network level and focus on restoring the end-to-end data delivery
   through multipath routing. As long as all paths do not fail
   concurrently, the end-to-end path availability is maintained. Prior work
   in multipath selection improves routing availability by choosing
   node-disjoint paths or link-disjoint paths. However, through our
   experiments on jamming effects using MicaZ nodes, we show that
   disjointness is insufficient for selecting fault-independent paths.
   Thus, we address multipath selection based on the knowledge of a path's
   availability history. Using Availability History Vectors (AHVs) of
   paths, we present a centralized AHV-based algorithm to select
   fault-independent paths, and a distributed AHV-based routing protocol
   built on top of a classic routing algorithm in ad hoc networks. Our
   extensive simulation results validate that both AHV-based algorithms are
   effective in overcoming the jamming impact by maximizing the end-to-end
   availability of the selected paths.}},

   scheduling; however, whenever a task reaches a state of zero laxity it
   is given the highest priority. FPSL and FPCL are variants of FPZL that
   introduce no additional scheduling points beyond those present with
   fixed priority scheduling. FPSL, FPCL and FPZL are minimally dynamic
   algorithms, in that the priority of a job can change at most once during
   its execution, bounding the number of pre-emptions.
   Polynomial time and pseudo-polynomial time sufficient schedulability
   tests are derived for these algorithms. The tests are then improved by
   computing upper bounds on the amount of execution that each task can
   perform at the highest priority. An empirical evaluation shows that
   FPSL, FPCL, and FPZL are highly effective, with a significantly larger
   number of tasksets deemed schedulable by the tests derived in this
   paper, than by state-of-the-art schedulability tests for EDZL
   scheduling.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the phenomenon of incomplete wetting of a high-energy
   liquid subphase by drops of pure amphiphilic molecules as well as drops
   of amphiphile solutions that are immiscible with the subphase. We show
   that amphiphiles escape across the contact line of the drop, move on the
   subphase/vapor interface, and form a submonolayer or full monolayer
   external to the drop. If this monolayer is sufficiently dense, then it
   can reduce the surface tension of the subphase, raise the contact angle
   of the drop, and prevent the drop from fully wetting the subphase. This
   phenomenon is called autophobing and has been extensively studied on
   solid substrates. For the liquid subphase studied here, we measure the
   surface tensions of the three relevant interfaces before and after the
   drop is deposited. The measured surface tension external to the drop
   shows that amphiphiles can move across the contact line and form a
   monolayer outside of the drop. In some cases, at equilibrium, the
   monolayer is in a sufficiently packed state to create the nonwetting
   condition. In other cases, at equilibrium the monolayer density is
   insufficient to lower the surface tension enough to achieve the
   nonwetting condition. Unlike on solid substrates where the formation of
   the monolayer external to the drop is kinetically hindered, the
   amphiphiles can move rapidly across the liquid subphase by
   Marangoni-driven surface transport, and local equilibrium is achieved.
   However, because the amphiphile inventory and subphase area are limited,
   the achievement of autophobing on a liquid subphase depends not only on
   the instrinsic subphase/amphiphile interaction but also on the total
   amphiphile inventory and area of the liquid subphase.}},

Abstract = {{The enantiospecific desorption kinetics of R- and S-propylene oxide (PO)
   from a Cu(100) surface modified by enantiomerically pure D- or L-lysine
   have been studied using temperature programmed desorption. These
   experiments have used R- or S-PO as the chiral probe for study of
   enantiospecific adsorption on Cu(100) surfaces modified with D- or
   L-lysine. This chiral probe/modifier/Cu system manifests a significant
   diastereomeric effect in the R- and S-PO peak desorption temperatures
   and, hence, true enantiospecific behavior. The enantiospecificity in the
   PO desorption kinetics is observed only over a narrow range of lysine
   modifier coverage with a maximum at a lysine coverage leaving an empty
   site density of theta(O) approximate to 0.25. The observation of
   enantiospecific behavior in the PO/lysine/Cu(100) system is in contrast
   with the failed results of prior attempts to observe enantiospecific
   desorption from chirally modified Cu surfaces. The potential for
   hydrogen-bonding interactions between the chiral probe and chiral
   modifier, which can depend on the coverage and configuration of the
   adsorbed modifier, may play a crucial role in enantiospecific adsorption
   on lysine modified Cu surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Amine-based solvents are likely to play an important role in CO2 capture
   applications in the future, and the identification of amines with
   superior performance will facilitate their use in CO2 capture. While
   some improvements in performance will be achieved through process
   modifications, modifying the CO2 capture performance of an amine also
   implies in part an ability to modify the reactions between the amine and
   CO2 through development of new fiinctionalized amines. We present a
   computational study of trends in the reactions between CO2 and
   functionalized amines with a focus on identifying molecular descriptors
   that determine trends in reactivity. We examine the formation of
   bicarbonate and carbamate species on three classes of functionalized
   amines: alkylamines, alkanolamines, and fluorinated alkylamines
   including primary, secondary, and tertiary amines in each class. These
   functional groups span electron-withdrawing to donating behavior,
   hydrogen-bonding, extent of functionalization, and proximity effects of
   the functional groups. Electron withdrawing groups tend to destabilize
   CO2 reaction products, whereas electron-donating groups tend to
   stabilize CO2 reaction products. Hydrogen bonding stabilizes CO2
   reaction products. Electronic structure descriptors based on
   electronegativity were found to describe trends in the bicarbonate
   formation energy. A chemical correlation was observed between the
   carbamate formation energy and the carbamic acid formation energy. The
   local softness on the reacting N in the amine was found to partially
   explain trends of carbamic acid formation energy.}},

Title = {{Inferring Species Richness and Turnover by Statistical Multiresolution
   Texture Analysis of Satellite Imagery}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The quantification of species-richness and species-turnover
   is essential to effective monitoring of ecosystems. Wetland ecosystems
   are particularly in need of such monitoring due to their sensitivity to
   rainfall, water management and other external factors that affect
   hydrology, soil, and species patterns. A key challenge for environmental
   scientists is determining the linkage between natural and human
   stressors, and the effect of that linkage at the species level in space
   and time. We propose pixel intensity based Shannon entropy for
   estimating species-richness, and introduce a method based on statistical
   wavelet multiresolution texture analysis to quantitatively assess
   interseasonal and interannual species turnover.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We model satellite images of regions of
   interest as textures. We define a texture in an image as a spatial
   domain where the variations in pixel intensity across the image are both
   stochastic and multiscale. To compare two textures quantitatively, we
   first obtain a multiresolution wavelet decomposition of each. Either an
   appropriate probability density function (pdf) model for the
   coefficients at each subband is selected, and its parameters estimated,
   or, a non-parametric approach using histograms is adopted. We choose the
   former, where the wavelet coefficients of the multiresolution
   decomposition at each subband are modeled as samples from the
   generalized Gaussian pdf. We then obtain the joint pdf for the
   coefficients for all subbands, assuming independence across subbands; an
   approximation that simplifies the computational burden significantly
   without sacrificing the ability to statistically distinguish textures.
   We measure the difference between two textures' representative pdf's via
   the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). Species turnover, or b diversity,
   is estimated using both this KL divergence and the difference in Shannon
   entropy. Additionally, we predict species richness, or a diversity,
   based on the Shannon entropy of pixel intensity. To test our approach,
   we specifically use the green band of Landsat images for a water
   conservation area in the Florida Everglades. We validate our predictions
   against data of species occurrences for a twenty-eight years long period
   for both wet and dry seasons. Our method correctly predicts 73\% of
   species richness. For species turnover, the newly proposed KL divergence
   prediction performance is near 100\% accurate. This represents a
   significant improvement over the more conventional Shannon entropy
   difference, which provides 85\% accuracy. Furthermore, we find that
   changes in soil and water patterns, as measured by fluctuations of the
   Shannon entropy for the red and blue bands respectively, are positively
   correlated with changes in vegetation. The fluctuations are smaller in
   the wet season when compared to the dry season.
   Conclusions/Significance: Texture-based statistical multiresolution
   image analysis is a promising method for quantifying interseasonal
   differences and, consequently, the degree to which vegetation, soil, and
   water patterns vary. The proposed automated method for quantifying
   species richness and turnover can also provide analysis at higher
   spatial and temporal resolution than is currently obtainable from
   expensive monitoring campaigns, thus enabling more prompt, more cost
   effective inference and decision making support regarding anomalous
   variations in biodiversity. Additionally, a matrix-based visualization
   of the statistical multiresolution analysis is presented to facilitate
   both insight and quick recognition of anomalous data.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal expansion and magnetostriction of Nd2Fe14Si3 polycrystalline
   intermetallic compound was measured, using the strain gauge method in
   the temperature range 77-590 K under applied magnetic fields up to 1.5
   T. Results show that both linear thermal expansion and linear thermal
   expansion coefficient exhibit anomalies below Curie temperature. A
   pronounced positive spontaneous volume magnetostriction has been
   observed below the Curie temperature. The spontaneous volume
   magnetostriction decreases with Si substitution in Nd2Fe17 compound. The
   saturation trend of the anisotropic magnetostriction below 115 K depends
   on the saturation of the lambda(gamma) mode. In the low field region (mu
   H-0 < 0.3 T), a minimum appears in the isothermal curves of the volume
   magnetostriction that may be attributed to the domain walls motion and
   rotation of the magnetic moments of domains toward the applied field
   direction. The results of the spontaneous and anisotropic
   magnetostriction are discussed based on the local magnetic moment model
   and irreducible magnetoelastic coupling modes, respectively. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In a previous paper, Alattas, Grossmann, and Palou-Rivera (2011)
   developed a single-period, nonlinear programing refinery planning model
   using the fractionation index (FI) for the crude distillation unit (CDU)
   equations. In this paper, the single period model is modified to a
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to determine the
   sequencing, changeovers, and processing times of crude oils over
   multiple time periods. The MINLP equations include traveling salesman
   problem constraints to generate the crude oil sequences that maximize
   profit. Moreover, the disjunction for the fractionation index (FI) is
   formulated with mixed integer constraints as opposed to the Heaviside
   function formulation of the previous work. The resulting model is shown
   to be robust and relatively fast. When subcycles arise, they are
   eliminated by adding appropriate subtour elimination constraints.
   Examples with up to 5 crude oils and 6 weeks time horizon are presented
   to illustrate the application of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Transient currents associated with electroforming TiO2-based resistive
   switching devices were measured using three distinct circuits designed
   to limit them, and they were correlated with physical changes in the top
   electrode using scanning electron microscopy. A transient current more
   than 10 times greater than expected was observed when only using the
   source meter to limit the current via the compliance set point. The
   large excursion arose from equipment delays and resulted in significant
   physical changes to the top electrode. An external resistor was used to
   decrease the excess transient current value to nearly zero, as long as
   parasitic capacitive discharges were also suppressed. Simultaneously,
   the physical changes to the top electrode were completely suppressed,
   indicating physical damage was related to Joule heating from the excess
   forming currents. The switching characteristics of all devices were
   similar, implying damage during electroformation of functional switches
   can be avoided by device/circuit design.}},

Title = {{Improving environmental change research with systematic techniques for

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scenarios are key tools in analyses of global environmental change.
   Often they consist of quantitative and qualitative components, where the
   qualitative aspects are expressed in narrative, or storyline, form.
   Fundamental challenges in scenario development and use include
   identifying a small set of compelling storylines that span a broad range
   of policy-relevant futures, documenting that the assumptions embodied in
   the storylines are internally consistent, and ensuring that the selected
   storylines are sufficiently comprehensive, that is, that descriptions of
   important kinds of future developments are not left out. The dominant
   approach to scenario design for environmental change research has been
   criticized for lacking sufficient means of ensuring that storylines are
   internally consistent. A consequence of this shortcoming could be an
   artificial constraint on the range of plausible futures considered. We
   demonstrate the application of a more systematic technique for the
   development of storylines called the cross-impact balance (CIB) method.
   We perform a case study on the scenarios published in the IPCC Special
   Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), which are widely used. CIB
   analysis scores scenarios in terms of internal consistency. It can also
   construct a very large number of scenarios consisting of combinations of
   assumptions about individual scenario elements and rank these
   combinations in terms of internal consistency. Using this method, we
   find that the four principal storylines employed in the SRES scenarios
   vary widely in internal consistency. One type of storyline involving
   highly carbon-intensive development is underrepresented in the SRES
   scenario set. We conclude that systematic techniques like CIB analysis
   hold promise for improving scenario development in global change
   research.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{With the capability of capturing detailed geometry of bridges in
   minutes, laser scanning technology has attracted the interests of bridge
   inspectors and researchers in the domain of bridge management. A
   challenge of effectively utilizing laser scanned point clouds for bridge
   inspection is that inspectors need to manually extract and measure large
   numbers of geometric features (e.g., points) for deriving geometric
   information items (e.g., the minimum underclearance) of bridges, named
   as bridge surveying goals in this research. Tedious manual data
   processing impedes inspectors from quantitatively understanding how
   various data processing options (e.g., algorithms, parameter values)
   influence the data processing time and the reliabilities of the
   surveying goal results. This paper shows the needs of automatic workflow
   executions for extracting surveying goals from laser scanned point
   clouds, and presents a computational framework for addressing these
   needs. This computational framework is composed of formal
   representations of workflows and mechanisms for constructing and
   executing workflows. Using a prototype system implemented based on this
   framework, we constructed and quantitatively characterized three
   workflows for extracting three representative bridge surveying goals,
   using three metrics of workflow performance defined in this research:
   exhaustiveness of measurement sampling, reliability of surveying goal
   results, and time efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{High-fidelity simulation is a key enabling technology for the widespread
   deployment of large unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). However, current
   approaches for lidar simulation leave much to be desired, particularly
   for scenes with vegetation. We introduce a novel 3D mapping technique
   that learns high-fidelity models for geo-specific lidar simulation
   directly from pose tagged lidar data. We introduce a novel stochastic,
   volumetric model that captures and can reproduce the statistical
   interactions of lidar with terrain. We show how to automatically learn
   the model directly from 3D mapping data collected by a UGV in the target
   environment. We extend our approach using terrain-classification
   techniques to develop a hybrid surface-volumetric model that combines
   the efficiency of surface modeling for areas that are well approximated
   by large surfaces (e.g. roads, bare earth) with our volumetric approach
   for more complex areas (e.g. bushes, trees) without sacrificing overall
   fidelity. We quantitatively compare the performance of our approach
   against more conventional methods on large outdoor datasets from urban
   and off-road environments. Our results show significant performance
   gains using our volumetric and hybrid approaches over the
   state-of-the-art, laying the ground work for truly high-fidelity

Abstract = {{In entrained slagging gasifiers, the fluidity of the molten ash is a
   critical factor for process control since it affects slag formation, the
   capture of inorganic constituents, refractory wear, and slag drainage
   along the gasification chamber walls. The use of western coal, or
   mixtures of eastern and western coals as gasifier feedstock, is likely
   to occur as western coals become available and technological issues that
   hinder their use are being resolved. In the present work, the viscosity
   of synthetic slags with ash chemistries simulating the western U. S.
   coals, was experimentally measured at a Po-2 = 10(-8) atm in the
   temperature range of 1773-1573 K (1500-1300 degrees C) using a
   rotating-bob viscometer. Alumina spindles and containment crucibles of
   both alumina and zirconia were used. Crystallization studies of this
   slag using a confocal scanning laser microscope found that a (Mg,
   Fe)Al2O4-based spinel precipitated at temperatures below 1723 K (1450
   degrees C), and this agreed with FactSage equilibrium phase prediction.
   The same spinels were observed in the post-viscometry experiment slags
   when ZrO2 crucibles were used and assumed to be in equilibrium with the
   slag at the higher temperatures. Zirconia dissolution resulted in a
   slight increase in the solid fraction present in slags at lower
   temperatures, compared to spinel fraction. Crystal precipitation changed
   the apparent activation energy and required a longer stabilization times
   for viscosity measurements. The viscosity results were used in
   predictive equations based on Veytsman and Einstein's models, with
   critical nucleation temperatures and the solid fraction calculated with
   FactSage. In the simulated eastern/western coal feedstock blends based
   on ash compositions, the fractions of the solid precipitates were also
   calculated using the thermodynamic program FactSage for each blend
   composition, and the plastic viscosity of each eastern/western coal slag
   blend was predicted using Veytsman's model and compared to available
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a general class of low complexity distributed scheduling
   algorithms in wireless networks, prioritized maximal scheduling, which
   compute a maximal set of transmitting links in each time slot according
   to certain pre-specified static priorities. The proposed scheduling
   scheme has low complexity, and is easily amendable for distributed
   implementation, such as adjusting inter-frame space (IFS) parameters
   under the ubiquitous 802.11 protocols. We provide throughput guarantees
   on the proposed scheduling scheme, by proving tight lower bound on the
   stability region and scheduling efficiency associated with a fixed
   priority vector. We next propose an online low complexity priority
   assignment algorithm, which can stabilize any arrival rate that is in
   the union of the lower bound regions of all priorities. The throughput
   guarantees are proved by fluid limits, and therefore can be applied to
   very general stochastic arrival processes. Finally, the performance of
   the proposed prioritized maximal scheduling scheme is verified by
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The infiltrations of synthetic coal slag into 99\%Al2O3,
   85\%Al2O315\%SiO2, and 90\%Cr2O310\%Al2O3 refractories with a
   temperature gradient induced along the penetration direction were
   compared to one another. The infiltrating slag was synthesized with a
   composition that is representative of an average of the ash contents
   from U S coal feedstock. Experiments were conducted with a hot-face
   temperature of 1450 degrees C in a CO/CO2 atmosphere. Minimal
   penetration was observed in the 90\%Cr2O310\%Al2O3 material because
   interactions between the refractory and the slag produced a protective
   layer of FeCr2O4, which impeded slag flow into the bulk of the
   refractory. After 5 h, the 99\%Al2O3 sample exhibited an average
   penetration of 12.7 mm whereas the 85\%Al2O315\%SiO2 sample showed 3.8
   mm. Slag infiltrated into the 99\%Al2O3 and 85\%Al2O315\%SiO2 refractory
   systems by dissolving the respective refractories' matrix materials,
   which consist of fine Al2O3 particles and an amorphous alumino-silicate
   phase. Due to enrichment in SiO2, a network-former, infiltration into
   the 85\%Al2O315\%SiO2 system yielded a higher viscosity slag and hence,
   a shallower penetration depth. The results suggest that slag
   infiltration can be limited by interactions with the refractory through
   the formation of either a solid layer that physically impedes fluid flow
   or a more viscous slag that retards infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a shape-programmable magnetically actuated
   soft capsule robot for semi-implantable drug delivery applications. The
   shape of the proposed soft capsule is changed by an external magnetic
   field. To change the robot shape by an external permanent magnet, the
   relevant soft robot design features and required conditions are
   investigated using simulations and experiments. If the magnetic field is
   increased above a critical value, the capsule collapses to a sphere-like
   stable shape, which keeps the capsule inside the stomach all the time,
   and it cannot move to the duodenum by gastric peristalsis. We conducted
   experiments inside a synthetic stomach-like membrane to investigate how
   much tissue stress is induced by the soft capsule under emulated gastric
   peristalsis to show that the capsule induces no pain in the stomach and
   can sustain its spherical shape against external forces. Such a soft
   capsule can be used to release drugs, which can be contained on its body
   parts or inside a reservoir, while staying in the stomach. After
   depletion of the drug, a controlled rolling motion using the external
   magnetic field is proposed to recover the initial cylindrical shape.
   Then, the capsule can move into the duodenum by peristalsis and is
   discharged through the anus.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion of 3G cellular technology varies widely across countries and
   regions. Past studies have shown that lower levels of diffusion of
   previous technologies and higher levels of income are significant
   factors in accelerating the take up of 1st and 2nd generation of mobile
   telephony. In addition, spectrum management policy plays a significant
   role in shaping 3G diffusion. Regulatory policies regarding spectrum
   management include mandating band and technology and decisions to hold
   spectrum auctions. An econometric analysis over a multi-country panel
   dataset shows that these spectrum management policies do have
   significant influence on the take-up of 3G. Findings suggest that the
   presence of multiple technologies for the previous generation is
   associated with rollout delay. The estimations indicate that countries
   that mandated a specific frequency band for 3G saw faster roll out, but
   in the long run those countries experienced a slower growth rate. Also
   estimations find that 3G diffusion is not significantly affected by the
   choice of auctions vs. alternative license award processes. Insights
   gained from this study of the 2G to 3G transition can provide guidance
   to regulators now contemplating the transition to newer generations. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Aerodynamic forces provide the primary means of distributing
   aerosol medications within the lungs. Partial airway obstructions can
   limit both air flow and aerosol penetration into diseased zones. We
   hypothesize that low surface tension additives may help to disperse
   aerosol medications after deposition in the airways, improving dose
   uniformity and drug delivery to underventilated regions. To test this,
   we performed a pilot scintigraphy study of surfactant and saline
   deposition and postdeposition dispersion.
   Methods: Because inhaled antibiotics for cystic fibrosis provide an
   example of where self-dispersing medications may be useful, we
   administered calfactant and saline aerosols with added Technetium 99m
   sulfur colloid (Tc-SC; 100 nm filtered) on different days in randomized
   order to eight cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects (average FEV1\%, p = 85 +/-
   12\%). Nebulized delivery was matched (similar aerosol sizes and volume
   delivery rates, fixed breathing patterns). Tc-SC distribution in the
   lungs was imaged continuously for 30 min after delivery.
   Results: Both aerosols were well tolerated. Aerosol distribution was
   mostly peripheral (58/42\%) and initially similar for saline and
   surfactant. Changes in whole lung counts after 30 min were also similar.
   Peripheral lung activity decreased more rapidly on average with
   calfactant though the difference versus saline was not statistically
   significant. Central to peripheral count ratio decreased with saline and
   increased with calfactant and c/p changes approached significance (-0.05
   +/- 0.16 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.10; p = 0.07 Wilcoxon).
   Conclusions: Our results lack statistical significance, but suggest that
   inhaled calfactant increased peripheral clearance, due to either
   surfactant-based dispersion or mucociliary effects. Further studies are
   needed to define the potential for low surface tension carriers to
   improve drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an automatic and robust approach to convert
   non-manifold CAD assemblies into unstructured all-hexahedral meshes
   conformal to the given B-Reps (boundary-representations) and with sharp
   feature preservation. In previous works, we developed an octree-based
   isocontouring method to construct unstructured hexahedral meshes for
   arbitrary non-manifold and manifold domains. However, sharp feature
   preservation still remains a challenge, especially for non-manifold CAD
   assemblies. In this paper, boundary features such as NURBS (non-uniform
   rational B-Splines) curves and surface patches are first extracted from
   the given B-Reps. Features shared by multiple components are identified
   and distinguished. To preserve these non-manifold features, one given
   surface patch may need to be split into several small ones. An
   octree-based algorithm is then carried out to create an unstructured
   all-hexahedral base mesh, detecting and preserving all the sharp
   features via a curve and surface parametrization. Two sets of local
   refinement templates are provided for adaptive mesh generation, along
   with a novel 2-refinement implementation. Vertices in the base mesh are
   categorized into four groups based on the given non-manifold topology,
   and each group is relocated using various methods with all sharp
   features preserved. After this stage, a novel two-step pillowing
   technique is developed for such complicated non-manifold domains to
   eliminate triangle-shaped quadrilateral elements along the curves and
   ``doublets{''}, handling non-manifold and manifold features in different
   ways. Finally, a combination of smoothing and optimization is used to
   further improve the mesh quality. Our algorithm is automatic and robust
   for non-manifold and manifold domains. We have applied our algorithm to
   several complicated CAD assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extension of our earlier work on quadtree-based

   this paper, we develop an algorithm to match the generated interior and

   to preserve sharp features. All the elements in the final mesh are
   within except small sharp angles present in the input geometry. Here, is
   an input parameter. The smaller is, the better angle bounds we can get.
   Finally, we group all the elements into six types, and most elements
   only need a few flops to construct the element stiffness matrix. This
   will significantly reduce the computational time during the finite

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new approach for heartbeat classification
   based on a combination of morphological and dynamic features. Wavelet
   transform and independent component analysis (ICA) are applied

   features. These two different types of features are concatenated and a
   support vector machine classifier is utilized for the classification of
   heartbeats into one of 16 classes. The procedure is independently
   applied to the data from two ECG leads and the two decisions are fused
   for the final classification decision. The proposed method is validated
   on the baseline MITBIH arrhythmia database and it yields an overall
   accuracy (i.e., the percentage of heartbeats correctly classified) of
   99.3\% (99.7\% with 2.4\% rejection) in the ``class-oriented{''}

Abstract = {{Logic diagnosis analyzes the observed failing circuit responses to
   derive the potential defect sites. This paper describes a method for
   improving diagnosis through failing behavior identification (FBI). FBI
   captures defect behavior (i.e., activation conditions of the defect) by
   identifying the signal lines related to defect activation. This
   additional information allows the root cause to be estimated in order to
   improve yield, design quality, and test quality, as well as guide PFA to
   perform faster defect localization. FBI is accomplished by: 1) deriving
   the neighborhood states of the defect site, i.e., the actual values on
   the signal lines within logical or physical proximity to the defect
   site, and 2) identifying the signal lines that are most relevant to
   defect activation. The efficacy of FBI is validated using circuit-level
   and logic-level simulation experiments. The results show that FBI
   achieves an average accuracy of 94\% in identifying signal lines that
   are relevant to defect activation, a 28\% improvement over an existing
   approach. Moreover, by analyzing the neighborhood states of each defect
   site reported by logic diagnosis, sites that are not likely to be
   defective can be eliminated, which leads to improvement in diagnosis
   resolution. Experiment results show that with little influence on
   diagnosis accuracy, the number of incorrect defective sites reported by
   logic diagnosis can be reduced by 64\%, on average.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{We have fabricated, tested and analyzed the reliability of Pt- and
   RuO2-coated ohmic microrelays in ultra-high purity gas environments.
   RuO2-coated relays could survive 3 x 10(8) contact cycles without
   electrical degradation, while Pt-coated devices degraded after 10(5)
   cycles. Thermally actuated microrelays were fabricated using a process
   that employed a polysilicon surface-micromachined substructure. After
   releasing the devices, just a few blanket metal depositions were
   required to create the different coatings. This method allowed direct
   comparisons between different coating materials, and was enabled by a
   self-aligned shadow mask that provides electrical isolation between
   different traces. Testing was performed in a clean environment achieved
   through in situ ultra-high vacuum bakeouts, chamber cooling to <5 x
   10(-9) Torr and chamber refill with ultra-high purity gases. The RuO2
   coatings were formed by two avenues-reactive sputtering and thermal
   oxidation. No significant difference in contact resistance or
   reliability was detected for these two deposition methods. For all
   coatings, post-test analysis by scanning electron microscopy and Auger
   electron spectroscopy indicated no difference in carbon concentration on
   real contact versus non-contacting areas, implying that carbon did not
   play a role in limiting the switches' reliability. The Pt-coated switch
   reliability limit was attributed to surface wear rather than to the
   growth of a contaminating film. For the RuO2 switches, trace resistance
   was reduced by ten times using an Al underlayer, so that the total
   device resistance was compatible with commercial device requirements.
   Because RuO2 is expected to be resistant to hydrocarbon contamination,
   this work shows that the RuO2 coating provides a promising path toward
   achieving ultra-high reliability ohmic microswitches.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely seen as a critical technology
   for reducing atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from power
   plants and other large industrial facilities, which are major sources of
   greenhouse gas emissions linked to global climate change. However, the
   high cost and energy requirements of current CO2 capture processes are
   major barriers to their use. This paper assesses the outlook for
   improved, lower-cost technologies for each of the three major approaches
   to CO2 capture, namely, post-combustion, pre-combustion and
   oxy-combustion capture. The advantages and limitations of each of method
   are discussed, along with the current status of projects and processes
   at various stages in the development cycle. We then review a variety of
   ``roadmaps{''} developed by governmental and private-sector
   organizations to project the commercial roll-out and deployment of
   advanced capture technologies. For perspective, we also review recent
   experience with R\&D programs to develop lower-cost technologies for SO2
   and NOx capture at coal-fired power plants. For perspective on projected
   cost reductions for CO2 capture we further review past experience in
   cost trends for SO2 and NOx capture systems. The key insight for
   improved carbon capture technology is that achieving significant cost
   reductions will require not only a vigorous and sustained level of
   research and development (R\&D), but also a substantial level of
   commercial deployment, which, in turn, requires a significant market for
   CO2 capture technologies. At present such a market does not yet exist.
   While various incentive programs can accelerate the development and
   deployment of improved CO2 capture systems, government actions that
   significantly limit CO2 emissions to the atmosphere ultimately are
   needed to realize substantial and sustained reductions in the future
   cost of CO2 capture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores physical effects associated with the application of
   cryopreservation via vitrification using a class of compounds which are
   defined here as synthetic ice modulators (SIMs). The general
   classification of SIMs includes molecules that modulate ice nucleation
   and growth, or possess properties of stabilizing the amorphous state, by
   virtue of their chemical structure and at concentrations that are not
   explained on a purely colligative basis. A sub-category of SIMs,
   referred to in the literature as synthetic ice blockers (SIBs), are
   compounds that interact directly with ice nuclei or crystals to modify
   their structure and/or rate of growth. The current study is part of an
   ongoing effort to characterize thermo-mechanical effects during
   vitrification, with emphasis on measuring the physical property of
   thermal expansion-the driving mechanism to thermo-mechanical stress.
   Materials under investigation are the cryoprotective agent (CPA)
   cocktail DP6 in combination with one of the following SIMs: 12\%
   polyethylene glycol 400, 6\% 1,3 cyclohexanediol, and 6\% 2,3
   butanediol. Results are presented for the CPA-SIM cocktail in the
   absence and presence of bovine muscle and goat artery specimens. This
   study focuses on the upper part of the cryogenic temperature range,
   where the CPA behaves as a fluid for all practical applications. Results
   of this study indicate that the addition of SIMs to DP6 allows lower
   cooling rates to ensure vitrification and extends the range of
   measurements. It is demonstrated that the combination of SIM with DP6
   increases the thermal expansion of the cocktail, with implications for
   the likelihood of fracture formation-the most dramatic outcome of
   thermo-mechanical stress. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of adsorbed Son surface segregation in CuxPd1 (-) (x)
   alloys (S/CuxPd1 (-) (x)) was characterized over a wide range of bulk
   alloy compositions (x = 0.05 to 0.95) using high-throughput Composition
   Spread Alloy Film (CSAF) sample libraries. Top-surface and near-surface
   compositions of the CSAFs were measured as functions of bulk Cu
   composition, x, and temperature using spatially resolved low energy ion
   scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
   (XPS). Preferential segregation of Cu to the top-surface of the S/CuxPd1
   (-) (x) CSAF was observed at all bulk compositions, x, but the extent of
   Cu segregation to the S/CuxPd1 (-) (x) surface was lower than the Cu
   segregation to the surface of a clean CuxPd1 (-) (x) CSAF, clear
   evidence of an S-induced ``segregation reversal.{''} The Langmuir-McLean
   formulation of the Gibbs isotherm was used to estimate the enthalpy and
   entropy of Cu segregation to the top-surface, Delta H-seg(x) and Delta
   S-seg(x), at saturation sulfur coverages. While Cu segregation to the
   top-surface of the clean CuxPd1 (-) (x) is exothermic (Delta H-seg<0)
   for all bulk Cu compositions, it is endothermic (Delta H-seg>0) for
   S/CuxPd1 (-) (x), Segregation to the S/CuxPd1 (-) (x) surface is driven
   by entropy. Changes in segregation patterns that occur upon adsorption
   of S onto CuxPd1 (-) (x) appear to be related to formation of
   energetically favored Pd - S bonds at the surface, which counterbalance
   the enthalpic driving forces for Cu segregation to the clean surface.

Abstract = {{Although previous studies investigated the relationship between general
   cognitive abilities and decision making, few have characterized specific
   cognitive abilities underlying decision-making competence. In this
   paper, we focus on executive functionscontrol processes involved in the
   regulation of cognition. Specifically, we report on an
   individual-differences study that investigated the relationship of
   executive functioning (EF) and general cognitive abilities (fluid
   intelligence and numeracy) with different aspects of decision-making
   competence. Individual differences in EF components explained aspects of
   decision-making competence even after controlling for fluid intelligence
   and numeracy. However, different aspects of decision-making competence
   varied in the extent to which they relied on different executive
   functions. In particular, resistance to framing effects, the ability to
   apply decision rules, and successful engagement in cognitive reflection
   partially depend on individual differences on the monitoring/inhibition
   dimension of EF. The ability to provide consistent judgments in risk
   perception is related to the shifting aspect of EF. The ability to
   recognize social norms and resistance to sunk costs were not
   significantly related to EF, thus supporting the idea that executive
   control is not a major determinant of these aspects of decision-making
   competence. Finally, substantial variance in some of the decision-making
   tasks remained unexplained, suggesting that other cognitive or
   non-cognitive abilities need to be considered in future studies.

Abstract = {{Studies on aging-related changes in decision making report mixed
   results. Some decision-making skills decline with age, while others
   remain unchanged or improve. Because fluid cognitive ability (e.g.,
   reasoning, problem solving) deteriorates with age, older adults should
   perform worse on decision-making tasks that tap fluid cognitive ability.
   However, performance on some decision-making tasks may require
   experience, which increases with age. On those tasks, older adults
   should perform at least as well as younger adults. These two patterns
   emerged in correlations between age and component tasks of Adult
   Decision-Making Competence (A-DMC), controlling for demographic
   variables. First, we found negative relationships between age and
   performance on two tasks (Resistance to Framing, Applying Decision
   Rules), which were mediated by fluid cognitive ability. Second,
   performance on other tasks did not decrease with age (Consistency in
   Risk Perception, Recognizing Age-group Social Norms) or improved
   (Under/Overconfidence, Resistance to Sunk Costs). In multivariate
   analyses, performance on these tasks showed independent positive
   relationships to both age and fluid cognitive ability. Because, after
   controlling for fluid cognitive ability, age becomes a proxy for
   experience, these results suggest that experience plays no role in
   performing the first set of tasks, and some role in performing the
   second set of tasks. Although not all decision-making tasks showed
   age-related declines in performance, older adults perceived themselves
   as worse decision makers. Self-ratings of decision-making competence
   were related to fluid cognitive ability and to decision-making skills
   that decreased with agebut not to decision-making skills that increased
   with age. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Financial decisions about investing and saving for retirement are
   increasingly complex, requiring financial knowledge and confidence in
   that knowledge. Few studies have examined whether direct assessments of
   individuals' confidence are related to the outcomes of their financial
   decisions. Here, we analyzed data from a national sample recruited
   through RAND's American Life Panel, an Internet panel study of US adults
   aged 1888 years. We examined the relationship of confidence with
   self-reported and actual financial decisions, using four different
   tasks, each performed by overlapping samples of American Life Panel
   participants. The four tasks were designed by different researchers for
   different purposes, using different methods to assess confidence. Yet,
   measures of confidence were correlated across tasks, and results were
   consistent across methodologies. Confidence and knowledge showed only
   modest positive correlations. However, even after controlling for actual
   knowledge, individuals with greater confidence were more likely to
   report financial planning for retirement and to successfully minimize
   fees on a hypothetical investment task. Implications for the role of
   confidence in investment behavior (even if it is unjustified) is
   discussed. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper enables the rapid creation and modification of freeform
   surfaces inside an augmented reality environment, and focuses on methods
   for enabling increased flexibility during exploratory, conceptual
   industrial product design through three-dimensional (3D) sketch-based
   user input. Specifically, we address the role of multiple shape
   representations with varying uncertainty levels during 3D conceptual
   sketching, along with methods to transform between those
   representations. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the
   formulation of virtual shape data in multiple, concurrent
   representations (points and surfaces), and a regression method to
   transition fluidly back and forth between these representations during
   design, (2) methods for deforming and exploring the product shape using
   these multiple representations, and (3) representations of these forms
   such that designers can explore conceptual designs without the need for
   detailed surface operations such as trimming or continuity enforcement.
   Through incorporating these contributions, we introduce techniques that
   can be incorporated in future computer-aided conceptual design systems.
   These contributions are demonstrated for freeform surface design, with
   examples of computer mouse and car seat exterior surfaces. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Magnetic tapes are still widely used in data storage facilities. A novel
   approach is presented for reducing the lateral tape motion (LTM) at the
   reel and thus for preventing the impacts between tape and reel flanges,
   which can easily damage the fragile tape edges. To measure the LTM,
   photonic sensors are employed, which have to be calibrated to compensate
   for nonlinearities and for the shift of the tape path between sensor
   probes while the reel winds and unwinds. Moreover, since a sensor cannot
   be placed as close to the reel as desired, the lateral tape position at
   the reel is estimated by extrapolating from two sensors. Actuation is
   provided by a tilted rotary guide. In this paper, first, the identified
   dynamics at the two sensors are combined to estimate the dynamics at the
   tape nip, and a complex proportional-integral-lead controller is
   implemented to compensate for the LTM at the extrapolated location.
   Then, the robust performance characteristics of the implemented
   controller is evaluated using the robust Bode plot, which accounts for
   the uncertainties embedded in the used system identification method
   based on frequency response data. Finally, the experimental results show
   a significant reduction above 60\% in LTM at the reel.}},

Title = {{Structural Design Principles of Complex Bird Songs: A Network-Based
   Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Bird songs are acoustic communication signals primarily used in
   male-male aggression and in male-female attraction. These are often
   monotonous patterns composed of a few phrases, yet some birds have
   extremely complex songs with a large phrase repertoire, organized in
   non-random fashion with discernible patterns. Since structure is
   typically associated with function, the structures of complex bird songs
   provide important clues to the evolution of animal communication
   systems. Here we propose an efficient network-based approach to explore
   structural design principles of complex bird songs, in which the song
   networks-transition relationships among different phrases and the
   related structural measures-are employed. We demonstrate how this
   approach works with an example using California Thrasher songs, which
   are sequences of highly varied phrases delivered in succession over
   several minutes. These songs display two distinct features: a large
   phrase repertoire with a `small-world' architecture, in which subsets of
   phrases are highly grouped and linked with a short average path length;
   and a balanced transition diversity amongst phrases, in which
   deterministic and non-deterministic transition patterns are moderately
   mixed. We explore the robustness of this approach with variations in
   sample size and the amount of noise. Our approach enables a more
   quantitative study of global and local structural properties of complex
   bird songs than has been possible to date.}},

Title = {{Implications of Near-Term Coal Power Plant Retirement for SO2 and NOx

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{9838-9845}},

Abstract = {{Regulations monitoring SO2, NO mercury, and other metal emissions in the
   U.S. will likely result in coal plant retirement in the near-term. Life
   cycle assessment studies have previously estimated the environmental
   benefits of displacing coal with natural gas for electricity generation,
   by comparing systems that consist of individual natural gas and coal
   power plants. However, such system comparisons may not be appropriate to
   analyze impacts of coal plant retirement in existing power fleets. To
   meet this limitation, simplified economic dispatch models for PJM, MISO,
   and ERCOT regions are developed in this study to examine changes in
   regional power plant dispatch that occur when coal power plants are
   retired. These models estimate the order in which existing power plants
   are dispatched to meet electricity demand based on short-run marginal
   costs, with cheaper plants being dispatched first. Five scenarios of
   coal plant retirement are considered: retiring top CO2 emitters, top NOx
   emitters, top SO2 emitters, small and inefficient plants, and old and
   inefficient plants. Changes in fuel use, life cycle greenhouse gas
   emissions (including uncertainty), and SO2 and NOx emissions are
   estimated. Life cycle GHG emissions were found to decrease by less than
   4\% in almost all scenarios modeled. In addition, changes in marginal
   damage costs due to SO2, and NOx, emissions are estimated using the
   county level marginal damage costs reported in the Air Pollution
   Emissions Experiments and Policy (APEEP) model, which are a proxy for
   measuring regional impacts of SO2 and NOx emissions. Results suggest
   that location specific parameters should be considered within
   environmental policy frameworks targeting coal plant retirement, to
   account for regional variability in the benefits of reducing the impact
   of SO2 and NOx emissions.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{87-97}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Fuel cell technology has drawn much attention from scientists and
   engineers due to its high energy conversion efficiency, quick start-up
   in the beginning of operation, portability, and minimal pollution.
   Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) play an important role in the fuel cell
   systems. A good PEM must meet a series of requirements such as high
   proton conductivity, excellent mechanical strength and stability,
   chemical and electrochemical stability, low fuel or oxidant crossover,
   and be amenable for fabrication into membrane electrode assemblies. In
   this paper, we focus on the recent advances in development of novel PEMs
   that work well under elevated temperature and/or low relative humidity.
   All PEMs described in this paper are divided into three categories:
   polymeric, ceramic, and inorganic-organic composite membranes. The
   Nafion membrane with structural and compositional modifications is the
   most promising candidate that can adapt to high temperature and low
   relative humidity operating conditions. Ceramic and inorganic-organic
   composite membranes display some desired properties, but the development
   of these membranes is still in early stages and further in-depth studies
   are needed. Possible approaches focusing on (1) improvement of proton
   conductivity and (2) enhancement of mechanical and thermal stabilities
   to improve the performance of novel PEMs are also discussed. (C) 2012

   hydrodynamic forces on the micro-objects are studied using both finite
   element solutions and analytical models from previous studies. These
   results are compared with experiment to determine manipulation
   characteristics for the complex flows. Due to its untethered and
   non-contact operation, this micro-manipulation method could be used to
   quickly move fragile or non-fragile micro-objects in inaccessible or

Title = {{Mineral scaling mitigation in cooling systems using tertiary-treated

Abstract = {{Treated municipal wastewater (MWW) is recognized as a significant
   potential source of cooling water for power generation. One of the key
   challenges for the successful use of the effluent from wastewater
   treatment facilities for cooling is the potential for significant
   mineral scaling when the raw water is concentrated as much as 4-6 times
   in recirculating cooling systems. Previous bench- and pilot-scale tests
   have shown that commonly used phosphorus- and polymer- based scaling
   inhibitors are ineffective when secondary-treated municipal wastewater
   (MWW) is used as make-up. In this study, two types of tertiary-treated
   municipal wastewaters, namely secondary-treated MWW with pH adjustment
   (MWW\_pH) and secondary-treated MWW subjected to nitrification and sand
   filtration (MWW\_NF) were evaluated as the sole source of make-up water
   for recirculating cooling systems. Both laboratory studies and
   pilot-scale tests revealed that adjusting the pH to 7.8 could reduce the
   mineral scaling rate by more than 80\% without causing any significant
   corrosion problems. In contrast to MWW, where calcium carbonate was the
   dominant scaling mineral, the main component of mineral scale in MWW\_pH
   was calcium phosphate. Both static and dynamic bench-scale tests
   indicated that scaling would not be a significant concern when MWW\_NF
   is used as the make-up water in recirculating cooling systems operated
   at 4-6 cycles of concentration (CoC). Extended pilot-scale studies
   confirmed that MWW\_NF is suitable makeup water for power plant cooling
   systems and that no anti-scaling chemicals would be required. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We propose two mixed-integer linear programming based approaches for the
   2D orthogonal strip packing problem. Using knowledge from the
   alternative forms of time representation in scheduling formulations, we
   show how to efficiently combine three different concepts into the x- and
   y-dimensions. One model features a discrete representation on the x-axis
   (strip width) and a continuous representation with general precedence
   variables on the y-axis (strip height). The other features a full
   continuous-space representation with the same approach for the y-axis
   and a single non-uniform grid made up of slots for the x-axis. Through
   the solution of a set of twenty nine instances from the literature, we
   show that the former is a better approach, even when compared to three
   alternative MILP models ranging from a pure discrete-space to a pure
   continuous-space with precedence variables in both dimensions. All

Abstract = {{Novel nanoporous nitrogen-enriched carbon materials were prepared
   through a simple carbonization procedure of well-defined block copolymer
   precursors containing the source of carbon, i.e., polyacrylonitrile

   preparation of nitrogen-enriched nanocarbons with hierarchical pore
   structure was enabled by the high fidelity preservation of the initial
   phase-separated nanostructure between two polymer blocks upon
   carbonization. Supercapacitors fabricated from the carbons exhibited
   unusually high capacitance per unit surface area (>30 mu F/cm(2)) which
   was attributed to the pseudocapacitance resulting from the high nitrogen
   content originating from the PAN precursor. Electrochemical availability
   of the nitrogen species was also evident from the results of oxygen
   reduction experiments. The hierarchical pore structure and the high
   nitrogen content in such materials make them particularly promising for
   use in supercapacitor and electrocatalyst applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real-time, coherent optical OFDM based on a field
   programmable gate array implementation. The transmitter uses 16QAM
   mapping and runs at 28 GSa/s achieving a data rate of 85.4 Gb/s on a
   single polarization. A cyclic prefix of 25\% of the symbol duration is
   added enabling dispersion-tolerant transmission over up to 400 km of
   SSMF. This is the first transmission experiment performed with a
   real-time OFDM transmitter running at data rates higher than 40 Gb/s. A
   key aspect of the paper is the introduction of a novel method for OFDM
   symbol synchronization without relying on training symbols. Unlike
   conventional preamble-based synchronization methods which perform
   cross-correlations at regular time intervals and let the system run
   freely in between, the proposed method performs synchronization in a
   continuous manner ensuring correct symbol alignment at all times. (C)

Abstract = {{Simulations are used to determine the effect of inertia on athermal
   shear of amorphous two-dimensional solids. In the quasistatic limit,
   shear occurs through a series of rapid avalanches. The distribution of
   avalanches is analyzed using finite-size scaling with thousands to
   millions of disks. Inertia takes the system to a new underdamped
   universality class rather than driving the system away from criticality
   as previously thought. Scaling exponents are determined for the
   underdamped and overdamped limits and a critical damping that separates
   the two regimes. Systems are in the overdamped universality class even

Abstract = {{We compare the power output from a year of electricity generation data
   from one solar thermal plant, two solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, and
   twenty Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) wind farms. The
   analysis shows that solar PV electricity generation is approximately one
   hundred times more variable at frequencies on the order of 10 Hz than
   solar thermal electricity generation, and the variability of wind
   generation lies between that of solar PV and solar thermal. We calculate
   the cost of variability of the different solar power sources and wind by
   using the costs of ancillary services and the energy required to
   compensate for its variability and intermittency, and the cost of
   variability per unit of displaced CO, emissions. We show the costs of
   variability are highly dependent on both technology type and capacity
   factor. California emissions data were used to calculate the cost of
   variability per unit of displaced CO2 emissions. Variability cost is
   greatest for solar PV generation at \$8-11 per MWh. The cost of
   variability for solar thermal generation is \$5 per MWh, while that of
   wind generation in ERCOT was found to be on average \$4 per MWh.
   Variability adds similar to\$15/tonne CO2 to the cost of abatement for
   solar thermal power, \$25 for wind, and \$33-\$40 for PV.}},

   Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In product design, designers often create a multitude of concept
   sketches as part of the ideation and exploration process. Transforming
   such sketches to 3D digital models requires special expertise due to a
   lack of intuitive computer aided design (CAD) tools suitable for rapid
   modeling. Recent advances in sketch-based user interfaces and immersive
   environments have introduced novel curve design methods that facilitate
   the transformation of such sketches into 3D digital models. However,
   rapid surfacing of such data remains an open challenge. Based on the
   observation that a sparse network of curves is reasonably sufficient to
   convey the intended geometric shape, we propose a new method for
   creating approximate surfaces on curve clouds automatically. A notable
   property of our method is that it relieves many topological and
   geometric restrictions of 3D conventional networks such as the curves do
   not need to be connected to one another or gently drawn. Our method
   calculates a 3D guidance vector field in the space that the curve cloud
   appears. This guidance vector field helps drive a deformable closed
   surface onto the curves. During this deformation, surface smoothness is
   controlled through a set of surface smoothing and subdivision
   operations. The resulting surface can be further beautified by the user
   manually using selective surface modification and fairing operations. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several case examples.
   Our studies have shown that the proposed technique can be particularly
   useful for rapid visualization. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007152]}},

Abstract = {{The transportation sector is the second largest source of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions in the United State. Developing underutilized urban
   industrial sites with certain characteristics (i.e., close proximity to
   transit, job and services, low remediation cost, and high density) can
   potentially reduce the transportation sector's impact on the environment
   by lowering vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and related GHG emissions.
   This study examines the effect of residential brownfield developments on
   VKT reduction and the resulting costs (including the cost of driving
   time, fuel, and external air pollution costs) and further compares the
   resulting costs with the initial one-time cleanup cost of brownfield
   sites. Sixteen brownfield and conventional development sites were
   analyzed in Baltimore, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh. Travel
   demand models were used to estimate VKT differences among the
   developments. Air pollution valuation data were used to estimate
   external environmental cost differences. On average, residential
   brownfield developments reduce VKT by 52\% compared to conventional
   greenfield developments. Also on average, brownfield developments result
   in a time and fuel cost reduction of 60\% and an external environmental
   cost saving of 66\%. Comparing these cost savings with the initial
   one-time cleanup cost of brownfields, it is shown that development
   density and the cost of remediation significantly affect the number of
   years required for the VKT cost savings to offset the remediation cost.

Abstract = {{Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is an osteoconductive and osteoinductive
   commercial biomaterial and approved medical device used in bone defects
   with a long track record of clinical use in diverse forms. True to its
   name and as an acid-extracted organic matrix from human bone sources,
   DBM retains much of the proteinaceous components native to bone, with
   small amounts of calcium-based solids, inorganic phosphates and some
   trace cell debris. Many of DBM's proteinaceous components (e.g., growth
   factors) are known to be potent osteogenic agents. Commercially sourced
   as putty, paste, sheets and flexible pieces. DBM provides a degradable
   matrix facilitating endogenous release of these compounds to the bone
   wound sites where it is surgically placed to fill bone defects, inducing
   new bone formation and accelerating healing. Given DBM's long clinical
   track record and commercial accessibility in standard forms and sources,
   opportunities to further develop and validate DBM as a versatile bone
   biomaterial in orthopedic repair and regenerative medicine contexts are
   attractive. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight materials that are both highly compressible and resilient
   under large cyclic strains can be used in a variety of
   applications(1-8). Carbon nanotubes offer a combination of elasticity,
   mechanical resilience and low density(9), and these properties have been
   exploited in nanotube-based foams(10-14) and aerogels(15,16). However,
   all nanotube-based foams and aerogels developed so far undergo
   structural collapse(15) or significant plastic deformation with a
   reduction in compressive strength(10,11,13,14) when they are subjected
   to cyclic strain. Here, we show that an inelastic aerogel made of
   single-walled carbon nanotubes can be transformed into a superelastic
   material by coating it with between one and five layers of graphene
   nanoplates. The graphene-coated aerogel exhibits no change in mechanical
   properties after more than 1x10(6) compressive cycles, and its original
   shape can be recovered quickly after compression release. Moreover, the
   coating does not affect the structural integrity of the nanotubes or the
   compressibility and porosity of the nanotube network. The coating also
   increases Young's modulus and energy storage modulus by a factor of
   similar to 6, and the loss modulus by a factor of similar to 3. We
   attribute the superelasticity and complete fatigue resistance to the
   graphene coating strengthening the existing crosslinking points or
   `nodes' in the aerogel.}},

Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{160-172}},

Abstract = {{Precision control of three-dimensional dynamic motions of piezoelectric
   actuators is crucial for many applications of nanotechnology and
   precision engineering. In this paper, an open-loop technique to control
   the three-dimensional single-frequency motions of multi-axis piezo-stack
   actuators is presented. In this approach, the dynamic behavior of
   piezo-stack actuators is represented by the harmonic frequency response
   functions (hFRFs) that are obtained through an laser Doppler vibrometry
   (LDV)-based experimental characterization method. To obtain the desired
   motions at a given frequency, the actuator is excited at both the
   fundamental (motion) frequency and its harmonics, latter of which aiming
   to compensate for the unwanted higher-harmonic response components that
   arise due to non-linear dynamic behavior. The fundamental and the
   first-order compensatory excitation components are determined
   analytically using the inverse hFRFs. For the higher-order response
   terms, a compensation approach based on an iterative experimental
   technique is proposed. The effectiveness of the presented control method
   is demonstrated through a set of evaluation tests on two different
   three-axis piezo-stack actuators, where a set of motion-error metrics
   were defined and quantified. It was shown that the proposed method can
   be used to generate single-frequency motions with wide range of
   nanometric sizes with average errors less than 5\% of the targeted
   motion amplitudes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Multiresponse Metamodeling in Simulation-Based Design Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires the
   availability of mathematical models of system's behavior as a function
   of a set of design variables; such models allow the designer to search
   for the best solution to the design problem. However, system models
   (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, physical prototypes)
   are usually time-consuming and expensive to evaluate, and thus unsuited
   for systematic use during design. Approximate models of system behavior
   based on limited data, also known as metamodels, allow significant
   savings by reducing the resources devoted to modeling during the design
   process. In this work in engineering design based on multiple
   performance criteria, we propose the use of multi-response Bayesian
   surrogate models (MR-BSM) to model several aspects of system behavior
   jointly, instead of modeling each individually. To this end, we
   formulated a family of multiresponse correlation functions, suitable for
   prediction of several response variables that are observed
   simultaneously from the same computer simulation. Using a set of test
   functions with varying degrees of correlation, we compared the
   performance of MR-BSM against metamodels built individually for each
   response. Our results indicate that MR-BSM outperforms individual
   metamodels in 53\% to 75\% of the test cases, though the relative
   performance depends on the sample size, sampling scheme and the actual
   correlation among the observed response values. In addition, the
   relative performance of MR-BSM versus individual metamodels was
   contingent upon the ability to select an appropriate
   covariance/correlation function for each application, a task for which a
   modified version of Akaike's Information Criterion was observed to be
   inadequate. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006996]}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental aspects of the interactions between cells and biomaterials
   provide a crucial framework for the design of many systems that interact
   with the human body. A comprehensive understanding of multifactorial
   processes may provide an adequate basis for the rational design of
   implantable devices ranging from nanoparticles for drug delivery and
   scaffolds for tissue engineering, to artificial organs for augmentation
   and rehabilitation. Recent progress in the elucidation of
   cell-biomaterials interactions has been predicated on advances in
   polymer chemistry, materials engineering, and device microfabrication.
   The confluence of these developments has stimulated a newfound ability
   to design soft materials and interfaces with precise chemical, physical,
   and mechanical properties. While static surfaces can yield insight into
   the interaction of mammalian cells with medical materials, the study of
   fundamental cell-biomaterials phenomena will benefit significantly from
   the ability to present biologically active signals to cells with
   spatiotemporal control. Specifically, the use of dynamic materials and
   interfaces can mirror the intrinsic dynamic behavior of living cells.
   This article highlights recent advances in soft materials design,
   interfacial engineering, and synthetic polymer networks in the context
   of producing dynamic materials to study cell-biomaterials interactions.
   Emerging challenges and future research directions are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration behavior of structures with parallelepiped shape-including
   beams, plates, and solids-are critical for a broad range of practical
   applications. In this paper we describe a new approach, referred to here
   as the three-dimensional spectral-Tchebychev (3D-ST) technique, for
   solution of three-dimensional vibrations of parallelepipeds with
   different boundary conditions. An integral form of the boundary-value
   problem is derived using the extended Hamilton's principle. The unknown
   displacements are then expressed using a triple expansion of scaled
   Tchebychev polynomials, and analytical integration and differentiation
   operators are replaced by matrix operators. The boundary conditions are
   incorporated into the solution through basis recombination, allowing the
   use of the same set of Tchebychev functions as the basis functions for
   problems with different boundary conditions. As a result, the
   discretized equations of motion are obtained in terms of mass and
   stiffness matrices. To analyze the numerical convergence and precision
   of the 3D-ST solution, a number of case studies on beams, plates, and
   solids with different boundary conditions have been conducted. Overall,
   the calculated natural frequencies were shown to converge exponentially
   with the number of polynomials used in the Tchebychev expansion.
   Furthermore, the natural frequencies and mode shapes were in excellent
   agreement with those from a finite-element solution. It is concluded
   that the 3D-ST technique can be used for accurate and numerically
   efficient solution of three-dimensional parallelepiped vibrations under
   mixed boundary conditions. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006256]}},

Abstract = {{The paper characterizes the invariant filtering measures resulting from

   probability (gamma) over bar. Our prior work showed that, for (gamma)

   matrices converges weakly to a unique invariant distribution mu((gamma)
   over bar). This paper shows that, as (gamma) over bar approaches one,
   the family \{mu((gamma) over bar)\}((gamma) over bar >0) satisfies a
   moderate deviations principle with good rate function I(.): 1) as
   (gamma) over bar up arrow 1, the family \{mu((gamma) over
   bar)\}converges weakly to the Dirac measure delta(P{*}) concentrated on
   the fixed point of the associated discrete time Riccati operator; 2) the
   probability of a rare event (an event bounded away from P{*}) under
   mu((gamma) over bar)decays to zero as a power law of (1 - (gamma) over
   bar) as (gamma) over bar up arrow 1; and, 3) the best power law decay
   exponent is obtained by solving a deterministic variational problem
   involving the rate function I(.). For specific scenarios, the paper

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for improving the test quality of digital
   circuits on a per-design basis by: 1) monitoring the defect behaviors
   that occur through volume diagnosis; and 2) changing the test patterns
   to match the identified behaviors. To characterize the behavior of a
   defect (i.e., the conditions when a defect is activated),
   physically-aware diagnosis is employed to extract the set of signal
   lines relevant to defect activation. Then, based on the set of signal
   lines derived, the defect is attributed to one of several behavior
   categories. Our defect level model uses the behavior-attribution results
   of the current failing population to guide test-set customization to
   minimize defect level for a given constraint on test costs, or
   alternatively, ensure that defect level does not exceed some
   predetermined threshold. Circuit-level simulation involving various
   types of defects shows that defect level can be reduced by 30\% using
   this method. Simulation experiment on actual chips also demonstrates
   quality improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a robotic biopsy device for capsule endoscopes.
   The proposed device consists of three modules for the complete process
   of biopsy, which includes monitoring the intestinal wall by a tissue
   monitoring module (TMM), aligning onto a polyp by an anchor module (AM),
   and sampling of the polyp tissue by a biopsy module (BM). The TMM
   utilizes a trigonal mirror as well as an on-board camera; since the TMM
   continuously takes images through lateral apertures, an operator such as
   a medical doctor is able to anchor the capsule endoscope onto the polyp
   and biopsy it with the visual feedback in real-time. When the operator
   finds a polyp using the TMM and the frontal camera of a capsule
   endoscope, then the AM is used to approach the polyp for biopsy. When
   the AM is in use, outriggers are extruded by shape-memory-alloy (SMA)
   springs, which results in the swelling of capsule endoscope body. In
   addition, an alignment module, which is a part of the AM, rotates the
   body of the capsule endoscope such that the biopsy razor can be aligned
   onto the polyp. Then, the BM excises a part of the polyp and seals the
   aperture, and the capsule endoscope continues exploring the intestine.
   The concept and working principles of the proposed device are introduced
   in this paper and are verified by a prototype that successfully
   integrates the three modules. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007100]}},

Abstract = {{Future systems will be too complex to design and implement explicitly.
   Instead, we will have to learn to engineer complex behaviours
   indirectly: through the discovery and application of local rules of
   behaviour, applied to simple process components, from which desired
   behaviours predictably emerge through dynamic interactions between
   massive numbers of instances. This paper describes a process-oriented
   architecture for fine-grained concurrent systems that enables
   experiments with such indirect engineering. Examples are presented
   showing the differing complex behaviours that can arise from minor
   (non-linear) adjustments to low-level parameters, the difficulties in
   suppressing the emergence of unwanted (bad) behaviour, the unexpected
   relationships between apparently unrelated physical phenomena (shown up
   by their separate emergence from the same primordial process swamp) and
   the ability to explore and engineer completely new physics (such as
   force fields) by their emergence from low-level process interactions
   whose mechanisms can only be imagined, but not built, at the current
   time.}},

Abstract = {{An axial-fan air-assisted sprayer, adapted with variable rate nozzles
   and adjustable air-assist flow control, for citrus tree-specific
   precision spraying, was tested. Static experiments were conducted to
   determine spray patterns at varied nozzle flow rates and air-assistance
   settings. Spray patterns confirmed that the sprayer delivered variable
   liquid flow rates and the air-diverting louvre controlled the
   air-assistance providing targeted spray delivery. Field experiments were
   conducted to determine suitable air-assistance and nozzle combinations
   needed in the future for sensor-controlled spraying in young
   (small-sized) citrus canopies. Experiments involved two nozzle
   treatments, a) nozzles 1-6, and b) nozzles 2-3 at 100\% output rates and
   three (40\%, 70\%, and 100\%) levels of air assistance selected based on
   spray patterns. The sprayer was operated at a travel speed of 4.5 km
   h(-1) and the water-soluble tracer deposition on biological and
   artificial targets, at 0.6 m and 1.4 m above ground and laterally at the
   canopy front, middle, and back, respectively were measured using
   fluorimetry. Results suggested that within nozzles 1-6 treatments with
   varied air-assist, 70\% air-assistance was more effective for small
   sized canopies than 100\% air-assistance; it appeared that the latter
   propelled the spray beyond the canopy and reduced the spray deposition
   efficiency. Also, for the citrus canopies studied, the use of two or
   three nozzles instead of the lower six nozzles (i.e. the control
   treatment) might be more suitable since they would result in 50\% or
   less chemical usage while having comparable spray deposition to that of
   the control. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A molten catalytic process has been demonstrated for converting coal
   into a synthesis gas consisting of roughly 20\% methane and 80\%
   hydrogen using alkali hydroxides as both catalysts and in situ CO2
   capture agents. Baselines studies were also conducted using no catalyst,
   weak capture agents (CaSiO3) and strong in situ capture agent for acid
   gases (CaO). While a similar gas composition can be achieved using CaO
   rather than alkali hydroxides, the rate of syngas production is greater
   when using molten alkali hydroxides than when using CaO as the in situ
   capture agent for acid gases, such as HCl, H2S and CO2. Parametric
   studies were conducted to understand the effects of temperature,
   pressure, catalyst composition, steam flow rate and the ratio of coal to
   alkali hydroxide on the performance of the molten catalytic gasifier in
   terms of kinetics and syngas composition. To measure the amount and the
   rate of coal conversion, we have developed a method for quantifying the
   coal conversion as the reduction charge remaining, which is related to
   the chemical oxygen demand remaining in the coal. At temperatures
   between 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C, we measured first-order
   steam-coal gasification rates using sub-bituminous coal of 2 h(-1) in a
   fixed bed reactor while capturing significant quantities of both H2S and
   CO2, and while also generating 20\% methane plus ethane in the syngas on
   a dry volume basis.}},

Abstract = {{In the early embryo, a series of symmetric, paired vessels, the aortic
   arches, surround the foregut and distribute cardiac output to the
   growing embryo and fetus. During embryonic development, the arch vessels
   undergo large-scale asymmetric morphogenesis to form species-specific
   adult great vessel patterns. These transformations occur within a
   dynamic biomechanical environment, which can play an important role in
   the development of normal arch configurations or the aberrant arch
   morphologies associated with congenital cardiac defects. Arrested
   migration and rotation of the embryonic outflow tract during late stages
   of cardiac looping has been shown to produce both outflow tract and
   several arch abnormalities. Here, we investigate how changes in flow
   distribution due to a perturbation in the angular orientation of the
   embryonic outflow tract impact the morphogenesis and growth of the
   aortic arches. Using a combination of in vivo arch morphometry with
   fluorescent dye injection and hemodynamics-driven bioengineering
   optimization-based vascular growth modeling, we demonstrate that outflow
   tract orientation significantly changes during development and that the
   associated changes in hemodynamic load can dramatically influence
   downstream aortic arch patterning. Optimization reveals that balancing
   energy expenditure with diffusive capacity leads to multiple arch vessel
   patterns as seen in the embryo, while minimizing energy alone led to the
   single arch configuration seen in the mature arch of aorta. Our model
   further shows the critical importance of the orientation of the outflow
   tract in dictating morphogenesis to the adult single arch and accurately
   predicts arch IV as the dominant mature arch of aorta. These results
   support the hypothesis that abnormal positioning of the outflow tract
   during early cardiac morphogenesis may lead to congenital defects of the
   great vessels due to altered hemodynamic loading.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fully distributed state estimation algorithm for
   wide-area monitoring in power systems. Through iterative information
   exchange with designated neighboring control areas, all the balancing
   authorities (control areas) can achieve an unbiased estimate of the
   entire power system's state. In comparison with existing hierarchical or
   distributed state estimation methods, the novelty of the proposed
   approach lies in that: 1) the assumption of local observability of all
   the control areas is no longer needed; 2) the communication topology can
   be different than the physical topology of the power interconnection;
   and 3) for DC state estimation, no coordinator is required for each
   local control area to achieve provable convergence of the entire power
   system's states to those of the centralized estimation. The performance
   of both DC and AC state estimation using the proposed algorithm is
   illustrated in the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces new analytical techniques for performing

   hidden false data injection cyber-attack on a power grid's SCADA system.
   Specifically, we consider ac state estimation and describe how the

   protecting the power system from such an attack. We present an algorithm
   based on graph theory which allows determining how many and which
   measurement signals an attacker will attack in order to minimize his
   efforts in keeping the attack hidden from bad data detection. This
   provides guidance on which measurements are vulnerable and need
   increased protection. Hence, this paper provides insights into the
   vulnerabilities but also the inherent strengths provided by ac state
   estimation and network topology features such as buses without power
   injections.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1039-1053}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A number of high-profile seismic events have occurred in recent years,
   with a wide variation in the resulting economic damage and loss of life.
   This variation has been attributed in part to the stringency of seismic
   building codes implemented in different regions. Using the HAZUS
   Earthquake Model, a benefit-cost analysis was performed on varying
   levels of standard buildings codes for Haiti and Puerto Rico. The
   methodology computes expected loss assuming a Poisson event process with
   lognormally distributed event magnitude and idealized damage-magnitude
   response functions. The event frequency and magnitude distributions are
   estimated from the historical record, while the damage functions are fit
   using HAZUS simulation results for events with systematically varying
   magnitudes and different seismic code levels. To validate the approach,
   a single-event analysis was conducted using alternative building codes
   and mean magnitude earthquakes. A probabilistic analysis was then used
   to evaluate the long-term expected value for alternative levels of
   building codes. To account for the relationship between lives saved and
   economic loss, the implicit cost of saving a life is computed for each
   code option. It was found that in the two areas studied, the expected
   loss of life was reduced the most by use of high seismic building code
   levels, but lower levels of seismic building code were more
   cost-effective when considering only building damages and the costs for
   code implementation. The methodology presented is meant to provide a
   basic framework for the future development of an economic-behavioral
   model for code adoption.}},

Abstract = {{A novel biosensor was prepared by immobilizing glucose oxidase on
   multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-coated electrospun gold fibers.
   Homogeneous coating of the electrospun gold fibers by MWCNTs was
   achieved by electrophoretic deposition at 20V (40 V cm(-1)), a
   deposition time of 30 s and a solution concentration of 0.25 mg mL(-1).
   Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the complete coverage of MWCNTs
   on the fiber surface. The carboxylated MWCNTs on the gold fibers
   provided an anchor for covalent immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOX).
   GOX covalently coupled to conductive carbon nanotubes demonstrated
   direct electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode surface
   without the need for a redox active mediator. Electrochemical
   characterization of the fabricated sensor by cyclic voltammetry revealed
   that the immobilized GOX exhibited a surface-confined reversible
   two-electron and two-proton reaction, with an electron transfer rate
   constant, k(s), of 1.12 s(-1) and a surface coverage of 1.1 x 10(-12)
   mol cm(-2). The sensor produced a linear response to glucose
   concentration up to 30.0 mM with a sensitivity of 0.47 mu A mM(-1)
   cm(-2) and a detection limit of 4 mu M. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We consider a cyber-physical system consisting of two interacting
   networks, i.e., a cyber network overlaying a physical network. It is
   envisioned that these systems are more vulnerable to attacks since node
   failures in one network may result in (due to the interdependence)
   failures in the other network, causing a cascade of failures that would
   potentially lead to the collapse of the entire infrastructure. The
   robustness of interdependent systems against this sort of catastrophic
   failure hinges heavily on the allocation of the (interconnecting) links
   that connect nodes in one network to nodes in the other network. In this
   paper, we characterize the optimum inter-link allocation strategy
   against random attacks in the case where the topology of each individual
   network is unknown. In particular, we analyze the ``regular{''}
   allocation strategy that allots exactly the same number of bidirectional
   internetwork links to all nodes in the system. We show, both
   analytically and experimentally, that this strategy yields better
   performance (from a network resilience perspective) compared to all
   possible strategies, including strategies using random allocation,
   unidirectional interlinks, etc.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{381}},
Pages = {{183-188}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We quantify the phoretic migration of a spherical cation-permselective
   colloidal particle immersed in a binary electrolyte under a
   time-dependent electric field. We invoke the thin-Debye-layer
   approximation, where the size of ionic Debye layer enveloping the
   particle is much smaller than the particle radius. The imposed electric
   field generates ion concentration gradients, or concentration
   polarization, in the bulk (electroneutral) electrolyte outside the Debye
   layer. The bulk ion concentration polarization-and consequently the
   particle's phoretic velocity-evolves on the time scale for ion diffusion
   around the particle, which can be on the order of milliseconds for
   typical colloidal dimensions. Notably, concentration polarization arises
   here solely due to the permselectivity of the particle; it does not
   require non-uniform ionic transport in the Debye layer (i.e., surface
   conduction). Thus, the phoretic transport of a permselective particle is
   significantly different to that of a inert, dielectric particle, since
   surface conduction is necessary to achieve bulk concentration
   polarization in the (more commonly studied) latter case. Calculations
   are presented for a permselective particle under oscillatory (ac) and
   suddenly applied electric fields. In the former case, the particle
   velocity possesses frequency-dependent components in phase and out of
   phase with the driving field; in the latter case, the particle
   approaches its terminal velocity with a long-time (algebraic) tail. (C)

Abstract = {{The thermal expansion and magnetostriction of HoFe11-xCoxTi (x=0, 0.3,
   0.7 and 1) intermetallic compounds were measured, using the strain gauge

   up to 1.5 T. Results show that for samples with x=0 and 0.3, both linear
   thermal expansion and linear thermal expansion coefficient exhibit
   anomalies below the Curie temperature. Below room temperature, the
   spontaneous volume magnetostriction decreases with Co content. For all
   compounds studied, the anisotropic magnetostriction shows similar
   behaviour in the measured temperature range. The magnetostriction
   compensation occurs above room temperature in all samples. The volume
   magnetostriction shows a linear dependence on the applied field and by
   approaching the Curie temperature this trend changes to parastrictive
   behaviour. The results of the spontaneous magnetostriction are discussed

Abstract = {{A comparative study of treating mature landfill leachate with various
   treatment processes was conducted to investigate whether the method of
   combined processes of internal micro-electrolysis (IME) without aeration
   and IME with full aeration in one reactor was an efficient treatment for
   mature landfill leachate. A specifically designed novel sequencing batch
   internal micro-electrolysis reactor (SIME) with the latest automation
   technology was employed in the experiment. Experimental data showed that
   combined processes obtained a high COD removal efficiency of 73.7 +/-
   1.3\%, which was 15.2\% and 24.8\% higher than that of the IME with and
   without aeration, respectively. The SIME reactor also exhibited a COD
   removal efficiency of 86.1 +/- 3.8\% to mature landfill leachate in the
   continuous operation, which is much higher (p < 0.05) than that of
   conventional treatments of electrolysis (22.8-47.0\%),
   coagulation-sedimentation (18.5-22.2\%), and the Fenton process
   (19.9-40.2\%), respectively. The innovative concept behind this
   excellent performance is a combination effect of reductive and oxidative
   processes of the IME, and the integration electro-coagulation. Optimal
   operating parameters, including the initial pH, Fe/C mass ratio, air
   flow rate, and addition of H2O2, were optimized. All results show that
   the SIME reactor is a promising and efficient technology in treating
   mature landfill leachate. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trends in the dissociative oxygen adsorption energy and oxygen vacancy
   formation energy on cubic LaBO3 and SrBO3 perovskite (001) surfaces
   (where B = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) and their dependence
   on strain, d-band filling, and oxidation state were examined using
   density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation. The
   effects of strain were found to be small compared to the effects of
   d-band filling and oxidations state. Electronic structure descriptors
   such as the d-band center of the B-atom were identified for trends in
   the dissociative oxygen adsorption energy and for the oxygen vacancy
   formation energy. A chemical correlation between these two reaction
   energies was also identified showing the trends in these reaction
   energies are not independent of each other. (C) 2012 American Institute

Title = {{H-2-D-2 Exchange Kinetics in the Presence of H2S over Pd4S, Pd70Cu30,
   and Pd47Cu53 Surfaces}},

Abstract = {{H2S retards H-2 transport across Pd membranes used for H-2 separation by
   forming a Pd4S scale that has both low H2 dissociation activity and low
   H-atom permeability. As hydrogen purification membranes, alloys such as
   Pd70Cu30 and Pd47Cu53 are attractive alternatives to pure Pd due to
   their resistance to formation of bulk sulfides. Nonetheless, exposure to
   H2S can decrease the permeability of Pd70Cu30 and Pd47Cu53 membranes,
   presumably by poisoning the catalytic activity of their surfaces for H-2
   dissociation. In this work, the effect of H2S on H-2 dissociation on
   Pd4S, Pd70Cu30, and Pd47Cu53 surfaces is investigated by rnicrokinetic
   analysis of H-2-D-2 exchange kinetics over Pd4S, Pd70Cu30, and Pd47Cu53
   surfaces in the presence of varying concentrations of H2S at
   near-ambient H-2+H-2 pressure. We show that the rate of H-2-D-2 exchange
   over all three surfaces is significantly suppressed when H2S is added to
   H-2/D-2/Ar reactant mixtures and that the suppression of H-2-D-2
   exchange increases with increasing H2S concentration. Microkinetic
   analysis of the H-2-D-2 exchange kinetics reveals that H2S decreases the
   rate of H-2-D-2 exchange by two distinct mechanisms: (1) increasing the
   intrinsic barrier to H-2 dissociation and (2) blocking H-2 dissociation
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Fe-based atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene (St)
   with various triarylphosphines containing electron donating methoxy

   the presence of tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine (TMPP) and much faster
   than with triphenylphosphine (TPP) under identical conditions. ATRP of
   St was carried out with initial ratio of reagents:
   {[}St]:{[}EBiB]:{[}(FeBr3)-Br-III]:{[}TTMPP] = 200:1:1:2, in 50\% (v/v)
   anisole at 100 degrees C (EBiB is ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate). After 21 h,
   conversion reached 92\%, yielding polystyrene with molecular weight M-n
   = 24 100 and M-w/M-n = 1.25. With TMPP and TPP under the same
   conditions, the conversion of monomer was only 19\% and 9\%,
   respectively. With 1 equiv of TTMPP vs (FeBr3)-Br-III, control was
   better, M-w/M-n similar to 1.1, but polymerization was slower. The
   phosphines could directly reduce Fe to Feu but could also act as ligands
   complexing transition metal and forming efficient ATRP catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-recognized that low Sigma-CSL boundaries are highly populated
   in the grain boundary character distribution (CBCD) for austenitic
   stainless steel (SS) processed by low strain and subsequent annealing.
   However, large-strain plus annealing typically tends to introducing
   numerous random high angle grain boundaries (RHABs) instead of producing
   high fraction of Sigma 3, Sigma 9 and Sigma 27 boundaries. In this case,
   the distribution of grain boundary planes of RHABs must be very relevant
   to the properties of material. The current study is to explore the
   evolution of CBCD and grain boundary plane distribution (GBPD) in 304
   austenitic SS after large strain and subsequent annealing using electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and five-parameter analysis (FPA). After
   solid solution treatment, 304 steel samples were separately processed by
   multiple forging (MF) and direct rolling (DR) with true strain epsilon=2
   followed by same annealing at 900 degrees C for 2-120 mm Then the GBCDs
   and GBPDs of the two groups of samples were examined. The results show
   that the total Sigma 3(n) (n=1, 2, 3) special boundaries in any sample
   as processed take a length fraction of lower than 45\% out of the entire
   boundaries, and with annealing proceeding the incoherent 13 boundaries
   tend to be tuned into coherent ones and consequently the summation
   fractions of Sigma 9 and Sigma 27 boundaries decrease accordingly. In
   the two samples which were separately processed by MF and DR but
   followed by the same annealing at 900 degrees C for 120 min, their
   random boundaries or general high angle boundaries (Sigma 3(n) special
   boundaries filtered) mostly appeare to be the < 111 > twist and < 110 >
   tilt boundaries, indicating there exist grain boundary textures (GBT) in
   both samples. However, in the condition of some misorientations, the
   GBPDs of random boundaries are quite different in the two samples. For
   grain boundaries of < 111 >/30-40 degrees misorientation, more grain
   boundaries of twist type nearly on the exact \{111\} plane are found in
   the specimen processed by DR and annealing for 120 min (DR120) compared
   to that processed by MF and annealing for 120 min (MF120). For the grain
   boundaries of < 110 >/50 degrees misorientation, it was found that most
   of such boundaries in MF120 are tilt type and positioned on \{112\},
   \{113\} and \{115\} planes, whereas those in DR120 are tilt or mixed
   type positioned on \{001\}, \{111\} and \{012\} It was suggested that
   there are distinct effects of pre-processing on the GBPDs of annealed
   304 steel.}},

Title = {{Epistemic uncertainty in predicting shorebird biogeography affected by

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},

Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Accurate spatio-temporal predictions of land-cover are fundamentally
   important for assessing geomorphological and ecological patterns and
   processes. This study quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in the
   species distribution modeling, which is generated by spatio-temporal
   gaps between the biogeographical data, model selection and model
   complexity. Epistemic uncertainty is generally given by the sum of
   subjective and objective uncertainty. The subjective uncertainty
   generated by the modeler-choice in the manipulation of the environmental
   variables was analyzed. The Snowy Plover in Florida (Charadrius
   alexandrinus nivosus, SP), a residential shorebird whose geographic
   range is extended along the Panhandle-Big Bend-Peninsula Gulf coast was
   considered as case-study. The first fundamental step for studying the
   species distribution and how it will be affected by climate change is to
   obtain an accurate description of the shorebird coastal habitat. The
   land-cover was translated into ecosystem classes using a land-cover
   model that predicts the evolution of coastal ecosystems affected by
   sea-level rise scenarios. The best land-cover map decreased the
   objective uncertainty (intrinsically present in data or models) in
   representing the spatial structure of the coastal ecosystem, reduced the
   temporal gaps with the occurrence data, and diminished the subjective
   uncertainty due to the conversion from land-cover to model-classes.
   Multimodeling was performed to reduce the uncertainty in the prediction
   of the species distribution related to model uncertainty. The best
   representation of the species distribution was performed by MAXENT. The
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the
   omission/commission test, the similarity index of the response curves,
   and the jackknife test were used simultaneously as indicators of the
   predictability of each species distribution model. The availability of
   updated high-resolution biogeoclimatological data was proven to be
   necessary in order to properly predict the species ranges for
   conservation purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},

Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{We have studied the dynamic behavior of nanoparticles in ferrofluids
   consisting of single-domain, biogenic magnetite (Fe3O4) isolated from
   Magnetospirillum magnetotacticunz (MS-1). Although dipolar chains form
   in magnetic colloids in zero applied field, when dried upon substrates,
   the solvent front disorders nanoparticle aggregation. Using
   avidin-biotin functionalization of the particles and substrate, we
   generated self-assembled, linear chain motifs that resist solvent front
   disruption in zero-field. The engineered self-assembly process we
   describe here provides an approach for the creation of ordered magnetic
   structures that could impact fields ranging from
   micro-electro-mechanical systems development to magnetic imaging of
   biological structures. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Calcium signaling is gated by a mechanical threshold in
   three-dimensional environments}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Cells interpret their mechanical environment using diverse signaling
   pathways that affect complex phenotypes. These pathways often interact
   with ubiquitous 2nd-messengers such as calcium. Understanding
   mechanically-induced calcium signaling is especially important in
   fibroblasts, cells that exist in three-dimensional fibrous matrices,
   sense their mechanical environment, and remodel tissue morphology. Here,
   we examined calcium signaling in fibroblasts using a minimal-profile,
   three-dimensional (MP3D) mechanical assay system, and compared responses
   to those elicited by conventional, two-dimensional magnetic tensile
   cytometry and substratum stretching. Using the MP3D system, we observed
   robust mechanically-induced calcium responses that could not be
   recreated using either two-dimensional technique. Furthermore, we used
   the MP3D system to identify a critical displacement threshold governing
   an all-or-nothing mechanically-induced calcium response. We believe
   these findings significantly increase our understanding of the critical
   role of calcium signaling in cells in three-dimensional environments
   with broad implications in development and disease.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{The initial stage in the oxidation of Cu single crystal surfaces has
   been studied on a surface structure spread single crystal ((SC)-C-4)
   exposing a continuous distribution of all Cu(hkl) surface orientations
   lying within 10 degrees polar angle of the (111) plane, Cu(111)+/- 10
   degrees-(SC)-C-4. The uptake of oxygen across the Cu(111) +/- 10
   degrees-(SC)-C-4 during exposure to O-2 at 300 K has been measured using
   spatially resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the
   resulting Cu2O surface oxide layer has been imaged using scanning
   tunneling microscopy (STM). Uptake of oxygen is dependent on surface
   step density and increases with increasing polar angle relative to the
   (111) pole. In contrast, the oxygen uptake does not depend on the
   crystallographic orientation of the step edge or, in other words, the
   kink density along the step edge. STM images reveal that once oxidation
   of the step edges begins, all of the boundaries of the Cu2O step oxide
   layer are oriented along (100) step edges in the Cu(111) terrace
   independent of the initial orientation of the step. In other words, the
   oxidizing step edges have no memory of their original orientation, and
   thus, the step growth depends only on step density and not on the kink
   density along the step edge. The combined use of both spatially resolved
   XPS and atomic scale imaging with STM on a Cu(111) +/- 10
   degrees-(SC)-C-4 has provided unique insight into the origins of
   structure-sensitive surface chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to examine the dynamics of soil-structure
   systems supported on isolated spread footings, in contradistinction with
   the rigid basemat often used in soil-structure interaction (SSI)
   studies. By considering a column-supported single-story structure on
   isolated footings, an explicit formula for the fundamental natural
   period of the system was obtained. This allows examination of the
   relative importance of the various system parameters that cause the
   natural period of the SSI system to increase compared with that of the
   corresponding fixed-base system. The key parameter is the relative
   stiffness of an individual column to the rocking stiffness of the
   corresponding footing. If this parameter is small (<0.5), there is
   little interaction (change in period <20\%). If it is large (>4), the
   base of the column behaves essentially as a hinge, and the natural
   period tends to double with respect to that of the structure on a rigid
   base because of the effect of rocking of the individual footings. The
   lateral and vertical stiffness of the individual footings play a lesser
   role. Numerical results for a particular model illustrate this effect.

Abstract = {{Here we present a novel atlas-based geometry pipeline for constructing
   three-dimensional cubic Hermite finite element meshes of the whole human
   heart from tomographic patient image data. To build the cardiac atlas,
   two superior atria, two inferior ventricles as well as the aorta and the
   pulmonary trunk are first segmented, and epicardial and endocardial
   boundary surfaces are extracted and smoothed. Critical points and
   skeletons (or central-line paths) are identified, following the cardiac
   topology. The surface model and the path tree are used to construct a
   hexahedral control mesh via a skeleton-based sweeping method. Derivative
   parameters are computed from the control mesh, defining cubic Hermite
   finite elements. The thickness of the atria and the ventricles is
   obtained using segmented epicardial boundaries or via offsetting from
   the endocardial surfaces in regions where the image resolution is
   insufficient. We also develop a robust optical flow approach to deform
   the constructed atlas and align it with the image from a second patient.
   This registration method is fully-automatic, and avoids manual
   operations required by segmentation and path extraction. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that this method can also be used to deformably map
   diffusion tensor MRI data with patient geometries to include fiber and
   sheet orientations in the finite element model. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The hierarchical construction of solid models with current
   computer-aided design systems provide little support in creating and
   editing free-form surfaces commonly encountered in industrial design. In
   this work, we propose a new design exploration method that enables
   sketch-based editing of free-form surface geometries where specific
   modifications can be applied at different levels of detail. This
   multilevel detail approach allows the designer to work from existing
   models and make alterations at coarse and fine representations of the
   geometry, thereby providing increased conceptual flexibility during
   modeling. At the heart of our approach lies a multiscale representation
   of the geometry obtained through a spectral analysis on the discrete
   free-form surface. This representation is accompanied by a sketch-based
   surface editing algorithm that enables edits to be made at different
   levels. The seamless transfer of modifications across different levels
   of detail facilitates a fluid exploration of the geometry by eliminating
   the need for a manual specification of the shape hierarchy. We
   demonstrate our method with several design examples.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed Fe-Ni oxide electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in
   alkaline electrolytes were synthesized using three different approaches:
   evaporation induced self-assembly, hard templating, and dip-coating. For
   each synthesis method, a peak in oxygen evolution activity was observed
   near 10 mol \% Fe content, where the mixed metal oxide was substantially
   more active than the parent metal oxide electrocatalysts. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the formation of a mixed NiO/NiFe2O4
   phase at low Fe concentrations, and formation of Fe2O3 at compositions
   above 25 mol \% Fe. Raman vibrational spectroscopy confirmed the
   formation of NiFe2O4, and did not detect Fe2O3 in the electrocatalysts
   containing up to 20 mol \% Fe. X-ray absorption near edge structure
   (XCANES) showed the Fe in the mixed oxides to be predominantly in the +3
   oxidation state. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showed
   changes in the Fe coordination shells under electrochemical oxygen
   evolution conditions. Temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy
   showed the mixed oxide surfaces also have superior oxidation activity
   for methanol oxidation, and that the reactivity of the mixed oxide
   surface is substantially different than that of the parent metal oxide
   surfaces. Overall, the NiFe2O4 phase is implicated in having a
   significant role in improving the oxygen evolution activity of the mixed
   metal oxide systems.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission investments are currently needed to meet an increasing
   electricity demand while enhancing security of supply, promoting
   competition, and integrating renewable energy. A key issue when
   assessing the benefits from an expanded grid concerns the valuation of
   the uncertain cash flows that result from the expansion. We develop a
   valuation model which combines optimization techniques, Monte Carlo
   simulation over the expansion project lifetime, and market data from
   futures contracts on commodities. Our multivariate stochastic model
   accounts for uncertain dynamics on both the demand side and the supply
   side. It can assist decision makers when confronted with challenging
   strategic portfolio choices regarding generation and transmission
   infrastructures. Though our ultimate goal is to develop a generalizable
   model, to demonstrate the model by example we consider a simplified
   network with two nodes. We then focus on the proposed Western HVDC
   subsea link between England/Wales and Scotland, and simulate the whole
   distribution of effects on major system variables over its useful life.

   costs arising from additional fuel requirements and production losses
   associated with condenser fouling are in the range of 0.4-2.2 Million

Title = {{Predicting conditions for microscale surfactant mediated tipstreaming}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microscale tipstreaming is a unique method to overcome the limiting
   length scale in microfluidics allowing for production of submicron-sized
   droplets. Tipstreaming is the ejection of small drops from a liquid
   thread formed by interfacial tension gradients and convective transport
   of surfactant. Controlling and understanding this process is essential
   for successful application in areas such as synthesis of nano-scale
   particles, manipulation of biomolecules, enzyme activity studies, and
   others. However, models that predict operating conditions for microscale
   tipstreaming do not currently exist. In this work, we develop a
   semi-analytical model aimed at capturing the essential physics of the
   tipstreaming mechanism. The model relies on interfacial shape
   observations indicative of microscale tipstreaming to simplify the fluid
   flow and surfactant transport equations. The result is an interfacial
   mass balance of surfactant. Conditions where the mass balance can be
   satisfied define the operating conditions for microscale tipstreaming.
   Results from the model are compared with our own experimental results.
   Good agreement is found between model predictions and experiments.
   Scaling of each boundary that controls the feasible tipstreaming region
   is given. Finally, the model is able to guide selection of device
   geometry and surfactant properties to shift or expand the feasible
   region where microscale tipstreaming is expected. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Large-eddy simulation of turbulent channel flow using explicit filtering
   and dynamic mixed models}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow at Re-tau = 395 are
   performed using explicit filtering. Two different subfilter-scale
   models, the dynamic Smagorinsky mixed model and the dynamic
   global-coefficient mixed model, are formulated in accordance with the
   explicitly filtered governing equations. The use of explicit filtering
   separates the filtering operation from discretization, thereby producing
   a grid-independent solution. In explicit-filter large-eddy simulations,
   both the dynamic Smagorinsky mixed and the dynamic global-coefficient
   mixed subfilter-scale models are found to produce solutions close to the
   non-filtered direct numerical simulation data when explicit-filter
   widths in the streamwise and spanwise directions and at the center of
   the channel in the wall normal direction are about four times the grid
   spacings for direct numerical simulation. Solutions obtained using
   explicit-filter large-eddy simulation are compared with solutions
   obtained using implicit-filter large-eddy simulation in a range of
   filter and grid resolution. Explicit-filter large-eddy simulations
   performed on gradually refined grids with a fixed set of explicit-filter
   widths are found to produce grid-converged solutions for both models.
   Similarly in implicit-filter large-eddy simulation, predictive
   capabilities of subfilter-scale models in explicit-filter large-eddy
   simulation are found to be interfered with truncation errors when the
   ratio of the explicit-filter width to the grid spacing is small. (C)

Title = {{Uncertainty in Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from United States
   Coal}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4917-4923}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Coal is an abundant energy resource, consumed in the United States
   chiefly by the power generation sector. Due to potential energy security
   benefits, it has also been considered as an alternate source for
   gasoline and diesel production. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have
   previously estimated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal
   combustion as well as upstream activities such as mining and transport,
   to compare its environmental impact with other fuels. Until recent
   years, LCA studies predominantly ignored the uncertainty and variability
   inherent in life cycle assessment. More recent work has estimated the
   uncertainty in the life cycle inventories of fossil fuels, but the use
   of these uncertainty ranges to model system-wide impacts has been
   limited. As shown by previous studies, uncertainty often affects the
   conclusions of comparative life cycle assessments, especially when
   differences in average environmental impacts between two competing
   fuels/products are small. This study builds upon an existing
   deterministic life cycle framework for coal and develops uncertainty
   estimates of associated greenhouse gas emissions, with the objective of
   supporting more robust decision-making in comparative energy systems
   analyses involving coal. Greenhouse gas emissions from fuel use and
   methane releases at coal mines, fuel use for coal transport and
   combustion of coal, based on publicly available data are included in the
   life cycle framework. Mean life cycle GHG emissions from coal are
   estimated to be 96 g CO(2)e/MJ, while the 90\% confidence interval
   ranged between 89 and 106 g CO(2)e/MJ. Life cycle greenhouse gas
   emissions from Fischer-Tropsch (FT) coal-based gasoline are
   stochastically compared to emissions from petroleum-based gasoline. In
   the base case modeled, emissions from coal-based FT gasoline were found
   to be higher than emissions from petroleum-based gasoline with a
   probability of 80\%, while they are lower with a probability of 20\%.
   Results suggest that incorporating uncertainty in life cycle estimates
   is important, especially if these estimates are to be used within policy
   frameworks.}},

Title = {{An Extended Pattern Search Approach to Wind Farm Layout Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{An extended pattern search approach is presented for the optimization of
   the placement of wind turbines on a wind farm. Problem-specific
   extensions infuse stochastic characteristics into the deterministic
   pattern search, inhibiting convergence on local optima and yielding
   better results than pattern search alone. The optimal layout for a wind
   farm is considered here to be one that maximizes the power generation of
   the farm while minimizing the farm cost. To estimate the power output,
   an established wake model is used to account for the aerodynamic effects
   of turbine blades on downstream wind speed, as the oncoming wind speed
   for any turbine is proportional to the amount of power the turbine can
   produce. As turbines on a wind farm are in close proximity, the
   interaction of turbulent wakes developed by the turbines can have a
   significant effect on the power development capability of the farm. The
   farm cost is estimated using an accepted simplified model that is a
   function of the number of turbines. The algorithm develops a
   two-dimensional layout for a given number of turbines, performing local
   turbine movement while applying global evaluation. Three test cases are
   presented: (a) constant, unidirectional wind, (b) constant,
   multidirectional wind, and (c) varying, multidirectional wind. The
   purpose of this work is to explore the ability of an extended pattern
   search (EPS) algorithm to solve the wind farm layout problem, as EPS has
   been shown to be particularly effective in solving multimodal layout
   problems. It is also intended to show that the inclusion of extensions
   into the algorithm can better inform the search than algorithms that
   have been previously presented in the literature. Resulting layouts
   created by this extended pattern search algorithm develop more power
   than previously explored algorithms using the same evaluation models and
   objective functions. In addition, the algorithm's resulting layouts
   motivate a heuristic that aids in the manual development of the best
   layout found to date. The results of this work validate the application
   of an extended pattern search algorithm to the wind farm layout problem,
   and that its performance is enhanced by the use of problem-specific
   extensions that aid in developing results that are superior to those
   developed by previous algorithms. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006997]}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Economists and policy makers increasingly consult national household
   surveys asking individuals about their economic circumstances, financial
   decisions, and expectations for the future. For decades, the
   Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers and other national surveys have
   asked about expectations for ``prices in general{''}, with responses
   being used by academic economists, policy makers, and central bankers.
   Although median responses track official inflation estimates,
   respondents exhibit considerable disagreement, with some reporting
   seemingly large overestimations. Here, we demonstrate that changes in
   the wording of survey questions about inflation expectations affect the
   central tendency of responses as well as their dispersion. We randomly
   assigned respondents to questions asking about ``prices in general{''},
   ``inflation{''}, or ``prices you pay{''}. Respondents' expectations and
   perceptions were lower and less dispersed when questions asked about
   ``inflation{''} instead of ``prices in general{''} or ``prices you
   pay{''}, with the latter two formulations eliciting similar response
   patterns. These question-wording effects were mediated by how much
   respondents thought of (extreme) personal price experiences when
   receiving questions about ``prices in general{''} or ``prices you
   pay{''}. Compared to questions about ``inflation{''}, questions about
   ``prices in general{''} and ``prices you pay{''} elicited expectations
   that were more strongly correlated to expected increases in gas prices,
   which were relatively large and likely salient at that time. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Developments in nanotechnology have led to innovative progress and
   converging technologies in engineering and science. These demand novel
   methodologies that enable efficient communications from the nanoscale
   all the way to decision-making criteria for actual production systems.
   In this paper, we discuss the convergence of nanotechnology and novel
   multi-scale modeling paradigms by using the fuel cell system as a
   benchmark example. This approach includes complex multi-phenomena at
   different time and length scales along with the introduction of an
   optimization framework for application-driven nanotechnology research
   trends. The modeling paradigm introduced here covers the novel holistic
   integration from atomistic/molecular phenomena to meso/continuum scales.
   System optimization is also discussed with respect to the reduced order
   parameters for a coarse-graining procedure in multi-scale model
   integration as well as system design. The development of a hierarchical
   multi-scale paradigm consolidates the theoretical analysis and enables
   large-scale decision-making of process level design, based on
   first-principles, and therefore promotes the convergence of
   nanotechnology to sustainable energy technologies.}},

   of processing, reconstruction, and tractography methods that can track
   white matter fibers from cortex, through complex fiber crossings, to
   cortical and subcortical targets with subvoxel resolution.
   OBJECTIVE: To perform neuroanatomical validation of HDFT and to
   investigate its neurosurgical applications.
   METHODS: Six neurologically healthy adults and 36 patients with brain
   lesions were studied. Diffusion spectrum imaging data were reconstructed
   with a Generalized Q-Ball Imaging approach. Fiber dissection studies
   were performed in 20 human brains, and selected dissection results were
   compared with tractography.
   RESULTS: HDFT provides accurate replication of known neuroanatomical
   features such as the gyral and sulcal folding patterns, the
   characteristic shape of the claustrum, the segmentation of the thalamic
   nuclei, the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, the
   multiple fiber crossing at the centrum semiovale, the complex angulation
   of the optic radiations, the terminal arborization of the arcuate tract,
   and the cortical segmentation of the dorsal Broca area. From a clinical
   perspective, we show that HDFT provides accurate structural connectivity
   studies in patients with intracerebral lesions, allowing qualitative and
   quantitative white matter damage assessment, aiding in understanding
   lesional patterns of white matter structural injury, and facilitating
   innovative neurosurgical applications. High-grade gliomas produce
   significant disruption of fibers, and low-grade gliomas cause fiber
   displacement. Cavernomas cause both displacement and disruption of
   fibers.
   CONCLUSION: Our HDFT approach provides an accurate reconstruction of
   white matter fiber tracts with unprecedented detail in both the normal
   and pathological human brain. Further studies to validate the clinical
   findings are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Project management tasks, such as productivity monitoring and cost
   estimation, require data to be fused from multiple data sources, which
   are typically spatial and temporal in nature. In order to fuse a pair of

   spatial and temporal reasoning mechanisms needed to fuse spatial and
   temporal data sources to support construction productivity monitoring.
   In addition, the paper also describes two different approaches (i.e.,
   interpolation and nearest neighbor approaches) that can be used to
   synchronize the temporal and/or spatial data sources. The developed
   taxonomy has been validated based on representative queries of
   construction engineers and managers that are identified in previous
   research studies. The interpolation and nearest neighbor approaches have
   been validated with real and simulated construction data sources. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: Functionally univentricular heart (FUH) anomalies are the
   leading cause of death from all structural birth defects. Total
   cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) is the last stage of the palliative
   surgical reconstruction with significant late hemodynamic complications
   requiring high-risk heart transplantation. Alternative therapeutic
   options for these critically ill patients are crucial. In Phase I, we
   investigated the effect of pulsatility of venous flow (VF) waveform on
   the performance of functional and ``failing{''} Fontan (FF) patients
   based on conduit power loss. In phase 2, the effect of enhanced external
   counter pulsation on Fontan circulation flow rates is monitored.
   Methods: In phase 1, Doppler VFs were acquired from FF patients with
   ventricle dysfunction. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD),
   hemodynamic efficiencies of the FF, functional and in-vitro generated
   mechanically assisted VF waveforms were evaluated. In phase 2, Fontan
   circulation on sheep model was created and enhanced external counter
   pulsation (EECP) applied.
   Results: Variations in the pulsatile content of the VF waveforms altered
   conduit efficiency notably. High frequency and low amplitude
   oscillations lowered the pulsatile component of power losses in FF VF
   waveforms. The systemic venous flow, pulmonary artery and aorta flows
   increased by utilizing EECP.
   Conclusion: Our data highlighted the significance of VF pulsatility on
   energy efficiency inside SV circulation and the feasibility of VF
   waveform optimization. EECP assist in Fontan circulation can result in
   venous flow augmentation. (Anadolu Kardiyol Derg 2012; 12: 420-6)}},

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Background. Aortic arch reconstruction in neonates is commonly performed
   using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. However, concerns have arisen
   regarding potential adverse neurologic outcomes from this complex
   procedure, raising questions about the best arterial cannulation
   approach for cerebral perfusion and effective systemic hypothermia. In
   this study, we use computational fluid dynamics to investigate the
   effect of different cannulation strategies in neonates.
   Methods. We used a realistic template of a hypoplastic neonatal aorta as
   the base geometry to investigate four cannulation options: (1) right
   innominate artery, (2) innominate root, (3) patent ductus arteriosus
   (PDA), or (4) innominate root and PDA. Performance was evaluated
   according to the numerically predicted cerebral and systemic flow
   distributions compared with physiologic perfusion under neonatal
   conditions.
   Results. The four cannulation strategies were associated with different
   local hemodynamics; however, this did not translate into any significant
   effect on the measured flow distributions. The largest difference only
   represented 0.8\% of the cardiac output and was measured in the
   innominate artery, which received 23.2\% of the cardiac output in option
   3 vs 24\% in option 4. Pulmonary artery snaring benefited all systemic
   vessels uniformly.
   Conclusions. Because of the very high vascular resistances in neonates,
   downstream vascular resistances dictated flow distribution to the
   different vascular beds rather than the cannulation strategy, allowing
   the surgical team to choose their method of preference. However,
   patients with aortic coarctation warrant further investigation and will
   most likely benefit from a 2-cannulae approach (option 4). (Ann Thorac

Abstract = {{The purposes of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetics of
   recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) from a
   polyurethane (PUR)-based porous scaffold and to determine the biological
   responses of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to the rhBMP-2
   released from those scaffolds. The rhBMP-2 was incorporated into the PUR
   three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds and release profiles were
   determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The bioactivity of
   the rhBMP-2 containing releasates was determined using hMSCs and
   compared with exogenous rhBMP-2. Release of rhBMP-2 from PUR-based
   systems was bi-phasic and characterized by an initial burst followed by
   a sustained release for up to 21 days. Expression of alkaline
   phosphatase activity by hMSCs treated with the rhBMP-2 releasates was
   significantly greater than the cells alone (control) throughout the time
   periods. Furthermore, after 14 days of culture, the hMSCs cultured with
   rhBMP-2 releasate had a greater amount of mineralization compared to
   exogenous rhBMP-2. Overall, the rhBMP-2 release from the PUR-based
   scaffolds was sustained for 21 days and the releasates appeared to be
   bioactive and promoted earlier osteogenic differentiation and
   mineralization of hMSCs than the exogenous rhBMP-2.}},

Abstract = {{In our previous work (Lazarus and Fedder 2011 J. Micromech. Microeng. 21
   0650281), we demonstrated a CMOS-MEMS capacitive humidity sensor with a
   72\% improvement in sensitivity over the highest previously integrated

   faster and more manufacturable high-sensitivity capacitive humidity
   sensor. These techniques include adding oxide pillars to hold the plates
   apart, spin coating polymer to allow sensors to be fabricated more
   cheaply, adding a polysilicon heater and etching away excess polymer in
   the release holes. In most cases a tradeoff was found between
   sensitivity and other factors such as response time or robustness. A
   robust high-speed sensor was designed with a sensitivity of 0.21\%
   change in capacitance per per cent relative humidity, while dropping the
   response time constant from 70 to 4s. Although less sensitive than our
   design, the sensor remains 17\% more sensitive than the most sensitive

Abstract = {{Active Shape Models (ASMs) have recently gained popularity for
   performing automatic facial landmark fitting. Their demonstrated ability
   to generalize and fit unseen faces make them ideal candidates for this
   task unlike the traditional Active Appearance Model (AAM)-based
   approaches, which have difficulty in accurately landmarking unseen
   images. Given a test image, a face detector is used to determine the
   locations, orientations and sizes of faces in the image. Facial
   landmarking algorithms, such as ASMs, are initialized based on these
   parameters. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments to
   exhaustively evaluate the tolerance of three popular ASMs to
   initialization perturbations (translation, rotation, and scaling in
   size) of the face detected, a topic that has not been analyzed in depth
   to date. Our results are consistent across different databases, provide
   an understanding of the role initialization plays in the landmark
   fitting process and serve as a performance gauge that could be
   considered when comparing facial landmarking algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{We study the large deviations performance of consensus+innovations
   distributed detection over noisy networks, where agents at a time step
   cooperate with their immediate neighbors (consensus) and assimilate
   their new observations (innovation.) We show that, under noisy
   communication, all agents can still achieve an exponential error rate,
   even when certain (or most) agents cannot detect the event of interest
   in isolation. The key to achieving this is the appropriate design of the
   time-varying weight sequence by which agents weigh their neighbors'
   messages. We find a communication payoff threshold on the communication
   noise power, i.e., the critical noise power below which cooperation
   among neighbors improves detection performance and above which the noise
   in the communication among agents overwhelms the distributed detector
   performance. Numerical examples illustrate several tradeoffs among
   network parameters and between the time (or number of measurements)
   needed for a reliable decision and the transmission power invested by
   the agents.}},

   inclusions to liquid or partially liquid calcium aluminates. Spinels
   (Al2O3 center dot xMgO) can also form in liquid steel after aluminum
   deoxidation. Like alumina, the spinels can be modified readily to liquid
   inclusions by a calcium treatment. The modification of spinels was
   studied by observing the transient evolution of inclusions, in
   laboratory and industrial heats. Spinel modification involves the
   preferential reduction of MgO from the spinel, with Mg dissolving in the
   steel, and it proceeds through transient calcium sulfide formation, just
   like in the case of alumina inclusions. Because magnesium dissolves in
   steel after the calcium treatment of spinels, the reoxidation of the
   melt will produce new spinels.}},

Abstract = {{Various mechanical characteristics of tilted and non-tilted grain
   boundaries in graphene were investigated under tension and compression
   in directions perpendicular and parallel to the grain boundaries using
   molecular dynamics simulation. In contrast to the non-tilted grain
   boundary and the pristine graphene, the mechanical response of tilted
   grain boundary was observed to be quite unique under perpendicular
   tension, exhibiting distinct crack propagation prior to tensile failure
   and the subsequent pattern of incomplete fracture. These features are
   manifested as a remarkable decrease in the slope and a rugged pattern in
   the stress-strain curves. The characteristic of incomplete fracture was
   striking especially for large misorientation angles with formation of
   long monoatomic carbon chains, suggesting a methodology for feasible
   production of the monoatomic carbon chains that have been difficult to
   synthesize and extract. Under perpendicular compression, the folding of
   the sheet occurred consistently along grain boundaries during the entire
   process, indicating a tunable folding, while the folding line wandered
   extensively for pristine graphene. Under parallel compression, we found
   that folding along grain boundaries disturbed the bending of the
   graphene substantially for intrinsic reinforcement. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{268-283}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for the characterization of dynamic
   behavior of piezoelectric-stack actuators. Piezo-stack actuators are
   used in many fields to obtain high-accuracy displacements and
   vibrations, commonly in multiple dimensions. However, obtaining accurate
   motions from piezo-stack actuators require thorough characterization of
   their non-linear dynamic response characteristics in three dimensions.
   In this work, a laser Doppler vibrometer-based precision
   characterization system is created to measure the three-dimensional
   dynamic motions of the piezo-stack actuators within a wide frequency
   range. A measurement reference frame is obtained by arranging three
   laser beams in a mutually orthogonal configuration. A set of
   stepped-sine tests are conducted at different levels of excitation
   amplitudes by individually exciting each of the stacks (of a multi-stack
   piezo actuator) and measuring the three-dimensional response in the
   measurement reference frame. The resulting dynamic response is
   decomposed into its components that occur at harmonics and non-harmonics
   of the excitation frequency. A power analysis is then conducted to
   determine the amount of contribution of each response component
   (harmonic or non-harmonic) in the overall response. The response
   behavior is then represented using a new approach constructed by
   extending the conventional frequency response function (FRF) description
   to higher-harmonic and non-harmonic components. The application of the
   approach is demonstrated by testing two three-axis piezo-stack
   actuators. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-grained dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) is an important
   tool in managing the balance between power and performance in
   chip-multiprocessors. Although manufacturing process variations are
   giving rise to significant core-to-core variations in power and
   performance, traditional DVFS controllers are unaware of these
   variations. Exploiting the different power profiles of the cores can
   significantly improve energy efficiency. Process variations do not
   significantly affect dynamic power, so less-leaky processing units are
   more energy-efficient than their leakier counterparts at a given supply
   voltage and frequency. Taking advantage of this observation, three
   existing DVFS control algorithms are modified to shift work from
   inefficient, leaky processing units to efficient, less leaky ones,
   maintaining performance while reducing total power consumption. This
   work-shifting is carried out both between dies in a given speed bin and
   between voltage/frequency islands on a given die. The gains enabled by
   incorporating variability-awareness into the three DVFS algorithms are
   demonstrated on both multithreaded and multiprogrammed workloads. For a
   baseline 16-core design with per-core voltage/frequency islands (VFIs)
   and a 4 x 4 mesh on-chip network, the aggregate power per squared
   throughput (power/throughput(2) or P/T-2) over all fabricated dies is
   reduced by 9.2\%, 5.7\%, and 7.7\% for the three controllers. Chip
   multiprocessor designs using other VFI granularities and network
   topologies are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline materials are generally thought to have grain size
   distributions that correspond to log-normal. Statistical volume elements
   can use such geometric shape distributions to simulate single-phase
   polycrystals. When the log-normal distribution is used for grain size,
   however, it can give rise to nonphysical large grains that cannot be
   practically accommodated in finite simulation volumes. The application
   of other distributions that afford better control of the upper tails,
   e.g., truncated distributions, resolves the problem and allows more
   representative distributions to be generated. These points are
   illustrated with an example of generation of a synthetic
   three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure to represent the nickel-based
   superalloy Inconel 100, which exhibits significant upper tail departure
   from log-normal. Twin insertion, to represent annealing twins, will also
   be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The access to water and the engineered landscapes accommodating its
   collection and allocation are pivotal issues for assessing
   sustainability. Recent mapping, sediment coring, and formal excavation
   at Tikal, Guatemala, have markedly expanded our understanding of ancient
   Maya water and land use. Among the landscape and engineering feats
   identified are the largest ancient dam identified in the Maya area of
   Central America; the posited manner by which reservoir waters were
   released; construction of a cofferdam for dredging the largest reservoir
   at Tikal; the presence of ancient springs linked to the initial
   colonization of Tikal; the use of sand filtration to cleanse water
   entering reservoirs; a switching station that facilitated seasonal
   filling and release; and the deepest rock-cut canal segment in the Maya
   Lowlands. These engineering achievements were integrated into a system
   that sustained the urban complex through deep time, and they have
   implications for sustainable construction and use of water management
   systems in tropical forest settings worldwide.}},

Title = {{Characterization of optical, chemical, and structural changes upon

Abstract = {{Sensor technologies that can operate under extreme conditions including
   high temperatures, high pressures, highly reducing and oxidizing
   environments, and corrosive gases are needed for process monitoring and
   control in advanced fossil energy applications. Optical sensors based on
   metal oxide thin films are important candidates and an improved
   understanding of the fundamental link between structural/chemical
   changes in thin films and measured optical properties in the presence of
   various gas species under relevant conditions is needed to aid in sensor
   development efforts. In support of this need, the manuscript describes
   the synthesis and structural/optical characterization of SnO2 thin films
   through standard sol-gel techniques that are subsequently reduced in an
   inert atmosphere containing 4-10\% hydrogen. Early stage film reduction
   occurs through formation of metallic liquid Sn nanoparticles upon
   exposure to hydrogen at elevated temperatures (>similar to 500 degrees
   C) that solidify upon cooling to room temperature. Simulated sensing
   measurements illustrate that a significant change in transmission of
   films deposited on planar substrates were observed under conditions
   where significant film reduction occurred. Because film reduction is an
   irreversible process in the absence of an oxidizing species, these
   results suggest that SnO2 may have limited practical use as a high
   temperature material for optical sensing in reducing atmospheres. Our
   results also highlight that caution must be employed in the
   interpretation of high temperature sensing results based upon standard
   surface interaction models for temperatures and gas environments where
   bulk film reduction may occur. This work serves as a basis for similar
   investigations in other standard metal oxide systems for gas sensing
   applications such as TiO2, ZnO, and WO3. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In the integration of oxy-fuel combustion to turbine power generation
   system, turbine alloys are exposed to high temperature and an atmosphere
   comprised of steam, CO2 and O-2. While surface and internal oxidation of
   the alloy takes place, the microstructure in the subsurface region also
   changes due to oxidation. In this study, bare metal coupons of Ni-base
   superalloys were exposed in oxy-fuel combustion environment for up to
   1000 h and the oxidation-related microstructures were examined. Phase
   transformation occurred in the subsurface region in Ni-based superalloy
   and led to twinning. The transformation product phases were analyzed
   through thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and various electron
   microscopy techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The mechanism by which the phase transformation and
   the formation of the microstructure occurred was also discussed. The
   possible effects of the product phases on the performance of the alloy
   in service were discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a study of the classical electrical resistivity size
   effect in tungsten. The important length scale for this size effect is
   the isotropic average electron mean free path (EMFP), which was
   determined to be 19.1 nm for W at 293 K by employing density functional
   theory. To explore the size effect experimentally, (110) oriented
   epitaxial W films with thicknesses ranging from 9.8 to 299.7 nm were
   prepared by sputter deposition onto (11 (2) over bar0) Al2O3 substrates
   at 520 degrees C followed by postdeposition annealing in Ar-4\%H-2 at
   850 degrees C. Film resistivities were measured at room temperature and
   at liquid He temperature. The Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) surface scattering
   model with a low specularity parameter (p = 0.11) was shown to provide a
   good description of the film resistivity as a function of film
   thickness. Further, it is shown that an upper bound to the EMFP cannot
   be established by fitting resistivity data to the FS model, whereas a
   lower bound can be assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Soft particle electrokinetic models have been used to determine adsorbed
   nonionic polymer and polyelectrolyte layer properties on nanoparticles
   or colloids by fitting electrophoretic mobility data. Ohshima first
   established the formalism for these models and provided analytical
   approximations (Ohshima, H. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995, 62, 189).
   More recently, exact numerical solutions have been developed, which
   account for polarization and relaxation effects and require fewer
   assumptions on the particle and soft layer properties. This paper
   characterizes statistical uncertainty in the polyelectrolyte layer
   charge density, layer thickness, and permeability (Brinkman screening
   length) obtained from fitting data to either the analytical or numerical
   electrokinetic models. Various combinations of particle core and polymer
   layer properties are investigated to determine the range of systems for
   which this analysis can provide a solution with reasonably small
   uncertainty bounds, particularly for layer thickness. Identifiability of
   layer thickness in the analytical model ranges from poor confidence for
   cases with thick, highly charged coatings, to good confidence for cases
   with thin, low-charged coatings. Identifiability is similar for the
   numerical model, except that sensitivity is improved at very high charge
   and permeability, where polarization and relaxation effects are
   significant. For some poorly identifiable cases, parameter reduction can
   reduce collinearity to improve identifiability. Analysis of experimental
   data yielded results consistent with expectations from the simulated
   theoretical cases. Identifiability of layer charge density and
   permeability is also evaluated. Guidelines are suggested for evaluation
   of statistical confidence in polymer and polyelectrolyte layer
   parameters determined by application of the soft particle electrokinetic
   theory.}},

Abstract = {{Processes for making well ordered L1(0) FePt thin films with
   root-mean-square surface roughness close to 0.4 nm, perpendicular
   anisotropy greater than 5 kOe and perpendicular squareness near 1 using
   a deposition temperature of 390 degrees C have been developed. In this
   study, we focused on reducing the ordering temperature and smoothness of
   L1(0) FePt films, while achieving good perpendicular magnetic properties
   by using MgO/CrRu/TiN or MgO/CrRu/Pt seed layers on Si/SiO2 substrates.
   It was found that the chemical ordering of L1(0) FePt films is strongly
   affected by the insertion of a sputtered MgO seed layer, and the CrRu
   (002) texture on a (002) textured MgO seed layer is substantially
   improved at high DC power. In order to prevent Cr diffusion, TiN and Pt
   films were inserted between the CrRu and FePt films. It was found that
   the smoothness, L1(0) FePt ordering, and perpendicular magnetic
   properties were strongly improved by the TiN barrier layer compared to
   the Pt barrier layer. Increased TiN thickness improved the perpendicular
   magnetic anisotropy due to the reduced lattice misfit between the CrRu
   and L1(0) FePt films. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   rheology in relation to the respective homopolymers. All short-range
   correlations are dominated by the PBA side chains, whereas long-range
   correlations reflect the screening of the backbones by the side chains.
   Such correlations show up also in the segmental dynamics. The PBA
   segmental dynamics are slowed-down, whereas the backbone dynamics are
   plasticized by the side chains. Overall the bottle-brush architecture

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) readily transform in the environment,
   which modifies their properties and alters their transport, fate, and
   toxicity. It is essential to consider such transformations when
   assessing the potential environmental impact of Ag-NPs. This review
   discusses the major transformation processes of Ag-NPs in various
   aqueous environments, particularly transformations of the metallic Ag
   cores caused by reactions with (in)organic ligands, and the effects of
   such transformations on physical and chemical stability and toxicity.
   Thermodynamic arguments are used to predict what forms of oxidized
   silver will predominate in various environmental scenarios. Silver binds
   strongly to sulfur (both organic and inorganic) in natural systems
   (fresh and sea waters) as well as in wastewater treatment plants, where
   most Ag-NPs are expected to be concentrated and then released.
   Sulfidation of Ag-NPs results in a significant decrease in their
   toxicity due to the lower solubility of silver sulfide, potentially
   limiting their short-term environmental impact. This review also
   discusses some of the major unanswered questions about Ag-NPs, which,
   when answered, will improve predictions about their potential
   environmental impacts. Research needed to address these questions
   includes fundamental molecular-level studies of Ag-NPs and their
   transformation products, particularly Ag2S-NPs, in simplified model
   systems containing common (in)organic ligands, as well as under more
   realistic environmental conditions using microcosm/mesocosm-type
   experiments. Toxicology studies of Ag-NP transformation products,
   including different states of aggregation and sulfidation, are also
   required. In addition, there is the need to characterize the surface
   structures, compositions, and morphologies of Ag-NPs and Ag2S-NPs to the
   extent possible because they control properties such as solubility and
   reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{The production of the neurotoxic methylmercury in the environment is
   partly controlled by the bioavailability of inorganic divalent mercury
   (Hg(II)) to anaerobic bacteria that methylate Hg(II). In sediment
   porewater, Hg(II) associates with sulfides and natural organic matter to
   form chemical species that include organic-coated mercury sulfide
   nanoparticles as reaction intermediates of heterogeneous mineral
   precipitation. Here, we exposed two strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria
   to three forms of inorganic mercury: dissolved Hg and sulfide,
   nanoparticulate HgS, and microparticulate HgS. The bacteria cultures
   exposed to HgS nanoparticles methylated mercury at a rate slower than
   cultures exposed to dissolved forms of mercury. However, net
   methylmercury production in cultures exposed to nanoparticles was 6
   times greater than in cultures treated with microscale particles, even
   when normalized to specific surface area. Furthermore, the methylation
   potential of HgS nanoparticles decreased with storage time of the
   nanoparticles in their original stock solution. In bacteria cultures
   amended with nano-HgS from a 16 h-old nanoparticle stock, 6-10\% of
   total mercury was converted to methylmercury after one day. In contrast,
   2-4\% was methylated in cultures amended with nano-HgS that was aged for
   3 days or 1 week. The methylation of mercury derived from nanoparticles
   (in contrast to the larger particles) would not be predicted by
   equilibrium speciation of mercury in the aqueous phase (<0.2 mu m) and
   was possibly caused by the disordered structure of nanoparticles that
   facilitated release of chemically labile mercury species immediately
   adjacent to cell surfaces. Our results add new dimensions to the
   mechanistic understanding of mercury methylation potential by
   demonstrating that bioavailability is related to the geochemical
   intermediates of rate-limited mercury sulfide precipitation reactions.
   These findings could help explain observations that the ``aging{''} of
   mercury in sediments reduces its methylation potential and provide a
   basis for assessing and remediating methylmercury hotspots in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfidation of metallic nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs) released to the environment may be an important detoxification
   mechanism. Two types of AgNPs an engineered polydisperse and aggregated
   AgNP powder, and a laboratory-synthesized, relatively monodisperse AgNP
   aqueous dispersion were studied. The particles were sulfidized to
   varying degrees and characterized to determine the effect of initial
   AgNP polydispersity and aggregation state on AgNP sulfidation, and then
   exposed to Escherichia coli to determine if the degree of sulfidation of
   pristine AgNPs affects growth inhibition of bacteria. The extent of
   sulfidation was found to depend on the HS-/Ag ratio. However, for the
   same reaction times, the more monodisperse particles were fully
   transformed to Ag2S, and the polydisperse, aggregated particles were not
   fully sulfidized, thus preserving the toxic potential of Ag-0 in the
   aggregates. A higher Ag2S:Ag-0 ratio in the sulfidized nanoparticles
   resulted in less growth inhibition of E. coli over 6 h of exposure.
   These results suggest that the initial properties of AgNPs can affect
   sulfidation products, which in turn affect microbial growth inhibition,
   and that these properties should be considered in assessing the
   environmental impact of AgNPs.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of silver nanoparticles in aquatic environments and
   their subsequent impact on organisms depends on key transformation
   processes, which include aggregation, dissolution, and surface
   modifications by metal-complexing ligands. Here, we studied how
   cysteine, an amino acid representative of thiol ligands that bind
   monovalent silver, can alter the surface chemistry, aggregation, and
   dissolution of zero-valent silver nanoparticles. We compared
   nanoparticles synthesized with two coatings, citrate and
   polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), and prepared nanoparticle suspensions
   (approximately 8 mu M total Ag) containing an excess of cysteine (400 mu
   M). Within 48 h, up to 47\% of the silver had dissolved, as indicated by
   filtration of the samples with a 0.025-mu m filter. Initial dissolution
   rates were calculated from the increase of dissolved silver
   concentration when particles were exposed to cysteine and normalized to
   the available surface area of nanoparticles in solution. In general, the
   rates of dissolution were almost 3 times faster for citrate-coated
   nanoparticles relative to PVP-coated nanoparticles. Rates tended to be
   slower in solutions with higher ionic strength in which the
   nanoparticles were aggregating. Xray absorption spectroscopy analysis of
   the particles suggested that cysteine adsorbed to silver nanoparticles
   surfaces through the formation of Ag(+I)-sulfhydryl bonds. Overall, the
   results of this study highlight the importance of modifications by
   sulfhydryl-containing ligands that can drastically influence the
   long-term reactivity of silver nanoparticles in the aquatic environment
   and their bioavailability to exposed organisms. Our findings demonstrate
   the need to consider multiple interlinked transformation processes when
   assessing the bioavailability, environmental risks, and safety of
   nanoparticles, particularly in the presence of metal-binding ligands.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a formalized vulnerability representation schema
   that targets supporting vulnerability assessment in a facility during an
   emergency triggered by a failure in a building system by identifying
   which critical assets might be affected by the current emergency. The
   representation schema captures to which threats specific content are
   vulnerable. Specifically, it enables the representation of threats and
   how they can be traced spatially. Moreover, it provides a way to
   describe content by its type, its exchange and use values as a way to
   identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, and to represent different
   types of content collections. Such a representation schema is needed for
   supporting automated vulnerability assessment in building emergencies.
   The formalized representation schema was tested for coverage in
   synthetic tests using OmniClass for content and the Emergency Response
   Guidebook for threats. For content, 84\% of 245 content types in
   OmniClass were successfully represented using the schema. These 245
   content types represent the content commonly included in facility asset
   management databases. For threats, 79\% of threats were successfully
   represented using the schema. The schema was also tested for
   extensibility in user tests, in which 99\% of content types and 83\% of
   threats cited by users were successfully represented using the schema.

Abstract = {{The present work is the first to examine temporal variability of
   bacterial diversity in a free-chlorinated drinking water distribution
   system over multiple years. The authors examined seasonal and monthly
   bacterial diversity by using three different molecular methods. 16S rRNA
   gene clone library analysis identified the bacteria in Pittsburgh
   seasonal water samples, collected in fall 2006, and winter, spring, and
   summer 2007 and an event sample collected following a major pipe break,
   as primarily members of the alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria
   classes, which agrees with previous studies of smaller numbers of bulk
   water samples over shorter durations. However, in this study, seasonal
   shifts in relative populations were observed with decreased
   alphaproteobacteria and increased betaproteobacteria diversity in the
   winter sample compared to the other seasonal samples, which may be
   caused by changes in chlorine dosing. Further, in 11 monthly samples
   collected at the same location from September 2008 to August 2009,
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results indicated that
   alpha-and betaproteobacteria predominated over the year, except in May
   and October, when changes in chlorine dosing as a result of temperature
   shifts may have influenced bacterial diversity. Denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) cluster analyses suggested that the monthly
   samples cluster seasonally with greater than 85\% similarity between
   March and April, June and July, and December and January. These results
   demonstrate the consistent presence of alpha-, beta-, and
   gammaproteobacteria in drinking water distribution systems across
   seasons during routine operational conditions and suggest that changes
   in bacterial class distributions may be useful indicators of system
   disruptions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000539. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{The effect of long-distance interconnection on wind power variability}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{We use time- and frequency-domain techniques to quantify the extent to
   which long-distance interconnection of wind plants in the United States
   would reduce the variability of wind power output. Previous work has
   shown that interconnection of just a few wind plants across moderate
   distances could greatly reduce the ratio of fast- to slow-ramping
   generators in the balancing portfolio. We find that interconnection of
   aggregate regional wind plants would not reduce this ratio further but
   would reduce variability at all frequencies examined. Further,
   interconnection of just a few wind plants reduces the average hourly
   change in power output, but interconnection across regions provides
   little further reduction. Interconnection also reduces the magnitude of
   low-probability step changes and doubles firm power output (capacity
   available at least 92\% of the time) compared with a single region.
   First-order analysis indicates that balancing wind and providing firm
   power with local natural gas turbines would be more cost-effective than
   with transmission interconnection. For net load, increased wind capacity
   would require more balancing resources but in the same proportions by
   frequency as currently, justifying the practice of treating wind as
   negative load.}},

Title = {{Cost analysis of stratospheric albedo modification delivery systems}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{We perform engineering cost analyses of systems capable of delivering
   1-5 million metric tonnes (Mt) of albedo modification material to
   altitudes of 18-30 km. The goal is to compare a range of delivery
   systems evaluated on a consistent cost basis. Cost estimates are
   developed with statistical cost estimating relationships based on
   historical costs of aerospace development programs and operations
   concepts using labor rates appropriate to the operations. We evaluate
   existing aircraft cost of acquisition and operations, perform in-depth
   new aircraft and airship design studies and cost analyses, and survey
   rockets, guns, and suspended gas and slurry pipes, comparing their costs
   to those of aircraft and airships. Annual costs for delivery systems
   based on new aircraft designs are estimated to be \$1-3B to deliver 1 Mt
   to 20-30 km or \$2-8B to deliver 5 Mt to the same altitude range. Costs
   for hybrid airships may be competitive, but their large surface area
   complicates operations in high altitude wind shear, and development
   costs are more uncertain than those for airplanes. Pipes suspended by
   floating platforms provide low recurring costs to pump a liquid or gas
   to altitudes as high as similar to 20 km, but the research, development,
   testing and evaluation costs of these systems are high and carry a large
   uncertainty; the pipe system's high operating pressures and tensile
   strength requirements bring the feasibility of this system into
   question. The costs for rockets and guns are significantly higher than
   those for other systems. We conclude that (a) the basic technological
   capability to deliver material to the stratosphere at million tonne per
   year rates exists today, (b) based on prior literature, a few million
   tonnes per year would be sufficient to alter radiative forcing by an
   amount roughly equivalent to the growth of anticipated greenhouse gas
   forcing over the next half century, and that (c) several different
   methods could possibly deliver this quantity for less than \$8B per
   year. We do not address here the science of aerosols in the
   stratosphere, nor issues of risk, effectiveness or governance that will
   add to the costs of solar geoengineering.}},

Title = {{Implications of changing natural gas prices in the United States
   electricity sector for SO2, NOX and life cycle GHG emissions}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Projections of increased domestic natural gas supply and low prices have
   encouraged increased natural gas utilization in the United States
   electricity sector. Natural gas can offset coal, likely decreasing
   overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other air emissions such as
   SO2 and NOX. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies using limited
   system boundaries have attempted to quantify the benefit of offsetting
   coal use. However, these studies do not consider that relative regional
   fuel prices may contribute most to the choice of coal over natural gas.
   External incentives such as low natural gas prices compared to coal are
   required if natural gas is to displace coal. In this study, simplified
   economic dispatch models are used to determine how natural gas
   utilization will increase in the short-term in response to changes in
   natural gas prices in three US grid regions-ERCOT, MISO and PJM. The
   results indicate that the change in air emissions is lower than
   suggested by LCAs, since LCAs generally do not include the complexity of
   regional electricity grids. For instance, this study estimates that life
   cycle GHG emissions may, at best, decrease by 7-15\% due to low natural
   gas prices, compared to almost 50\% reductions estimated by previous
   LCAs.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Real-time scheduling algorithms like RMA or EDF and their corresponding
   schedulability test have proven to be powerful tools for developing
   predictable real-time systems. However, the traditional interrupt
   management model presents multiple inconsistencies that break the
   assumptions of many of the real-time scheduling tests, diminishing its
   utility. In this article, we analyze these inconsistencies and present a
   model that resolves them by integrating interrupts and tasks in a single
   scheduling model. We then use the RMA theory to calculate the cost of
   the model and analyze the circumstances under which it can provide the
   most value. This model was implemented in a kernel module. The
   portability of the design of our module is discussed in terms of its
   independence from both the hardware and the kernel. We also discuss the
   implementation issues of the model over conventional PC hardware, along
   with its cost and novel optimizations for reducing the overhead.
   Finally, we present our experimental evaluation to show evidence of its
   temporal determinism and overhead.}},

Pages = {{243-253}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns the problem of detecting leaks at carbon
   sequestration sites through the monitoring of CO2 levels using a
   wireless sensor network (WSN). By applying a basic linear dynamic model
   for an advection-diffusion process, a model-based detection strategy
   called the Iterative Partial Sequential Probability Ratio Test (IPSPRT)
   can be employed to detect and localize multiple leaks. A 3-D CO2
   transport model is employed to provide a proof of concept simulated
   evaluation of the IPSPRT against a windowed-average approach in terms of
   time-to-decision vs. probability of false alarm and probability of a
   missed alarm. Despite using only a basic linear dynamic model, the
   IPSPRT is shown to achieve exponentially increasing better
   time-to-decision than the windowed-average approach as the probability
   of false alarm and probability of a missed alarm are decreased. A test
   bed implementation is described and employed to evaluate the performance
   of the IPSPRT in the presence of common WSN errors. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A transformer-combined fully integrated outphasing class-D PA in 45 nm
   LP CMOS achieves 31.5 dBm peak output power at 2.4 GHz with 27\% peak
   PAE, and supports over 86 dB of output power range. The PA employs
   dynamic power control (DPC) whereby sections of the PA are turned on or
   off dynamically according to the instantaneous signal amplitude to
   reduce power dissipation, especially at back-off. Dynamic on-off
   switching introduces transients on the power supply that can limit
   performance. The paper proposes and demonstrates techniques to reduce
   the impact of such transients. A multi-section slab inductor based
   transformer combiner is used to allow individual switching of unit PAs.
   The PA delivers 24.8 dBm average power while meeting 64-QAM WLAN
   requirements. PAE is 16\% when using DPC, which represents a 33\%
   efficiency enhancement compared to theDPC-disabled mode. At lower
   average power of 20.5 dBm, DPC enables a 140\% enhancement in average
   efficiency, hence increasing battery life.}},

Abstract = {{The observation of a giant magnetocaloric effect in Gd5Ge1.9Si2Fe0.1 has
   stimulated the magnetocaloric research in the last two decades. However,
   the high price of Gd and its proclivity to corrosion of these compounds
   have prevented their commercial use. To reduce raw materials cost,
   transition metal-based alloys are investigated to replace rare
   earth-based materials. Environmental considerations, substitution for
   scarce and strategic elements, and cost considerations all speak to
   potential contributions of these new materials to sustainability.
   Fe-based soft amorphous alloys are believed to be promising magnetic
   refrigerants. Efforts in improving the refrigeration capacity (RC) of
   refrigerants mainly rely on broadening the magnetic entropy change. One
   promising technique is to couple two phases of magnetic materials with
   desirable properties. Second is the investigation of nanoparticle
   synthesis routes, with ball milling being the most widely used one. The
   motivation for the nanoparticles synthesis is rooted in their inherent
   tendency to have distributed exchange coupling, which will broaden the
   magnetic entropy curve. As proven with the cost analysis, the focus is
   believed to shift from improving the RC of refrigerants toward finding
   the most economically advantageous magnetic refrigerant with the highest
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Plaque composition is a potentially important diagnostic feature for
   carotid artery stenting (CAS). The purpose of this investigation is to
   evaluate the reproducibility of manual border correction in
   intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology (VH IVUS) images. Three
   images each were obtained from 51 CAS datasets on which automatic border
   detection was corrected manually by two trained observers. Plaque was
   classified using the definitions from the CAPITAL (Carotid Artery Plaque
   Virtual Histology Evaluation) study, listed in order from least to most
   pathological: no plaque, pathological intimal thickening, fibroatheroma,
   fibrocalcific, calcified fibroatheroma, thin-cap fibroatheroma, and
   calcified thin-cap fibroatheroma. Inter-observer variability was
   quantified using both weighted and unweighted Kappa statistics.
   Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the cross-sectional areas of
   the vessel and lumen. Agreement using necrotic core percentage as the
   criterion was evaluated using the unweighted Kappa statistic. Agreement
   between classifications of plaque type was evaluated using the weighted
   Kappa statistic. There was substantial agreement between the observers
   based on necrotic core percentage (kappa = 0.63), while the agreement
   was moderate (kappa(quadratic) = 0.60) based on plaque classification.
   Due to the time-consuming nature of manual border detection, an improved
   automatic border detection algorithm is necessary for using VH IVUS as a
   diagnostic tool for assessing the suitability of patients with carotid
   artery occlusive disease for CAS. (C) 2011 IPEM. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The viscosity of the molten ash (slag) resulting from the mineral
   constituents in carbon feedstock used in slagging gasifiers is critical
   for controlling the gasification process. The viscosity of two synthetic
   slags with compositions resembling the mineral impurities in average
   eastern and western coal feedstock was examined at temperatures from
   1300-1500 degrees C using a rotating bob viscometer. A few combinations
   of atmospheres and experimental materials were investigated with respect
   to one another to determine slag viscosity. A CO/CO2 atmosphere (CO/CO2
   = 1.8, corresponding to a Po-2 = 10(-8) atm) is required to sustain
   ferrous ions in FeO-containing slags, an environment that is oxidizing
   to most metals. Iron oxide in the slag prevents usage of Fe parts. In
   unpurified Ar, the Fe metal surface oxidizes. Using purified argon
   prevents iron measurement components from oxidation; however, the
   metallic surfaces act as nucleation sites for the reduction of the Fe
   oxide in the slag into metallic Fe. Dissolution of ceramic materials
   into the slag, including Al2O3 and ZrO2, occurs in both atmospheres.
   Therefore, evaluating slag properties in the laboratory is challenging.
   The measured viscosities of two synthetic slags in this study diverged
   depending upon material selection. This difference is likely
   attributable to container/spindle-slag interactions. Viscosity
   measurements of the eastern coal slag using all ceramic parts agreed
   best with FactSage prediction above 1350 degrees C, with an average
   activation energy of 271.2 kJ. For western coal slag, the dissolution of
   container/spindle materials was substantial during the measurement, with
   precipitation of crystalline phase noted. The experimental viscosity
   data of the western coal slag agreed best with Kalmanovitch prediction
   above 1350 degrees C. The activation energy changed dramatically for
   both data sets of western coal slag, likely indicating the
   Newtonian-to-non-Newtonian transition.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a simple, low-cost, but effective approach to deposit
   graphene on silicon wafers with dielectrophoresis. With a comb-shaped
   electrode design, graphene sheets can be actively captured between
   electrodes. Dielectrophoresis proves effective in depositing a
   large-scale array of graphene on desired locations. The deposition of
   semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) with the same
   approach is also studied to compare the two forms of carbon-based
   nanomaterials. The graphene deposition has a lower success rate
   (approximately 62\%) than s-SWNTs (100\%) to cover the comb fingers due
   to the 2-D sheet structure and larger dimensions of the material. The
   assembled graphene sheets can successfully bridge over the electrode gap
   to create functional, ready-to-use electronic devices. The
   dielectrophoretically deposited graphene is used as the semiconducting
   material in a liquid-gated field-effect transistor, and it demonstrates
   p-type characteristics with holes as the majority charge carriers. When
   used in two-terminal chemiresistors, the deposited graphene demonstrates
   high sensitivity toward pH values in liquid. The resistance of graphene
   is inversely proportional to the pH value of the solution in the range
   of 5-9 with the pH sensitivity of 17.5 Omega/decade. The high-precision,
   high-yield deposition provides a practical approach for the fabrication
   of future graphene electronic devices and sensors.}},

Abstract = {{LaMnO3 and (La,Sr)MnO3 were prepared as mesoporous powders using sol-gel
   methods that incorporated evaporation-induced self-assembly of
   surfactants as structure-directing agents. The precursor and surfactant
   concentrations, surfactant character (mainly molecular weight), aging
   humidity, and annealing temperature were all found to influence the
   specific surface area of the powders, which were maximized at 50 and 46
   m2/g for LaMnO3 and (La,Sr)MnO3, respectively. Increased metal nitrate
   contents in the initial sol composition and increased relative humidity
   during aging led to products having increased specific surface areas
   owing to increased mesoporosity. The lower molecular weight surfactant
   CTAB was found to generate higher specific surface area powders than
   those generated using the larger molecular weight nonionic surfactants
   P-123 and F-127. On the other hand, the relative thermal stability of
   the mesoporous powders, annealed at 750 degrees C for 100 h, increased
   with the molecular weight of surfactant. Mesoporous powders having
   promising thermal stability and surface areas in the 2025 m2/g range
   were easily obtainable using P-123 and F-127, indicating that high
   surface area electrocatalysts with mesoporous microstructures can be

Abstract = {{Biobased composites made from biopolymers and plant-based fibers are

   studied here have been demonstrated to rapidly biodegrade in anaerobic
   conditions to methane thereby reducing construction-related landfill
   waste and producing a useful end product, namely fuel for energy or a
   feedstock to grow more biopolymer. To be a useful in construction,
   susceptibility to moisture and eventual moisture resistance is
   necessary. Diffusion properties and mechanical properties are
   characterized in various moisture and temperature conditions for
   hemp/cellulose acetate and hemp/poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate) composites.
   The composites were observed to follow Fick's 2nd law of diffusion. The
   tensile moduli of elasticity were found to decrease with full moisture
   saturation while the ductility increased and the ultimate strength did
   not change significantly. Measured diffusion coefficients are compared
   to petroleum-based and other biobased composites. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{As externally powered microsystems become more common, designers need
   better tools to understand power delivery systems such as non-resonant
   capacitive coupling. In this paper we present the first general method
   which allows a designer to easily model power delivery through
   capacitive coupling. The method uses a power iteration technique which
   allows one to analyze systems when the time to charge the coupling
   capacitor is longer than a charge cycle, enabling us to analyze a
   greater range of systems than previously possible. In fact, we are able
   to model the entire system with an equivalent resistance. We show that
   our model accurately reproduces both static and dynamic characteristics
   of the exact solution and that this model is general, in that it is
   valid for capacitor charge times that are longer as well as shorter than
   a charge cycle. This model also reveals several regions of operation
   where different parameters (e. g., capacitance, frequency and series
   resistance) dominate, allowing the designer to quickly and intuitively
   understand the design space for capacitive power transfer.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{If hurricane modification were to become a feasible strategy for
   potentially reducing hurricane damages, it would likely generate public
   discourse about whether to support its implementation. To facilitate an
   informed and constructive discourse, policymakers need to understand how
   people perceive hurricane modification. Here, we examine Florida
   residents perceptions of hurricane modification techniques that aim to
   alter path and wind speed. Following the mental models approach, we
   conducted a survey study about public perceptions of hurricane
   modification that was guided by formative interviews on the topic. We
   report a set of four primary findings. First, hurricane modification was
   perceived as a relatively ineffective strategy for damage reduction,
   compared to other strategies for damage reduction. Second, hurricane
   modification was expected to lead to changes in projected hurricane
   path, but not necessarily to the successful reduction of projected
   hurricane strength. Third, more anger was evoked when a hurricane was
   described as having changed from the initially forecasted path or
   strength after an attempted modification. Fourth, unlike what we
   expected, participants who more strongly agreed with statements that
   recognized the uncertainty inherent in forecasts reported more rather
   than less anger at scientists across hurricane modification scenarios.
   If the efficacy of intensity-reduction techniques can be increased,
   people may be willing to support hurricane modification. However, such
   an effort would need to be combined with open and honest communications
   to members of the general public.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explored whether topical application of antibodies
   targeting tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) or interleukin-6 (IL-6)
   conjugated to hyaluronic acid (HA) could reduce the extension of
   necrosis by modulating inflammation locally in a partial-thickness rat
   burn model. Partial-thickness to deep partial-thickness burn injuries
   present significant challenges in healing, as these burns often progress
   following the initial thermal insult, resulting in necrotic expansion
   and increased likelihood of secondary complications. Necrotic expansion
   is driven by a microenvironment with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
   mediators, and local neutralization of these using antibody conjugates
   could reduce burn progression. Trichrome-stained tissue sections
   indicated the least necrotic tissue in (anti-TNF-a)-HA-treated sites,
   while (anti-IL-6)-HA-treated sites displayed similar outcomes to saline
   controls. This was confirmed by vimentin immunostaining, which
   demonstrated that HA treatment alone reduced burn progression by nearly
   30\%, but (anti-TNF-a)-HA reduced it by approximately 70\%. At all time
   points, (anti-TNF-a)-HA-treated sites showed reduced tissue levels of
   IL-1 beta compared to controls, suggesting inhibition of a downstream
   mediator of inflammation. Decreased macrophage infiltration in
   (anti-TNF-a)-HA-treated sites compared to controls was elucidated by
   immunohistochemical staining of macrophages, suggesting a reduction in
   overall inflammation in all time points. These results suggest that
   local targeting of TNF-a may be an effective strategy for preventing
   progression of partial-thickness burns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for converting any unstructured
   quadrilateral or hexahedral mesh to a generalized T-spline surface or
   solid T-spline, based on the rational T-spline basis functions. Our
   conversion algorithm consists of two stages: the topology stage and the
   geometry stage. In the topology stage, the input quadrilateral or
   hexahedral mesh is taken as the initial T-mesh. To construct a gap-free
   T-spline, templates are designed for each type of node and applied to
   elements in the input mesh. In the geometry stage, an efficient surface
   fitting technique is developed to improve the surface accuracy with
   sharp feature preservation. The constructed T-spline surface and solid
   T-spline interpolate every boundary node in the input mesh, with C
   (2)-continuity everywhere except the local region around irregular
   nodes. Finally, a B,zier extraction technique is developed and linear
   independence of the constructed T-splines is studied to facilitate
   T-spline based isogeometric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new point set surfacing method based on a data-driven
   mapping between the parametric and geometric spaces. Our approach takes
   as input an unstructured and possibly noisy point set representing a
   two-manifold in R-3. To facilitate parameterization, the set is first
   embedded in R-2 using neighborhood-preserving locally linear embedding.
   A learning algorithm is then trained to learn a mapping between the
   embedded two-dimensional (2D) coordinates and the corresponding
   three-dimensional (3D) space coordinates. The trained learner is then
   used to generate a tessellation spanning the parametric space, thereby
   producing a surface in the geometric space. This approach enables the
   surfacing of noisy and non-uniformly distributed point sets. We discuss
   the advantages of the proposed method in relation to existing methods,
   and show its utility on a number of test models, as well as its
   applications to modeling in virtual reality environments. (C) 2012

   kiln cooler had high nitrogen contents (50-250 ppm, depending on
   particle size), contributing to elevated nitrogen levels in liquid steel
   produced in the electric arc furnaces. The proposed mechanism of
   nitriding of SL/RN DRI involves gaseous nitrogen (present within the
   rotary cooler) diffusing into the solid bed and is supported by a simple
   diffusion model. A strong correlation was found between the melt-in
   carbon content of the liquid steel and the final tap nitrogen content,
   with melt-in carbon of 0.3\%C or higher resulting in nitrogen levels
   below 50 ppm at tap, even when charging DRI material that is high in
   nitrogen.}},

Title = {{Robust Design of Two-Dimensional Optical Reference Signals Against
   Diffraction Effects}},

Pages = {{2168-2175}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two novel approaches to the design of
   two-dimensional (2-D) optical zero reference signals (ZRSs) that are
   robust against diffraction effects based on the parametric minimum
   cross-entropy (PMCE) method. Grating alignment systems require a 2-D
   optical ZRS to perform absolute measurements. A common method of
   acquiring 2-D optical ZRSs involves illuminating two identical
   superimposed 2-D zero reference codes (ZRCs). The output signal is the
   2-D optical ZRS and can be represented as the autocorrelation of the 2-D
   ZRC transmittance. In ultrahigh-resolution systems, diffraction distorts
   the shadow of the first 2-D ZRC, degrading the autocorrelation and
   greatly reducing the amplitude of the 2-D optical ZRS. To improve the
   robustness of 2-D optical ZRSs against diffraction effects, this paper
   formulates two combinatorial optimization problems for the design of 2-D
   ZRCs with minimum diffraction effects: one of which is a maximization
   problem, and the other a minimization problem. Aiming at solving the two
   problems, this study proposes two schemes based on the PMCE method to
   search for an optimal 2-D ZRC. Simulation results reveal that there are
   3.36-8.34\% increases in the slope of the central peak of a 2-D optical
   ZRS and that there are 16.12-20.90\% increases in the sum of the slope
   of the central peak and the effective signal amplitude of a 2-D optical
   ZRS, as compared with those obtained by the recently proposed
   cross-entropy method. The proposed PMCE-based schemes prove to search
   for 2-D ZRCs more effectively than existing solutions, while requiring
   less computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses photochemical aging of secondary organic aerosol
   (SOA) produced from alpha-pinene ozonolysis. The SOA is aged via
   hydroxyl radical (OH) reactions with first-generation vapors and UV
   photolysis. OH radicals are created through tetramethylethylene
   ozonolysis, HOOH photolysis, or HONO photolysis, sources that vary in OH
   concentration and the presence or absence of UV illumination. Aging
   strongly influences observed SOA mass concentrations, but the behavior
   is complex. In the dark or with high concentrations of OH, vapors are
   functionalized, lowering their volatility, resulting in an increase in
   OA by a factor of 2-3. However, with lower concentrations of OH under UV
   illumination SOA mass concentrations decrease over time. We attribute
   this decrease to evaporation driven by photolysis of the highly
   functionalized second-generation products. The photolysis rates are
   rapid, a few percent of the NO2 photolysis frequency, and can thus be
   highly competitive with other aging mechanisms in the atmosphere.}},

Title = {{Human movement data for malaria control and elimination strategic
   planning}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Recent increases in funding for malaria control have led to the
   reduction in transmission in many malaria endemic countries, prompting
   the national control programmes of 36 malaria endemic countries to set
   elimination targets. Accounting for human population movement (HPM) in
   planning for control, elimination and post-elimination surveillance is
   important, as evidenced by previous elimination attempts that were
   undermined by the reintroduction of malaria through HPM. Strategic
   control and elimination planning, therefore, requires quantitative
   information on HPM patterns and the translation of these into parasite
   dispersion. HPM patterns and the risk of malaria vary substantially
   across spatial and temporal scales, demographic and socioeconomic
   sub-groups, and motivation for travel, so multiple data sets are likely
   required for quantification of movement. While existing studies based on
   mobile phone call record data combined with malaria transmission maps
   have begun to address within-country HPM patterns, other aspects remain
   poorly quantified despite their importance in accurately gauging malaria
   movement patterns and building control and detection strategies, such as
   cross-border HPM, demographic and socioeconomic stratification of HPM
   patterns, forms of transport, personal malaria protection and other
   factors that modify malaria risk. A wealth of data exist to aid filling
   these gaps, which, when combined with spatial data on transport
   infrastructure, traffic and malaria transmission, can answer relevant
   questions to guide strategic planning. This review aims to (i) discuss
   relevant types of HPM across spatial and temporal scales, (ii) document
   where datasets exist to quantify HPM, (iii) highlight where data gaps
   remain and (iv) briefly put forward methods for integrating these
   datasets in a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework for
   analysing and modelling human population and Plasmodium falciparum
   malaria infection movements.}},

Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{The optimal design of complex distillation system for separation of
   multicomponent zeotropic mixtures is studied. Super column with the
   ability to separate any specified products from the given feed is
   introduced for defining integration upper limit of design alternatives.
   The improved state-space (SS) superstructure incorporating all basic
   mass and heat transfer elements are adopted to capture all
   configurations in the framework of super column. Specifically, by adding
   stages-cascade process operator in the original representation, a series
   of optimal flowsheets with multiple thermal links, which have never been
   included within previous superstructure are easily generated. The
   mathematical modeling of the proposed superstructure is performed with
   mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP). It advocates the use of
   rigorous physical model for each mass/heat transfer stage to ensure the
   practical reliability and optimality of the attained designs. Then the
   derived optimization model is solved by a modified solution procedure,
   in which the key item is an iterative initialization scheme. Three
   multicomponent zeotropic separation examples are employed to illustrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These optimum designs yield
   significant savings in total annual cost (TAC) relative to Petlyuk
   columns and some guidelines for distillation flowsheet retrofit based on
   thermodynamic analysis are proposed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Motivation: Knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is
   crucial for understanding its functions. The subcellular pattern of a
   protein is typically represented as the set of cellular components in
   which it is located, and an important task is to determine this set from
   microscope images. In this article, we address this classification
   problem using confocal immunofluorescence images from the Human Protein
   Atlas (HPA) project. The HPA contains images of cells stained for many
   proteins; each is also stained for three reference components, but there
   are many other components that are invisible. Given one such cell, the
   task is to classify the pattern type of the stained protein. We first
   randomly select local image regions within the cells, and then extract
   various carefully designed features from these regions. This
   region-based approach enables us to explicitly study the relationship
   between proteins and different cell components, as well as the
   interactions between these components. To achieve these two goals, we
   propose two discriminative models that extend logistic regression with
   structured latent variables. The first model allows the same protein
   pattern class to be expressed differently according to the underlying
   components in different regions. The second model further captures the
   spatial dependencies between the components within the same cell so that
   we can better infer these components. To learn these models, we propose
   a fast approximate algorithm for inference, and then use gradient-based
   methods to maximize the data likelihood.
   Results: In the experiments, we show that the proposed models help
   improve the classification accuracies on synthetic data and real
   cellular images. The best overall accuracy we report in this article for
   classifying 942 proteins into 13 classes of patterns is about 84.6\%,
   which to our knowledge is the best so far. In addition, the dependencies
   learned are consistent with prior knowledge of cell organization.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we address the optimal production of second-generation
   biodiesel using waste cooking oil and algae oil. We consider five
   different technologies for the transesterification of the oil
   (homogeneous acid- or alkali-catalyzed, heterogeneous basic-catalyzed,
   enzymatic, and supercritical uncatalyzed). We formulate the problem as
   an MINLP problem where the models for each of the reactors are based on
   surface response methodology to capture the effects of the variables on
   the yield. The aim is to perform simultaneous optimization and heat
   integration for the production of biodiesel from each of the different
   oil sources in terms of the technology to use and the operating
   conditions to apply. Furthermore, a process network is designed to
   minimize the freshwater consumption. The optimal conditions in the
   reactors differ from those traditionally used because the separation
   tasks are taken into account in this work. For algae oil, the optimal
   process employs alkali as the catalyst and has a production cost of
   0.42\$/gal, an energy consumption of 1.94 MJ/gal, and a freshwater
   consumption of 0.60 gal(water)/gal(ethanol). For cooking oil, the
   optimal process is the one with the heterogeneous catalyst and has a
   production cost and energy and water consumption of \$0.66/gal, 1.94
   MJ/gal, and 0.33 gal(water)/gal(ethanol), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Initiators for continuous activator regeneration atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ICAR ATRP) with ppm amount of Cu catalyst was
   successfully developed in water. For the first time, Cu catalyst
   concentrations of 100 ppm and lower were used in aqueous media to
   prepare well-defined macromolecules. Polymers of oligo(ethylene oxide)
   methyl ether acrylate were synthesized with low dispersity (M-w/M-n =
   1.15-1.28) using 20-100 ppm of an active
   CuBr/tris(pyridin-2-ylrnethyl)amine-based catalyst in the presence of
   excess bromide anions. This technique was used to synthesize a
   thermoresponsive block copolymer of poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl
   ether methacrylate)-b-poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate).
   The methacrylic block had a lower critical solution temperature (LCST =
   77 +/- 2 degrees C) below that of the acrylic block. The hydrodynamic
   diameter of ca. 10 nm at temperatures below the LCST is consistent with
   free polymer chains in solution, and the diameter of ca. 30 nm above the
   LCST is consistent with a micellar structure. The aqueous ICAR ATRP
   technique was also used to successfully synthesize a well-defined
   bioconjugate by growing poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) acrylate) from a
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein functionalized with ca. 30 ATRP
   initiating sites.}},

Title = {{Morphology-Induced Collective Behaviors: Dynamic Pattern Formation in
   Water-Floating Elements}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Complex systems involving many interacting elements often organize into
   patterns. Two types of pattern formation can be distinguished, static
   and dynamic. Static pattern formation means that the resulting structure
   constitutes a thermodynamic equilibrium whose pattern formation can be
   understood in terms of the minimization of free energy, while dynamic
   pattern formation indicates that the system is permanently dissipating
   energy and not in equilibrium. In this paper, we report experimental
   results showing that the morphology of elements plays a significant role
   in dynamic pattern formation. We prepared three different shapes of
   elements (circles, squares, and triangles) floating in a water-filled
   container, in which each of the shapes has two types: active elements
   that were capable of self-agitation with vibration motors, and passive
   elements that were mere floating tiles. The system was purely
   decentralized: that is, elements interacted locally, and subsequently
   elicited global patterns in a process called self-organized segregation.
   We showed that, according to the morphology of the selected elements, a
   different type of segregation occurs. Also, we quantitatively
   characterized both the local interaction regime and the resulting global
   behavior for each type of segregation by means of information theoretic
   quantities, and showed the difference for each case in detail, while
   offering speculation on the mechanism causing this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{A problem-specific model is presented for the short-term scheduling
   problem in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry. To increase
   the computational efficiency, the limited intermediate inventory is
   modeled indirectly by relating mixing and packing intervals. In
   addition, the model size is reduced by exploiting the process
   characteristics by dedicating time intervals to product types, The
   efficiency and flexibility of the formulation is demonstrated using ten
   examples based on an ice cream scheduling case study. The examples
   contain 62-73 batches of 8 products that must be produced within a 120-h
   horizon. All cases can be solved to optimality within 170 s. The
   addition of a periodic cleaning requirement on the mixing lines
   significantly increases the complexity of the problem. An algorithm is
   proposed that solves to optimality within half an hour 9 out of 10 cases
   with periodic cleaning. For the 10th case the makespan obtained was
   0.6\% higher than the theoretical minimum makespan.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon electrodes are proposed in reactive sediment caps for in situ
   treatment of contaminants. The electrodes produce reducing conditions
   and H-2 at the cathode and oxidizing conditions and O-2 at the anode.
   Emplaced perpendicular to seepage flow, the electrodes provide the
   opportunity for sequential reduction and oxidation of contaminants. The
   objectives of this study are to demonstrate degradation of nitrobenzene
   (NB) as a probe compound for sequential electrochemical reduction and
   oxidation, and to determine the effect of applied voltage, initial
   concentration, and natural organic matter on the degradation rate. In
   H-cell reactors with graphite electrodes and buffer solution, NB was
   reduced stoichiometrically to aniline (AN) at the cathode with
   nitrosobenzene (NSB) as the intermediate. AN was then removed at the
   anode, faster than the reduction step. No common AN oxidation
   intermediate was detected in the system. Both the first order reduction
   rate constants of NB (k(NB)) and NSB (k(NSB)) increased with applied
   voltage between 2 V and 3.5 V (when the initial NB concentration was 100
   mu M, k(NB) = 0.3 h(-1) and k(NSB) = 0.04 h(-1) at 2 V; k(NB) = 1.6
   h(-1) and k(NSB) = 0.64 h(-1) at 3.5 V) but stopped increasing beyond
   the threshold of 3.5 V. When initial NB concentration decreased from 100
   to 5 mu M, k(NB) and k(NSB) became 9 and 5 times faster, respectively,
   suggesting that competition for active sites on the electrode surface is
   an important factor in NB degradation. Presence of natural organic
   matter (in forms of either humic acid or Anacostia River sediment
   porewater) decreased k(NB) while slightly increased k(NSB), but only to
   a limited extent (similar to factor of 3) for dissolved organic carbon
   content up to 100 mg/L. These findings suggest that electrode-based
   reactive sediment capping via sequential reduction/oxidation is a
   potentially robust and tunable technology for in situ contaminants
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{High-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy is a non-destructive materials
   characterization technique that is capable of tracking the evolution of
   three-dimensional microstructures as they respond to external stimuli.
   We present measurements of the annealing response of high-purity
   aluminum using the near-field variant of this technique. The data are
   analyzed with the forward modeling method which produces orientation
   maps that exhibit complex intragranular structures. Analysis and
   verification of results use both reconstructed sample space maps and
   detector space intensity patterns. Sensitivity to the ordering of the
   microstructure through both recovery and recrystallization is
   demonstrated. Sharpening of diffraction peaks and a corresponding
   reduction in intragranular orientation variations signal recovery
   processes. The emergence of a new bulk grain (recrystallization) is
   observed in a disordered region of the microstructure; the new grain has
   an orientation with no obvious relation to those of grains surrounding
   the disordered region. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Tuning bubbly structures in microchannels}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Foams have many useful applications that arise from the structure and
   size distribution of the bubbles within them. Microfluidics allows for
   the rapid formation of uniform bubbles, where bubble size and volume
   fraction are functions of the input gas pressure, liquid flow rate, and
   device geometry. After formation, the microchannel confines the bubbles
   and determines the resulting foam structure. Bubbly structures can vary
   from a single row ({''}dripping{''}), to multiple rows
   ({''}alternating{''}), to densely packed bubbles ({''}bamboo{''} and dry
   foams). We show that each configuration arises in a distinct region of
   the operating space defined by bubble volume and volume fraction. We
   describe the boundaries between these regions using geometric arguments
   and show that the boundaries are functions of the channel aspect ratio.
   We compare these geometric arguments with foam structures observed in
   experiments using flow-focusing, T-junction, and co-flow designs to
   generate stable nitrogen bubbles in aqueous surfactant solution and
   stable droplets in oil containing dissolved surfactant. The outcome of
   this work is a set of design parameters that can be used to achieve
   desired foam structures as a function of device geometry and
   experimental control parameters. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The cross-plane thermal conductivity of SiC amorphous films was measured
   employing the transient thermoreflectance technique. The SiC films were
   deposited on silicon substrates by RF magnetron sputtering at room
   temperature. The thickness of the films was varied in the range from 100
   nm to 2500 nm to analyze the size effect. The results found that the
   thermal conductivity of the SiC thin films is significantly smaller than
   that of the SiC material in bulk form. The small thermal conductivity
   stems from the structural disorder of the films, which was confirmed by
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.
   In addition, the contribution of the thermal boundary resistance to the
   thermal conductivity of the films is discussed.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{2840-2846}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Chemical modification strategies to improve the mechanical properties of
   lignin-based polyurethanes are presented. We hypothesized that treatment
   of lignin with Lewis acids would increase the concentration of hydroxyl
   groups available to react with diisocyanate monomers. Under the
   conditions used, hydrogen bromide-catalyzed modification resulted in a
   2896 increase in hydroxyl group content. Associated increases in
   hydrophilicity of solvent-cast thin films were also recorded as
   evidenced by decreases in water contact angle. Polyurethanes were then
   prepared by first preparing a prepolymer based on mixtures of
   toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and unmodified or modified lignin, then
   polymerization was completed through addition of polyethylene glycol
   (PEG), resulting in mass ratios of TDI:lignin:PEG of 43:17:40 in the
   compositions investigated here. The mixture of TDI and unmodified lignin
   resulted in a lignin powder at the bottom of the liquid, suggesting it
   did not react directly with TDI. However, a homogeneous solution
   resulted when TDI and the hydrogen bromide-treated lignin were mixed,
   suggesting demethylation indeed increased reactivity and resulted in
   better integration of lignin into the urethane network. Significant
   improvements in mechanical properties of modified lignin polyurethanes
   were observed, with a 6.5-fold increase in modulus, which were
   attributed to better integration of the modified lignin into the
   covalent polymer network due to the higher concentration of hydroxyl
   groups. This research indicates that chemical modification strategies
   can lead to significant improvements in the properties of lignin-based
   polymeric materials using a higher fraction of an inexpensive lignin
   monomer from renewable resources and a lower fraction an expensive,
   petroleum-derived isocyanate monomer to achieve the required material
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Improved preservation techniques have the potential to improve
   transplant outcomes by better maintaining donor organ quality and by
   making more organs available for allotransplantation. Persufflation,
   (PSF, gaseous oxygen perfusion) is potentially one such technique that
   has been studied for over a century in a variety of tissues, but has yet
   to gain wide acceptance for a number of reasons. A principal barrier is
   the perception that ex vivo PSF will cause in vivo embolization
   post-transplant. This review summarizes the extensive published work on
   heart, liver, kidney, small intestine and pancreas PSF, discusses the
   differences between anterograde and retrograde PSF, and between PSF and
   other conventional methods of organ preservation (static cold storage,
   hypothermic machine perfusion). Prospective implications of PSF within
   the broader field of organ transplantation, and in the specific
   application with pancreatic islet isolation and transplant are also
   discussed. Finally, key issues that need to be addressed before PSF
   becomes a more widely utilized preservation strategy are summarized and
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effect of pulsatility of venous flow
   waveform in the inferior and superior caval vessels on the performance
   of functional and ``failing{''} Fontan patients based on two primary
   performance measures the conduit power loss and the distribution of
   inferior caval flow (hepatic factors) to the lungs. Methods: Doppler
   angiography flows were acquired from two typical extra-cardiac conduit
   ``failing{''} Fontan patients, aged 13 and 25 years, with ventricle
   dysfunction. Using computational fluid dynamics, haemodynamic
   efficiencies of ``failing{''}, functional, and in vitro-generated
   mechanically assisted venous flow waveforms were evaluated inside an
   idealised total cavopulmonary connection with a caval offset. To
   investigate the effect of venous pulsatility alone, cardiac output was
   normalised to 3 litres per minute in all cases. To quantify the
   pulsatile behaviour of venous flows, two new performance indices were
   suggested. Results: Variations in the pulsatile content of venous
   waveforms altered the conduit efficiency notably. High-frequency and
   low-amplitude oscillations lowered the pulsatile component of the power
   losses in ``failing{''} Fontan flow waveforms. Owing to the offset
   geometry, hepatic flow distribution depended strongly on the ratio of
   time-dependent caval flows and the pulsatility content rather than
   mixing at the junction. ``Failing{''} Fontan flow waveforms exhibited
   less balanced hepatic flow distribution to lungs. Conclusions: The
   haemodynamic efficiency of single-ventricle circulation depends strongly
   on the pulsatility of venous flow waveforms. The proposed performance
   indices can be calculated easily in the clinical setting in efforts to
   better quantify the energy efficiency of Fontan venous waveforms in
   pulsatile settings.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{The scaling of linear optimization problems, while poorly understood, is
   definitely not devoid of techniques. Scaling is the most common
   preconditioning technique utilized in linear optimization solvers, and
   is designed to improve the conditioning of the constraint matrix and
   decrease the computational effort for solution. Most importantly,
   scaling provides a relative point of reference for absolute tolerances.
   For instance, absolute tolerances are used in the simplex algorithm to
   determine when a reduced cost is considered to be nonnegative. Existing
   techniques for obtaining scaling factors for linear systems are
   investigated herein. With a focus on the impact of these techniques on
   the performance of the simplex method, we analyze the results obtained
   from over half a billion simplex computations with CPLEX, MINOS and
   GLPK, including the computation of the condition number at every
   iteration. Some of the scaling techniques studied are computationally
   more expensive than others. For the Netlib and Kennington problems
   considered herein, it is found that on average no scaling technique
   outperforms the simplest technique (equilibration) despite the added
   complexity and computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell therapy for tissue repair is a rapidly evolving field and the
   factors that dictate the physiological responsiveness of stem cells
   remain under intense investigation. In this study we hypothesized that
   the mechanical loading history of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs)
   would significantly impact MDSC survival, host tissue angiogenesis, and
   myocardial function after MDSC transplantation into acutely infarcted
   myocardium. Mice with acute myocardial infarction by permanent left
   coronary artery ligation were injected with either nonstimulated (NS) or
   mechanically stimulated (MS) MDSCs. Mechanical stimulation consisted of
   stretching the cells with equibiaxial stretch with a magnitude of 10\%
   and frequency of 0.5 Hz. MS cell-transplanted hearts showed improved
   cardiac contractility, increased numbers of host CD31 + cells, and
   decreased fibrosis, in the peri-infarct region, compared to the hearts
   treated with NS MDSCs. MS MDSCs displayed higher vascular endothelial
   growth factor expression than NS cells in vitro. These findings
   highlight an important role for cyclic mechanical loading
   preconditioning of donor MDSCs in optimizing MDSC transplantation for

Abstract = {{Intrinsic tendon healing in response to injury is a reparative process
   that often results in formation of scar tissue with functional and
   mechanical properties inferior to those of the native tendon.
   Development of therapies that can promote regenerative, rather than
   reparative, healing hold the promise of improving patient recovery from
   tendon and ligament injuries by producing tissue that is morphologically
   and functionally equivalent to the native tissue. One therapeutic
   approach that has been a frequent topic of investigation in the
   preclinical literature is the use of recombinant human platelet-derived
   growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) to augment tendon and ligament repair. The
   chemotactic, mitogenic, and pro-angiogenic properties of rhPDGF-BB have
   been shown to result in recruitment and proliferation of tenogenic cells
   and a commensurate boost in extracellular matrix deposition and
   organization, improving the morphological and biomechanical properties
   of healing tendons and ligaments. The outcomes of the preclinical
   studies reviewed here strongly suggest that rhPDGF-BB will provide a new
   therapeutic opportunity to improve the treatment of injured tendons and

Abstract = {{Geoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is
   already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and
   functioning in some regions. Two types of geoengineering activities that
   have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which
   removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or
   sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of
   sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs).
   Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of
   climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and
   precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the
   climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic
   and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties
   associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth
   system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Bone tissue engineering scaffolds composed of poly(D,L-lactide:
   glycolide) (DL-PLGA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP)
   nanocomposites were prepared and characterized. Scaffolds with two
   specific architectures were produced via fused deposition modeling
   (FDM), a type of extrusion freeform fabrication. Microfilaments
   deposited at angles of 0 degrees and 90 degrees were designated as the
   `simple' scaffold architecture, while those deposited at angles
   alternating between 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees and -45 degrees
   were designated as the `complex' scaffold architecture. In addition, the
   simple and complex scaffolds were coated with hydroxyapatite (HA). The
   surface morphology of the scaffolds was assessed before and after HA
   coating and uniform distribution of HA coating on the surface was
   observed by scanning electron microscopy. The scaffolds were implanted
   into rabbit femoral unicortical bone defects according to four treatment
   groups based on pore structure and HA coating. After 6 and 12 weeks,
   scaffolds and host bone were recovered and processed for histology. Data
   suggest that all configurations of the scaffolds integrated with the
   host bone and were biocompatible and thus may offer an exciting new
   scaffold platform for delivery of biologicals for bone regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Logic-level simulation has been the de facto method for simulating
   defect/faulty behavior for various testing tasks since it offers a good
   tradeoff between accuracy and speed. Unfortunately, by abstracting
   defect behavior to the logic level (i.e., a fault model), it also
   discards important information that inevitably results in inaccuracies.
   This paper describes a fast and accurate defect simulation framework
   called SLIDER (simulation of layout-injected defects for electrical
   responses). SLIDER uses well-developed mixed-signal simulation
   technology that is conventionally used for design verification. There
   are three innovative aspects that distinguish SLIDER from prior work in
   this area: 1) accuracy resulting from defect injection taking place at
   the layout level; 2) speedup resulting from careful and automatic
   partitioning of the circuit into maximal digital and minimal analog
   domains for mixed-signal simulation; and 3) complete automation that
   includes defect generation, defect injection, design partitioning,
   netlist extraction, mixed-signal simulation, and test-data extraction.
   The virtual failure data created by SLIDER is useful in a variety of
   settings that include diagnosis resolution improvement, defect
   localization, fault model evaluation, and evaluation of yield/test
   learning techniques that are based on failure data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The paper studies distributed static parameter (vector) estimation in
   sensor networks with nonlinear observation models and noisy intersensor
   communication. It introduces separably estimable observation models that
   generalize the observability condition in linear centralized estimation
   to nonlinear distributed estimation. It studies two distributed
   estimation algorithms in separably estimable models, the NU (with its
   linear counterpart LU) and the NLU. Their update rule combines a
   consensus step (where each sensor updates the state by weight averaging
   it with its neighbors' states) and an innovation step (where each sensor
   processes its local current observation). This makes the three
   algorithms of the consensus + innovations type, very different from
   traditional consensus. This paper proves consistency (all sensors reach
   consensus almost surely and converge to the true parameter value),
   efficiency, and asymptotic unbiasedness. For LU and NU, it proves
   asymptotic normality and provides convergence rate guarantees. The three
   algorithms are characterized by appropriately chosen decaying weight
   sequences. Algorithms LU and NU are analyzed in the framework of
   stochastic approximation theory; algorithm NLU exhibits mixed time-scale
   behavior and biased perturbations, and its analysis requires a different
   approach that is developed in this paper.}},

   buildings?}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{399-411}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We examine the economic feasibility of using dedicated DC circuits to
   operate lighting in commercial buildings. We compare light-emitting
   diodes (LEDs) and fluorescents that are powered by either a central DC
   power supply or traditional AC grid electricity, with and without solar
   photovoltaics (PV) and battery back-up. Using DOE performance targets
   for LEDs and solar PV, we find that by 2012 LEDs have the lowest
   levelized annualized cost (LAC). If a DC voltage standard were
   developed, so that each LED fixture's driver could be eliminated, LACs
   could decrease, on average, by 5\% compared to AC LEDs with a driver in
   each fixture. DC circuits in grid-connected PV-powered LED lighting
   systems can lower the total unsubsidized capital costs by 4-21\% and
   LACs by 2-21\% compared to AC grid-connected PV LEDs. Grid-connected PV
   LEDs may match the LAC of grid-powered fluorescents by 2013. This
   outcome depends more on manufacturers' ability to produce LEDs that
   follow DOE's lamp production cost and efficacy targets, than on reducing
   power electronics costs for DC building circuits and voltage
   standardization. Further work is needed to better understand potential
   safety risks with DC distribution and to remove design, installation,
   permitting, and regulatory barriers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Building on systems-based philosophy, theory, methodology, and practice,
   the challenges associated with modeling, assessing, managing, and

   theory of scenario structuring; the epistemology of the states of the
   CIS-CCT systems; the role of systems integration in CIS-CCT; the risk to
   CIS-CCT from malicious insiders' intrusion; the complex definition and
   quantification of the risk function associated with CIS-CCT systems; and
   modeling the multiple perspectives of CIS-CCT, focusing on hierarchical
   holographic modeling (HHM) and phantom system models (PSM). The paper

Abstract = {{Particle-stabilized emulsions and foams offer a number of advantages
   over traditional surfactant-stabilized systems, most notably a greater
   stability against coalescence and coarsening. Nanoparticles are often
   less effective than micrometer-scale colloidal particles as stabilizers,
   but nanoparticles grafted with polymers can be particularly effective
   emulsifiers, stabilizing emulsions for long times at very low
   concentrations. In this work, we characterize the long-time and dynamic
   interfacial tension reduction by polymer-grafted nanoparticles adsorbing
   from suspension and the corresponding dilatational moduli for both
   xylene-water and air-water interfaces. The dilatational moduli at both
   types of interfaces are measured by a forced sinusoidal oscillation of
   the interface. Surface tension measurements at the air-water interface
   are interpreted with the aid of independent ellipsometry measurements of
   surface excess concentrations. The results suggest that the ability of
   polymer-grafted nanoparticles to produce significant surface and
   interfacial tension reductions and dilatational moduli at very low
   surface coverage is a key factor underlying their ability to stabilize
   Pickering emulsions at extremely low concentrations.}},

Title = {{SAS-Pro: Simultaneous Residue Assignment and Structure Superposition for
   Protein Structure Alignment}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Protein structure alignment is the problem of determining an assignment
   between the amino-acid residues of two given proteins in a way that
   maximizes a measure of similarity between the two superimposed protein
   structures. By identifying geometric similarities, structure alignment
   algorithms provide critical insights into protein functional
   similarities. Existing structure alignment tools adopt a two-stage
   approach to structure alignment by decoupling and iterating between the
   assignment evaluation and structure superposition problems. We introduce
   a novel approach, SAS-Pro, which addresses the assignment evaluation and
   structure superposition simultaneously by formulating the alignment
   problem as a single bilevel optimization problem. The new formulation
   does not require the sequentiality constraints, thus generalizing the
   scope of the alignment methodology to include non-sequential protein
   alignments. We employ derivative-free optimization methodologies for
   searching for the global optimum of the highly nonlinear and
   non-differentiable RMSD function encountered in the proposed model.
   Alignments obtained with SAS-Pro have better RMSD values and larger
   lengths than those obtained from other alignment tools. For
   non-sequential alignment problems, SAS-Pro leads to alignments with high
   degree of similarity with known reference alignments. The source code of
   SAS-Pro is available for download at
   http://eudoxus.cheme.cmu.edu/saspro/SAS-Pro.html.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an efficient strategic/tactical planning model
   for offshore oilfield development problem that is fairly generic and can
   be extended to include other complexities. The proposed multiperiod
   nonconvex MINLP (mixed integer nonlinear programming) model for
   multifield site includes three components (oil, water, and gas)
   explicitly in the formulation using higher order polynomials, avoiding
   bilinear and other nonlinear terms. With the objective of maximizing
   total NPV for long-term planning horizon, the model involves decisions
   related to FPSO (floating production, storage, and offloading)
   installation and expansions, field-FPSO connections, well drilling, and
   production rates in each time period. The model can be solved
   effectively with DICOPT for realistic instances and gives good quality
   solutions. Furthermore, it can be reformulated into an MILP after
   piecewise linearization and exact linearization techniques that can be
   solved globally in an efficient way. Solutions of realistic instances
   involving 10 fields, 3 FPSOs, 84 wells, and 20 years planning horizon
   are reported, as well as comparisons between the computational
   performance of the proposed MINLP and MILP formulations.}},

Abstract = {{An organometallic vapor phase epitaxy-based process route has been
   developed to achieve homoepitaxial deposition of GaN(0001) films via
   step-flow growth on substrates having <1 degrees off-cut. Atomic force
   microscopy of the surfaces of 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 nm thick films revealed
   steps and terraces as the only features; three-dimensional GaN islands
   were not observed. Film-substrate interfaces were not present in
   cross-sectional samples using high-resolution TEM. This indicated that
   continuous film growth occurred from steps on the substrate without
   re-nucleation and defect formation on the terraces. This process route
   also mitigated the generation of additional dislocations, as validated
   by the exact matches of the density and positions of dislocations that
   reached the substrate surface and those observed in a subsequently grown
   600 nm film. The influence of grain boundaries in the interior of the
   GaN substrates was manifest in variations in terrace width and step
   orientation across the substrates and the films. A grain orientation map
   generated across a representative substrate revealed highly disoriented
   grains on the periphery. The disorientation angles between these
   adjacent grains were centered around similar to 35 degrees, similar to
   70 degrees and similar to 90 degrees. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{While energy storage technologies have existed for decades, fast-ramping
   grid-level storage is still an immature industry and is experiencing
   relatively rapid improvements in performance and cost across a variety
   of technologies. In this innovation cycle, it is important to determine
   which properties of emerging energy storage technologies are most
   valuable. Decreased capital cost, increased power capability, and
   increased efficiency all would improve the value of an energy storage
   technology and each has cost implications that vary by application, but
   there has not yet been an investigation of the marginal rate of
   technical substitution between storage properties. We use
   engineering-economic models of four emerging fast-ramping energy storage
   technologies and examine their cost-effectiveness for four realistic
   current applications. We determine which properties have the greatest
   effect on cost-of-service by performing an extended sensitivity analysis
   on the storage properties for combinations of application and storage
   type. We find that capital cost of storage is consistently important,
   and identify applications for which power/energy limitations are
   important. Each combination is different and blanket statements are not
   always appropriate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a multidimensional model that spatially resolves transport,
   surface chemistry, and electrochemical kinetics within water-filled
   pores of a porous electrode with an adjacent Nafion polymer electrolyte.
   A novel aspect of this model is the simultaneous capturing of the
   electric double layers (EDLs) at the water vertical bar Nafion and water
   vertical bar electrode interfaces. In addition, the model incorporates
   discrete domains to spatially resolve specific adsorption at the inner
   Helmholtz plane (IHP); surface charging due to functional groups; and
   multistep, multipathway electrochemical reactions at the outer Helmholtz
   plane (OHP). Herein, we apply the model to the hydrogen oxidation
   reaction (HOR) in water-filled mesopores of a platinum- (Pt-) carbon
   electrode, similar to a polymer electrolyte fuel cell's (PEFC's) anode.
   This work was motivated by the limited understanding of how incomplete
   polymer electrolyte coverage of a catalyst affects the kinetics and
   transport in these electrodes. Our results indicate that the Pt within a
   water-filled pore is only 5\% effective for an applied potential of 20
   mV. At low potentials (<150 mV), the current is limited by the low H-2
   solubility in water according to the Tafel-Volmer HOR pathway. At higher
   potentials, the current is reduced by proton exclusion by the
   overlapping EDLs and the Donnan potential at the water vertical bar
   polymer electrolyte interface, suppressing the Heyrovsky-Volmer pathway.
   Our analysis includes a parametric study of the pore radius and length.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
   formulation for the tank farm operation problem (TFOP), which involves
   the simultaneous scheduling of continuous multiproduct processing lines
   and the assignment of dedicated storage tanks to finished products. The
   objective of the problem is to minimize blocking of the finished lines
   by obtaining an optimal schedule and an optimal allocation of storage
   resources. The novelty of this work is the integration of a tank
   assignment problem with a scheduling problem where a dedicated storage
   tank has to be chosen from a tank farm given the volumes, sequencing,
   and timing of production of a series of products. The scheduling part of
   the model is based on the multioperation sequencing (MOS) model by
   Mouret et al. (Mouret, S.; Grossmann, L E.; Pestiaux, P. Time
   representations and mathematical models for process scheduling problems.
   Comput. Chem. Eng. 2011, 35, 1038-1063). The formulation is tested in
   three examples of different size and complexity.}},

Title = {{Importance of composition and hygroscopicity of BC particles to the
   effect of BC mitigation on cloud properties: Application to California
   conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) has many effects on climate including the direct
   effect on atmospheric absorption, indirect and semi-direct effects on
   clouds, snow effects, and others. While most of these are positive
   (warming), the first indirect effect is negative and quantifying its
   magnitude in addition to other BC feedbacks is important for supporting
   policies that mitigate BC. We use the detailed aerosol chemistry parcel
   model of Russell and Seinfeld (1998), observationally constrained by
   initial measured aerosol concentrations from five California sites, to
   provide simulated cloud drop number (CDN) concentrations against which
   two GCM calculations - one run at the global scale and one nested from
   the global-to-regional scale are compared. The GCM results reflect the
   combined effects of their emission inventories, advection schemes, and
   cloud parameterizations. BC-type particles contributed between 16 and
   20\% of cloud droplets at all sites even in the presence of more
   hygroscopic particles. While this chemically detailed parcel model
   result is based on simplified cloud dynamics and does not consider
   semi-direct or cloud absorption effects, the cloud drop number
   concentrations are similar to the simulations of both Chen et al.
   (2010b) and Jacobson (2010) for the average cloud conditions in
   California. Reducing BC particle concentration by 50\% decreased the
   cloud droplet concentration by between 6\% and 9\% resulting in the
   formation of fewer, larger cloud droplets that correspond to a lower
   cloud albedo. This trend is similar to Chen et al. (2010b) and Jacobson
   (2010) when BC particles were modeled as hygroscopic. This reduction in
   CDN in California due to the decrease in activated BC particles supports
   the concern raised by Chen et al. (2010a) that the cloud albedo effect
   of BC particles has a cooling effect that partially offsets the direct
   forcing reduction if other warming effects of BC on clouds are
   unchanged. These results suggests that for regions like the California
   sites studied here, where BC mitigation targets fossil fuel sources, a
   critical aspect of the modeled reduction is the chemical composition and
   associated hygroscopicity of the BC particles removed as well as their
   relative contribution to the atmospheric particle concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A new multiobjective optimization formulation dealing with simultaneous
   scheduling and control issues in single line processing systems is
   proposed. Objective functions featuring economic profit and dynamic
   performance are considered because normally they are in conflict.
   Because integer, continuous variables and process dynamic behavior are
   involved, the bicriterion optimization problem is cast in terms of a
   mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problem. The Pareto front of
   each problem is computed using the E-constraint method for handling
   multiobjective problems. The results indicate that improved optimal
   solutions can be obtained by using multiobjective optimization
   techniques instead of just simple merging of all the target objective
   functions into a single objective. The proposed multiobjective approach
   for handling scheduling and control problems is illustrated using three
   CSTR examples of varying nonlinear behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Many high-level synthesis tools offer degrees of freedom in mapping
   high-level specifications to Register-Transfer Level descriptions. These
   choices do not affect the functional behavior but span a design space of
   different cost-performance tradeoffs. In this paper we present a novel
   machine learning-based approach that efficiently determines the
   Pareto-optimal designs while only sampling and synthesizing a fraction
   of the design space. The approach combines three key components: (1) A
   regression model based on Gaussian processes to predict area and
   throughput based on synthesis training data. (2) A ``smart{''} sampling
   strategy, GP-PUCB, to iteratively refine the model by carefully
   selecting the next design to synthesize to maximize progress. (3) A
   stopping criterion based on assessing the accuracy of the model without
   access to complete synthesis data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our approach using IP generators for discrete Fourier transforms and
   sorting networks. However, our algorithm is not specific to this
   application and can be applied to a wide range of Pareto front
   prediction problems.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimisation-based algorithm which
   usually requires a numerical method to calculate the solution of the
   problem. Inherently, numerical methods for optimisation problems are
   implemented on a finite-precision hardware platform and are subject to
   the appearance of numerical instabilities of catastrophic cancellation
   and ill-conditioned matrices. These anomalies are difficult to detect
   and overcome, and for safety-critical applications, it is essential to
   have a mechanism that can at least issue a warning when an arithmetic
   instability occurs. Towards this direction, Monte Carlo arithmetic (MCA)
   for the floating-point (FP) number system has been used for both
   detection and mitigation of catastrophic cancellation and
   ill-conditioned matrices. An alternative to FP is the Logarithmic Number
   System (LNS) that recently has been proposed for the real-time hardware
   implementation of embedded MPC. In this study the authors present the
   adaptation of MCA to LNS for detecting and mitigating catastrophic
   cancellation, forming the Monte Carlo Logarithmic Number System (MCLNS).
   An inherent drawback of MCA is the accuracy deterioration which is a
   direct consequence of the randomisation in the arithmetic operations.
   Additionally, multiple simulations of the system result in performance
   deterioration equal to the number of simulations. Using off-line
   simulations it is possible to determine the necessary hardware
   requirements to achieve desired accuracy under performance constraints.
   These trade-offs are studied and analysed for an MPC algorithm, and the
   hardware implementation cost of MCLNS is quantified by synthesis on a
   Xilinx Virtex-IV FPGA.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the mechanism of cell migration, we cultured fibroblasts
   on micro-patterned tracks to induce persistent migration with a highly
   elongated morphology and well-defined polarity, which allows
   microfluidic pharmacological manipulations of regional functions. The
   function of myosin II was probed by applying inhibitors either globally
   or locally. Of interest, although global inhibition of myosin II
   inhibited tail retraction and caused dramatic elongation of the
   posterior region, localized inhibition of the cell body inhibited
   nuclear translocation and caused elongation of the anterior region. In
   addition, local application of cytochalasin D at the tip inhibited
   frontal extension without inhibiting forward movement of the cell
   nucleus, whereas local treatment posterior to the nucleus caused
   reversal of nuclear movement. Imaging of cortical dynamics indicated
   that the region around the nucleus is a distinct compression zone where
   activities of anterior and posterior regions converge. These
   observations suggest a three-component model of cell migration in which
   a contractile middle section is responsible for the movement of a bulky
   cell body and the detachment/retraction of a resistive tail, thereby
   allowing these regions to undergo coordinated movement with a moving
   anterior region that carries little load.}},

Abstract = {{The agglomerate model of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)

   diameter, while in reality there is a distribution of agglomerate sizes.
   Here, we analyze how the agglomerate model's predictions are affected by
   incorporating an agglomerate diameter distribution. Our analysis shows
   that the diameter distribution causes the agglomerate model predictions
   to differ by as much as 70\% when compared to even reasonable single
   agglomerate diameter choices. The error in the model's predictions is
   highly sensitive to both agglomerate diameter and overpotential. Even
   the agglomerate diameter that gives the lowest maximum error in our
   results, 115 nm, errs by as much as 15\% at certain overpotentials.

Abstract = {{While traditional high-resolution STEM is performed by exclusively
   collecting electrons which have been scattered to high angles (i.e.,
   HAADF), the present contribution will focus on small-angle scattered
   electrons, as in low angle annular dark-field (LAADF) STEM. This unique
   imaging mode allows one to image defect contrast while maintaining
   directly interpretable atomic resolution. By simply adjusting the
   microscope camera length, and thus the acceptance angle of the annular
   detector, it is possible to transition between Z-contrast and defect
   contrast. Both LAADF and HAADF experimental and computational results
   are discussed in regards to zone axis imaging of a gamma/gamma'
   Ni-superalloy; various length scales are explored. Electron
   de-channeling is observed while the probe is placed over defected
   regions of crystal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Substrate- and thickness-related effects on the oxygen surface exchange
   of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) thin films were investigated to understand
   better cathode reactivity in solid oxide fuel cells. Epitaxial
   (100)-oriented LSM films were fabricated on (100)-SrTiO3 and
   (110)-NdGaO3 substrates and were characterized using electrical
   conductivity relaxation. A strong substrate effect on the chemical
   surface exchange coefficient (k(chem)) was observed, with a higher
   k(chem), found for films on SrTiO3 than those on NdGaO3. Two distinct
   activation energies (E-a) were observed for k(chem), which were assigned
   to two parallel exchange processes; the relative contributions from each
   depended on the substrate, film thickness, and temperature. For films
   coherently strained to the substrates, k(chem) values differed by almost
   an order of magnitude, whereas E-a was similar to 4.5 (+/- 0.1) eV on
   both substrates. For relaxed films, k(chem) values differed only by a
   factor of 2, and E-a was similar to 0.75 (+/- 0.1) eV on both
   substrates. We discuss the strain effect relative to the native surface
   exchange and the thickness effect relative to the extended defect
   populations in the films. The outcome of this study sheds light on how
   microstructural features affect surface chemistry in modified cathodes.}},

Title = {{A review of uncertainties in technology experience curves}},
Journal = {{ENERGY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{762-771}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The use of log-linear experience curves (or learning curves) relating
   reductions in the unit cost of technologies to their cumulative
   production or installed capacity has become a common method of
   representing endogenous technical change in energy-economic models used
   for policy analysis. Yet, there are significant uncertainties in such
   formulations whose impact on key model results have been insufficiently
   examined or considered. This paper reviews the major types of
   uncertainty in log-linear experience curves and their effect on
   projected rates of cost reduction. Uncertainties are found not only in
   the learning rate parameter of a log-linear model, but also in the
   functional form that determines the shape of an experience curve.
   Evidence for alternative forms such as an S-shaped curve is reviewed
   along with case studies that demonstrate the uncertainties associated
   with cost increases during early commercialization of a technology a
   phenomena that is widely recognized but rarely quantified or
   incorporated in learning models. Additional factors discussed include
   the effects of learning discontinuities, institutional forgetting, and
   the influence of social, economic and political factors. We then review
   other models of causality, which aim to improve modelers' ability to
   explain and predict the influence of other underlying processes that
   contribute to technology cost reductions in addition to learning.
   Ignoring other types of underlying mechanisms can create a false sense
   of precision and overestimate the true contribution of learning.
   Currently, however, uncertainties in such multi-factor models remain
   large due to the difficulties of estimating key parameters (such as
   private-sector R\&D investments) and extending models of a specific
   technology to a broader suite of technologies and cost projections.
   Pending the development and validation of more robust models of
   technological change, we suggest ways to significantly improve the
   characterization and reporting of current learning model uncertainties
   and their impacts on the results of energy-economic models to help
   reduce the potential for drawing inappropriate or erroneous policy
   conclusions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A successful ICAR (initiators for continuous activator regeneration)
   ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) of styrene was conducted
   with iron(III) bromide and 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (ACHN)
   as the thermal initiator. A polymerization, started with SO ppm of FeBr3
   and 50 mol equivalents of ACHN in 33\% (v/v) anisole at 90 degrees C,
   reached 70\% conversion in 24 h and was well controlled, giving a
   polymer with a narrow molecular weight distribution (M-w/M-n = 1.15).
   The number average molecular weight (M-n) corresponded well to
   theoretical values, as conversion increased. The rate of polymerization
   was dependent on the amount of ACHN initially added to the reaction. A
   polymer with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, M-w/M-n
   = 1.29 at 65\% of conversion, was obtained with 5 ppm of FeBr3 and the
   appropriate amount of ACHN. This procedure therefore provides an
   efficient controlled polymerization in addition to creating a robust,
   cheap, and environmentally friendly catalytic system. Control of
   polymerization with ACHN was better than with tert-butyl peracetate as a
   thermal initiator or tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, Fe-0, or Zn-0 wire as
   reducing agents.}},

Abstract = {{Right ventricular failure is a significant complication following
   implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which increases
   morbidity and mortality. Consequently, researchers have sought
   predictors that may identify patients at risk. However, they have lacked
   sensitivity and/or specificity. This study investigated the use of a
   decision tree technology to explore the preoperative data space for
   combinatorial relationships that may be more accurate and precise. We
   retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 patients with initial LVAD
   implantation at the Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh
   Medical Center, between May 1996 and October 2009. Among those patients,
   27 later required a right ventricular assist device (RVAD+) and 156
   remained on LVAD (RVAD-) until the time of transplantation or death. A
   synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to the
   RVAD+ group to compensate for the disparity of sample size. Twenty-one
   resampling levels were evaluated, with decision tree model built for
   each. Among these models, the top six predictors of the need for an RVAD
   were transpulmonary gradient (TPG), age, international normalized ratio
   (INR), heart rate (HR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), prothrombin
   time, and right ventricular systolic pressure. TPG was identified to be
   the most predictive variable in 15 out of 21 models, and constituted the
   first splitting node with 7 mmHg as the breakpoint. Oversampling was
   shown to improve the senstivity of the models monotonically, although
   asymptotically, while the specificity was diminished to a lesser degree.
   The model built upon 5X synthetic RVAD+ oversampling was found to
   provide the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity,
   included TPG (layer 1), age (layer 2), right atrial pressure (layer 3),
   HR (layer 4,7), INR (layer 4, 9), alanine aminotransferase (layer 5),
   white blood cell count (layer 5,6, \& 7), the number of inotrope agents
   (layer 6), creatinine (layer 8), AST (layer 9, 10), and cardiac output
   (layer 9). It exhibited 85\% sensitivity, 83\% specificity, and 0.87
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (RoC), which was
   found to be greatly improved compared to previously published studies.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, historical production information for an activity and the
   corresponding contextual information depicting the conditions under
   which a production rate is achieved are stored in multiple dispersed
   data sources, if they are stored. This results in extra time and effort
   spent in searching, gathering, and integrating information while
   estimating the activity production rates in new bids. Because estimators
   work on tight schedules to deliver bids, this may impede estimators from
   being able to use the neutral and objective data related to past
   performances. This paper describes a general algorithm developed for
   data storage, an approach that facilitates the storage of
   activity-specific production and contextual information in an integrated
   fashion within project models. This approach employs both an as-planned
   and an as-built project model as inputs, integrates these models by
   performing automated mappings between them, and augments this integrated
   model with activity-specific production and contextual information
   collected in the field. The developed approach has been validated in
   terms of its generality in supporting automatic mapping between the
   as-planned and as-built project models and its generality of data
   storage in terms of storing data items, which have different
   representation requirements. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000139.

Abstract = {{In this work we present the design of a scalable, controllable,
   miniature flapping wing robot. The design effort comprises
   considerations of the number of driving actuators for controllability,
   body structure for both weight minimization and rigidity, and overall
   compactness of the robot design. This results in the development of the
   spherical four-bar transmission mechanism, with a single-wing prototype
   experimentally characterized. A dual-wing robot design manufactured via
   the smart composite microstructures technique is presented, featuring
   independent wing actuation. Finite-element analysis of the final
   airframe design is presented, ensuring vibration modes out of the
   operation range of the platform and high rigidity. A working prototype
   is manufactured and experiments are conducted characterizing the robot's
   lift production capabilities and ensuring minimal wing coupling. A
   scaling law of the proposed design is presented based on momentum
   theory, predicting an increase of the lift/weight ratio with decreasing
   size. An optimization methodology for the parameters of a scaled down
   prototype is presented, based on a developed theoretical simulation and
   design tool. Finally, a 1/2 scaled down prototype using the optimized
   parameters is built and tested, featuring a lift/weight ratio of 3/8.}},

Abstract = {{The infiltration characteristics of synthetic coal slag into Al2s3
   refractory material with a temperature gradient induced along the slag's
   penetration direction were investigated with respect to time and oxygen
   partial pressure of the experimental atmosphere. Synthetic slag, which
   is representative of an average of the ash contents from United States
   coal feedstock, was melted in either an oxidizing air atmosphere or a
   reducing CO/CO2 gas mixture with a ratio of 1.8. The experiments were
   conducted with a hot-face temperature of 1450 degrees C, and the slags
   were deposited onto refractory samples in the same atmospheres as they
   were originally melted. A comparison between the infiltrations in the
   CO/CO2 and air atmospheres revealed that differences in oxygen partial
   pressure changed the mode in which the slag interacted with the
   refractory. While infiltrations in CO/CO2 atmosphere demonstrated
   elevated Al2O3 concentrations in the slag owing to refractory
   dissolution, infiltrations in air atmosphere showed enrichment of SiO2
   and Al2O3 in the slag because iron-oxide from the slag incorporated into
   the corundum refractory. For both cases, the reactions led to increases
   in viscosity, but the effect was more profound in the air atmosphere,
   where penetrations were found to be shallower. The oxygen partial
   pressure's influence on the slag's composition, primarily with
   iron-oxide species, and on viscosity played a pivotal role in governing
   the effective penetration into the refractory.}},

Title = {{Stochastic region competition algorithm for Doppler sonography
   segmentation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: A probabilistic image segmentation algorithm called stochastic
   region competition is proposed for performing Doppler sonography
   segmentation.
   Methods: The image segmentation is conducted by maximizing a posteriori
   that models histogram likelihood, gradient likelihood, and a spatial
   prior. The optimization is done by a modified expectation and
   maximization (EM) method that aims to improve computation efficiency and
   avoid local optima.
   Results: The algorithm was tested on 155 color Doppler sonograms and
   compared with manual delineations. The qualitative assessment shows that
   our algorithm is able to segment mass lesions under the condition of low
   image quality and the interference of the color-encoded Doppler
   information. The quantitative assessment analysis shows that the average
   distance between the algorithm-generated boundaries and manual
   delineations is statistically comparable to the variability of manual
   delineations. The ratio of the overlapping area between the
   algorithm-generated boundaries and manual delineations is also
   comparable to that between different sets of manual delineations. A
   reproductivity test was conducted to confirm that the result is
   statistically reproducible.
   Conclusions: The algorithm can be used to perform Doppler sonography
   segmentation and to replace the tedious manual delineation task in
   clinical application. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in reducing emissions from electricity
   generation in the United States (U.S.). Renewable energy, energy
   efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested
   solutions. Both supply- and demand-side interventions will displace
   energy-and emissions-from conventional generators. Marginal emissions
   factors (MEFs) give a consistent metric for assessing the avoided
   emissions resulting from such interventions. This paper presents the
   first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system.
   Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006
   through 2011, we estimate regional MEFs for CO2, NOx and SO2, as well as
   the share of marginal generation from coal-, gas-, and oil-fired
   generators. Trends in MEFs with respect to system load, time of day, and
   month are explored. We compare marginal and average emissions factors
   (AEFs), finding that AEFs may grossly misestimate the avoided emissions
   resulting from an intervention. We find significant regional differences
   in the emissions benefits of avoiding one megawatt-hour of electricity:
   compared to the West, an equivalent energy efficiency measure in the
   Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70\% more CO2, 12 times more SO2,
   and 3 times more NOx emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Commonly found in nature and engineering, multiphase flows contain
   interacting media of different phases. Traditionally, there have been
   two ways to model such flows. First, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach, in
   which the phases are modeled as interpenetrating continua, is
   computationally efficient but does not provide the discrete particle
   locations. Second, in the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, the dispersed
   phase is treated as individual particles interacting with a fluid
   continuum. However, this approach is computationally demanding.
   especially for flows containing a large number of particles. The current
   work introduces an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to modeling multiphase
   flows, in which the particles are modeled using lattice-based cellular
   automata (CA). The fluid is modeled as a continuum while particles are
   modeled on a lattice which allows them to evolve spatially and
   temporally. Thus, this work examines the feasibility of the Eulerian-CA
   approach for modeling multiphase flows while achieving significant
   speedups in computational times. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Visualization of flow structures in Fontan patients using 3-dimensional

Abstract = {{Objective: Our objective was to analyze 3-dimensional (3D) blood flow
   patterns within the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) using in vivo
   phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC MRI).
   Methods: Sixteen single-ventricle patients were prospectively recruited
   at 2 leading pediatric institutions for PC MRI evaluation of their
   Fontan pathway. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 8
   patients with an extracardiac (EC) TCPC, and group 2 comprised 8
   patients with a lateral tunnel (LT) TCPC. A coronal stack of 5 to 10
   contiguous PC MRI slices with 3D velocity encoding (5-9 ms resolution)
   was acquired and a volumetric flow field was reconstructed.
   Results: Analysis revealed large vortices in LT TCPCs and helical flow
   structures in EC TCPCs. On average, there was no difference between LT
   and EC TCPCs in the proportion of inferior vena cava flow going to the
   left pulmonary artery (43\% +/- 7\% vs 46\% +/- 5\%; P = .34). However,
   for EC TCPCs, the presence of a caval offset was a primary determinant
   of inferior vena caval flow distribution to the pulmonary arteries with
   a significant bias to the offset side.
   Conclusions: 3D flow structures within LT and EC TCPCs were
   reconstructed and analyzed for the first time using PC MRI. TCPC flow
   patterns were shown to be different, not only on the basis of LT or EC
   considerations, but with significant influence from the superior vena
   cava connection as well. This work adds to the ongoing body of research
   demonstrating the impact of TCPC geometry on the overall hemodynamic
   profile. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012; 143: 1108-16)}},

Abstract = {{Poly(e-caprolactone fumarate) (PCLF) scaffold formulations were assessed
   as a delivery system for recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein
   (rhBMP-2) for bone tissue engineering. The formulations included PCLF
   with combinations of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and hydroxyapatite (HA).
   The assessments included in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro assays
   validated cell attachment using a pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1).
   Additionally, in vitro release profiles of rhBMP-2 from PCLF scaffolds
   were determined up to 21 days. The data suggested that PCLF incorporated
   with PVA and HA accelerated rhBMP-2 release and that the released
   protein was bioactive. For the in vivo study, a critical-sized defect
   (CSD) model in rabbit calvaria was used to test PCLF scaffolds. At 6
   weeks post-implantation, significantly more bone formation was measured
   in PCLF scaffolds containing rhBMP-2 than in scaffolds without rhBMP-2.
   In conclusion, we demonstrated that PCLF delivered biologically active
   rhBMP-2, promoted bone healing in a CSD and has potential as a bone
   tissue engineering scaffold. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a systematic framework is introduced to synthesize the
   optimal separation process of azeotropic mixtures. The proposed
   framework, which can handle an arbitrary number of components, consists
   of two main steps: a system analysis and a state-space superstructure
   algorithm. The system analysis is composed of some equation-oriented
   algorithms to supply basic information for the superstructure, including
   structure of the composition space, existence of unchangeable points and
   candidate operations. It is shown that the proposed superstructure
   featuring multistream mixing is superior to previous ones because it
   significantly expands the feasible area. Moreover, detailed design
   parameters such as number of stages and reflux ratio are derived.
   Additionally, flowsheet feasibility test rules are constructed to
   facilitate the analysis of the process, and are able to be used as
   heuristic methods to guide the design of ternary or quaternary systems.
   Three industrial cases are presented to illustrate the proposed
   framework. (c) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J,

Abstract = {{The in vivo tissue response to a newly developed fiber-reinforced
   calcium phosphate cement (CPC) formulation was assessed using a
   well-established rabbit calvarial defect model. Bilateral subcritical
   sized (8-mm diameter) defects were surgically created in the parietal
   bones of each rabbit (a total of 48 rabbits), and randomized to be
   filled with either the new fiber-reinforced formulation, a conventional
   CPC (positive control), or left unfilled (negative control). The implant
   sites were subsequently retrieved after 12, 24, and 52 weeks
   postsurgery. Each specimen, including the parietal bone craniotomy and
   underlying brain, were recovered at necropsy and the tissue responses
   were assessed by histology. The resulting histological slides indicated
   that there was no evidence of severe inflammatory responses or
   osteolysis. The data showed new dural and pericranial bone formation
   along the implants, as well as excellent bone-to-implant interfaces in
   all of the CPC-filled defects. These results suggest that the biologic
   response to the new fiber-reinforced CPC formulations and conventional
   nonreinforced CPC are very similar, and both demonstrate excellent
   biocompatibility as well as an overall osteophylic response. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{The optimal flowsheet for the production of bioethanol from switchgrass
   via hydrolysis is proposed in this work. A superstructure embedding a
   number of alternatives is proposed. Two technologies are considered for
   switchgrass pretreatment, dilute acid and ammonia fiber explosion so
   that the structure of the grass is broken down. Next, enzymatic
   hydrolysis follows any of the pretreatments to obtain fermentable
   sugars, mainly xylose and glucose. Ethanol is obtained by fermentation
   of the sugars. To obtain fuel quality, ethanol and water must be removed
   from the waterethanol mixture. A number of dehydration technologies is
   considered including rectification, adsorption in corn grits, molecular
   sieves, and pervaporation. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming (MINLP). The superstructure is optimized by
   decomposing the MINLP for each of the pretreatments. Then, multieffect
   columns and heat integration are used to reduce the energy consumption
   and cooling needs. Finally, an economic evaluation is performed. The
   optimal flowsheet consists of using dilute acid hydrolysis followed by
   molecular sieves as dehydration technology, which requires less energy
   and cooling and yielding a promising production price of 0.8 \$/gal. (c)

Abstract = {{Using variational methods, we establish conditions for the nonlinear
   stability of adhesive states between an elastica and a rigid halfspace.
   The treatment produces coupled criteria for adhesion and buckling
   instabilities by exploiting classical techniques from Legendre and
   Jacobi. Three examples that arise in a broad range of engineered
   systems, from microelectronics to biologically inspired fiber array
   adhesion, are used to illuminate the stability criteria. The first
   example illustrates buckling instabilities in adhered rods, while the
   second shows the instability of a peeling process and the third
   illustrates the stability of a shear-induced adhesion. The latter
   examples can also be used to explain how microfiber array adhesives can
   be activated by shearing and deactivated by peeling. The nonlinear
   stability criteria developed in this paper are also compared to other
   treatments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution during the supersolvus heat treatment of a
   powder-metallurgy, low-solvus, high-refractory (LSHR) superalloy was
   established. For this purpose, three lots of LSHR with varying initial
   carbon/boron composition and thermomechanical history were subjected to
   a series of short-time (induction) and long-time (furnace) heat
   treatments followed by scanning electron microscopy/electron backscatter
   diffraction and quantitative metallography. The size of the (pinned)
   gamma grains exhibited a limited dependence on heating rate and soak
   time at peak temperature, and it was generally smaller than the
   predictions based on the classic Smith-Zener model. The differences were
   rationalized in terms of stereological and pinning-particle location
   effects. Observations of limited coarsening of the carbide/boride
   pinning particles were interpreted in the context of prior experimental
   observations and a modified Lifshitz-Slyosov-Wagner model applied
   previously for the coarsening of compound phases in steels.}},

Abstract = {{Therapies using adult stem cells often require mechanical manipulation
   such as injection or incorporation into scaffolds. However,
   force-induced rupture and mechanosensitivity of cells during
   manipulation is largely ignored. Here, we image cell mechanical
   structures and perform a biophysical characterization of three different
   types of human adult stem cells: bone marrow CD34+ hematopoietic, bone
   marrow mesenchymal and perivascular mesenchymal stem cells. We use
   micropipette aspiration to characterize cell mechanics and quantify
   deformation of subcellular structures under force and its contribution
   to global cell deformation. Our results suggest that CD34+ cells are
   mechanically suitable for injection systems since cells transition from
   solid- to fluid-like at constant aspiration pressure, probably due to a
   poorly developed actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, mesenchymal stem cells
   from the bone marrow and perivascular niches are more suitable for
   seeding into biomaterial scaffolds since they are mechanically robust
   and have developed cytoskeletal structures that may allow cellular
   stable attachment and motility through solid porous environments. Among
   these, perivascular stem cells cultured in 6\% oxygen show a developed
   cytoskeleton but a more compliant nucleus, which can facilitate the
   penetration into pores of tissues or scaffolds. We confirm the relevance
   of our measurements using cell motility and migration assays and measure
   survival of injected cells. Since different types of adult stem cells
   can be used for similar applications, we suggest considering mechanical
   properties of stem cells to match optimal mechanical characteristics of
   therapies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of Synthetic A beta Peptide Oligomers and Fluorinated Solvents on
   Kv1.3 Channel Properties and Membrane Conductance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{The impact of synthetic amyloid beta (1-42) (A beta(1-42)) oligomers on
   biophysical properties of voltage-gated potassium channels Kv 1.3 and
   lipid bilayer membranes (BLMs) was quantified for protocols using
   hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as solvents
   prior to initiating the oligomer formation. Regardless of the solvent
   used A beta(1-42) samples contained oligomers that reacted with the
   conformation-specific antibodies A11 and OC and had similar size
   distributions as determined by dynamic light scattering. Patch-clamp
   recordings of the potassium currents showed that synthetic A beta(1-42)
   oligomers accelerate the activation and inactivation kinetics of Kv 1.3
   current with no significant effect on current amplitude. In contrast to
   oligomeric samples, freshly prepared, presumably monomeric, A beta(1-42)
   solutions had no effect on Kv 1.3 channel properties. A beta(1-42)
   oligomers had no effect on the steady-state current (at -80 mV) recorded
   from Kv 1.3-expressing cells but increased the conductance of artificial
   BLMs in a dose-dependent fashion. Formation of amyloid channels,
   however, was not observed due to conditions of the experiments. To
   exclude the effects of HFIP (used to dissolve lyophilized A beta(1-42)
   peptide), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (used during A beta(1-42)
   synthesis), we determined concentrations of these fluorinated compounds
   in the stock A beta(1-42) solutions by F-19 NMR. After extensive
   evaporation, the concentration of HFIP in the 100 x stock A beta(1-42)
   solutions was,similar to 1.7 mu M. The concentration of residual TFA in
   the 70 x stock A beta(1-42) solutions was similar to 20 mu M. Even at
   the stock concentrations neither HFIP nor TFA alone had any effect on
   potassium currents or BLMs. The A beta(1-42) oligomers prepared with
   HFIP as solvent, however, were more potent in the electrophysiological
   tests, suggesting that fluorinated compounds, such as HFIP or
   structurally-related inhalational anesthetics, may affect A beta(1-42)
   aggregation and potentially enhance ability of oligomers to modulate
   voltage-gated ion channels and biological membrane properties.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid adoption of mobile phone technologies in Africa is offering
   exciting opportunities for engaging with high-risk populations through
   mHealth programs, and the vast volumes of behavioral data being
   generated as people use their phones provide valuable data about human
   behavioral dynamics in these regions. Taking advantage of these
   opportunities requires an understanding of the penetration of mobile
   phones and phone usage patterns across the continent, but very little is
   known about the social and geographical heterogeneities in mobile phone
   ownership among African populations. Here, we analyze a survey of mobile
   phone ownership and usage across Kenya in 2009 and show that distinct
   regional, gender-related, and socioeconomic variations exist, with
   particularly low ownership among rural communities and poor people. We
   also examine patterns of phone sharing and highlight the contrasting
   relationships between ownership and sharing in different parts of the
   country. This heterogeneous penetration of mobile phones has important
   implications for the use of mobile technologies as a source of
   population data and as a public health tool in sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{We propose linear generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) models for
   the short-term scheduling problem of single stage batch plants with
   parallel units. Three different concepts of continuous-time
   representation are explored, immediate and general precedence, as well
   as multiple time grids. The linear GDP models are then reformulated
   using both big-M and convex hull reformulations, and the resulting
   mixed-integer linear programming models compared through the solution of
   a set of example problems. We show that two general precedence models
   from the literature can be derived using a big-M reformulation for a set
   of disjunctions and a convex hull reformulation for another. The best
   performer is, however, a multiple time grid model which can be derived
   from the convex hull reformulation followed by simple algebraic
   manipulations to eliminate the disaggregated variables and reduce the
   sets of constraints, thus leading to a more compact and efficient
   formulation.}},

Abstract = {{This study estimates fossil-based CO2 emissions and energy use from
   1900-2000 for Allegheny County, PA. Total energy use and emissions
   increased from 1900 to 1970, reflecting the significant industrial,
   economic, and population growth that occurred in Allegheny County. From
   1970 to 2000, Allegheny County experienced a 30\% decrease in total
   emissions and energy use from peak values, primarily because of a
   decline in industrial activity (40\% decrease in value added) and the
   loss of a quarter of its population. Despite these dramatic economic and
   demographic transitions, per capita emissions remained stable from 1970
   to 2000, buoyed by relatively stable or slightly increasing emissions in
   the commercial and transportation sectors. Allegheny County's history
   suggests the scale of change needed to achieve local emissions
   reductions may be significant; given years of major technological,
   economic, and demographic changes, per capita emissions in 1940 were
   nearly the same in 2000. Most local governments are planning emissions
   reductions rates that exceed 1\% per year, which deviate significantly
   from historical trends. Our results suggest additional resources and
   improved planning paradigms are likely necessary to achieve significant
   emissions reductions, especially for areas where emissions are still
   increasing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{372}},
Pages = {{183-191}},

Abstract = {{The impact of transport of surfactants to fluid-fluid interfaces is
   complex to assess and model, as many processes are in the regime where
   kinetics, diffusion and convection are comparable. Using the principle
   that the timescale for diffusion decreases with increasing curvature, we
   previously developed a micro-tensiometer to accurately measure
   fundamental transport coefficients via dynamic surface tension at
   spherical microscale liquid-fluid interfaces. In the present study, we
   use a low Reynolds number flow in the bulk solution to further increase
   the rate of diffusion. Dynamic surface tension is measured as a function
   of Peclet number and the results are compared with a simplified
   convection-diffusion model. Although a transition from diffusion to
   kinetic-limited transport is not observed experimentally for the
   surfactants considered, lower bounds on the adsorption and desorption
   rate constants are determined that are much larger than previously
   reported rate constants. The results show that the details of the flow
   field do not need to be controlled as long as the local Reynolds number
   is low. Aside from other pragmatic advantages, this experimental tool
   and analysis allows the governing mechanisms of surfactant transport at
   liquid-fluid interfaces to be quantified using flow near the interface
   to decrease the length scale for diffusion, separating the relevant
   timescales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Membrane Association of the PTEN Tumor Suppressor: Molecular Details of

   Reflection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{The structure and function of the PTEN phosphatase is investigated by
   studying its membrane affinity and localization on in-plane fluid,
   thermally disordered synthetic membrane models. The membrane association
   of the protein depends strongly on membrane composition, where
   phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol diphosphate
   (PI(4,5)P-2) act pronouncedly synergistic in pulling the enzyme to the
   membrane surface. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding
   of wild type (wt) PTEN to PS and PI(4,5)P-2 were determined to be K-d
   similar to 12 mu M and 0.4 mu M, respectively, and K-d similar to 50 nM
   if both lipids are present. Membrane affinities depend critically on
   membrane fluidity, which suggests multiple binding sites on the protein
   for PI(4,5)P-2. The PTEN mutations C124S and H93R show binding
   affinities that deviate strongly from those measured for the wt protein.
   Both mutants bind PS more strongly than wt PTEN. While C124S PTEN has at
   least the same affinity to PI(4,5)P-2 and an increased apparent affinity
   to PI(3,4,5) P-3, due to its lack of catalytic activity, H93R PTEN shows
   a decreased affinity to PI(4,5)P-2 and no synergy in its binding with PS
   and PI(4,5)P-2. Neutron reflection measurements show that the PTEN
   phosphatase ``scoots'' along the membrane surface (penetration <5
   angstrom) but binds the membrane tightly with its two major domains, the
   C2 and phosphatase domains, as suggested by the crystal structure. The
   regulatory C-terminal tail is most likely displaced from the membrane
   and organized on the far side of the protein similar to 60 angstrom away
   from the bilayer surface, in a rather compact structure. The combination
   of binding studies and neutron reflection allows us to distinguish
   between PTEN mutant proteins and ultimately may identify the structural
   features required for membrane binding and activation of PTEN.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a recently developed electron diffraction technique called
   diffraction scanning transmission electron microscopy (D-STEM) is
   coupled with precession electron microscopy to obtain quantitative local
   texture information in damascene copper interconnects (1.8 mu m-70 nm in
   width) with a spatial resolution of less than 5 nm. Misorientation and
   trace analysis is performed to investigate the grain boundary
   distribution in these lines. The results reveal strong variations in
   texture and grain boundary distribution of the copper lines upon
   downscaling. Lines of width 1.8 mu m exhibit a strong < 111 > normal
   texture and comprise large micron-size grains. Upon downscaling to 180
   nm, a \{111\} < 110 > bi-axial texture has been observed. In contrast,
   narrower lines of widths 120 and 70 nm reveal sidewall growth of \{111\}
   grains and a dominant < 110 > normal texture. The microstructure in
   these lines comprises clusters of small grains separated by high angle
   boundaries in the vicinity of large grains. The fraction of coherent
   twin boundaries also reduces with decreasing line width.}},

   experienced during bone drilling. The model incorporates the radially
   varying drill-bit geometry and cutting conditions analytically, while
   capturing the material and friction properties empirically through a
   specific energy formulation. The forces from the chisel edge are modeled
   by considering the indentation process that occurs in the vicinity of
   the drill-bit axis. A procedure is outlined to calibrate the specific
   energies, where only a small number of calibration experiments are
   required for a wide range of drilling conditions and drill-bit geometry.
   The calibration parameters for the cortical portions of bovine tibia are
   identified through drilling tests. Subsequently, a series of validation
   tests are conducted under different feed rates and spindle speeds. The
   thrust forces and torques were observed to vary considerably between
   bones from different animals. The forces from the model were seen to
   match well with those from the experimentation within the inherent
   variations from the bone characteristics. The model can be used to
   select favorable drilling conditions, to assist in robotic surgeries,
   and to design optimal orthopaedic drill bits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: Mismatches between pump output and venous return in a
   continuous-flow ventricular assist device may elicit episodes of
   ventricular suction. This research describes a series of in vitro
   experiments to characterize the operating conditions under which the
   EVAHEART centrifugal blood pump (Sun Medical Technology Research Corp.,
   Nagano, Japan) can be operated with minimal concern regarding left
   ventricular (LV) suction.
   Methods: The pump was interposed into a pneumatically driven pulsatile
   mock circulatory system (MCS) in the ventricular apex to aorta
   configuration. Under varying conditions of preload, afterload, and
   systolic pressure, the speed of the pump was increased step-wise until
   suction was observed. Identification of suction was based on pump inlet
   pressure.
   Results: In the case of reduced LV systolic pressure, reduced preload
   (<= 10 mmHg), and afterload (<= 60 mmHg), suction was observed for
   speeds >= 2,200 rpm. However, suction did not occur at any speed (up to
   a maximum speed of 2,400 rpm) when preload was kept within 10-14 mmHg
   and afterload >= 80 mmHg. Although in vitro experiments Cannot replace
   in vivo models, the results indicated that ventricular suction can be
   avoided if sufficient preload and afterload are maintained.
   Conclusion: Conditions of hypovolemia and/or hypotension may increase
   the risk of suction at the highest speeds, irrespective of the native
   ventricular systolic pressure. However, in vitro guidelines are not
   directly transferrable to the clinical situation; therefore,
   patient-specific evaluation is recommended, which can be aided by
   ultrasonography at various points in the course of support.}},

   (magnetic layer, carbon overcoat (COC), lubricant, and air bearing

   was measured through the thermal cycle of 50 degrees C-700 degrees C-300
   degrees C-800 degrees C-300 degrees C-900 degrees C-200 degrees C by
   vibrating sample magnetometry. In (Fe65Co35)(79.5+x)B13Nb4-xSi2Cu1.5
   alloys, the stability of the (Fe,Co,Nb)(23)B-6 (23-6) phase is increased
   with increasing Nb content. In the x = 4 alloy, (Fe,Nb)(2)B is the only
   secondary crystalline phase to form, demonstrating that Nb is necessary
   for the 23-6 phase to form. The (Fe65Co35)(83)B10Nb4Si2Cu1 alloy forms
   the 23-6 phase more readily than the x = 0 alloy, likely due to the

   Fe54.6Co29.4Si2.8(B0.8-YPY)(14)Nb1Cu1 (Y = 0, 0.2, and 0.3) alloys have

   subsequently annealed in an argon atmosphere to induce
   nanocrystallization. P addition increases primary crystallization
   temperature (Tx(1)), thermal stability (Delta Tx), and activation energy
   (Q(JMA)) for secondary crystallization in as-cast alloys. The saturation
   induction (B-s) of 1.68 T for as-cast P free alloy decreases
   continuously with the addition of P. However, the soft magnetic
   properties are enhanced for P added alloys. The XRD pattern reveals that
   grain refinement increases with increasing P contents. Alloys annealed
   at 430 degrees C confirm primary nanocrystallization of alpha-FeCo in
   the amorphous matrix, while annealing at 550 degrees C causes secondary
   crystallization of other non-magnetic phases as well. The magnetic
   moment of as-cast and annealed alloys, measured by vibrating sample
   magnetometry (VSM), has minimum values at two temperatures, labeled
   Tc-1, Tc-2, prior to secondary crystallization, corresponding to the
   ferromagnetic transitions of as-quenched amorphous and residual

Abstract = {{Superior electrical conductivity and thermo-mechanical response of
   graphene can significantly improve areal density in magnetic data
   storage. The current head media spacing in hard disk drives (HDD) is 7.2
   nm, and replacing conventional carbon overcoat (COC) with graphene will
   drastically reduce head media spacing, increasing areal density to eight
   times its present value. A paradigm shift in HDD systems can also be
   achieved via selection of a combination of new lubricants and
   unconventional architecture of COC systems. Here, we evaluate the
   feasibility of graphene overcoat (GOC), by understanding GOC-lubricant
   interactions. We further introduce new alternative head-disk interface
   (HDI) designs consisting of buffer/lubricant layers (i.e.,
   graphene/carbon nanotube (CNT) or fullerene/perfluoropolyether (PFPE)).
   These hybrids could further enhance tribological performance including
   the reduction of wear and friction while drastically increasing areal
   density of data storage devices. Our study here will lead to vigorous
   investigation of HDI in magnetic data storage, including heat-assisted
   magnetic recording (HAMR), with tuned atomistic design criteria. (C)

Abstract = {{Binary FePt films with compositions in the range of 42.4 to 54.0 at. \%
   Pt were sputter deposited at temperatures between 100 and 300 degrees C.
   Films deposited at 250 and 300 degrees C were fully L1(0) ordered,
   whereas films deposited between 100 and 200 degrees C were either A1 or
   a mixture of A1 and L1(0). Differential scanning calorimetry studies
   following deposition showed a bifurcation in the post-deposition
   formation characteristics of the L1(0) phase for films deposited between
   100 and 200 degrees C depending on film composition. For films with
   compositions >47 at. \% Pt, L1(0) formation kinetics were identical to
   those for room-temperature deposited films. In contrast, for films with
   <47 at. \% Pt, significantly higher temperatures were needed for full
   transformation to the L1(0) phase. Thus the choice of deposition
   temperature and film composition is critical to achieving fully L1(0)
   films during deposition. The Curie temperature of the L1(0) phase was
   not impacted by the deposition temperature. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{This study proposes a new resonant magnetic charger comprising circular
   spiral coils that operate with a strong coupling effect between the
   transmitter and the receiver. The two spiral coils are fitted with
   additional copper tapes to serve as resonant transmitter and receiver

   coupled mode theory. Analysis results show that the proposed system can
   dramatically improve the efficiency and extend the power transfer
   distance. Experiments have been carried out in order to verify the
   performance of the system. In particular, the trends of output voltages
   when either the operating frequencies or the transfer distances are
   changing are reported. The system efficiency obtained experimentally is
   also given. Both calculated and measured results are in good agreement.

Title = {{Fairness via Source Throttling: A Configurable and High-Performance
   Fairness Substrate for Multicore Memory Systems}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Cores in chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) share multiple memory subsystem
   resources. If resource sharing is unfair, some applications can be
   delayed significantly while others are unfairly prioritized. Previous
   research proposed separate fairness mechanisms for each resource. Such
   resource-based fairness mechanisms implemented independently in each
   resource can make contradictory decisions, leading to low fairness and
   performance loss. Therefore, a coordinated mechanism that provides
   fairness in the entire shared memory system is desirable.
   This article proposes a new approach that provides fairness in the
   entire shared memory system, thereby eliminating the need for and
   complexity of developing fairness mechanisms for each resource. Our
   technique, Fairness via Source Throttling (FST), estimates unfairness in
   the entire memory system. If unfairness is above a system-software-set
   threshold, FST throttles down cores causing unfairness by limiting the
   number of requests they create and the frequency at which they do. As
   such, our source-based fairness control ensures fairness decisions are
   made in tandem in the entire memory system. FST enforces thread
   priorities/weights, and enables system-software to enforce different
   fairness objectives in the memory system.
   Our evaluations show that FST provides the best system fairness and
   performance compared to three systems with state-of-the-art fairness
   mechanisms implemented in both shared caches and memory controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are increasingly being
   investigated for use in biomedical applications for intracellular
   imaging and ablation, as well as vehicles for drug and gene delivery.
   One major obstacle to the development of safe, controlled, and effective
   SWCNT-based biomedical materials is limited quantification of dosage-
   and time-dependent uptake kinetics, cellular effects, and recovery
   profiles. Here, we quantified NIH-3T3 cellular uptake of and recovery
   from individualized SWCNTs dispersed using a biocompatible dispersing
   agent, bovine serum albumin (BSA). Uptake and recovery were determined
   by monitoring the mass of SWCNTs-BSA per cell, as a function of
   SWCNTs-BSA over the concentration range of 1 to 100 mu g mL(-1) and time
   range of seconds to days. To determine SWCNTs-BSA biocompatibility as a
   function of uptake and recovery, cytotoxicity, proliferation potential,
   and cell phenotype were monitored for each condition, interestingly, the
   rate of cellular uptake of SWCNTs-BSA was rapid, reaching steady state
   within similar to 1 min, in agreement with modeling. We also observed a
   threshold SWCNT exposure level (>1 mu g mL(-1)) above which
   internalization is saturated and uptake scales linearly with exposure
   amount. Cells were able to recover from SWCNTs-BSA over similar to 30 h,
   regardless of dosage level or exposure time. We suggest that these
   differential rates of uptake and recovery, quantified in our work, may
   enable cell-based SWCNT delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the performance in vitro of 6 distal protection
   filters (DPFs) on the basis of filtration ability and effects on
   pressure gradient and vascular impedance in a flow model of the internal
   carotid artery (ICA).
   Methods: Six DPFs (Accunet, Angioguard, Filter Wire, Gore Embolic
   Filter, NAV6, and SpiderFX) were evaluated in a physiologically
   realistic flow loop. A blood analog was heated to body temperature and
   circulated by a pulsatile pump outputting a time-varying flow rate
   representative of the ICA. The ICA flow model was a highly curved tube
   representing a challenging site for filter deployment. The DPFs were
   deployed at the apex of the curved segment, and 2 sizes of microspheres
   (143 and 200 pm) were injected to simulate embolization. The capture
   efficiency, pressure gradient, normalized pressure gradient, and
   vascular impedance were calculated.
   Results:The Gore filter had high capture efficiency (143 mu m: 99.97\%;
   200 mu m: 100.00\%) with relatively small increases in pressure gradient
   (143 mu m: +27\%; 200 mu m: +20\%) and vascular impedance (143 mu m:
   +23.4\%; 200 mu m: +6.1\%) after particles were injected. Spider had the
   lowest capture efficiency (143 mu m: 1.50\%; 200 mu m: 19.34\%,
   p<0.0005), while NAV6 (143 mu m: +916\%, p<0.0005) and Accunet (200 mu
   m: +179\%, p<0.0005) yielded the largest pressure gradient increases.
   Conclusion: A bench-top flow apparatus exhibiting physiologically
   realistic conditions was developed by combining pulsatile flow and a
   body temperature blood analog. Using microspheres larger than the pore
   size of most of the DPFs, the device-wall apposition has an important
   effect on the overall filter performance and the global fluid dynamics
   in the flow model. J Endovasc Ther. 2012;79:249-260}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based design optimization was applied
   to achieve the finalized design of the PediaFlow (R) PF4, a magnetically
   levitated rotodynamic pediatric ventricular assist device. It features a
   streamlined blood-flow path with a single annular fluid passage between
   the rotor and the stationary housing. The resulting impeller is composed
   of a first-stage mixed-flow section having four blades at the conical
   nose region followed by a second-stage fully axial-flow section with
   three blades within the annular gap region. A stator with three
   inwardly-directed vanes is provided at the conical tail region to
   recover pressure and straighten the flow. CFD predictions of head and
   efficiency characteristics agreed remarkably well with the validation
   experimental data: with overprediction of head by < 7 mmHg over the
   entire operational range and a slight overprediction in best efficiency
   by similar to 1\%. The new optimized PF4 extended the maximum flow range
   of the previous PF3 device by more than 100\% to over 2.3 liter per
   minute (LPM) for the same range of operating speeds, and doubled the
   maximum hydraulic efficiency to similar to 27\%. Evaluation of hemolysis
   was performed by a Lagrangian particle-tracking technique with analysis
   of regional contributions to the overall blood damage. The simulation
   revealed that hemolysis increases with an increase in both the flow rate
   and rotor speed but not necessarily with just an increase in flow rate
   at a constant rotor speed. At the flow rate of 1.0 LPM and a head of 138
   mmHg, PF4 has a hemolysis index of 0.0032 compared to 0.0058 produced by
   PF3 at the same flow rate with a head of 48 mmHg. Numerical simulation
   of radial fluid forces performed by the CFD model with an eccentric
   rotor revealed the presence of negative fluid stiffness that was
   monotonically related to both flow and speed. Finally, conjugate heat
   transfer analysis predicted temperature rise adjacent to the motor to be
   inversely proportional to the length, but not exceeding similar to 2
   degrees C over the intended range of operation. In conclusion, CFD-based
   design optimization greatly expedited and facilitated the completion of
   the PediaFlow (R) flow path and contributed to the system-wide

Abstract = {{Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) provides a framework that allows one to
   incorporate both frequent and infrequent observations easily because it
   uses a window of past measurements, where the slower ones can be
   introduced as they become available. Also, MHE allows for the use of
   constraints on the state estimates, which improves the performance of
   the estimator.
   Here we propose the use of a variable structure MHE that can handle
   multi-rate measurements. Furthermore, we propose a novel strategy for
   updating the smoothed covariance matrix of the arrival cost based on
   Nonlinear Programming (NLP) sensitivity. For this we show the
   relationship that exists between the covariance and the reduced Hessian
   of the NLP. Moreover, we propose a fast strategy for extracting the
   reduced Hessian information directly from the linearized optimality
   conditions used in Interior Point solvers such as IPOPT. The proposed
   methodology is illustrated using benchmark examples from the literature.

Abstract = {{A comprehensive model is proposed that can be used to select a proper
   conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) probe for use in stable
   scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) operation. This type of operation
   mode could be useful for scanning and patterning heterogeneous surfaces
   with both conductive and insulating parts using electrical principles in
   a non-contact fashion. The model includes elastic contact deformation,
   intermolecular forces, electrostatic attraction and tunnelling current
   generation between the tip and the sample and the snap-into contact
   criterion of the probe. Using the model, snap-into contact distances of
   the probes with varying stiffness values under different bias voltages
   are found, and is verified with experiments. It is shown that, for a
   given sample and tip materials, an optimal bias voltage for STM
   operation with CAFM cantilevers exists. The results also show that, to
   successfully utilise CAFM probes as STM end-effectors, there is a
   minimum normal stiffness limit for a given bias voltage. For operation
   on metal surfaces using metal-coated probes with tip radius values
   smaller than 50 nm, the model predicts that probes with high stiffness
   values (>24 N/m) enable both STM and AFM operations reliably with
   potential resolution reduction in AFM force sensing. The model also
   implies that probes with longer tips are better for minimising the
   electrostatic attraction between the cantilever and the substrate. The
   model would help researchers to select proper CAFM probes, which could
   enable simultaneous AFM and STM imaging and manipulation capabilities
   for tip-based nanofabrication applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this Letter, a combination of conductive atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) with a compliant
   cantilever is used to electrically probe oxidised TiO2-x nanostructures
   in situ. In STM mode, both the written width and the effective
   resistivity of material in the written line increase with write bias. At
   low writing voltages (similar to 3.5 V), the STM written lines are
   narrow (30 nm), but they are not resistive enough to allow patterns with
   a 1-2 mu m perimeter to provide electrical isolation above 10 M Omega.
   Raising the bias to 8.5 V during writing allows similar structures to
   provide isolation of better than 250 M Omega. The resistivity in the
   lines written at the latter with high bias is 28 Omega m. From
   electrical estimates, the oxidation appears to go through the thickness
   at all voltages, but is more chemically incomplete (larger value of x)
   at low voltage. The data are not consistent, with a small amount of
   metallic Ti remaining under the written mark, that is, partial
   penetration of the oxidation. The thickness of this Ti layer would have
   to be unphysically small (1 million times smaller than an atomic layer
   thickness) to allow this interpretation.}},

Title = {{PCE dissolution and simultaneous dechlorination by nanoscale zero-valent

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{While the capability of nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) to
   dechlorinate organic compounds in aqueous solutions has been
   demonstrated, the ability of NZVI to remove dense non-aqueous phase
   liquid (DNAPL) from source zones under flow-through conditions similar
   to a field scale application has not yet been thoroughly investigated.
   To gain insight on simultaneous DNAPL dissolution and NZVI-mediated
   dechlorination reactions after direct placement of NZVI into a DNAPL
   source zone, a combined experimental and modeling study was performed.
   First, a DNAPL tetrachloroethene (PCE) source zone with emplaced NZVI
   was built inside a small custom-made flow cell and the effluent PCE and
   dechlorination byproducts were monitored over time. Second, a model for
   rate-limited DNAPL dissolution and NZVI-mediated dechlorination of PCE
   to its three main reaction byproducts with a possibility for
   partitioning of these byproducts back into the DNAPL was formulated. The
   coupled processes occurring in I he flow cell were simulated and
   analyzed using a detailed three-dimensional numerical model. It was
   found that subsurface emplacement of NZVI did not markedly accelerate
   DNAPL dissolution or the DNAPL mass-depletion rate, when NZVI at a
   particle concentration of 10 g/L was directly emplaced in the DNAPL
   source zone. To react with NZVI the DNAPL PCE must first dissolve into
   the groundwater and the rate of dissolution controls the longevity of
   the DNAPL source. The modeling study further indicated that faster
   reacting particles would decrease aqueous contaminant concentrations but
   there is a limit to how much the mass removal rate can be increased by
   increasing the dechlorination reaction rate. To ensure reduction of
   aqueous contaminant concentrations, remediation of DNAPL contaminants
   with NZVI should include emplacement in a capture zone down-gradient of
   the DNAPL source. (C) 2011 Elsevier RV. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Passivity is an important property of circuits and systems to guarantee
   stable global simulation. Nonetheless, non-passive models may result
   from passive underlying structures due to numerical or measurement
   error/inaccuracy. A postprocessing passivity enforcement algorithm is
   therefore desirable to perturb the model to be passive under a
   controlled error. However, previous literature only reports such
   passivity enforcement algorithms for pole-residue models and regular
   systems (RSs). In this paper, passivity enforcement algorithms for
   descriptor systems (DSs, a superset of RSs) with possibly singular
   direct term (specifically, D+D-T or I-DDT) are proposed. The proposed
   algorithms cover all kinds of state-space models (RSs or DSs, with
   direct terms being singular or nonsingular, in the immittance or
   scattering representation) and thus have a much wider application scope
   than existing algorithms. The passivity enforcement is reduced to two
   standard optimization problems that can be solved efficiently. The
   objective functions in both optimization problems are the error
   functions, hence perturbed models with adequate accuracy can be
   obtained. Numerical examples then verify the efficiency and robustness
   of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops autonomous manipulation strategies for a mobile
   untethered microrobot that operates on a 2-D surface in a fluidic
   environment. The microrobot, which is a permanent magnet, is under 500
   mu m in all dimensions and is actuated by oscillating external magnetic
   fields. Two types of manipulations are considered: 1) front pushing,
   where the microrobot pushes a micro-object by direct contact; and 2)
   side pushing, which can result in noncontact pushing, where the fluid
   flow fields that are generated by a translating microrobot are used to
   displace a micro-object. Physical models are provided to estimate the
   displacement of the micro-object due to the fluid motion. Model-based
   controllers to perform contact and noncontact manipulation are proposed,
   which iteratively correct emerging manipulation behaviors to improve
   performance. It is found that using a model-based solution as a
   feed-forward input, which is combined with a learning controller, can
   significantly improve micro-object pushing performance. Finally, we
   begin to address the problem to assemble two micro-objects together
   using the microrobot, which is only successful by using a side-pushing
   method.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty and Variability in Product Carbon Footprinting Case Study of
   a Server}},

Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen increasing interest in life cycle greenhouse gas
   emissions accounting, also known as carbon footprinting, due to drivers
   such as transportation fuels policy and climate-related eco-labels,
   sometimes called carbon labels. However, it remains unclear whether
   applications of greenhouse gas accounting, such as carbon labels, are
   supportable given the level of precision that is possible with current
   methodology and data. The goal of this work is to further the
   understanding of quantitative uncertainty assessment in carbon
   footprinting through a case study of a rackmount electronic server.
   Production phase uncertainty was found to be moderate (+/-15\%), though
   with a high likelihood of being significantly underestimated given the
   limitations in available data for assessing uncertainty associated with
   temporal variability and technological specificity. Individual
   components or subassemblies showed varying levels of uncertainty due to
   differences in parameter uncertainty (i.e., agreement between data sets)
   and variability between production or use regions. The use phase
   displayed a considerably higher uncertainty (+/-50\%) than production
   due to uncertainty in the useful lifetime of the server, variability in
   electricity mixes in different market regions, and use profile
   uncertainty. Overall model uncertainty was found to be +/-35\% for the
   whole life cycle, a substantial amount given that the method is already
   being used to set policy and make comparative environmental product
   declarations. Future work should continue to combine the increasing
   volume of available data to ensure consistency and maximize the
   credibility of the methods of life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon
   footprinting. However, for some energy-using products it may make more
   sense to increase focus on energy efficiency and use phase emissions
   reductions rather than attempting to quantify and reduce the uncertainty
   of the relatively small production phase.}},

Abstract = {{We study a simple, yet unconventional approach to the global

   Non-convexity of the sum of least-squares objective in parameter
   estimation problems may often lead to the presence of multiple local

   global optimization and experiment with one of its implementations,
   BARON (Sahinidis in J. Glob. Optim. 8(2):201-205, 1996), to solve
   parameter estimation problems. Through the explicit use of first-order
   optimality conditions, we are able to significantly expedite convergence
   to global optimality by strengthening the relaxation of the
   lower-bounding problem that forms a crucial part of the spatial
   branch-and-bound technique. We analyze the results obtained from 69 test
   cases taken from the statistics literature and discuss the successes and
   limitations of the proposed idea. In addition, we discuss software
   implementation for the automation of our strategy.}},

Journal = {{INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{124-129}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Individuals' decisions and behaviour can play a critical role in
   determining both the probability and severity of injury. Behavioural
   decision research studies peoples' decision-making processes in terms
   comparable to scientific models of optimal choices, providing a basis
   for focusing interventions on the most critical opportunities to reduce
   risks. That research often seeks to identify the `mental models' that
   underlie individuals' interpretations of their circumstances and the
   outcomes of possible actions. In the context of injury prevention, a
   mental models approach would ask why people fail to see risks, do not
   make use of available protective interventions or misjudge the
   effectiveness of protective measures. If these misunderstandings can be
   reduced through context-appropriate risk communications, then their
   improved mental models may help people to engage more effectively in
   behaviours that they judge to be in their own best interest. If that
   proves impossible, then people may need specific instructions, not
   trusting to intuition or even paternalistic protection against
   situations that they cannot sufficiently control. The method entails
   working with domain specialists to elicit and create an expert model of
   the risk situation, interviewing lay people to elicit their comparable
   mental models, and developing and evaluating communication interventions
   designed to close the gaps between lay people and experts. This paper
   reviews the theory and method behind this research stream and uses
   examples to discuss how the approach can be used to develop
   scientifically validated context-sensitive injury risk communications.}},

Abstract = {{Kinesin-5 is an essential mitotic motor. However, how its
   spatial-temporal distribution is regulated in mitosis remains poorly
   understood. We expressed localization and affinity purification-tagged
   Eg5 from a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (this construct was
   called mEg5) and found its distribution to be tightly regulated
   throughout mitosis. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis
   showed rapid Eg5 turnover throughout mitosis, which cannot be accounted
   for by microtubule turnover. Total internal reflection fluorescence
   microscopy and high-resolution, single-particle tracking revealed that
   mEg5 punctae on both astral and midzone microtubules rapidly bind and
   unbind. mEg5 punctae on midzone microtubules moved transiently both
   toward and away from spindle poles. In contrast, mEg5 punctae on astral
   microtubules moved transiently toward microtubule minus ends during
   early mitosis but switched to plus end-directed motion during anaphase.
   These observations explain the poleward accumulation of Eg5 in early
   mitosis and its redistribution in anaphase. Inhibition of dynein blocked
   mEg5 movement on astral microtubules, whereas depletion of the
   Eg5-binding protein TPX2 resulted in plus end-directed mEg5 movement.
   However, motion of Eg5 on midzone microtubules was not altered. Our
   results reveal differential and precise spatial and temporal regulation
   of Eg5 in the spindle mediated by dynein and TPX2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an in-depth analysis on face shape alignment for
   pose insensitive face recognition. The dissimilarity between two face
   images can be modeled as the difference in intensity between these two
   images, obtained by warping these faces onto the same shape. In order to
   achieve this, we must first align both face images independently to
   obtain a sparse 2-D shape representation. We achieve this by using a
   Combination of ASMs and AAMs (CASAAMs). We then exchange these two
   shapes and obtain new intensity (texture) faces based on these exchanged
   shapes. This allows us to align the two faces with increased pixel-level
   correspondence while simultaneously achieving a certain degree of pose
   correction. In order to account for large pose variation, it becomes
   necessary to model the underlying 3-D face structure for the synthesis
   of novel 2-D poses. However, in many real-world scenarios, only a single
   image of the subject is provided and acquisition of the 3-D model is not
   always feasible. To tackle this common real-world scenario, we propose a
   novel approach for modeling faces, called 3D Generic Elastic Model
   (3D-GEM), which can be deformed from a single 2-D image. Our analysis
   shows that 3-D depth information of human faces does not dramatically
   change across people, indicating that precise depth information of a
   person is not needed to generate useful novel 2-D poses. This is a
   significant discovery that makes our method feasible. We thus
   demonstrate that our 3-D face model can be efficiently produced by using
   a generic depth model which can be elastically deformed based on input
   facial features. This face model can then be rotated in 3-D in order to
   synthesize any arbitrary 2-D facial pose. Experimental results show that
   3-D faces modeled by our proposed work effectively handle large 3-D pose
   changes in face alignment and they can be used for achieving pose
   tolerant face recognition. We also provide comparative results of face
   synthesis obtained by an actual 3-D face scanner and our approach,
   showing our proposed modeling approach is both effective and efficient.}},

   and no node has access to the entire matrix A at any time. We consider
   two scenarios in which either the columns or the rows of A are
   distributed among the compute nodes. Our algorithm, named D-ADMM, is a

Abstract = {{This research tests people's support for the wait-and-see approach in
   climate change due to the uncertainty in both the timing and probability
   of future consequences. In a laboratory experiment, carbon-tax
   consequences were presented to participants in one of two forms: a
   written description, where the probability, consequences, and timing
   were explicitly provided; and experience, where the probability,
   consequences, and timing were sampled through unlabeled buttons. Four
   problems were presented in each condition such that the probability of
   consequences was high or low and the timing was early or late. Results
   indicated that the proportion of wait-and-see choices was greater in
   experience than description. Furthermore, in both experience and
   description, the proportion of wait-and-see choices was greater when the
   probability was low rather than high. The difference in the proportion
   of wait-and-see choices between the low and high probability was
   amplified in experience and attenuated in description. Finally, there
   was no difference in the proportion of wait-and-see choices when the
   timing of climate consequences was early rather than late in both
   experience and description. These results are explained by people's risk
   and time preferences. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly is a phenomenon broadly observed in nature where a vast
   number of various molecules spontaneously synthesize complex structures.
   In this article, prompted by the need for the realization of highly
   autonomous self-assembly systems that employ magnetism as a driving
   force, we discuss fundamental issues associated with magnetically driven
   self-assembly systems. We first introduce some examples from our case
   studies, in which the models all subscribe to a distributed approach,
   and thus lack central control. Then we categorize them by their type of
   magnetic attachment. The issues discussed include several fundamental
   properties, such as the effect of morphology, stochasticity, the
   difference between two-dimensional models and three-dimensional models,
   emergence, allostericity, and parallelism. The conclusions obtained
   support our stance that the appropriate morphology lightens the control
   cost for the assembly, providing primal but engaging instances of
   magnetic self-assembly systems that warrant further study.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework to generate alternative mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming formulations for disjunctive convex programs that lead to
   stronger relaxations. We extend the concept of ``basic steps{''} defined
   for disjunctive linear programs to the nonlinear case. A basic step is
   an operation that takes a disjunctive set to another with fewer number
   of conjuncts. We show that the strength of the relaxations increases as
   the number of conjuncts decreases, leading to a hierarchy of
   relaxations. We prove that the tightest of these relaxations, allows in
   theory the solution of the disjunctive convex program as a nonlinear
   programming problem. We present a methodology to guide the generation of
   strong relaxations without incurring an exponential increase of the size
   of the reformulated mixed-integer program. Finally, we apply the theory
   developed to improve the computational efficiency of solution methods
   for nonlinear convex generalized disjunctive programs (GDP). This
   methodology is validated through a set of numerical examples. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The xFe(2)TiO(4)-(1-x)Fe3O4 pseudo-binary systems (0 <= x <= 1) of
   ulvospinel component were synthesized by solid-state reaction between
   ulvospinel Fe2TiO4 precursors and commercial Fe3O4 powders in
   stochiometric proportions. Crystalline structures were determined by
   X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and it was found that the as-obtained
   titanomagnetites maintain an inverse spinel structure. The lattice
   parameter a of synthesized titanomagnetite increases linearly with the
   increase in the ulvospinel component. Fe-57 room temperature Mossbauer
   spectra were employed to evaluate the magnetic properties and cation
   distribution. The hyperfine magnetic field is observed to decrease with
   increasing Fe2TiO4 component. The fraction of Fe2+ in both tetrahedral
   and octahedral sites increases with the increase in Ti4+ content, due to
   the substitution and reduction of Fe3+ by Ti4+ that maintains the charge
   balance in the spinel structure. For x in the range of 0 <= x <= 0.4,
   the solid solution is ferrimagnetic at room temperature. However, it
   shows weak ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic behavior for x in the range of
   0.4 < x <= 0.7. When x > 0.70, it only shows paramagnetic behavior, with
   the appearance of quadrupole doublets in the Mossbauer spectra.
   Simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric
   analysis (DSC-TGA) studies showed that magnetite is not stable, and
   thermal decomposition of magnetite occurs with weight losses
   accompanying with exothermic processes under heat treatment in inert
   atmosphere. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gecko-inspired angled elastomer micropillars with flat or round tip
   endings are presented as compliant pick-and-place micromanipulators. The
   pillars are 35 mu m in diameter, 90 mu m tall, and angled at an
   inclination of 20. By gently pressing the tip of a pillar to a part, the
   pillar adheres to it through intermolecular forces. Next, by retracting
   quickly, the part is picked from a given donor substrate. During
   transferring, the adhesion between the pillar and the part is high
   enough to withstand disturbances due to external forces or the weight of
   the part. During release of the part onto a receiver substrate, the
   contact area of the pillar to the part is drastically reduced by
   controlled vertical or shear displacement, which results in reduced
   adhesive forces. The maximum repeatable ratio of pick-to-release
   adhesive forces is measured as 39 to 1. It is found that a flat tip
   shape and shear displacement control provide a higher pick-to-release
   adhesion ratio than a round tip and vertical displacement control,
   respectively. A model of forces to serve as a framework for the
   operation of this micromanipulator is presented. Finally, demonstrations
   of pick-and-place manipulation of micrometer-scale silicon
   microplatelets and a centimeter-scale glass cover slip serve as proofs
   of the concept. The compliant polymer micropillars are safe for use with
   fragile parts, and, due to exploiting intermolecular forces, could be
   effective on most materials and in air, vacuum, and liquid environments.}},

   various times during an exposure period by electrochemical polarization
   resistance measurements using a three-electrode system. The average
   corrosion rates (ACR) were also determined by the gravimetric weight
   loss method to correlate with the ICR data. Stainless steel was used as
   the reference electrode to replace the standard saturated calomel
   electrode for increased robustness of the system in pilot-scale cooling
   systems. A side-streamflow channel unit was designed to hold the three
   electrodes in flowing cooling water. Use of stainless steel as a
   reference electrode was reliable and ICR was monitored intermittently
   for 28 days. Integration of the ICR data from the pilot-scale cooling
   towers correlated well with the ACR results, with similar correlation
   coefficients obtained from bench-scale experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is part 1 of a series dealing with the design of integrated
   interplant water-allocation and heat-exchange networks (IWAHENs), a
   special case of interplant network synthesis with multiple physical
   properties. Traditionally, the tasks of optimizing water-allocation
   networks (WANs) and heat exchange networks (HENs) were either performed
   individually or studied within a single plant. In this paper, a novel
   multiscale state-space superstructure is developed to capture all
   possible network configurations for the fixed flow rate (FF) IWAHEN
   designs with both direct and indirect integration schemes. In addition,
   our model has been simplified to deal with the interplant HEN design
   where the optimal utility network can be determined simultaneously. By
   properly addressing the interactions between different plants as well as
   the WAN and HEN subsystems, lower total annualized cost (TAC) can be
   obtained in all examples by solving the corresponding mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming (MINLP) model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the cost of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) for
   natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. Existing studies employ
   a broad range of assumptions and lack a consistent costing method. This
   study takes a more systematic approach to analyze plants with an
   amine-based postcombustion CCS system with 90\% CO2 capture. We employ
   sensitivity analyses together with a probabilistic analysis to quantify
   costs for plants with and without CCS under uncertainty or variability
   in key parameters. Results for new baseload plants indicate a likely
   increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of \$20-32/MWh
   (constant 2007\$) or \$22-40/MWh in current dollars. A risk premium for
   plants with CCS increases these ranges to \$23-39/MWh and \$25-46/MWh,
   respectively. Based on current cost estimates, our analysis further
   shows that a policy to encourage CCS at new NGCC plants via an emission
   tax or carbon price requires (at 95\% confidence) a price of at least
   \$125/t CO2 to ensure NGCC-CCS is cheaper than a plant without CCS.
   Higher costs are found for nonbaseload plants and CCS retrofits.}},

Title = {{In-situ and ex-situ characterization of TiO2 and Au nanoparticle
   incorporated TiO2 thin films for optical gas sensing at extreme
   temperatures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Sensor technologies that can operate under extreme conditions including
   high temperatures, high pressures, highly reducing and oxidizing
   environments, and corrosive gases are needed for process monitoring and
   control in advanced fossil energy applications. Sensor technologies
   based on optical waveguide-based techniques are highly attractive for
   passive, embedded, and remote sensing. A critical enabling technology
   for optical waveguide sensors is the development of advanced optical
   thin film coatings which have a desired set of optical properties that
   change in a rapid, selective, and sensitive manner to a particular
   quantity of interest. TiO2 and Au nanoparticle incorporated TiO2
   nanocomposite thin films were prepared through sol-gel deposition
   techniques and their respective optical responses to a 4\% H-2/N-2
   mixture were investigated in the visible / near-IR range of 400-1000 nm.
   A tendency for Au nanoparticles to occupy special sites on the TiO2
   microstructure, such as grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and triple
   points is rationalized in terms of basic surface energy arguments. The
   Au / TiO2 nanocomposite films showed a useful optical response due to a
   reversible, rapid, and repeatable shift in the localized surface plasma
   resonance peak of Au nanoparticles at a temperature of 650 degrees C and
   850 degrees C. In contrast, high temperature exposure of TiO2 films to
   reducing gases at 850 degrees C resulted in the growth of abnormally
   large grains or ``hillocks{''} that protruded from the sample surface
   and resulted in light scattering and an irreversible decrease in
   transmission at short wavelengths. The origin of the observed optical
   response of Au / TiO2 nanocomposite films is discussed in the context of
   work by prior investigators in the Au / yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ)
   system and needs for future research in this area is highlighted. (C)

   finite element mesh successfully predicted the activation of twin
   variants consisting of the highest RSS and the second-highest RSS. The
   MB-CPFEM demonstrated that local fluctuation of the stress field induces

Abstract = {{Polymer coatings on nano-sized remediation agents and subsurface
   heterogeneity will affect their transport, likely in a pH-dependent
   manner. The effect of pH on the aggregation of polymer-coated nanoscale
   zerovalent iron (nZVI) and its deposition onto sand and clay (kaolinite)
   surfaces was studied. nZVI coatings included a high molecular weight (90
   kg/mol) strong polyanion, poly(methacrylic acid)-b-(methy
   methacrylate)-b-(styrenesulfonate) (PMAA-PMMA-PSS) and a low molecular
   weight (2.5 kg/mol) weak polyanion, polyaspartate. Aggregation and
   deposition increased with decreasing pH for both polyelectrolytes. The
   extent was greater for the low MW polyaspartate coated nZVI. Enhanced
   deposition at lower pH was indicated because the elutability of
   polyaspartate-modified hematite (which did not aggregate) also decreased
   at lower pH. The greater deposition onto clay minerals compared to
   similar sized silica fines is attributed to charge heterogeneity on clay
   mineral surfaces, which is sensitive to pH. Heteroaggregation between
   kaolinite particles and nZVI over the pH range 6-8 confirmed this
   assertion. Excess unadsorbed polyelectrolyte in solution (100 mg/L)
   enhanced the transport of modified nZVI by minimizing aggregation and
   deposition onto sand and clay. These results indicate that site physical
   and chemical heterogeneity must be considered when designing an nZVI
   emplacement strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neutron reflection was used to characterize the adsorbed layer structure
   for lysozyme conjugated at the N-terminus with a single perdeuterated
   methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain at the silica/water interface.
   Adsorbed layers were produced with two different surface concentrations
   corresponding to opposite sides of a pronounced transition in the
   adsorption isotherm for mono-PEGylated lysozyme. The transition was
   previously ascribed, on the basis of less direct characterization by
   normal force measurements, to a change in the distribution of the
   conjugated PEG chain segments in the interfacial region in response to
   lateral repulsions (S.M. Daly, T.M. Przybycien, R.D. Tilton, Langmuir 21
   (2005) 1328-1337). Neutron reflectivity was measured for both surface
   concentrations using three different sets of neutron scattering length
   density contrast conditions, and models for the distribution of PEG and
   lysozyme content in the layers were obtained by simultaneous regression
   of all contrast condition data sets. This analysis indicated that the
   surface proximal volume is occupied almost equally by PEG and lysozyme
   at the low surface concentration, while at the higher surface
   concentration PEG is preferentially shifted away from the surface, with
   all lysozyme remaining in the surface proximal region. The distal
   regions of the high surface concentration layer contain only PEG,
   consistent with the previous interpretation of normal force
   measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is anticipated that the next generation of computational epidemic
   models will simulate both infectious disease transmission and dynamic
   human behaviour change. Individual agents within a simulation will not
   only infect one another, but will also have situational awareness and a
   decision algorithm that enables them to modify their behaviour. This
   paper develops such a model of behavioural response, presenting a
   mathematical interpretation of a well-known psychological model of
   individual decision making, the health belief model, suitable for
   incorporation within an agent-based disease-transmission model. We
   formalize the health belief model and demonstrate its application in
   modelling the prevalence of facemask use observed over the course of the
   2003 Hong Kong SARS epidemic, a well-documented example of behaviour
   change in response to a disease outbreak.}},

   Microstructures}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{The (relative) energies of symmetric tilt grain boundaries in a strongly
   segregated lamellar block copolymer are determined by analysis of the
   dihedral angles at grain-boundary triple junctions. The analysis reveals
   two regimes: at low and intermediate misorientations (corresponding to a
   tilt-angle range 0 <= theta <= 85 degrees) the grain-boundary energy is
   found to depend on the tilt angle as E(theta) similar to theta(x), with
   2.5 > x >= 0. At large misorientations the grain-boundary energy is
   found to be independent (within the experimental uncertainty) of the
   angle of tilt. The transition between the two scaling regimes is
   accompanied by the transition of the grain-boundary structure from the
   chevron to the omega morphology. Grain-boundary energy and frequency are
   found to be inversely related, thus suggesting boundary energy to be an
   important parameter during grain coarsening in block-copolymer
   microstructures, as it is in inorganic polycrystalline microstructures.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{171-184}},

Abstract = {{Power-intensive processes can lower operating expenses when adjusting
   production planning according to time-dependent electricity pricing
   schemes. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time, deterministic MILP
   model that allows optimal production planning for continuous
   power-intensive processes. We emphasize the systematic modeling of
   operational transitions, that result from switching the operating modes
   of the plant equipment, with logic constraints. We prove properties on
   the tightness of several logic constraints. For the time horizon of 1
   week and hourly changing electricity prices, we solve an industrial case
   study on air separation plants, where transitional modes help us capture
   ramping behavior. We also solve problem instances on cement plants where
   we show that the appropriate choice of operating modes allows us to
   obtain practical schedules, while limiting the number of changeovers.
   Despite the large size of the MILPs, the required solution times are
   small due to the explicit modeling of transitions. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Correlations between altered nuclear shape and disease are empirically
   observed, but the causes of nuclear dysmorphisms are poorly understood.
   The nucleoskeleton, which provides the majority of the mechanical
   stability of the nucleus, is composed primarily of intermediate
   filaments of lamin proteins and forms a mostly-planar network between
   the inner nuclear membrane and chromatin. It is unclear if blebs and
   larger scale changes in nuclear morphology are consequences of
   reorganization of the nucleoskeleton alone or of other cellular
   processes. To test this, we computationally recapitulate the lamina
   network using a mechanical network model created as a network of Hookean
   springs. A- and B-type lamin filaments were distributed over a spherical
   surface into distinct networks linked to one another by lamin-associated
   proteins. Iterative force-based adjustment of the network structure,
   together with a stochastically modified Bell model of bond breakage and
   formation, simulates nucleoskeleton reorganization with blebs. The rate
   of bleb retraction into the nucleus depends on both initial size of the
   bleb and number of networks being deformed. Our results show that
   induced blebs are more stable when only one filament component is
   deformed or when the networks have no interconnections. Also, the
   kinetics of retraction is influenced by the composition of the bleb.
   These results match with our experiments and others.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{900-914}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an approach to the optimization of the nonlinear
   component of a physiologically motivated feature extraction system for
   automatic speech recognition. Most computational models of the
   peripheral auditory system include a sigmoidal nonlinear function that
   relates the log of signal intensity to output level, which we represent
   by a set of frequency dependent logistic functions. The parameters of
   these rate-level functions are estimated to maximize the a posteriori
   probability of the correct class in training data. The performance of
   this approach was verified by the results of a series of experiments
   conducted with the CMU S phinx-III speech recognition system on the
   DARPA Resource Management, Wall Street Journal databases, and on the
   AURORA 2 database. In general, it was shown that feature extraction that
   incorporates the learned rate-nonlinearity, combined with a
   complementary loudness compensation function, results in better
   recognition accuracy in the presence of background noise than
   traditional MFCC feature extraction without the optimized nonlinearity
   when the system is trained on clean speech and tested in noise. We also
   describe the use of lattice structure that constraints the training
   process, enabling training with much more complicated acoustic models.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},

Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{580-590}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although the benefits of distributed cogeneration are widely cited,
   adoption has been slow in the United States. Adoption could be
   encouraged by making cogeneration more economically attractive, either
   by increasing the expected returns or decreasing the risks of such
   investments. We evaluate the expected returns from demand response,
   capacity markets, regulation markets, accelerated depreciation, pricing
   CO2 emissions, and net metering. We find that (1) there is an incentive
   to overcommit in the capacity market due to lenient non-response
   penalties, (2) there is significant revenue potential in the regulation
   market, though demand-side resources are yet to participate, (3) a price
   on CO2 emissions will make cogeneration more attractive relative to
   conventional, utility-supplied energy, and (4) accelerated depreciation
   is an easy and effective mechanism for improving the economics of
   cogeneration. We go on to argue that uncertainty in fuel and electricity
   prices present a significant risk to cogeneration projects, and we
   evaluate the effectiveness of feed-in tariffs at mitigating these risks.
   We find that guaranteeing a fixed electricity payment is not effective.
   A two-part feed-in tariff, with an annual capacity payment and an energy
   payment that adjusts with fuel costs, can eliminate energy-price risks.

Abstract = {{The recording performance of data-storage devices, in which write/read
   elements move relative to a storage medium to reliably store and
   retrieve information, depends on the capability of servo mechanisms to
   provide the necessary positioning accuracy. The desired characteristics
   of servo mechanisms for data-storage systems include robustness against
   variations of environmental parameters, high resolution, accuracy,
   stability, and fast response. This paper presents a comprehensive
   overview of advanced servo-control methods for data storage. The
   applications are to well-established recording technologies, including
   magnetic tape and magnetic disk systems as well as CD/DVD/Blue-Ray
   optical data-storage systems. Moreover, newer holographic and near-field
   optical systems and the emerging probe-storage technology are also
   addressed. Emphasis is given to the potential exhibited by the
   technologies considered for achieving ultra-high storage capacity, as
   required by the exploding demand in data-storage capacity for archival
   systems and massive multimedia data storage.}},

Title = {{Chemical and Engineering Approaches To Enable Organic Field-Effect
   Transistors for Electronic Skin Applications}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Skin is the body's largest organ and is responsible for the transduction
   of a vast amount of information. This conformable material
   simultaneously collects signals from external stimuli that translate
   into information such as pressure, pain, and temperature. The
   development of an electronic material, inspired by the complexity of
   this organ is a tremendous, unrealized engineering challenge. However,
   the advent of carbon-based electronics may offer a potential solution to
   this long-standing problem.
   In this Account, we describe the use of an organic field-effect
   transistor (OFET) architecture to transduce mechanical and chemical
   stimuli Into electrical signals. In developing this mimic of human skin,
   we thought of the sensory elements of the OFET as analogous to the
   various layers and constituents of skin. In this fashion, each layer of
   the OFET can be optimized to carry out a specific recognition function.
   The separation of multimodal sensing among the components of the OFET
   may be considered a ``divide and conquer{''} approach, where the
   electronic skin (e-skin) can take advantage of the optimized chemistry
   and materials properties of each layer.
   This design of a novel microstructured gate dielectric has led to
   unprecedented sensitivity for tactile pressure events. Typically,
   pressure-sensitive components within electronic configurations have
   suffered from a lack of sensitivity or long mechanical relaxation times
   often associated with elastomeric materials. Within our method, these
   components are directly compatible with OFETs and have achieved the
   highest reported sensitivity to date. Moreover, the tactile sensors
   operate on a time scale comparable with human skin, making them ideal
   candidates for integration as synthetic skin devices. The methodology is
   compatible with large-scale fabrication and employs simple, commercially
   available elastomers.
   The design of materials within the semiconductor layer has led to the
   incorporation of selectivity and sensitivity within gassensing devices
   and has enabled stable sensor operation within aqueous media.
   Furthermore, careful tuning of the chemical composition of the
   dielectric layer has provided a means to operate the sensor in real time
   within an aqueous environment and without the need for encapsulation
   layers.
   The integration of such devices as electronic mimics of skin will
   require the incorporation of biocompatible or biodegradable components.
   Toward this goal, OFETs may be fabricated with >99\% biodegradable
   components by weight, and the devices are robust and stable, even In
   aqueous environments. Collectively, progress to date suggests that OFETs
   may be integrated within a single substrate to function as an electronic
   mimic of human skin, which could enable a large range of sensing-related
   applications from novel prosthetics to robotic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Pyruvate kinase-deficient Escherichia coli (PB25) is a low
   by-product-producing yet fast-growing mutant that has been shown to have
   technological potential. Determining the flux limits through finding the
   extreme point flux sets was previously reported to identify alternate
   metabolite trafficking scenarios. Previously, the extreme point flux
   sets were used to design tracer experiments; however, variation in
   extracellular measurements was not considered, and reaction
   reversibility was assumed to be low to moderate. In this study, we
   examined the utility of limiting the fluxes and predetermining the
   trafficking scenarios in PB25, including confirmation of quasi-linearity
   between extreme points to ensure sensitivity is maintained. The effects
   of variation in extracellular measurements and reaction reversibilities
   were also examined. Tightened flux limits reduced the nonlinearity
   between label distribution and fluxes. For low to moderate
   reversibility, contrast was also preserved. However, for highly
   reversible phosphoglucoisomerase activity, information from common
   analytes could lead to a flux solution that is biased towards one
   extreme point. Based on the PB25 model, some suggestions are provided
   for how predetermining flux limits and trafficking scenarios could
   enable flux identification in larger network problems.}},

Abstract = {{The human body has limited regenerative capacity in most of the major
   tissues and organs. This fact has spurred the field of regenerative
   medicine, promising to repair damage following traumatic injury or
   disease. Multiple therapeutic strategies are being explored including
   small molecules, gene delivery, and stem cells; however, tissue
   engineering remains a primary approach to achieving regeneration. Organ
   transplantation demonstrates that damaged tissues can be replaced, but
   technology to regenerate complex organs de novo is not yet available.
   Instead, tissue engineering can augment the body's own regenerative
   ability by replacing tissue sections and enhancing the regenerative
   cascade. As a consequence of these opportunities, it is timely to review
   the criteria and current status of engineered tissue grafts designed as
   patches to replace or regenerate damaged or diseased tissue and restore
   organ function. This topic will be explored starting from the
   biomaterials and cells incorporated into the engineered graft, the
   environment into which the graft is implanted and the integration of the
   engineered graft with the host. Common issues will be addressed that are
   relevant to regeneration in multiple tissue and organ systems. Specific
   examples will focus on engineered grafts for myocardial and corneal
   repair to illustrate the tissue-specific challenges and opportunities
   and highlight the innovation needed as the field moves forward. WIREs

Abstract = {{Laser scanners enable bridge inspectors to collect dense 3D point
   clouds, which capture detailed geometries of bridges. While these data
   sets contain rich geometric information, they bring unique challenges
   related to geometric information retrieval. This paper describes a case
   study to show the necessity and potential value of automating the manual
   data processing workflows being executed for extracting geometric data
   items (surveying goals) from 3D point clouds, and presents an approach
   for formalizing these workflows to enable such automation. We analyzed
   manual procedures of taking measurements on 3D point clouds and as-built
   models for obtaining bridge inspection related surveying goals,
   synthesized and categorized all data processing operations into nine
   generic operations. These nine categories of operations can be
   formalized using <operator, inputs, output, parameters, constraints>
   tuples. Using these tuples, we formalized an operation library and
   workflow construction mechanisms for enabling inspectors to
   semi-automatically construct executable workflows. This formalism also
   incorporates several mechanisms for facilitating extensions to the
   existing operation library to accommodate additional surveying goals
   that have not been covered. The developed approach is validated for its
   generality to support workflows needed for all surveying goals required
   by the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) program, and for its
   extensibility to support workflows needed to support a variety of other
   surveying goals identified in the Architecture/Engineering/Construction
   domain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy called software product line engineering, or SPLE, is taking
   hold in industries in which software is an integral part of product
   offerings. Where it has found a foothold, SPLE has brought about
   remarkable results such as unprecedented product variation, substantial
   production cost savings, slashing of time to market, and massive
   productivity gains. SPLE is the software version of an old manufacturing
   concept: building a suite of products from common parts assembled under
   a common design in a common production facility. The special properties
   of software make SPLE a particularly high-payoff proposition. SPLE
   exploits the commonalities among products to achieve economies of scale,
   by creating core assets assets that will be applied to multiple products
   in the product line. SPLE accommodates the differences among products by
   explicitly identifying and planning for those variations in product
   behavior and qualities. This management of variation allows the
   organization to achieve economies of scope and provides the capability
   of mass customization where every market is treated as a niche.
   Management ensures that core asset developers create effective core
   assets and product builders efficiently build products by using them.
   This requires oversight, coordination, and melding of purpose of groups
   that have slightly different inherent goals. (C) 2011 Kelley School of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the performance of Kalman filtering for
   discrete-time linear Gaussian systems, where packets containing
   observations are dropped according to a Markov process modeling a
   Gilbert-Elliot channel. To address the challenges incurred by the loss
   of packets, we give a new definition of non-degeneracy, which is
   essentially stronger than the classical definition of observability, but
   much weaker than one-step observability, which is usually used in the
   study of Kalman filtering with intermittent observations. We show that
   the trace of the Kalman estimation error covariance under intermittent
   observations follows a power decay law. Moreover, we are able to compute
   the exact decay rate for non-degenerate systems. Finally, we derive the
   critical value for non-degenerate systems based on the decay rate,
   improving upon the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{State estimation using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an important
   technique in many commercial and military applications, in which a group
   of (nonidentical) sensors take noisy observations of system state and
   send back to a fusion center through wireless broadcasting for state
   estimation. In order to minimize the terminal estimation error
   covariance at the fusion center, a partial broadcasting policy should
   tell which sensors to broadcast at each stage. The limited battery
   allows each sensor to broadcast only a few times. The limited wireless
   communication bandwidth allows only a few sensors to broadcast at the
   same time. Due to these couplings, the optimal partial broadcasting
   policy is not clear in general. Despite the abundant applications of
   partial broadcasting policies, theoretical analysis is rare. In this
   technical note, we provide a first study on the properties of optimal
   partial broadcasting policies. When there is no packet drop, a
   good-sensor-late-broadcast (GSLB) rule is shown to perform optimally for
   both the scalar system and the vector system. When packet drops with
   positive probability, situations in which the GSLB rule may or may not
   perform optimally are analyzed. Under different dropping rates, the GSLB
   rule is compared with several other policies through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a unified filtering framework for hybrid metric/topological
   robot global localization and SLAM. At a high level, our method relies
   on a topological graph representation whose vertices define uniquely
   identifiable places in the environment and whose edges define feasible
   paths between them. At a low level, our method generalizes to any
   detailed metric submapping technique. The filtering framework we present
   is designed for multi-hypothesis estimation in order to account for
   ambiguity when closing loops and to account for uniform uncertainty when
   initializing pose estimates. Our implementation tests multiple
   topological hypotheses through the incremental construction of a
   hypothesis forest with each leaf representing a possible graph/state
   pair at the current time step. Instead of using a heuristic approach to
   accept or reject hypotheses, we propose a novel Bayesian method that
   computes the posterior probability of each hypothesis. In addition, for
   every topological hypothesis, a metric estimate is maintained with a
   local Kalman filter. Careful pruning of the hypothesis forest keeps the
   growing number of hypotheses under control while a garbage-collector
   hypothesis is used as a catch-all for pruned hypotheses. This enables
   the filter to recover from unmodeled disturbances such as the kidnapped
   robot problem.}},

Abstract = {{Constitutive equations for the multiaxial stress-strain behavior of
   aluminum alloy 5754 sheets were developed, based on crystal plasticity.
   A Taylor-based polycrystal plasticity model, a tangent formulation of
   the self-consistent viscoplastic model (VPSC), and an N-site
   viscoplastic model based on the fast Fourier transform (VPFFT) were used
   to fit a single slip system hardening law to the available data for
   tension, plane strain, and biaxial stretching. The fitting procedure
   yields good agreement with the monotonic stress-strain data, with
   similar parameter values for each model. When simulating multiaxial
   tests using the developed hardening law, models that allow both stress
   and strain variations in grains give better predictions of the
   stress-strain curves. Furthermore, generally, the simulated texture
   evolution is too rapid when compared to the experiments. By
   incorporating a more detailed neighbor interaction effect, the VPFFT
   model predicts texture evolution in better agreement with experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive the joint (amplitude, phase) distribution of

   variables. We call this new distribution the complex Double Gaussian
   distribution. This probability distribution function (PDF) is a doubly
   infinite summation over modified Bessel functions of the first and
   second kind. We analyze the behavior of this sum and show that the
   number of terms needed for accuracy is dependent upon the Rician
   k-factors of the two input variables. We derive an upper bound on the
   truncation error and use this to present an adaptive computational
   approach that selects the minimum number of terms required for accuracy.
   We also present the PDF for the special case where either one or both of
   the input complex Gaussian random variables is zero-mean. We demonstrate
   the relevance of our results by deriving the optimal Neyman-Pearson
   detector for a time reversal detection scheme and computing the receiver
   operating characteristics through Monte Carlo simulations, and by

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The thermal expansion and spontaneous magnetostriction of
   polycrystalline samples of Er1-xGdxMn6Sn6 (0 <= x <= 1) intermetallics
   with hexagonal HfFe6Ge6-type structure are investigated in the
   temperature range of 77-520 K. The Gd substitution has significant
   effect on the interatomic distances and especially on inter-sublattice
   R-Mn couplings. The replacement of Er by Gd causes the lattice constants
   to increase due to the larger atomic radius of Gd compared with Er. It
   also results in increasing the ordering temperature as well as the
   spontaneous magnetostriction values following reinforcement the R-Mn
   coupling. The examined samples exhibit considerable thermal expansion
   anomalies at the Neel temperature (T-N = 340 and 335 K for the samples
   with x = 0 and 0.2, respectively) and also at T-M = 309-311 K where the
   Mn moments experience collapse-like reduction. Whereas, trivial
   anomalies are revealed at the Curie points (T-C = 77 K for the sample
   with x = 0,164 and 383 K for x = 0.2, 419 and 434 K for x = 0.6 and 1,
   respectively). From the results, it is concluded that the magnetovolume
   effects in these compounds originate mainly from the antiferromagnetic
   interlayer Mn-Mn exchange interactions, and the intraplane
   ferromagnetism does not influence the magnetoelasticity. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Objectives. Risk perceptions are central to good health decisions.
   People can judge valid probabilities but use 50\% disproportionately.
   The authors hypothesized that 50\% is more likely than other responses
   to reflect not knowing the probability, especially among individuals
   with low education and numeracy, and evaluated the usefulness of
   eliciting ``don't know{''} explanations. Methods. Respondents (n = 1020)
   judged probabilities for living or dying in the next 10 years,
   indicating whether they gave a good estimate or did not know the
   chances. They completed demographics, medical history, and numeracy
   questions. Results. Overall, 50\% was more likely than other
   probabilities to be explained as ``don't know{''} (v. ``a good
   estimate{''}). Correlations of using 50\% with low education and
   numeracy were mediated by expressing ``don't know.{''} Judged
   probabilities for survival and mortality explained as ``don't know{''}
   had lower correlations with age, diseases, and specialist visits.
   Conclusions. When judging risks, 50\% may reflect not knowing the
   probability, especially among individuals with low numeracy and
   education. Probabilities expressed as ``don't know{''} are less valid.
   Eliciting uncertainty could benefit theoretical models and educational

Abstract = {{Typical protocols for password-based authentication assume a single
   server that stores all the information (e.g., the password) necessary to
   authenticate a user. An inherent limitation of this approach, assuming
   low-entropy passwords are used, is that the user's password is exposed
   if this server is ever compromised. To address this issue, it has been
   suggested to share a user's password information among multiple servers,
   and to have these servers cooperate (possibly in a threshold manner)
   when the user wants to authenticate. We show here a two-server version
   of the password-only key-exchange protocol of Katz, Ostrovsky, and Yung
   (the KOY protocol). Our work gives the first secure two-server protocol
   for the password-only setting (in which the user need remember only a
   password, and not the servers' public keys), and is the first two-server
   protocol (in any setting) with a proof of security in the standard
   model. Our work thus fills a gap left by the work of MacKenzie et al.
   (2006) {[}31] and Di Raimondo and Gennaro (2006) {[}16]. As an
   additional benefit of our work, we show modifications that improve the
   efficiency of the original KOY protocol. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The thermal expansion and magnetostriction of polycrystalline sample of
   the ErMn6Sn6 intermetallic compound with hexagonal HfFe6Ge6-type
   structure are investigated in the temperature range of 77 K to above 400
   K. The thermal expansion measurement of the sample shows anomalous
   behavior around its T-N=340 K. The isofield curves of volume
   magnetostriction also reveal anomalies at paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic
   and antiferromagnetic-ferrimagnetic phase transitions. In the
   antiferromagnetic state, the transition to ferrimagnetism can be induced
   by an applied magnetic field. The threshold field for the metamagnetic
   transition H-th increases from 0.18 T at 84 K to about 1 T around 220 K,
   and then decreases monotonously to T-N. This behavior is well consistent
   with that observed earlier on magnetization curves attributed to
   exchange-related metamagnetic transition rather than the
   anisotropy-related one. Furthermore, the low Hth values suggest that the
   Mn-Mn coupling in ErMn6Sn6 is not so strong. The experimental results
   obtained are discussed in the framework of two-magnetic sublattice by
   bearing in mind the lattice parameter dependence of the interlayer Mn-Mn
   exchange interaction in this layered compound. From the temperature
   dependence of magnetostriction values and considering the
   magnetostriction relation of a hexagonal structure, we attempt to
   determine the signs of some of the magnetostriction constants for this
   compound. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that if the United States is
   to generate 20\% of its electricity from wind, over 50 GW will be
   required from shallow offshore turbines. Hurricanes are a potential risk
   to these turbines. Turbine tower buckling has been observed in typhoons,
   but no offshore wind turbines have yet been built in the United States.
   We present a probabilistic model to estimate the number of turbines that
   would be destroyed by hurricanes in an offshore wind farm. We apply this
   model to estimate the risk to offshore wind farms in four representative
   locations in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal waters of the United States.
   In the most vulnerable areas now being actively considered by
   developers, nearly half the turbines in a farm are likely to be
   destroyed in a 20-y period. Reasonable mitigation measures-increasing
   the design reference wind load, ensuring that the nacelle can be turned
   into rapidly changing winds, and building most wind plants in the areas
   with lower risk-can greatly enhance the probability that offshore wind
   can help to meet the United States' electricity needs.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate and convenient approach for monitoring the rate of mineral
   deposition on metals in real time was developed and involves use of an
   electrochemical cell employing the metallic collecting surface as a
   working electrode (WE). The WE serves as both the surface for mineral
   deposition and a sensor for probing subtle changes attributable to the
   growth of mineral deposits at the metal-mineral-water interface. The
   interfacial capacitance obtained from electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) was used as a measure of surface coverage by the
   mineral scale. Results show that a constant-phase element (CPE)
   capacitance correlated very well with the mass of mineral deposits
   accumulated on the metal surface. Moreover, the characteristics of
   different minerals evaluated in this study, i.e., calcium carbonate,
   calcium sulfate, and calcium phosphate, did not affect the CPE
   capacitance measurement significantly. Rather, the CPE capacitance was
   sensitive to small changes in the mineral mass deposited on the
   electrode (<0.1 mg). Unlike traditional methods for measurement of
   mineral deposition, the EIS allows in situ semicontinuous measurements
   of overall mineral deposition, and its sensitivity provides means for
   early detection of mineral deposition.}},

Abstract = {{High gradient magnetic field separators have been widely used in a
   variety of biological applications. Recently, the use of magnetic
   separators to remove malaria-infected red blood cells (pRBCs) from blood
   circulation in patients with severe malaria has been proposed in a
   dialysis-like treatment. The capture efficiency of this process depends
   on many interrelated design variables and constraints such as magnetic
   pole array pitch, chamber height, and flow rate. In this paper, we model
   the malaria-infected RBCs (pRBCs) as paramagnetic particles suspended in
   a Newtonian fluid. Trajectories of the infected cells are numerically
   calculated inside a micro-channel exposed to a periodic magnetic field
   gradient. First-order stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
   governing the trajectory of particles under periodic magnetic fields due
   to an array of wires are solved numerically using the 1st to 5th order
   adaptive step Runge-Kutta solver. The numerical experiments show that in
   order to achieve a capture efficiency of 99\% for the pRBCs it is
   required to have a longer length than 80 mm; this implies that in
   principle, using optimization techniques the length could be adjusted,
   i.e., shortened to achieve 99\% capture efficiency of the pRBCs.

Abstract = {{Integrated sites are tightly interconnected networks of large-scale
   chemical processes. Given the large-scale network structure of these
   sites, disruptions in any of its nodes, or individual chemical
   processes, can propagate and disrupt the operation of the whole network.
   Random process failures that reduce or shut down production capacity are
   among the most common disruptions. The impact of such disruptive events
   can be mitigated by adding parallel units and/or intermediate storage.
   In this paper, we address the design of large-scale, integrated sites
   considering random process failures. In a previous work (Terrazas-Moreno
   et al., 2010), we proposed a novel mixed-integer linear programming
   (MILP) model to maximize the average production capacity of an
   integrated site while minimizing the required capital investment. The
   present work deals with the solution of large-scale problem instances
   for which a strategy is proposed that consists of two elements. On one
   hand, we use Benders decomposition to overcome the combinatorial
   complexity of the MILP model. On the other hand, we exploit
   discrete-rate simulation tools to obtain a relevant reduced sample of
   failure scenarios or states. We first illustrate this strategy in a
   small example. Next, we address an industrial case study where we use a
   detailed simulation model to assess the quality of the design obtained
   from the MILP model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method by which the thermal conductivity of a nanostructure
   with arbitrary geometry can be predicted through Monte Carlo sampling of
   the free paths associated with phonon-phonon and phonon-boundary
   scattering. The required inputs are the nanostructure geometry and the
   bulk phonon frequencies, group velocities, and mean free paths. The
   method is applied to a thin film in the in-plane and cross-plane
   directions and to a polycrystalline bulk material. For the film, a
   faster approach to the bulk thermal conductivity is found compared to
   predictions made using the Matthiessen rule with the bulk mean free path
   and an average phonon-boundary scattering length. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{We present a method for characterizing the full five parameter
   heterophase interface character distributions (HICD) using
   two-dimensional electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) images. We
   apply the HICD method to determine the orientation relationships and
   three-dimensional normal vectors of Cu-Nb interfaces in both physical
   vapor-deposited (PVD) pure Cu-Nb (4 mu m individual layer thickness) and
   accumulative roll-bonded (ARB) alloyed Cu-Nb multilayer composites
   (200-600 nm layer thickness). The HICD analysis shows that \{112\}(Cu)
   planes arc most preferentially and frequently bonded with \{112)(Nb)
   planes with Kurdjumov-Sachs and Nishiyama-Wasserman misorientations in
   the ARB alloyed Cu-Nb multilayers. These interfaces differ from the
   \{111\}(Cu)parallel to\{110\}(Nb) interfaces predominantly found in the
   PVD pure Cu-Nb multilayered thin films. Also, pure tilt type interfaces
   with a {[}111]/30 degrees misorientation and \{110\}(Cu) planes bonded
   to \{112\}(Nb) planes were found in ARB alloyed Cu-Nb multilayers. In
   the ARB material the observed Cu-Nb interfaces differ from what would be
   obtained from random pairings of the Cu and Nb orientations in terms of
   the relative intensities (in multiples of random distribution) and
   shapes of the interface normal peaks, which indicates that these
   interfaces were preferentially selected during the high strain ARB
   process. The measured ARB textures along the interface also differ from
   the theoretical rolling textures for each bulk single phase metal,
   suggesting that during ARB layer refinement these interfaces have some
   influence on slip activity by constraining grain deformation or through
   the kinetics of dislocation interface interactions. (C) 2011 Acta

Abstract = {{With the enactment of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,
   U.S. President Obama made a public commitment to a new approach to
   energy production and transmission in the United States. It features
   installing smart meters and related technologies in residential homes,
   as part of transforming the current electrical grid into a ``smart
   grid.{''} Realizing this transformation requires consumers to accept
   these new technologies and take advantage of the opportunities that they
   create. We use methods from behavioral decision research to understand
   consumer beliefs about smart meters, including in-depth mental models
   interviews and a follow-up survey with a sample of potential smart meter
   customers of a major U.S. mid-Atlantic electricity utility. In both the
   surveys and the interviews, most respondents reported wanting smart
   meters. However, these preferences were often based on erroneous beliefs
   regarding their purpose and function. Respondents confused smart meters
   with in-home displays and other enabling technologies, while expecting
   to realize immediate savings. They also perceived risks, including less
   control over their electricity usage, violations of their privacy, and
   increased costs. We discuss the policy implications of our results. (C)

Abstract = {{Pilot-scale cooling towers can be used to evaluate corrosion, scaling,
   and biofouling control strategies when using particular cooling system
   makeup water and particular operating conditions. To study the potential
   for using a number of different impaired waters as makeup water, a
   pilot-scale system capable of generating 27 000 kJ/h heat load and
   maintaining recirculating water flow with a Reynolds number of 1.92 x
   10(4) was designed to study these critical processes under conditions
   that are similar to full-scale systems. The pilot-scale cooling tower
   was equipped with an automatic makeup water control system, automatic
   blowdown control system, semi-automatic biocide feeding system, and
   corrosion, scaling, and biofouling monitoring systems. Observed
   operational data revealed that the major operating parameters, including
   temperature change (6.6 degrees C), cycles of concentration (N := 4.6),
   water flow velocity (0.66 m/s), and air mass velocity (3660 kg/h m(2)),
   were controlled quite well for an extended period of time (up to 2
   months). Overall, the performance of the pilot-scale cooling towers
   using treated municipal wastewater was shown to be suitable to study
   critical processes (corrosion, scaling, biofouling) and evaluate cooling
   water management strategies for makeup waters of complex quality. (C)

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1201-1210}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A calibrated Monte Carlo (cMC) approach, which quantifies grain boundary
   kinetics within a generic setting, is presented. The influence of
   misorientation is captured by adding a scaling coefficient in the spin
   flipping probability equation, while the contribution of different
   driving forces is weighted using a partition function. The calibration
   process relies on the established parametric links between Monte Carlo
   (MC) and sharp-interface models. The cMC algorithm quantifies
   microstructural evolution under complex thermomechanical environments
   and remedies some of the difficulties associated with conventional MC
   models. After validation, the cMC approach is applied to quantify the
   texture development of polycrystalline materials with influences of
   misorientation and inhomogeneous bulk energy across grain boundaries.
   The results are in good agreement with theory and experiments. (C) 2011

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was performed for single-phase flow and
   condensation characteristics inside five micro-fin tubes with the same
   outer diameter 5 mm and helix angle 18 degrees. Data are for mass fluxes
   ranging from about 200 to 650 kg/m(2) s. The nominal saturation
   temperature is 320 K, with inlet and outlet qualities of 0.8 and 0.1,
   respectively. The results suggest that Tube 4 has the highest
   condensation heat transfer coefficient and also the highest condensation
   pressure drop penalty, while Tube 5 has the highest enhancement ratio
   due to its lowest pressure drop penalty and intermediate heat transfer
   coefficient. Condensation heat transfer coefficient flattens out
   gradually as G decreases when G <400 kg/(m(2) s) for Tube 2 and Tube 4.
   This nonlinear mass-flux effect may be explained by the complex
   interactions between micro-fins and fluid, including liquid drainage by
   surface tension and interfacial turbulence. In addition, the
   experimental data was analyzed using seven existing pressure-drop
   correlations and four heat-transfer models to verify their respective
   accuracies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper studies the asymptotic behavior of discrete time Random
   Riccati Equations (RRE) arising in Kalman filtering when the arrival of
   the observations is described by a Bernoulli independent and identically
   distributed (i.i.d.) process. We model the RRE as an order-preserving,
   strongly sublinear random dynamical system (RDS). Under a sufficient
   condition, stochastic boundedness, and using a limit-set dichotomy
   result for order-preserving, strongly sublinear RDS, we establish the
   asymptotic properties of the RRE: the sequence of random prediction
   error covariance matrices converges weakly to a unique invariant
   distribution, whose support exhibits fractal behavior. For stabilizable
   and detectable systems, stochastic boundedness (and hence weak
   convergence) holds for any nonzero observation packet arrival
   probability and, in particular, we can establish weak convergence at
   operating arrival rates well below the critical probability for mean
   stability (the resulting invariant measure in that situation does not
   possess a first moment). We apply the weak-Feller property of the Markov
   process governing the RRE to characterize the support of the limiting
   invariant distribution as the topological closure of a countable set of
   points, which, in general, is not dense in the set of positive
   semi-definite matrices. We use the explicit characterization of the
   support of the invariant distribution and the almost sure (a.s.)
   ergodicity of the sample paths to easily compute statistics of the
   invariant distribution. A one-dimensional example illustrates that the
   support is a fractured subset of the non-negative reals with
   self-similarity properties.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note concerns control applications over lossy data
   networks. Sensor data is transmitted to an estimation-control unit over
   a network and control commands are issued to subsystems over the same
   network. Sensor and control packets may be randomly lost according to a
   Bernoulli process. In this context, the discrete-time linear quadratic
   gaussian (LQG) optimal control problem is considered. In Schenato et al.
   {[}1], a complete analysis was carried out for the case that sensor
   measurements and control inputs are delivered into a single packet to
   the estimator and to the actuators respectively. Here, a nontrivial
   generalization for MIMO systems is presented under the assumption that
   each sensor and each actuator exchange data with the control unit in an
   independent way by using their own data packet (no aggregation). In such
   a framework, it is shown that the separation principle still holds in
   the case where packet arrivals are acknowledged by the receiver.
   Moreover, the optimal LQG control is a linear function of the state that
   explicitly depends on the loss probabilities of the actuator channels.
   Such a dependence is not present in the single channel case considered
   in mean-square. In the infinite horizon case, stability conditions on
   the packet arrival probabilities are provided in terms of linear matrix
   inequalities (LMIs).}},

Abstract = {{If implementation of proposals to engineer the climate through
   solar-radiation management (SRM) ever occurs, it is likely to be
   contingent on climate sensitivity. However, modelling studies examining
   the effectiveness of SRM as a strategy to offset anthropogenic climate
   change have used only the standard parameterizations of atmosphere-ocean
   general circulation models that yield climate sensitivities close to the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project mean. Here, we use a
   perturbed-physics ensemble modelling experiment to examine how the
   response of the climate to SRM implemented in the stratosphere (SRM-S)
   varies under different greenhouse-gas climate sensitivities. When SRM-S
   is used to compensate for rising atmospheric concentrations of
   greenhouse gases, its effectiveness in stabilizing regional climates
   diminishes with increasing climate sensitivity. However, the potential
   of SRM-S to slow down unmitigated climate change, even regionally,
   increases with climate sensitivity. On average, in variants of the model
   with higher sensitivity, SRM-S reduces regional rates of temperature
   change by more than 90\% and rates of precipitation change by more than
   50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions of hydrogen atoms with the surface and
   the subsurface regions of Pd is critical to the development of advanced
   energy technologies for hydrogen storage, hydrogen separations, and
   catalytic conversion processes. While many of the physical and chemical
   characteristics of the H-2-Pd system are known, the kinetics and
   thermodynamics of H atom absorption into the bulk, transport from the
   bulk back to the surface, and desorption from the surface remain
   unclear. In this work, the kinetics of D-2 release from Pd following
   exposure to D-2 over a range of pressures and temperatures were measured
   using temperature programmed desorption. To accurately simulate the
   kinetics of D-2 release, the continuum-based model of Mavrikakis, et al.
   (J. Chem. Phys 105, 8398, 1996) was extended to include activation
   barriers for desorption and transport that depend on D atom
   concentration in the surface, subsurface and bulk regions of the Pd. The
   use of concentration dependent barriers improves the ability of the
   model to predict the hydrogen uptake and release kinetics observed
   across temperatures ranging from 100 to 600 K. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose methods to control multiple untethered
   magnetic microrobots (called Mag-mu Bots), with all dimensions under 1
   mm, without the need for a specialized surface. We investigate sets of
   Mag-mu Bots that are geometrically designed to respond uniquely to the
   same applied magnetic fields. By controlling the magnetic field
   waveforms, individual and subgroups of Mag-mu Bots are able to locomote
   in a parallel but dissimilar fashion. The control of geometrically
   dissimilar Mag-mu Bots and a group of identically fabricated Mag-mu Bots
   are investigated, and control strategies are developed for 1-D and 2-D
   motion. This is accomplished by learning the velocity response of each
   microrobot to various control signals and using the uniqueness of each
   microrobot response to achieve independent control. The effect of
   high-level control parameters are investigated in simulation and in
   experiments, and the simultaneous independent global positioning of two
   and three microrobots is demonstrated in 2-D space. As this control
   method is accomplished without the use of a specialized surface, it has
   potential applications in areas such as microfluidic systems and
   biomanipulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a magnetically actuated soft capsule endoscope
   (MASCE) as a tetherless miniature mobile robot platform for diagnostic
   and therapeutic medical applications inside the stomach. Two embedded
   internal permanent magnets and a large external magnet are used to
   actuate the robot remotely. The proposed MASCE has three novel features.
   First, its outside body is made of soft elastomer-based compliant
   structures. Such compliant structures can deform passively during the
   robot-tissue contact interactions, which makes the device safer and less
   invasive. Next, it can be actively deformed in the axial direction by
   using external magnetic actuation, which provides an extra degree of
   freedom that enables various advanced functions such as axial position
   control, drug releasing, drug injection, or biopsy. Finally, it
   navigates in three dimensions by rolling on the stomach surface as a new
   surface locomotion method inside the stomach. Here, the external
   attractive magnetic force is used to anchor the robot on a desired
   location, and the external magnetic torque is used to roll it to another
   location, which provides a stable, continuous, and controllable motion.
   The paper presents design and fabrication methods for the compliant
   structures of the robot with its axial deformation and position control
   capability. Rolling-based surface locomotion of the robot using external
   magnetic torques is modeled, and its feasibility is tested and verified
   on a synthetic stomach surface by using a magnetically actuated capsule
   endoscope prototype.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic
   response of endmills while considering the actual fluted cross-sectional
   geometry and pretwisted shape of the tools. The model is solved using
   the spectral-Tchebychev (ST) technique. The bending and the coupled
   torsional-axial behavior of four different fluted endmills is compared
   to finite element model (FEM) predictions and experimental results
   obtained using modal testing under free-free boundary conditions. For
   the first eight modes, including six bending and two torsional/axial
   modes, the difference between the 3D-ST and experimental natural
   frequencies is shown to be 3\% or less for all four tools tested during
   this study. For the same modes, the 3D-ST and FEM predictions agree to
   better than 1\%. To demonstrate its application, the 3D-ST model for the
   fluted section of a commercial endmill is coupled to the spindle-holder
   to predict the tool-point dynamics using receptance coupling
   substructure analysis (RCSA) with a flexible connection. The coupled
   model is validated through experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Decision tree for adjuvant right ventricular support in patients

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) failure is a significant complication
   after implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). It is
   therefore important to identify patients at risk a priori. However,
   prognostic models derived from multivariate analyses have had limited
   predictive power.
   METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 LVAD
   recipients between May 1996 and October 2009; of these, 27 later
   required a RVAD (RVAD(+)) and 156 remained on LVAD only (RVAD(-)) until
   transplant or death. A decision tree model was constructed to represent
   combinatorial non-linear relationships of the pre-operative data that
   are predictive of the need for RVAD support.
   RESULTS: An optimal set of 8 pre-operative variables were identified:
   transpulmonary gradient, age, right atrial pressure, international
   normalized ratio, heart rate, white blood cell count, alanine
   aminotransferase, and the number of inotropic agents. The resultant
   decision tree, which consisted of 28 branches and 15 leaves, identified
   RVAD(+) patients with 85\% sensitivity, RVAD(-) patients with 83\%
   specificity, and exhibited an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of 0.87.
   CONCLUSIONS: The decision tree model developed in this study exhibited
   several advantages compared with existing risk scores. Quantitatively,
   it provided improved prognosis of RV support by encoding the non-linear,
   synergic interactions among pre-operative variables. Because of its
   intuitive structure, it more closely mimics clinical reasoning and
   therefore can be more readily interpreted. Further development with
   additional multicenter, longitudinal data may provide a valuable
   prognostic tool for triage of LVAD therapy and, potentially, improve
   outcomes. J Heart Lung Transplant 2012;31:140-9 (C) 2012 International

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes two novel ways to extend brain-computer interface

   that combines a BCI with another device to help people send information.
   Different types of hybrid BCIs are discussed, along with challenges and
   issues. BCIs are also being extended through intelligent systems.
   Software that allows high-level control, incorporates context and the
   environment and/or uses virtual reality can substantially improve BCI
   systems. Throughout the paper, we critically address the real benefits
   of these improvements relative to existing technology and practices. We
   also present new challenges that are likely to emerge as these novel BCI

Abstract = {{One of the stumbling blocks for implementation of Vehicular Ad Hoc
   Networks is the penetration rate: the percentage of vehicles that have

   unlikely to happen instantaneously, it is important to explore the
   performance gains achievable at low penetration rates. This especially
   pertains to safety applications, which are expected to provide
   life-saving information to all drivers on the road within a given
   region. We propose a technique that can be employed by safety
   applications to address the low penetration issue. By using visual cues
   on the equipped vehicles, such as specific patterns of hazard warning
   lights, we show that for all but the lowest vehicle densities, a radio
   penetration rate of 30\% is sufficient to inform more than 95\% of
   drivers in the region of interest in a timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{In applications such as the production of hydrogen ions for accelerators
   in spallation neutron sources, charge stripping of hydrogen ions using
   high-power lasers represents an attractive technical approach. The use
   of laser-ion interaction in conjunction with a laser recirculation
   cavity holds promise for improved efficiency, but the high-radiation
   environment raises concerns about the longevity of the key components of
   such a system, especially the nonlinear crystal used for frequency
   conversion. We present the results of an in-reactor irradiation
   experiment in which a sample beta-barium borate crystal has been
   irradiated with fast neutrons and gamma-rays, accompanied with the Monte
   Carlo analysis of the irradiation dose and its comparison with typical
   conditions at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory. The results suggest that our design of the laser
   recirculation cavity exhibits a radiation hardness consistent with
   maintaining enhancement factors of the order of 10 over > 10 years, but
   a more detailed experimental study is needed to investigate the
   radiation hardness of cavity designs exhibiting greater enhancement
   factors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel algorithm for the compression of ECG signals, in

   These functions can be constructed by sampling continuous Hermite
   functions at specific sampling points. They form an orthogonal basis in
   the underlying signal space. The proposed algorithm relies on the theory

   the constructed discrete Hermite functions have important advantages
   compared to continuous Hermite functions, which have previously been
   suggested for the compression of QRS complexes. Our algorithm achieves
   higher compression ratios compared with previously reported algorithms

Abstract = {{We present a simple model to account for the potential effectiveness of

   climate change. This method provides a parsimonious way to account for
   regional inequality in the assessment of SRM effectiveness and allows
   policy and decision makers to examine the linear climate response to
   different SRM configurations. To illustrate how the model works, we use
   data from an ensemble of modeling experiments conducted with a general
   circulation model (GCM). We find that an SRM scheme optimized to restore
   population-weighted temperature changes to their baseline compensates
   for 99\% of these changes while an SRM scheme optimized for
   population-weighted precipitation changes compensates for 97\% of these
   changes. Hence, while inequalities in the effectiveness of SRM are
   important, they may not be as severe as it is often assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a technology that could allow
   for continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world,
   smoothing the transition to non-fossil energy sources. Our objective is
   to assess the commercial viability of CCS given pervasive future
   uncertainties, particularly uncertainties about future natural gas and
   CO2 prices. Using data from the Integrated Environmental Control Model
   (IECM), we develop an interactive Excel-based spreadsheet tool to
   compare levelized-average costs of four different new-construction 500
   MW power plants: natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) with CCS, NCGG
   without CCS, supercritical coal with CCS, and supercritical coal without
   CCS. With low natural gas prices, the NGCC without the sequestration
   option is the dominant technology. Overall, CCS projects for either
   natural gas or coal projects are unlikely to be the lowest-cost option
   for CO2 prices less than \$50 per ton. Finally, we examine several
   potential policy levers that could affect the deployment of CCS. (c)

Abstract = {{Phonon transport across a silicon/vacuum-gap/silicon structure is
   modeled using lattice dynamics calculations and Landauer theory. The
   phonons transmit thermal energy across the vacuum gap via atomic
   interactions between the leads. Because the incident phonons do not
   encounter a classically impenetrable potential barrier, this mechanism
   is not a tunneling phenomenon. While some incident phonons transmit
   across the vacuum gap and remain in their original mode, many are
   annihilated and excite different modes. We show that the heat flux due
   to phonon transport can be 4 orders of magnitude larger than that due to
   photon transport predicted from near-field radiation theory.}},

Title = {{Three-Dimensional Stochastic Off-Lattice Model of Binding Chemistry in
   Crowded Environments}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Molecular crowding is one of the characteristic features of the
   intracellular environment, defined by a dense mixture of varying kinds
   of proteins and other molecules. Interaction with these molecules
   significantly alters the rates and equilibria of chemical reactions in
   the crowded environment. Numerous fundamental activities of a living
   cell are strongly influenced by the crowding effect, such as protein
   folding, protein assembly and disassembly, enzyme activity, and signal
   transduction. Quantitatively predicting how crowding will affect any
   particular process is, however, a very challenging problem because many
   physical and chemical parameters act synergistically in ways that defy
   easy analysis. To build a more realistic model for this problem, we
   extend a prior stochastic off-lattice model from two-dimensional (2D) to
   three-dimensional (3D) space and examine how the 3D results compare to
   those found in 2D. We show that both models exhibit qualitatively
   similar crowding effects and similar parameter dependence, particularly
   with respect to a set of parameters previously shown to act linearly on
   total reaction equilibrium. There are quantitative differences between
   2D and 3D models, although with a generally gradual nonlinear
   interpolation as a system is extended from 2D to 3D. However, the
   additional freedom of movement allowed to particles as thickness of the
   simulation box increases can produce significant quantitative change as
   a system moves from 2D to 3D. Simulation results over broader parameter
   ranges further show that the impact of molecular crowding is highly
   dependent on the specific reaction system examined.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of Ag NPs can affect their toxicity and persistence in
   the environment. We measured the solubility of organic-coated silver
   nanoparticles (Ag NPs) having particle diameters ranging from 5 to 80 nm
   that were synthesized using various methods, and with different organic
   polymer coatings including poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and gum arabic. The
   size and morphology of Ag NPs were characterized by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS)
   spectroscopy and synchrotron-based total X-ray scattering and pair
   distribution function (PDF) analysis were used to determine the local
   structure around Ag and evaluate changes in crystal lattice parameters
   and structure as a function of NP size. Ag NP solubility dispersed in 1
   mM NaHCO3 at pH 8 was found to be well correlated with particle size
   based on the distribution of measured TEM sizes as predicted by the
   modified Kelvin equation. Solubility of Ag NPs was not affected by the
   synthesis method and coating as much as by their size. Based on the
   modified Kelvin equation, the surface tension of Ag NPs was found to be
   similar to 1 J/m(2), which is expected for bulk fcc (face centered
   cubic) silver. Analysis of XAFS, X-ray scattering, and PDFs confirm that
   the lattice parameter, a, of the fcc crystal structure of Ag NPs did
   riot change with particle size for Ag NPs as small as 6 nm, indicating
   the absence of lattice strain. These results are consistent with the
   finding that Ag NP solubility can be estimated based on TEM-derived
   particle size using the modified Kelvin equation for particles in the
   size range of 5-40 nm in diameter.}},

Abstract = {{The electrokinetics of electrochemical capacitor electrodes composed of
   either pyrolyzed dextrose or chemically activated pyrolyzed dextrose
   during progressive steps in the production process were studied under
   dynamic charging condition by using cyclic voltammetry. Two different
   sizes and species of aqueous electrolyte anions, SO42- and NO3-, were
   used to probe the relationship between functional species dimension and
   electrode morphology. Cyclic voltammetry data collected with different
   scan rates demonstrate the appearance of slow charging process in the
   non-activated pyrolyzed carbons because of their ultramicroporous
   properties. The KOH activated material had significant micro-pores, and
   demonstrated electrokinetics of an ideal electric double layer. The
   activation on the carbon pyrolyzed at lower temperature is assumed to
   develop cylindrical pores, while that on the carbon pyrolyzed at higher
   temperature evolves slit-shaped pores. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{The effect of homopolymer (hP) addition on the structure formation in
   lamellar amorphous block copolymers (BCP) with narrow- and
   broad-molecular weight distribution (MWD) was studied using small-angle
   X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The systems in
   our study consist of blends of a poly(styrene-b-methyl acrylate)
   copolymer with block-selective broad MWD of the poly(methyl acrylate)
   domain as well as polystyrene and poly(methyl acrylate) hPs with
   molecular weight less than the corresponding block of the copolymer.
   Homopolymer addition to the broad MWD domain of the BCP is found to
   induce structural changes similar to narrow MWD BCP/hP blend systems.
   Conversely, addition of hP to the narrow MWD domain is found to induce a
   more pronounced expansion of lamellar domains due to the segregation of
   the hP to the center region within the host copolymer domain. With
   increasing hP concentration, the formation of a stable two-phase regime
   with coexisting lamellar/gyroid microphases is observed that is bounded
   by uniform lamellar phase regimes that differ in the distribution of hP
   within the corresponding narrow MWD block domain. The segregation of
   low-molecular weight hP to the center region of the narrowdisperse
   domains of a broad MWD BCP is rationalized as a consequence of the more
   stretched chain conformations within the narrowdisperse block that are
   implied by the presence of a disperse adjacent copolymer domain. The
   increase of chain stretching reduces the capacity of the narrowdisperse
   block to solubilize hP additives and thus provides a driving force for
   the segregation of hP chains to the center of the host copolymer domain.

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{149-159}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel strategy for the simulation of thermally
   coupled distillation sequences using process simulators. First, we show
   that the two side stream connections involved in a `thermal couple' can
   be accurately substituted by a combination of a material stream and heat
   flow; enabling a sequence of thermally coupled distillation columns to
   be simulated without recycle streams, similar to conventional
   simulations of zeotropic distillation sequences. In fact, using this
   method, a sequence of thermally coupled distillation columns is not more
   difficult to converge than other distillation systems without recycles.
   Furthermore, in most cases, this approach introduces negligible errors,
   and provides excellent starting points for rigorous simulations of
   actual thermally coupled systems with recycle streams. Different
   examples, including mixtures of hydrocarbons (C4s-C5s-C6s), aromatics
   (BTX), alcohols, non-ideal azeotropic systems (acetone, benzene,
   chloroform) and systems involving 4 or 5 components are presented. In
   addition, various thermodynamically equivalent configurations,
   corresponding to different alternatives for implementing this approach,
   are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of copper-mediated controlled/living radical polymerization
   (CRP) of methyl acrylate (MA) in the presence of Cu(0) and two different
   ligands that form active catalyst complexes with copper TPMA
   (tris(2-pyridylinethyl)amine) and Me(6)TREN (tris(2-(dimethylamino)ethyp
   amine) are compared. The critical difference between the ligands is that
   TPMA forms a Cu(I) complex that undergoes essentially no
   ciisproportionation in a mixture of MA and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
   DMSO/MA (v/v = 1/2), while the complex with Me6TREN undergoes
   disproportionation to a limited extent. Parameters such as the surface
   area of Cu wire, the concentration of added Cu(11)X(2)/L, and ligand
   concentration were examined. Both the Me(6)TREN- and TPMA-based
   catalysts efficiently controlled the polymerization of MA. The
   TPMA-based system showed a power law order of 0.47 for the apparent
   propagation rate constant with the Cu surface area, very similar to the
   reported value for the Me(6)TREN-based system, which showed a power law
   of 0.44. These results demonstrate that the polymerization of MA in DMSO
   in the presence of metallic copper can be explained by a core
   atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) process in which the Cu acts
   as a supplemental activator and reducing agent, rather than through the
   proposed single-electron-transfer living radical polymerization
   (SET-LRP) mechanism, which requires additional assumptions, such as
   complete and instantaneous disproportionation of Cu(1)/L species.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Synchrotron x-ray scattering was used to study the evolution of
   interface roughness with annealing for a series of Cu thin films. The
   films were encapsulated in SiO2 or Ta/SiO2 and prepared by sputter
   deposition. Specular x-ray reflectivity was used to determine the root
   mean square roughness for both the upper and the lower Cu/SiO2 (or
   Cu/Ta) interfaces. The lateral roughness was studied by diffuse x-ray
   reflectivity. Annealing the films at 600 degrees C resulted in a
   smoothing of only the upper interface for the Cu/SiO2 samples, while the
   lower Cu/SiO2 interfaces and both interfaces for the Ta encapsulated
   films did not evolve significantly. This difference in kinetics is
   consistent with the lower diffusivity expected of Cu in a Cu/Ta
   interface (compared to a Cu/SiO2 interface) and the mechanical rigidity
   of the lower Cu/SiO2 interface. As a function of roughness wavelength,
   the upper Cu/SiO2 interfaces exhibited a roughness decay with annealing
   that was only 12.5\% of that expected for classical capillarity driven
   smoothening of a free surface. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{A microscale shear cell is used to study the formation of parabolic
   focal conic defects in the thermotropic smectic-A liquid crystal 8CB
   (4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl). Defects are produced by four distinct
   methods: by the application of dilatational strain alone, by shear flow
   alone, by dilatational strain and subsequent shear flow, and by the
   simultaneous application of dilatational strain and shear flow. We
   confirm that defects originate within the bulk, consistent with the
   previously suggested undulation instability mechanism. In the presence
   of a shear flow, we observe that defect formation requires
   micrometer-level dilatations, whose magnitude depends on the sample
   thickness. The size and ordering of both disordered and ordered defect
   arrays is quantified using a pair distribution function. Deviations from
   the predictions of linear stability theory are observed that have not
   been reported previously. For example, defects form a square array with
   greater ordering in the principal flow direction. Ordering due to shear
   flow does not change the average defect size. It has been shown
   previously that the principal defect sizes of ordered defects scale
   differently with sample thickness than the wavelength of the small
   amplitude undulations. We find that disordered defects show a similar
   deviation from this predicted wavelength.}},

Abstract = {{A temperature rise on the order of tenths of a degree is observed as one
   fluid spreads over a hygroscopic fluid. While this behavior is only
   exhibited with hygroscopic fluids, it is independent of the properties
   of the spreading fluid. The spreading induces a `rolling' motion in the
   subphase which brings `fresh' fluid to the surface, exposing it to the
   water vapor in the air. As water is absorbed into the hygroscopic
   liquid, heat is released. The same behavior is observed whether the
   spreading fluid has a spreading monolayer that drives a convection front
   or is a spreading lens with a moving three-phase contact line. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A greyscale-based fully automatic deformable image registration
   algorithm, based on an optical flow method together with geometric
   smoothing, is developed for dynamic lung modeling and tumor tracking. In
   our computational processing pipeline, the input data is a set of 4D CT
   images with 10 phases. The triangle mesh of the lung model is directly
   extracted from the more stable exhale phase (Phase 5). In addition, we
   represent the lung surface model in 3D volumetric format by applying a
   signed distance function and then generate tetrahedral meshes. Our
   registration algorithm works for both triangle and tetrahedral meshes.
   In CT images, the intensity value reflects the local tissue density. For
   each grid point, we calculate the displacement from the static image
   (Phase 5) to match with the moving image (other phases) by using merely
   intensity values of the CT images. The optical flow computation is
   followed by a regularization of the deformation field using geometric
   smoothing. Lung volume change and the maximum lung tissue movement are
   used to evaluate the accuracy of the application. Our testing results
   suggest that the application of deformable registration algorithm is an
   effective way for delineating and tracking tumor motion in image-guided
   radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulation is a useful tool to
   estimate the wall stress distribution and predict the rupture risk of a
   cerebral aneurysm. Accurate simulation is important to assist the
   treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Although the accuracy has been
   increased in recent years, the process still remains physically
   non-reasonable with most simulation studies relying on a uniform wall
   thickness and isotropic material property. In this paper, we present an
   anisotropic material property modeling scheme with a non-uniform wall
   thickness distribution for patient-specific cerebral aneurysms. The
   non-uniform wall thickness distribution and material anisotropy are
   obtained through deforming the mesh of a healthy blood-vessel onto an
   aneurysm model, where the mesh deformation simulates the formation of
   the aneurysm by stretching the mesh elements. With the addition of
   material anisotropy, the simulation results can be improved and become
   more physically meaningful.}},

Abstract = {{We study the asymptotic exponential decay rate I for the convergence in
   probability of products WkWk-1...W1 of random symmetric, stochastic
   matrices W-k. Albeit it is known that the probability P that the product
   WkWk-1...W1 is epsilon away from its limit converges exponentially fast
   to zero, i.e., P similar to e(-kI), the asymptotic rate I has not been
   computed before. In this paper, assuming the positive entries of W-k are
   bounded away from zero, we explicitly characterize the rate I and show
   that it is a function of the underlying graphs that support the positive
   (non zero) entries of W-k. In particular, the rate I is given by a
   certain generalization of the min-cut problem. Although this min-cut
   problem is in general combinatorial, we show how to exactly compute I in
   polynomial time for the commonly used matrix models, gossip and link
   failure. Further, for a class of models for which I is difficult to
   compute, we give easily computable bounds: I <= I <= I, where I and I
   differ by a constant ratio. Finally, we show the relevance of I as a
   system design metric with the example of optimal power allocation in
   consensus+innovations distributed detection.}},

Abstract = {{Viral diffusion is an important area of research in networks, with
   applications from epidemiology to cyber and cuberphysical systems
   security. To study the infection dynamics of a single virus in a
   complete network, it suffices to study the dynamics of a single
   statistic - the fraction of infected nodes in the network. Here, we
   consider multiple viruses (two viruses for simplicity.) To go beyond the
   complete network, we consider a (special type of) bipartite network and
   show that, in this case and with two viruses, the state of the network
   is a four dimensional Markov process that collects the fractions of
   infected nodes in each island (bipartite classes) for each type of
   infection. The dynamics of this Markov process is described by a system
   of coupled stochastic integral equations. The stochastic dynamics leads,
   in the large scale limit (mean field), to four coupled nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. To study the system qualitative
   behavior and determine the asymptotic distributions of infected nodes by
   each virus in each island, we resort to studying simpler configurations
   whose dynamics bound the dynamics of the original system and exhibit the
   same attractor.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of infinite-horizon sensor
   scheduling for estimation of a discrete-time linear Gaussian system,
   where the sensor information may be dropped during communication over a
   memoryless erasure channel, modeled as an independent Bernoulli process.
   We assume that due to energy or bandwidth constraints, the sensor can
   only maintain an average communication rate of r. The optimal
   communication schedule is thus chosen by the sensor to minimize the
   average estimation error of the receiver. We prove necessary and
   sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the optimization problem
   for two classes of protocols, one where deterministic acknowledgments
   are transmitted from the central location back to the sensor (ACK) and
   and the other where the acknowledgement structure is absent (No-ACK). We
   prove that for the No-ACK case, the optimal schedule can be approximated
   by a periodic schedule with arbitrarily close performance. For the ACK
   case, we provide the explicit optimal sensor schedule. A numerical
   example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   strategy.}},

   a network of nodes. Solving them with distributed algorithms provides
   advantages over centralized solutions, such as privacy and the ability

   in networks where each node requires only partial knowledge of the
   problem's solution. We explore this feature to design a decentralized
   algorithm that follows a significant reduction in the total number of
   communications. Our algorithm is based on the Alternating Direction of

Abstract = {{In classical, centralized optimization, the Nesterov gradient algorithm
   reduces the number of iterations to produce an epsilon-accurate solution
   (in terms of the cost function) with respect to ordinary gradient from O
   (1/epsilon) to O (1/root epsilon). This improvement is achieved on a
   class of convex functions with Lipschitz continuous first derivative,
   and it comes at a very small additional computational cost per
   iteration. In this paper, we consider distributed optimization, where
   nodes in the network cooperatively minimize the sum of their private
   costs subject to a global constraint. To solve this problem, recent
   literature proposes distributed (sub) gradient algorithms, that are
   attractive due to computationally inexpensive iterations, but that
   converge slowly-the epsilon error is achieved in O (1/epsilon(2))
   iterations. Here, building from the Nesterov gradient algorithm, we
   present a distributed, constant step size, Nesterov-like gradient
   algorithm that converges much faster than existing distributed (sub)
   gradient methods, with zero additional communications and very small
   additional computations per iteration k. We show that our algorithm
   converges to a solution neighborhood, such that, for a convex compact
   constraint set and optimized stepsize, the convergence time is O
   (1/epsilon). We achieve this on a class of convex, coercive,
   continuously differentiable private costs with Lipschitz first
   derivative. We derive our algorithm through a useful penalty, network's
   Laplacian matrix-based reformulation of the original problem (referred
   to as the clone problem) - the proposed method is precisely the
   Nesterov-gradient applied on the clone problem. Finally, we illustrate
   the performance of our algorithm on distributed learning of a classifier
   via logistic loss.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based control strategies are widely advocated to improve the
   energy efficiency of building systems but they require accurate dynamic
   building models, which are often difficult to obtain in practice. While
   modeling a multi-zone lab for model-based control, we observed that the
   experimental data often does not have sufficient quality for system
   identification. To address this problem, we propose a Building
   Data-Dependent Identifcation (BDDI) algorithm to calculate the numerical
   identifiability for high-order RC models. The algorithm is a closed-loop
   ``active identification{''} architecture that dynamically improves
   experimental design for better data quality. We conclude that the
   experimental conditions needed for accurate identification of building
   systems fall outside normal building operation. Therefore, systematic
   design of experiments with minimal disturbances (such as occupancy) are
   necessary to reliably model building dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave structural health monitoring systems are often characterized
   by multi-modal and dispersive propagation media. Accurate knowledge of
   guided wave characteristics could help to dramatically improve
   performance, but estimating this information from data is often very
   difficult. In this paper, we present a methodology, based on compressed
   sensing, that utilizes l(1)-regularized optimization techniques to
   recover the sparse characteristics of the guided wavefields in the
   frequency-wavenumber domain. Using simulated guided wave data, we
   demonstrate the performance of this technique and compare it to a more
   traditional approach, the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier transform
   method. We show that, with 10 sensors, our compressed sensing method
   successfully estimates 1000 points in a wavefield with an average
   correlation coefficient of more than 0.99 while the 2-dimensional
   discrete Fourier transform method requires more than 820 sensors to
   achieve the same performance.}},

   in a microfluidic channel for concentration of microparticles and
   bacteria. We have investigated standing waves produced by boundary
   reflections from a single interdigitated transducer operating near 6
   MHz. Observations of particle motions show both concentration in the
   acoustic field and acoustic streaming. We have modeled the generation of
   standingacoustic waves in three dimensions with and without a water
   channel. At the low frequencies used in this work, the waves generated
   are bulk plate waves rather than surface acoustic waves.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents experimental results of applying an ultrasonic
   monitoring system to a real-world operating hot-water supply system. The
   purpose of these experiments is to investigate the feasibility of
   continuous ultrasonic damage detection on pipes with permanently mounted
   piezoelectric transducers under environmental and operational
   variations. Ultrasonic guided wave is shown to be an efficient damage
   detector in laboratory experiments. However, environmental and
   operational variations produce dramatic changes in those signals, and
   therefore a useful signal processing approach must distinguish change
   caused by a scatterer from change caused by ongoing variations. We study
   pressurized pipe segments (10-in diameter) in a working hot-water supply
   system that experiences ongoing variations in pressure, temperature, and
   flow rate; the system is located in an environment that is mechanically
   and electrically noisy. We conduct pitch-catch tests, with a duration of
   10 ms, between transducers located roughly 12 diameters apart. We
   applied different signal processing techniques to the collected data in
   order to investigate the ongoing environmental and operational
   variations and the stationarity of the signal. We present our analysis
   of these signals and preliminary detection results.}},

Abstract = {{Consolidating Virtual Machines (VMs) in data centers is desirable as it
   reduces hardware and power costs. However the performances of VMs on
   shared physical servers are not isolated from each other as they contend
   for the same server resources. This contention degrades the performance
   of delay sensitive applications and can increase response times by three
   orders of magnitude at high contention levels. In order to achieve
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs) under VM consolidation, resources must
   be allocated by considering the performance effects of contention. We
   therefore present VARACO, a contention-aware VM management system to
   achieve Quality-of-Service (QoS) targets for multi-tier web
   applications. VARACO models applications' performances online using 13
   server resource utilization and contention metrics. Resources are
   dynamically allocated using these models to achieve QoS targets. Our
   results show that application-level performance can be modeled 130\%
   more accurately when resource contention is considered. We demonstrate
   VARACO by achieving a 90th percentile response time target of a sample
   application under VM consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{We expect femto-cells to be massively and densely deployed in the
   future. Numerous existing works on femto-cell interference management
   assume that the local topology of interfering femto-cells can be
   sufficiently approximated through sensing, if not already known in
   advance. We show that this assumption results in poor throughput
   performance in dense femto-cell networks. For some cell-edge users,
   using conventional sensing in dense deployments can result in almost 50
   times less instantaneous throughput, as compared to having oracular
   knowledge of interference topology. This sub-optimality is caused by
   ``far-away{''} interferers. These are femto-cells that are deployed just
   far enough such that their presence will not be detected by conventional
   sensing. We then introduce a mobile sensing scheme to detect these
   ``far-away{''} interferers by exploiting the inherent mobility of
   femto-cell users. We show through packet-level simulation that this
   sensing scheme is able to better approximate the interference topology.
   This results in significantly improved performance over conventional
   sensing, in dense deployment scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Many motile unicellular organisms have evolved specialized behaviors for
   detecting and responding to chemical gradients (chemotaxis) or oxygen
   (aerotaxis), while magnetotactic bacteria sense magnetic fields to align
   their direction of movement. Herein we show that Magnetospirillum
   magneticum (AMB-1) have the ability to sense and respond not only to the
   direction of magnetic fields of naturally occurring magnitude, but also
   to local, highly concentrated magnetic field gradients that do not occur
   in their natural environment. We imposed these gradients through our
   system integrating Helmholtz coils and permalloy (Ni80Fe20)
   microstructures. The AMB-1 exhibit three distinct behaviors as they
   approached gradients near the microstructures unidirectional, single
   direction reversal, and double direction reversal. These results
   indicate previously unknown capabilities of the magnetic sensing systems
   of AMB-1.}},

Abstract = {{There is no consolidated, integral, quantifiable, granular, updated
   source of information for the roads we traverse and the environment we
   live in everyday. This leads to ambiguity about road conditions, which
   is tolerable during normal conditions but extremely problematic in
   adverse conditions such as snow blockages, water-logging due to storms,
   degraded roads and potholes. Without such knowledge, city authorities
   cannot take effective action against such problems. Also, one only has
   knowledge about ones immediate surroundings in a car, and not what to
   expect further down the road. Our approach is to deploy a number of
   embedded modules capable of sensing, computing and reporting, each of
   which can simply be plugged into any vehicle. Hence this enables each
   vehicle's connectivity to the cloud and larger coverage as compared to
   static sensors. The data reported by each module itself might be prone
   to errors. Therefore, the cloud crowd sources the data from these
   modules and merges it to increase confidence in the information. Our
   work, Panoptes, demonstrates these aspects through crowdsourced pothole
   detection for city roads.}},

Abstract = {{Generating electricity at wastewater treatment plants is a promising
   near-term application of fuel cell systems. The scale of most wastewater
   treatment plants is such that there is a good match with the scale of
   today's fuel cell systems. This paper presents an exergy analysis and an
   economic comparison between two fuel cell systems that generate
   electricity at a wastewater treatment plant. The first process
   integrates an anaerobic digester (AD) with a solid oxide fuel cell
   (SOFC). The SOFC was modeled using publicly-available data from the
   tests on the Rolls-Royce pressurized SOFC. The second process has the
   wastewater sent directly to a microbial fuel cell (MFC). An MFC is an
   electrochemical cell in which bacteria convert acetate, sugars and/or
   other chemicals into protons, electrons and carbon dioxide at the anode
   electrode. The MFC was modeled as a PEM fuel cell as used for vehicle
   applications, but with a few changes: (a) anaerobic bacteria, such as
   geobacter, grow directly on the surface of the anode electrode, (b)
   there is no anode gas diffusion layer (GDL), (c) iron pyrophyrin, rather
   than platinum, is used as the catalyst material on the anode, in
   addition to the bacteria, and (d) the Nafion electrolyte is replaced
   with a bipolar membrane in order to minimize the transfer of non-proton
   cations, such as Na+, from the anode to the cathode. The rest of the
   equipment in the MFC is the same as those in commercial vehicle PEM fuel
   cells in order to use recent DOE cost estimates for PEM fuel cell
   systems. In both cases, we generated V-i curves of SOFC and MFC-PEM
   systems from data available on a) PEM \& SOFC electrolyte conductivity
   and b) anode and cathode exchange current densities, including the
   effect of platinum levels on the cathode exchange current density of PEM
   fuel cells. A full exergy analysis was conducted for both systems
   modeled. The power per inlet exergy will be presented as a function of
   the current density and the pressure of the fuel cell. Using various
   Department of Eneregy (DOE) cost estimates for fuel cell systems, we
   perform parametric studies for both the MFC and AD-SOFC systems in order
   to maximize the internal rate of return on investment (IRR). In the MFC
   case, we varied the platinum loading on the cathode in order to maximize
   the IRR, and in the AD-SOFC case, we varied the current density of the
   SOFC in order to maximize the IRR.
   Finally, we compare the IRR of the two systems modeled above with the
   IRR of an anaerobic digester integrated with a piston engine capable of
   operating on biogas, such as the GE Jenbacher. Using an electricity sale
   price of \$80/MWh, the IRR of the AD-SOFC, the microbial fuel cell and
   the AD-piston engine were 9\%/yr, 10\%/yr and 2\%/yr. respectively. This
   economic analysis suggests that further experimental research should be
   conducted on both the microbial fuel cell and the pressurized SOFC
   because both systems were able to generate attractive values of IRR at
   an electricity sale price close to the average industrial price of
   electricity in the US.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new point set surfacing method that employs neural
   networks for regression. Our technique takes as input unstructured and
   possibly noisy point sets representing two-manifolds in R-3. To
   facilitate parametrization, the set is first embedded in R-2 using
   neighborhood preserving locally linear embedding. A neural network is
   then constructed and trained that learns a mapping between the embedded
   2D parametric coordinates and the corresponding 3D space coordinates.
   The trained network is then used to generate a tessellation that spans
   the parametric space, thereby producing a surface in the original space.
   This approach enables the surfacing of noisy and non-uniformly
   distributed point sets, and can be applied to open or closed surfaces.
   We show the utility of the proposed method on a number of test models,

Abstract = {{In product design, designers often create a multitude of concept
   sketches as part of the ideation process. Transforming such sketches to
   3D digital models usually require special expertise and effort due to a
   lack of suitable Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. Although recent
   advances in sketch-based user interfaces and immersive environments
   (such as augmented/virtual reality) have introduced novel curve design
   tools, rapid surfacing of such data remains an open challenge. To this
   end, we propose a new method that enables a quick construction of
   approximate surfaces from a cloud of 3D curves that need not be
   connected to one another. Our method first calculates a vector field by
   discretizing the space in which the curve cloud appears into a voxel
   image. This vector field drives a deformable surface onto the 3D curve
   cloud thus producing a closed surface. The surface smoothness is
   achieved through a set of surface smoothing and subdivision operations.
   Our studies show that the proposed technique can be particularly usefill
   for early visualization and assessment of design ideas.}},

Abstract = {{As technology advances, there is an increasing need to reliably output
   mechanical work at smaller scales. At the nanoscale, one of the most
   promising routes is utilizing biomolecular motors such as myosin
   proteins commonly found in cells. Myosins convert chemical energy into
   mechanical energy and are strong candidates for use as components of
   artificial nanodevices and multi-scale systems. Isoforms of the myosin
   superfamily of proteins are fine-tuned for specific cellular tasks such
   as intracellular transport, cell division, and muscle contraction. The
   modular structure that all myosins share makes it possible to
   genetically engineer them for fine-tuned performance in specific
   applications. In this study, a parametric analysis is conducted in order
   to explore the design space of Myosin II isoforms.
   The crossbridge model for myosin mechanics is used as a basis for a
   parametric study. The study sweeps commonly manipulated myosin
   performance variables and explores novel ways of tuning their
   performance. The analysis demonstrates the extent that myosin designs
   are alterable. Additionally, the study informs the biological community
   of gaps in experimentally tabulated myosin design parameters. The study
   lays the foundation for further progressing the design and optimization
   of individual myosins, a pivotal step in the eventual utilization of
   custom-built biomotors for a broad range of innovative nanotechnological
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we investigate how consumers make preference judgments when
   taking into account both product form and function. In prior work, where
   aesthetic preference is quantified using visual conjoint methods,
   aesthetic preference and functional preference were handled separately.
   Here we introduce a new methodology for testing the hypothesis that when
   consumers make decisions taking into account both a product's form and
   its function they employ a more complex decision making strategy than
   when basing their decision on form or function alone. We believe that
   this strategy will involve both cognitive and emotional processes.
   We used a two stage conjoint analysis to develop a preference function
   that takes both form and function into account. When compared with
   participant ratings of form and function combinations across 14
   subjects, the model is shown to have a correlation of approximately
   0.56, p < 0.001.
   Next we developed a novel paradigm using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to determine what parts of the brain are primarily
   involved with any given tradeoff between form and function. While in the
   scanner, study participants were asked to make decisions between options
   where only form varied, where only function varied, and where form and
   function both varied.
   Results from 7 participants suggest that choices based on products that
   vary in both form and function involve some unique and some common brain
   networks as choices based on form or function alone; most important,
   emotion-related regions are activated during these complex decisions
   where form and function are in conflict. These results demonstrate the
   feasibility of using fMRI to address questions about the mental
   processes underlying consumer decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering goals are typically rooted in addressing the functional
   needs of a product. While these engineering goals and specifications can
   be important in consumers' buying decisions, many times the first
   impression of the product comes from judgments of the product's
   aesthetic form. For this reason, this paper set out to study how well
   human judgment of performance based on a car's shape correlates with the
   actual measured performance of the car's shape, and what features of the
   car's shape most influence this judgment. More specifically,
   participants were asked to rate how aerodynamic, sporty, fuel efficient,
   and rugged a computer generated car design appeared to them, and these
   ratings were analyzed against the actual aerodynamics of the vehicle as
   well as key indicators of sportiness and cornering stability such as
   center of gravity and wheel stance. The inter-rater consistency of human
   judgments was also studied. Using this human judgment data, the
   attributes in car design with the greatest effect on participant
   judgment of vehicle performance were identified, and were compared
   against their importance and effect in actual vehicle performance.
   Analysis of this data gives key insights about how car designers can
   create designs that better convey the desired goals of a car to
   consumers while also meeting those performance goals.}},

Abstract = {{Recent trends in technology are challenging engineers to configure
   products at ever smaller scales. At the nano-scale, biological protein
   machines are commonly chosen as a power-source for a broad-range of
   nano-devices. This paper explores the challenges in designing these and
   similar systems, such as improving the emergent system performance that
   arises from the interactions of many stochastic components.
   We develop a domain-independent methodology, using multi-agent
   simulations as a means of modeling and predicting emergent system
   behavior across scales and structure-behaviorfunction representations
   for understanding and navigating the resulting design space. This
   methodology is validated with an application of synthetic myosin motor
   design at the nanoscale, with simulation results aligning well with the
   macroscopic performance of myosin-powered muscular contractions.
   The multi-agent simulation is implemented with myosins modeled as
   agents, allowing for the virtual design and experimentation of synthetic
   myosins with altered structures and mechanochemical behaviors. Four
   myosin populations are designed and simulated, with their emergent
   system performance determined by aggregating the contributions of each
   myosin agent over time.
   Although the multi-agent simulation successfully recreates the emergent
   behaviors of the myosins, it is difficult to draw conclusions about how
   each structural variation influences aggregate performance. SBF
   representations of the system are then developed to describe how the
   aggregate performance of the system is explainable in terms of myosin
   behaviors, which map directly to altered myosin structures. It is then
   demonstrated how an engineer may utilize these representations and
   experimental results to reason about, and configure a myosin system with
   optimal performance.
   The methodology is domain-independent, ensuring its extendibility to
   similar complex systems while aiding a designer in simplifying a complex
   physical phenomenon to a design space consisting of only a few critical
   parameters. The methodology is particularly suited for complex systems
   with many parts operating stochastically across scales, and should prove
   invaluable for engineers facing the challenges of biological nanoscale
   design, where designs with unique properties require novel approaches or
   useful configurations in nature await discovery.}},

Abstract = {{This work lends insight into the meaning and impact of ``near{''} and
   ``far{''} analogies. A cognitive engineering design study is presented
   that examines the effect of the distance of analogical design stimuli on
   design solution generation, and places those findings in context of
   results from the literature. The work ultimately sheds new light on the
   impact of analogies in the design process and the significance of their
   distance from a design problem. In this work, the design repository from
   which analogical stimuli are chosen is the U.S. patent database, a
   natural choice, as it is one of the largest and easily accessed
   catalogued databases of inventions. The ``near{''} and ``far{''}
   analogical stimuli for this study were chosen based on a structure of
   patents, created using a combination of Latent Semantic Analysis and a
   Bayesian based algorithm for discovering structural form, resulting in
   clusters of patents connected by their relative similarity. The findings
   of this engineering design study are contextualized with the fmdings of
   recent work in design by analogy, by mapping the analogical stimuli used
   in the earlier work into similar structures along with the patents used
   in the current study. Doing so allows the discovery of a relationship
   between all of the stimuli and their relative distance from the design
   problem. The results confirm that ``near{''} and ``far{''} are relative
   terms, and depend on the characteristics of the potential stimuli.
   Further, although the literature has shown that ``far{''} analogical
   stimuli are more likely to lead to the generation innovative solutions
   with novel characteristics, there is such a thing as too far. That is,
   if the stimuli are too distant, they then can become harmful to the
   design process. Importantly, as well, the data mapping approach to
   identify analogies works, and is able to impact the effectiveness of the
   design process. This work has implications not only in the area of
   finding inspirational designs to use for design by analogy processes in
   practice, but also for synthesis, or perhaps even unification, of future
   studies in the field of design by analogy.}},

Abstract = {{Over 20\% of electricity in US is used by lighting. Solid state lighting
   (SSL) efficiency can surpass that of incandescent and fluorescent
   lighting techniques. Nonetheless SSL efficiency is greatly reduced at
   high temperatures that result from inadequate heat dissipation. SSL
   requires blue and green light emitting diodes (LEDs) made from Gallium
   Nitride (GaN) and Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) to eventually generate
   white light. Conduction within the LED is a major thermal resistance for
   heat dissipation, and motivates study of thermal properties of LED
   materials, including GaN and InGaN. Bulk thermal properties are poor
   estimates of thin film properties due to increased boundary and defect
   scattering of phonons in the films. By examining real nitride based LED
   architectures with the 3-omega technique, thin film thermal
   conductivities of nucleation, buffer, contact, and active regions were
   measured from 100-400K. We find that the AlN nucleation layer is a
   bottleneck to heat transfer, having a thermal conductivity (x) two
   orders of magnitude less than bulk crystalline AlN. Further, the
   temperature dependent behavior is characteristic of an amorphous solid.
   TEM images of the AlN layer show a very high dislocation density
   (4x10(10) cm(-2)). We hypothesize that scattering from these
   dislocations as well as the film boundaries, causes the observed
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{To predict the thermal conductivity of a dielectric or insulating
   material requires the phonon frequencies and lifetimes. Techniques for
   predicting these quantities have been proposed based in molecular
   dynamics simulation and lattice dynamics calculations. Here, two
   expressions for the phonon spectral energy density are described and
   applied to two test systems: Lennard-Jones argon and Stillinger-Weber
   silicon. One spectral energy density expression is derived from lattice
   dynamics theory, while the other uses only the atomic velocities from
   molecular dynamics simulation. We find that while the spectral energy
   density using only atomic velocities can predict the phonon frequencies,
   it is not generally able to predict the lifetimes due to terms omitted
   in the derivation.}},

Abstract = {{Raindrops on vehicles' windshields can degrade the performance of
   in-vehicle vision systems. In this paper, we present a novel approach
   that detects and removes raindrops in the captured image when using a
   single in-vehicle camera. When driving in light or moderate rainy
   conditions, raindrops appear as small circlets on the windshield in each
   image frame. Therefore, by analyzing the color, texture and shape
   characteristics of raindrops in images, we first identify possible
   raindrop candidates in the regions of interest (ROI), which are small
   locally salient droplets in a raindrop saliency map. Then, a
   learning-based verification algorithm is proposed to reduce the number
   of false alarms (i.e., clear regions mis-detected as raindrops).
   Finally, we fill in the regions occupied by the raindrops using image
   inpainting techniques. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed
   method is capable of detecting and reducing raindrops in various rain
   and road scenarios. We also quantify the improvement offered by the
   proposed method over the state-of-the-art algorithms aimed at the same
   problem and the benefits to the in-vehicle vision applications like
   clear path detection.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of facial features is a key pre-processing step in enabling
   facial recognition, building of 3D facial models, expression analysis,
   and pose estimation. Recently, graph cuts based algorithms have been
   adapted to carry out this task but many of these methods require manual
   initialization of points in the foreground and background. In this
   paper, we propose a novel and fully automatic approach, named FaceCut,
   to perform accurate facial feature segmentation. FaceCut combines the
   positive features of the Modified Active Shape Model (MASM) and GrowCut

Abstract = {{With the proposed penetration of electric vehicles and advanced metering
   technology, the demand side is foreseen to play a major role in flexible
   energy consumption scheduling. On the other hand, over the past several
   years, there has been a growing interest for the utility companies to
   integrate more renewable energy resources. Such renewable resources,
   e.g., wind or solar, due to their intermittent nature, brought great
   uncertainty to the power grid system. In this paper, we propose a
   mechanism that attempts to mitigate the resulting grid operational
   uncertainty by properly exploiting the potentials offered by demand
   flexibility. To address the challenge, we develop a novel locational
   marginal price (LMP) based pricing scheme that involves active demand
   side participation by casting the network objectives as a two-stage
   Stackelberg game between the local grid operator and several
   aggregators. We use the solution concept of subgame perfect equilibrium
   to analyze the resulting game and derive the optimal pricing scheme.
   Subsequently, we discuss the optimal real time conventional capacity
   planning for the local grid operator to achieve the minimal mismatch
   between supply and demand with the wind power integration. Finally, we
   assess our proposed scheme with field data. The simulation results
   further confirm the optimality of our scheme and suggest reasonably well
   long term performance with simplified heuristic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{AC power system state estimation process aims to produce a real-time
   ``snapshot{''} model for the network. Therefore, a grand challenge to
   the newly built smart grid is how to ``optimally{''} estimate the state
   with increasing uncertainties, such as intermittent wind power
   generation or inconsecutive vehicle charging. Mathematically, such
   estimation problems are usually formulated as Weighted Least Square
   (WLS) problems in literature. As the problems are nonconvex, current
   solvers, for instance the ones implementing the Newton's method, for
   these problems often achieve local optimum, rather than the much desired
   global optimum. Due to this local optimum issue, current estimators may
   lead to incorrect user power cut-offs or even costly blackouts in the
   volatile smart grid. To initialize the iterative solver, in this paper,
   we propose utilizing historical data as well as fast-growing
   computational power of Energy Management System, to efficiently obtain a
   good initial state. Specifically, kernel ridge regression is proposed in
   a Bayesian framework based on Nearest Neighbors search. Simulation
   results of the proposed method show that the new method produces an
   initial guess excelling current industrial approach.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a fully distributed framework for sequential
   recursive state estimation in inter-connected electrical power systems.
   Specifically, the setup considered involves a grid partitioned into
   multiple control areas that communicate over a sparse communication
   network. In the absence of a global sensor data fusion center (the
   conventional centralized SCADA) and with sensing model uncertainties, an
   adaptive distributed state estimation approach, the D A E, is proposed
   in which the system control areas engage in a collaborative joint
   (model) learning and (state) estimation procedure through sequential
   information exchange over the pre-assigned communication network. The
   proposed distributed estimation methodology is recursive, in that, each
   system control area refines its state estimate at a given sampling
   instant by suitably combining its past estimate with the newly collected
   local measurement(s) and the information obtained from its communication
   neighbors. Under rather weak assumptions of global observability and
   connectivity of the control area communication network, the proposed
   distributed adaptive scheme is shown to yield consistent system state
   estimates (i.e., estimates that converge to the true system state in the
   large sample limit), the convergence rate being optimal in the Fisher
   information sense. As discussed, the proposed approach based on local
   communication and computation is suitable for real-time implementation
   as opposed to conventional centralized SCADA based estimation
   architectures with periodic data gathering and processing, thus being
   potentially more responsive and adaptive to sensed data generated by
   advanced non-conventional sensing resources like the PMUs with
   significantly higher system sampling rates.}},
