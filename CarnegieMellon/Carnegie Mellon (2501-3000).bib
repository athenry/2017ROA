Abstract = {{Active intracellular cargo transport is essential to survival and
   function of eukaryotic cells. How this process is controlled spatially
   and temporally so that the right cargo is delivered to the right
   destination at the right time remains poorly understood. To address this
   question, it is essential to characterize and analyze the molecular
   machinery and spatiotemporal behavior of intracellular transport. To
   this end, we developed related computational image models. Specifically,
   to study the molecular machinery of intracellular transport, we
   developed anisotropic spatial density kernels for reconstruction and
   segmentation of related super-resolution STORM (stochastic optical
   reconstruction microscopy) images. To study the spatiotemporal behavior
   of intracellular transport, we developed hidden Markov models and
   principal component analysis for representation and analysis of movement
   of individual transported cargoes. We validated and benchmarked the
   image models using simulated and actual experimental images. The models
   and related computational analysis methods developed in this study are
   general and can be used for studying molecular machinery and
   spatiotemporal dynamics of other cellular processes.}},

Abstract = {{An image analysis algorithm is described that utilizes a Graphics

   tissue layer present in an OCT image obtained by a prototype SDOCT
   corneal imaging system. The system has a scanning depth range of 6mm and
   can acquire 15 volumes per second at the cost of lower resolution and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than diagnostic OCT scanners. To the best of
   our knowledge, we are the first to experiment with non-median percentile
   filtering for simultaneous noise reduction and feature enhancement in
   OCT images, and we believe we are the first to implement any form of
   non-median percentile filtering on a GPU. The algorithm was applied to
   five different test images. On an average, it took similar to 0.5
   milliseconds to preprocess an image with a 20th-percentile filter, and
   similar to 1.7 milliseconds for our second-stage algorithm to detect the
   faintly imaged transparent surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a subspace system identification for estimating the
   stiffness matrix and flexural rigidities of a shear building under
   earthquake. Subspace SI is a kind of inverse problem and suffers from
   inherent instabilities caused by modeling error and measurement noise.
   The size of Hankel matrix (k(m+p)xT(w)/Delta t), which represents the
   amount of selected dynamic data among measured responses, is closely
   related to the accuracy and numerical instability of estimated system
   matrices. The numerical instability and accuracy of subspace SI is
   investigated through the estimation error curve of stiffness matrix. The
   estimation error curve is obtained with respect to the number of block
   row(k) and sampling rate (Delta t) for various time window size (T-w)
   using a prior finite element model of a shear building. k,Delta t and
   T-w resulting in a target accuracy level, are determined through this
   curve considering the computational cost of subspace identification. The
   validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through the numerical
   example of a five-story shear building model with and without damage.}},

Abstract = {{Optical sensors that are applied in conjunction with bright optical
   sources such as lasers typically have to be protected from damaging
   light exposure levels by the use of optical limiters. The principal aims
   for optical limiter materials are: (1) to block selectively the
   frequency of interest at high light levels and - at low light levels -
   exhibit high transmittance of optical frequencies in order to enable the
   fabrication of transparent yet protective windows; (2) a rapid response
   time when exposed to high light levels. Novel opportunities for the
   design of materials with dynamic switchable limiting properties are
   provided by optically transparent two-photon active polymer
   nanocomposites materials in which the scattering strength of embedded
   particle fillers can be dynamically modulated by the nonlinear
   absorption of a polymer host medium. In a first part this contribution
   will present recent results on the synthesis of silica nanoparticles
   that are index-matched to organic solvents by means of polymer
   functionalization. Effective medium theory will be shown to provide a
   valuable tool in predicting polymer-graft compositions that are
   index-matched to the embedding solvent thus resulting in dramatically
   reduced linear scattering cross section of the particle dispersant. The
   second part of this contribution will present preliminary results on the
   linear and nonlinear optical properties of particle dispersions in both
   solvent and solutions of two-photon active (TPA) dyes. For mixed
   solutions of TPA-dyes and index-matched particle fillers an increased
   limiting efficiency is observed while neat particles are found to be TPA
   inactive.}},

Abstract = {{Endoleaks may evolve and become severe post-surgical complications in
   patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). After endovascular
   aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), endoleaks may induce EVAR failure.
   Therefore, the early detection and management of endoleak development
   could help reduce the need for reoperation. An endoleak is characterized
   by blood flow that leaks into the cavity between the stent-graft (SG)
   and aneurysm sac. Comprehensive hemodynamic analysis can identify the
   relationship of flow-induced wall stress and endoleak formation. Given
   this hypothesis, a numerical analysis of fluid-structure interaction was
   performed in this study. SG geometry and AAA flow dynamics were
   incorporated using the physiological conditions of three
   patient-specific models of AAA after EVAR. Endoleak locations were well
   matched to the local peak locations of von Mises stress in the aneurysm
   bulges of these patients. Further investigation on the associated blood
   flow structures could provide insights on the physical relationship
   between hemodynamic force and endoleak formation. The presented
   analytical procedure offers a reliable alternative for endoleak
   prediction and detection. This method may be used for post-EVAR patient
   care with sophisticated imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance,
   computed tomography, and digital subtraction angiography.}},

   then used as a guidance for the cross field construction. Finally, a
   global parameterization is computed on the surface, with an anisotropy
   enabled by adapting the cross field to non-uniform parametric line
   spacings. By combining the gradient information from different
   eigenfunctions, the generated parametric lines are automatically aligned
   with the structural features at various scales, and they are insensitive
   to local detailed features on the surface when low-mode eigenfunctions

Abstract = {{The syntheses of water network systems are usually performed by
   minimizing the total annual cost. In this contribution, Mixed Integer
   Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) syntheses of water networks are performed
   by using various economic objectives, in order to investigate their
   effects on the structural, environmental, and economic characteristics
   of optimal water networks. Batch-semicontinuous and isothermal
   continuous water networks were analyzed during this study. Significant
   differences between optimal networks were obtained when using different
   economic objectives. Minimization of freshwater costs produced highly
   integrated designs with high levels of water reuse, regeneration reuse
   or recycling, but low profitability. In contrast, maximization of the
   internal rate of return resulted in highly profitable designs with low

Abstract = {{We present a versatile non-contact micromanipulation approach using the
   rotational flows locally induced by rotation of spherical magnetic
   microrobots in liquid environments. Micro-scale objects in close
   vicinity to the rotating microrobot are trapped inside the induced
   rotational flows and carried along with the robot as it translates on a
   planar surface by rotational motion. The proposed approach can handle a
   wide range of object sizes, and manipulate objects larger than the robot
   and significantly denser than water. Trapping and transport of
   individual human myeloid leukemia cells and swimming flagellated
   bacteria using this method has also been demonstrated. The proposed
   approach requires no special surface pattern or spatial structure, and
   hence is directly compatible with existing micro fluidic devices.}},

   and overflow) associated with fixed-point arithmetic into the training
   process so that the resulting classifiers are robust to these
   non-idealities. Mathematically, LDA-FP is formulated as a mixed integer
   programming problem that can be efficiently solved by a novel
   branch-and-bound method proposed in this paper. Our numerical
   experiments demonstrate that LDA-FP substantially outperforms the
   conventional approach for the emerging biomedical application of brain

Abstract = {{Our earlier lane-marking detection method identified lane-markings
   appearing on an input image based on the intensity contrast between
   lane-markings pixels and their neighboring pixels. This detection
   results in outputs with nearly-zero false negatives, but with many false
   positives. To filter out these false positives in a principled way, we
   utilize the driving direction of a roadway. We do this because
   longitudinal lane-markings delineate the driving direction of a road and
   the orientations of any true, longitudinal lane-markings appearing on
   input images should be aligned with this direction. To approximate the
   driving direction of a road, we detect the vanishing point on a horizon
   line and draw a line to link the image coordinates of the detected
   vanishing point to those of the center of the image bottom. We then
   filter out any lane-marking blobs if their orientations are not aligned
   with that of the approximated driving direction. Through testing with
   streets and inter-city highway images, the proposed method demonstrates
   its effectiveness.}},

   technological feasibility. But as the technology evolves, improving user
   experience through learning expert's or individual's driving pattern
   emerges as a promising research direction. As a first step toward this
   goal, we investigate methods to learn from human demonstrations in urban
   scenarios without any environmental disturbances (traffic-free). We
   propose a path model that generates a reference path with smooth and
   peak-value-reduced curvature, and a parameterized speed model to be
   fitted by human driving data. Model parameters are then learned through
   regression methods, and certain statistical human driving patterns are
   revealed. The learned model is then evaluated by comparing the generated
   plan with the collected data by the same human driver.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel planning framework that can greatly
   improve the level of intelligence and driving quality of autonomous
   vehicles. A reference planning layer first generates kinematically and
   dynamically feasible paths assuming no obstacles on the road, then a
   behavioral planning layer takes static and dynamic obstacles into
   account. Instead of directly commanding a desired trajectory, it
   searches for the best directives for the controller, such as lateral
   bias and distance keeping aggressiveness. It also considers the social
   cooperation between the autonomous vehicle and surrounding cars. Based
   on experimental results from both simulation and a real autonomous
   vehicle platform, the proposed behavioral planning architecture improves
   the driving quality considerably, with a 90.3\% reduction of required
   computation time in representative scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Parking is a major problem of car transportation, with important
   implications in traffic congestion and urban landscape. Reducing the
   space needed to park cars has led to the development of fully automated
   and mechanical parking systems. These systems are, however, limitedly
   deployed because of their construction and maintenance costs. Leveraging
   on semi and fully-autonomous vehicular technology, as well as on the
   electric propulsion paradigm and in vehicular ad hoc networking, we
   propose a new parking concept where the mobility of parked vehicles is
   managed by a parking lot controller to create space for cars entering or
   exiting the parking lot, in a collaborative manner. We show that the
   space needed to park such vehicles can be reduced to half the space
   needed with conventional parking lot designs. We also show that the
   total travelled distance of vehicles in this new parking lot paradigm
   can be 30\% less than in conventional parking lots. Our proposal can
   have important consequences in parking costs and in urban landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Locating facial feature points is an important step for many facial
   image analysis tasks. Over the past few years, Active Shape Model (ASM)
   has become one of the most popular approaches to solve this problem.
   However, ASM-based methods are sensitive to initialization errors caused
   by poor face detection results. In this paper, an effective
   initialization for the ASM-based methods is proposed by our improved
   initial 8-landmarks ASM model together with Viola-Jones eye detection.
   In particular, we apply the 8-landmarks ASM model with the position of
   eyes from eye detector as reference points. After that, we choose
   several 76-landmark candidates from the training set that have the key
   feature points related to the result of the previous 8-landmark model.
   The best candidate has the lowest fitting errors with the test image and
   is used as initialization. To evaluate the performance of our work, we
   conduct the experiments on the MUCT and LFPW database. Compared to the
   latest ASM implementation, MASM, our proposed can improved the MASM by
   an average accuracy of 44\% when dealing with poor initialization.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) has become a powerful
   popular non-invasive tool for detecting biomarkers of various types of
   subtle pediatric cardiomyopathies yielding BIG temporal, high-resolution
   data. The complexities associated with the annotation of images and
   extraction of markers, necessitate the development of efficient
   workflows to acquire, manage and transform this data into actionable
   knowledge for patient care. We develop and test a novel framework called
   CMRI-BED for biomarker extraction and discovery from pediatric cardiac
   MRI data involving the use of a suite of tools for image processing,
   marker extraction and predictive modeling. We applied the workflow to
   obtain and analyze a small dataset containing CMRI-derived biomarkers
   for classifying positive versus negative findings of cardiomyopathy in
   children. Preliminary results show the feasibility of our framework for
   processing such data while also yielding actionable predictive
   classification rules that can augment knowledge conveyed in cardiac
   radiology outcome reports.}},

Abstract = {{Spherical gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been synthesized in aqueous
   solutions using sodium citrate (SC) and tannic acid (TA) as reducing and
   stabilizing agents. Upon addition of TA and compared to the GNP TA-free
   aqueous solutions, a reduction of the GNPs size and consequently a
   dramatic change of their optical properties have been observed and
   quantitatively analyzed using Mie theory. An increase in the
   concentration of TA reveals a modification of the colloidal solution
   refractive index that is evidenced by the shift in the peak position of
   the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band. The variations of
   the peak absorbance with the TA concentration are examined in the low
   and high concentration regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection on dynamic real-world networks such as large caller
   networks and online social networks is a very difficult problem,
   analogous to looking for a needle in a haystack. This paper considers
   detecting churners in a 3.7 million mobile phone network. The two main
   issues are designing fast and efficient features and classifiers. We
   discuss both in this paper. We associate every caller in the network
   with an activity vector and an affinity graph, and our features are
   derived from activity levels computed from subgraphs of the affinity
   graph. These features reflect the graph-dependent nature of the problem.
   To compute these networks expeditiously, we extend as integral affinity
   graphs the concept of integral images. Our anomaly classifier is a
   cascaded classifier with stages that combine naive Bayes and decision
   tree classifiers. Simulations with a 3.7 million cell phone user network
   illustrate an anomaly classifier that reaches a false alarm rate of
   0.8\% with a churn detection rate of 71\%.}},

Abstract = {{One of the largest challenges for multichannel localization systems is
   developing methodologies that are robust to interference. Unlike noise,
   interference is not random and often has characteristics resembling the
   true signals of interest. Interference often originates from multipath
   propagation, jamming signals, or other sources. In this paper, we
   demonstrate that we can significantly improve localization performance
   in the presence of interference through the use of a random sensor
   topology and matched field processing. To show this, we apply concepts
   and results from random matrix theory and compressed sensing. We
   demonstrate theoretically that random sensor topologies allow us to
   achieve performance characteristics similar to those of random noise.
   Specifically, we show that the localization performance improves, with a
   high probability, at a rate proportional to the number of sensors in the
   system. We verify these results through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed optimization where N nodes in a generic,

   convex costs. Existing literature proposes distributed gradient-like
   methods that are attractive due to computationally cheap iterations and
   provable resilience to random inter-node communication failures, but
   such methods have slow theoretical and empirical convergence rates.
   Building from the centralized Nesterov gradient methods, we propose
   accelerated distributed gradient-like methods and establish that they
   achieve strictly faster rates than existing distributed methods. At the
   same time, our methods maintain cheap iterations and resilience to
   random communication failures. Specifically, for convex, differentiable
   local costs with Lipschitz continuous and bounded derivative, we
   establish (with respect to the cost function optimality) convergence in
   probability and convergence rates in expectation and in second moment.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we use a superstrucutre optimization approach for the
   comparison between traditional biodiesel plants and the integration of
   glycerol to methanol production or its use to obtain ethanol within the
   production of biodiesel from algae. In the first case the glycerol is
   reformed, either autoreforming or steam reforming, the raw syngas
   purified and whose composition (H-2:CO ratio) is adjusted for the
   production of methanol. The methanol once purified is used for the
   transesterification of the oil produced from the algae. In the second
   case we take advantage of the fact that the algae composition allows the
   simultaneous production of ethanol and biodiesel. The starch is
   liquified and saccharified to obtain glucose that is fermented to
   ethanol. On the other hand, the oil is transesterified with ethanol to
   produce biodiesel, either using an enzymatic or an homogeneous
   catalysts. The glycerol is fermented to ethanol. Both water-ethanol,
   streams from glucose and from glycerol are fed to a multieffect column
   and later to a molecular sieve. The dehydrated ethanol is used for the
   transesterification of the oil while the excess is sold as biofuel.
   Glycerol as byproduct is still interesting as long as its price is over
   \$0.05 /kg. In terms of integrated facilities, the use of glycerol to

Abstract = {{This contribution focuses on those renewable sources used within the
   transportation sector. As in the short-term only biofuels from biomass
   might provide an alternative that can be implemented (Martin and
   Grossmann, 2013), this contribution deals with biofuels production. A
   generic multi-period model is applied for the efficient synthesis of
   large-scale biorefinery supply networks. This model, which was
   previously developed by the authors (Cucek et al., 2013), is upgraded
   using different model reduction techniques (Lam et al., 2011) in order
   to be applied cross-regionally throughout the European Union (EU).
   Several first, second, and third generations of biofuel production
   technologies are considered (Cucek et al., 2013), and applied to a case
   study of the EU. The results show that miscanthus and algae are
   particularly promising raw materials for producing biofuels capable to
   economically substitute significantly more than 10 \% of fossil fuels
   for transportation at the EU level.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses an integrated framework for deciding about the
   supplier selection in processed food supply chains that accounts for
   tactical production and distribution planning. We are especially
   concerned with the option of producing with local or mainstream raw
   materials. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it
   proposes a new multi-objective two-stage stochastic mixed-integer
   programming model for the supplier selection that maximizes the profit
   and minimizes the risk of a low customer service. Secondly, the main
   complexities of processed food supply chains management are considered:
   perishability of raw materials and final products, uncertainty at
   downstream and upstream parameters, and customer willingness to pay.
   Results indicate that dual sourcing is a strategy to be pursued across
   several scenarios. The multi-objective approach shows that a small
   decrease in the expected value of profit results in a significant
   increase in the customer service. Acknowledging the increase in
   customers willing to pay for local products is also fundamental.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of various meteorological parameters such as temperature,
   wind speed, absolute humidity, precipitation and mixing height on PM2.5
   concentrations over Europe were examined using a three-dimensional
   chemical transport model, PMCAMx-2008. Our simulations covered three
   periods, representative of different seasons (summer, winter, and fall).
   PM2.5 appears to be more sensitive to temperature changes compared to
   the other meteorological parameters in all seasons.
   PM2.5 generally decreases as temperature increases, although the
   predicted changes vary significantly in space and time, ranging from
   -700 ng m(-3) K-1 (-8\% K-1) to 300 ng m(-3) K-1 (7\% K-1). The
   predicted decreases of PM2.5 are mainly due to evaporation of ammonium
   nitrate, while the higher biogenic emissions and the accelerated
   gas-phase reaction rates increase the production of organic aerosol (OA)
   and sulfate, having the opposite effect on PM2.5. The predicted
   responses of PM2.5 to absolute humidity are also quite variable, ranging
   from -130 ng m(-3)\%(-1) (-1.6\% \%(-1)) to 160 ng m(-3) \%(-1)
   (1.6\%\%(-1)) dominated mainly by changes in inorganic PM2.5 species. An
   increase in absolute humidity favors the partitioning of nitrate to the
   aerosol phase and increases the average PM2.5 during summer and fall.
   Decreases in sulfate and sea salt levels govern the average PM2.5
   response to humidity during winter. A decrease of wind speed (keeping
   the emissions constant) increases all PM2.5 species (on average 40 ng
   m(-3) \%(-1)) due to changes in dispersion and dry deposition. The wind
   speed effects on sea salt emissions are significant for PM2.5
   concentrations over water and in coastal areas. Increases in
   precipitation have a negative effect on PM2.5 (decreases up to 110 ng
   m(-3) \%(-1)) in all periods due to increases in wet deposition of PM2.5
   species and their gas precursors. Changes in mixing height have the
   smallest effects (up to 35 ng m(-3) \%(-1)) on PM2.5.
   Regarding the relative importance of each of the meteorological
   parameters in a changed future climate, the projected changes in
   precipitation are expected to have the largest impact on PM2.5 levels
   during all periods (changes up to 2 mu g m(-3) in the fall). The
   expected effects in future PM2.5 levels due to wind speed changes are
   similar in all seasons and quite close to those resulting from future
   precipitation changes (up to 1.4 mu g m(-3)). The expected increases in
   absolute humidity in the future can lead to large changes in PM2.5
   levels (increases up to 2 mu g m(-3)) mainly in the fall due to changes
   in particulate nitrate levels. Despite the high sensitivity of PM2.5
   levels to temperature, the small expected increases of temperature in
   the future will lead to modest PM2.5 changes and will not dominate the
   overall change.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a liquid-phase metal electrode to be used with
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) for a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA).
   DEAs are favorable for soft-matter applications where high efficiency
   and response times are desirable. A consistent challenge faced during
   the fabrication of these devices is the selection and deposition of
   electrode material. While numerous designs have been demonstrated with a
   variety of conductive elastomers and greases, these materials have
   significant and often intrinsic shortcomings, e.g. low conductivity,
   hysteresis, incapability of large deformations, and complex fabrication
   requirements. The liquid metal alloy eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) is
   a promising alternative to existing compliant electrodes, having both
   high conductivity and complete soft-matter functionality. The liquid
   electrode shares almost the same electrical conductivity as conventional
   metal wiring and provides no mechanical resistance to bending or
   stretching of the DEA. This research establishes a straightforward and
   effective method for quickly depositing EGaIn electrodes, which can be
   adapted for batch fabrication, and demonstrates the successful actuation
   of sample curved cantilever elastomer actuators using these electrodes.
   As with the vast majority of electrostatically actuated elastomer
   devices, the voltage requirements for these curved DEAs are still quite
   significant, though modifications to the fabrication process show some
   improved electrical properties. The ease and speed with which this
   method can be implemented suggests that the development of a more
   electronically efficient device is realistic and worthwhile.}},

Abstract = {{Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a chemical reaction that can occur
   between alkaline components in cement paste and reactive forms of silica
   in susceptible aggregates when sufficient moisture is present. The ASR
   product, known as ASR gel, can cause expansion and cracking that damages
   the structure. We pass ultrasonic signals through concrete laboratory
   specimens and use three different ultrasonic methods to detect the onset
   of ASR damage, or the presence of ASR damage while still at the
   microscale. Our test specimens are fabricated with aggregate known to be
   reactive and are then exposed to an aggressive environment to accelerate
   ASR development. We use swept-sine excitations and obtain pitch-catch
   records from specimens that have been exposed to the accelerated
   environment. From this data, we demonstrate an ultrasonic passband
   method shows high frequency components diminish faster than low
   frequency components, and therefore the ultrasonic passband shifts to
   the low frequency side due to ASR damage. The test results also show
   that the ultrasonic passband is logically related to specimen size. We
   also demonstrate a stretching factor method is able to track the
   progress of ASR damage in concrete very well. These methods are shown to
   be more reliable than attenuation spectrum or attenuation methods that
   do not detect the ASR damage in concrete at early stages.}},

Abstract = {{Guided waves can propagate long distances and are sensitive to subtle
   structural damage. Guided-wave based damage localization often requires
   extracting the scatter signal(s) produced by damage, which is typically
   obtained by subtracting an intact baseline record from a record to be
   tested. However, in practical applications, environmental and
   operational conditions (EOC) dramatically affect guided wave signals. In
   this case, the baseline subtraction process can no longer perfectly
   remove the baseline, thereby defeating localization algorithms.
   In previous work, we showed that singular value decomposition (SVD) can
   be used to detect the presence of damage under large EOC variations,
   because it can differentiate the trends of damage from other EOC
   variations. This capability of differentiation implies that SVD can also
   robustly extract a scatter signal, originating from damage in the
   structure, that is not affected by temperature variation. This process
   allows us to extract a scatterer signal without the challenges
   associated with traditional temperature compensation and baseline
   subtraction routines.. In this work, we use to approach to localize
   structural damage in large, spatially and temporally varying EOCs.
   We collect pitch-catch records from randomly placed PZT transducers on
   an aluminum plate while undergoing temperature variations. Damage is
   introduced to the plate during the monitoring period. We then use our
   SVD method to extract the scatter signal from the records, and use the
   scatter signal to localize damage using the delay-and-sum method. To
   compare results, we also apply several temperature compensation methods
   to the records and then perform baseline subtraction. We show that our
   SVD-based approach successfully localize damage while current
   temperature-compensated baseline subtraction methods fail.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a room-level building occupancy estimation
   system (BOES) utilizing low-resolution vibration sensors that are
   sparsely distributed. Many ubiquitous computing and building maintenance
   systems require fine-grained occupancy knowledge to enable occupant
   centric services and optimize space and energy utilization. The sensing
   infrastructure support for current occupancy estimation systems often
   requires multiple intrusive sensors per room, resulting in systems that
   are both costly to deploy and difficult to maintain. To address these
   shortcomings, we developed BOES. BOES utilizes sparse vibration sensors
   to track occupancy levels and activities. Our system has three major
   components. 1) It extracts features that distinguish occupant activities
   from noise prone ambient vibrations and detects human footsteps. 2)
   Using a sequence of footsteps, the system localizes and tracks
   individuals by observing changes in the sequences It uses this tracking
   information to identify when an occupant leaves or enters a room. 3) The
   entering and leaving room information are combined with detected
   individual location information to update the room-level occupancy state
   of the building. Through validation experiments in two different
   buildings, our system was able to achieve 99.55\% accuracy for event
   detection, less than three feet average error for localization, and 85\%
   accuracy in occupancy counting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the current status of global modeling of the
   organic aerosol (OA) in the troposphere and analyzes the differences
   between models as well as between models and observations. Thirty-one
   global chemistry transport models (CTMs) and general circulation models
   (GCMs) have participated in this intercomparison, in the framework of
   AeroCom phase II. The simulation of OA varies greatly between models in
   terms of the magnitude of primary emissions, secondary OA (SOA)
   formation, the number of OA species used (2 to 62), the complexity of OA
   parameterizations (gas-particle partitioning, chemical aging, multiphase
   chemistry, aerosol microphysics), and the OA physical, chemical and
   optical properties. The diversity of the global OA simulation results
   has increased since earlier AeroCom experiments, mainly due to the
   increasing complexity of the SOA parameterization in models, and the
   implementation of new, highly uncertain, OA sources. Diversity of over
   one order of magnitude exists in the modeled vertical distribution of OA
   concentrations that deserves a dedicated future study. Furthermore,
   although the OA/OC ratio depends on OA sources and atmospheric
   processing, and is important for model evaluation against OA and OC
   observations, it is resolved only by a few global models.
   The median global primary OA (POA) source strength is 56 Tg a(-1) (range
   34-144 Tg a(-1)) and the median SOA source strength (natural and
   anthropogenic) is 19 Tg a(-1) (range 13-121 Tg a(-1)). Among the models
   that take into account the semi-volatile SOA nature, the median source
   is calculated to be 51 Tg a(-1) (range 16-121 Tg a(-1)), much larger
   than the median value of the models that calculate SOA in a more
   simplistic way (19 Tg a(-1); range 13-20 Tg a(-1), with one model at 37
   Tg a(-1)). The median atmospheric burden of OA is 1.4 Tg (24 models in
   the range of 0.6-2.0 Tg and 4 between 2.0 and 3.8 Tg), with a median OA
   lifetime of 5.4 days (range 3.8-9.6 days). In models that reported both
   OA and sulfate burdens, the median value of the OA/sulfate burden ratio
   is calculated to be 0.77; 13 models calculate a ratio lower than 1, and
   9 models higher than 1. For 26 models that reported OA deposition
   fluxes, the median wet removal is 70 Tg a(-1) (range 28-209 Tg a(-1)),
   which is on average 85\% of the total OA deposition.
   Fine aerosol organic carbon (OC) and OA observations from continuous
   monitoring networks and individual field campaigns have been used for
   model evaluation. At urban locations, the model-observation comparison
   indicates missing knowledge on anthropogenic OA sources, both strength
   and seasonality. The combined model-measurements analysis suggests the
   existence of increased OA levels during summer due to biogenic SOA
   formation over large areas of the USA that can be of the same order of
   magnitude as the POA, even at urban locations, and contribute to the
   measured urban seasonal pattern.
   Global models are able to simulate the high secondary character of OA
   observed in the atmosphere as a result of SOA formation and POA aging,
   although the amount of OA present in the atmosphere remains largely
   underestimated, with a mean normalized bias (MNB) equal to -0.62 (-0.51)
   based on the comparison against OC (OA) urban data of all models at the
   surface, -0.15 (+0.51) when compared with remote measurements, and -0.30
   for marine locations with OC data. The mean temporal correlations across
   all stations are low when compared with OC (OA) measurements: 0.47
   (0.52) for urban stations, 0.39 (0.37) for remote stations, and 0.25 for
   marine stations with OC data. The combination of high (negative) MNB and
   higher correlation at urban stations when compared with the low MNB and
   lower correlation at remote sites suggests that knowledge about the
   processes that govern aerosol processing, transport and removal, on top
   of their sources, is important at the remote stations. There is no clear
   change in model skill with increasing model complexity with regard to OC
   or OA mass concentration. However, the complexity is needed in models in
   order to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural OA as needed for
   climate mitigation, and to calculate the impact of OA on climate
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-electrolyte fuel cells are a promising energy-conversion
   technology. Over the last several decades significant progress has been
   made in increasing their performance and durability, of which
   continuum-level modeling of the transport processes has played an
   integral part. In this review, we examine the state-of-the-art modeling
   approaches, with a goal of elucidating the knowledge gaps and needs
   going forward in the field. In particular, the focus is on multiphase
   flow, especially in terms of understanding interactions at interfaces,
   and catalyst layers with a focus on the impacts of ionomer thin-films
   and multiscale phenomena. Overall, we highlight where there is consensus
   in terms of modeling approaches as well as opportunities for further
   improvement and clarification, including identification of several
   critical areas for future research. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by

Abstract = {{This study investigated the influence of micro-porous layer (MPL)
   surface topology on the polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) performance
   through, both experimental characterization and computational modeling.
   Studies were performed considering MPLs with varying degrees of surface
   roughness and crack size/density. In two instances, we systematically
   varied the topology by introducing water transport channels into the
   MPL. We experimentally observed that transport channels consistently
   increased the maximum current density. To investigate the reasons for
   the performance improvement, a two-dimensional, multi-phase, multi-fluid
   model was formulated with discrete domains for morphological features,
   including liquid water retention within interfacial voids and cracks.
   The model results provide evidence that the performance improvement with
   the modified MPLs is due to improved liquid water removal from the
   catalyst layer (CL). Liquid water moves laterally through the CL
   vertical bar MPL interface until it reaches the milled lines and from
   there it is removed in through-plane direction through the fibrous
   diffusion media (DM) and into the gas channel. A key outcome of this
   work is that we demonstrate a CL vertical bar MPL interface model that
   can accurately capture the effects of varying MPL surface morphology on
   PEFC performance and can be used in the design of new, optimized CL
   vertical bar MPL interface morphologies. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{A high-gain, Q-band power amplifier (PA) implemented in 45-nm
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS is presented. The PA is designed for
   fully integrated radios and provides 30.7 dB of gain to allow the
   digital baseband to fully saturate the PA at 18.7 dBm output power. This
   is achieved with an overall power-added efficiency (PAE), including all
   pre-driver and impedance matching networks, of 18.1\%. The raw PAE of
   the PA unit cell is 29\%. This PA provides the highest reported gain of
   single CMOS PAs in the Q-band and one of the highest P-sat and raw PAE
   per PA cell. In addition the digital implementation of the pre-driver
   enabled the overall die area to be smaller than comparable Q-band PAs,
   with a core area of 0.12 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the architecture, design and experiences from
   a wirelessly managed microgrid deployment in rural Les Anglais, Haiti.
   The system consists of a three-tiered architecture with a cloud-based
   monitoring and control service, a local embedded gateway infrastructure
   and a mesh network of wireless smart meters deployed at 52 buildings.
   Each smart meter device has an 802.15.4 radio that enables remote
   monitoring and control of electrical service. The meters communicate
   over a scalable multi-hop TDMA network back to a central gateway that
   manages load within the system. The gateway also provides an 802.11
   interface for an on-site operator and a cellular modem connection to a
   cloud-backend that manages and stores billing and usage data. The cloud
   backend allows occupants in each home to pre-pay for electricity at a
   particular peak power limit using a text messaging service. The system
   activates each meter within seconds and locally enforces power limits
   with provisioning for theft detection. We believe that this fine-grained
   micro-payment model can enable sustainable power in otherwise unfeasible
   areas.
   This paper provides a chronology of our deployment and installation
   strategy that involved GPS-based site mapping along with various network
   conditioning actions required as the network evolved. Finally, we
   summarize key lessons learned and hypothesis about additional hardware
   that could be used to ease the tracing of faults like short circuits and
   downed lines within microgrids.}},

   CHEMCAD coupled with MATLAB for the rigorous simulation of the
   integrated biorefinery and evaluate the algae composition for such
   integrated facility followed by energy integration using SYNHEAT and a
   detailed economic analysis. The integrated facility has a promising
   production cost for liquid fuels \$0.46/gal, almost half that in case of

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{2953-2965}},
Abstract = {{Organic compounds represent a significant fraction of submicrometer
   atmospheric aerosol mass. Even if most of these compounds are
   semi-volatile in atmospheric concentrations, the ambient organic aerosol
   volatility is quite uncertain. The most common volatility measurement
   method relies on the use of a thermodenuder (TD). The aerosol passes
   through a heated tube where its more volatile components evaporate,
   leaving the less volatile components behind in the particulate phase.
   The typical result of a thermodenuder measurement is the mass fraction
   remaining (MFR), which depends, among other factors, on the organic
   aerosol (OA) vaporization enthalpy and the accommodation coefficient. We
   use a new method combining forward modeling, introduction of
   ``experimental{''} error, and inverse modeling with error minimization
   for the interpretation of TD measurements. The OA volatility
   distribution, its effective vaporization enthalpy, the mass
   accommodation coefficient and the corresponding uncertainty ranges are
   calculated. Our results indicate that existing TD-based approaches quite
   often cannot estimate reliably the OA volatility distribution, leading
   to large uncertainties, since there are many different combinations of
   the three properties that can lead to similar thermograms. We propose an
   improved experimental approach combining TD and isothermal dilution
   measurements. We evaluate this experimental approach using the same
   model, and show that it is suitable for studies of OA volatility in the
   lab and the field.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder afflicting more
   than 1 million aging Americans, incurring \$23 billion in annual medical
   costs in the U.S. alone. Approximately 90\% Parkinson patients
   undergoing treatment have mobility related problems related to
   medication which prevent them doing their activities of daily living.
   Efficient management of PD requires complex medication regimens
   specifically titrated to individuals' needs. These personalized regimens
   are difficult to maintain for the patient and difficult to prescribe for
   a physician in the few minutes available during office visits. Diverging
   from current form of laboratory-ridden wearable sensor technologies, we
   have developed SPARK, a framework that leverages a synergistic
   combination of Smartphone and Smartwatch in monitoring multidimensional

Abstract = {{Solution-processed silver nanowire (Ag-NW) network structures are
   candidate materials for application as flexible transparent conductors
   in a wide range of flexible electronics. However, challenges remain in
   fabricating these materials in an efficient and scalable manner in
   addition to making them mechanically robust. Here, a method based on the
   direct processing of Ag-NW network structures from aqueous polymer
   solutions is presented that significantly increases the uniformity of
   the NW networks and lowers the percolation threshold, thus resulting in
   an increased figure of merit (percolative FoM Pi > 40) of Ag-NW based
   transparent conductors. Direct polymer solution processing also reduces
   the batch-to-batch variability of optical and electrical properties of
   the NW networks to <5\% of the mean (as compared to 10-20\% variability
   for pristine Ag-NW networks), and significantly improves their
   resistance to mechanical deformation. Our results further indicate that
   semicrystalline polymers such as poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) could serve
   as viable and benign alternatives to conducting polymer matrices (such
   as PEDOT:PSS) that pose a challenge to device fabrication due to their
   corrosive properties. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{The alkali-silica reaction (ASR) occurs between the reactive aggregates
   and the alkaline cement paste in concrete, eventually producing damage
   such as swelling and cracking. This research uses mechanical tests and
   ultrasonic tests to detect ASR onset in concrete specimens. The test
   specimens are fabricated in pairs, one specimen typically subjected to
   an accelerated ASR environment (immersion in 1 N NaOH solution at 80
   degrees C) and the second specimen comparable but not exposed to the
   accelerated ASR environment. In mechanical tests, the transverse and
   longitudinal resonant frequencies are measured. Results show that ASR
   damage would lower the resonant frequencies. In the ultrasonic test,
   broadband excitations are used and pitch-catch records are obtained. The
   presence of ASR damage in concrete is shown to cause frequency dependent
   ultrasonic attenuation. Signals from ASR damaged specimens show strong
   attenuation at high frequencies and weak attenuation at low frequencies.
   In contrast, signals from paired non-ASR specimens show comparable
   energy over the entire range of measured frequencies. The cumulative
   distribution function of frequency components (CDF) is used to
   characterize the ultrasonic passband changes caused by ASR damage and
   detect the existence of ASR damage in frequency domain.}},

   situational awareness by taking advantage of control theory and time
   Petri net. Linear time-invariant systems are used to model the target
   system, attacks, assets influences, and an anomaly-based intrusion

   perfectly attackable, algebraic and topological attackability conditions
   are derived. Numerical evaluation is performed to determine the impact

Abstract = {{A detailed three-dimensional regional chemical transport model
   (Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions,
   PMCAMx) was applied over Europe, focusing on the formation and chemical
   transformation of organic matter. Three periods representative of
   different seasons were simulated, corresponding to intensive field
   campaigns. An extensive set of AMS measurements was used to evaluate the
   model and, using factor-analysis results, gain more insight into the
   sources and transformations of organic aerosol (OA). Overall, the
   agreement be-tween predictions and measurements for OA concentration is
   encouraging, with the model reproducing two-thirds of the data (daily
   average mass concentrations) within a factor of 2. Oxygenated OA (OOA)
   is predicted to contribute 93\% to total OA during May, 87\% during
   winter and 96\% during autumn, with the rest consisting of fresh primary
   OA (POA). Predicted OOA concentrations compare well with the observed
   OOA values for all periods, with an average fractional error of 0.53 and
   a bias equal to -0.07 (mean error = 0.9 mu g m(-3), mean bias =-0.2 mu g
   m(-3)). The model systematically underpredicts fresh POA at most sites
   during late spring and autumn (mean bias up to -0.8 mu g m(-3)). Based
   on results from a source apportionment algorithm running in parallel
   with PMCAMx, most of the POA originates from biomass burning (fires and
   residential wood combustion), and therefore biomass burning OA is most
   likely underestimated in the emission inventory. The sensitivity of POA
   predictions to the corresponding emissions' volatility distribution is
   discussed. The model performs well at all sites when the Positive Matrix
   Factorization (PMF)-estimated low-volatility OOA is compared against the
   OA with saturation concentrations of the OA surrogate species C{*} <=
   0.1 mu g m(-3) and semivolatile OOA against the OA with C{*} > 0.1 mu g
   m(-3).}},

Abstract = {{The performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting regional model
   with chemistry (WRF-Chem) in simulating the spatial and temporal
   variations in aerosol mass, composition, and size over California is
   quantified using the extensive meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol
   measurements collected during the California Nexus of Air Quality and
   Climate Experiment (CalNex) and the Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative
   Effects Study (CARES) conducted during May and June of 2010. The overall
   objective of the field campaigns was to obtain data needed to better
   under-stand processes that affect both climate and air quality,
   including emission assessments, transport and chemical aging of
   aerosols, aerosol radiative effects. Simulations were performed that
   examined the sensitivity of aerosol concentrations to anthropogenic
   emissions and to long-range transport of aerosols into the domain
   obtained from a global model. The configuration of WRF-Chem used in this
   study is shown to reproduce the overall synoptic conditions, thermally
   driven circulations, and boundary layer structure observed in region
   that controls the transport and mixing of trace gases and aerosols.
   Reducing the default emissions inventory by 50\% led to an overall
   improvement in many simulated trace gases and black carbon aerosol at
   most sites and along most aircraft flight paths; however, simulated
   organic aerosol was closer to observed when there were no adjustments to
   the primary organic aerosol emissions. We found that sulfate was better
   simulated over northern California whereas nitrate was better simulated
   over southern California. While the overall spatial and temporal
   variability of aerosols and their precursors were simulated reasonably
   well, we show cases where the local transport of some aerosol plumes
   were either too slow or too fast, which adversely affects the statistics
   quantifying the differences between observed and simulated quantities.
   Comparisons with lidar and in situ measurements indicate that long-range
   transport of aerosols from the global model was likely too high in the
   free troposphere even though their concentrations were relatively low.
   This bias led to an over-prediction in aerosol optical depth by as much
   as a factor of 2 that offset the under-predictions of boundary-layer
   extinction resulting primarily from local emissions. Lowering the
   boundary conditions of aerosol concentrations by 50\% greatly reduced
   the bias in simulated aerosol optical depth for all regions of
   California. This study shows that quantifying regional-scale variations
   in aerosol radiative forcing and determining the relative role of
   emissions from local and distant sources is challenging during `clean'
   conditions and that a wide array of measurements are needed to ensure
   model predictions are correct for the right reasons. In this regard, the
   combined CalNex and CARES data sets are an ideal test bed that can be
   used to evaluate aerosol models in great detail and develop improved
   treatments for aerosol processes.}},

Abstract = {{People engage in routine behaviors. Automatic routine discovery goes
   beyond low-level activity recognition such as sitting or standing and
   analyzes human behaviors at a higher level (e. g., commuting to work).
   With recent developments in ubiquitous sensor technologies, it becomes
   easier to acquire a massive amount of sensor data. One main line of
   research is to mine human routines from sensor data using parametric
   topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation. The main shortcoming
   of parametric models is that it assumes a fixed, pre-specified parameter
   regardless of the data. Choosing an appropriate parameter usually
   requires an inefficient trial-and-error model selection process.
   Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find optimal parameter values
   in advance for personalized applications.
   In this paper, we present a novel nonparametric framework for human
   routine discovery that can infer high-level routines without knowing the
   number of latent topics beforehand. Our approach is evaluated on public
   datasets in two routine domains: a 34-daily-activity dataset and a
   transportation mode dataset. Experimental results show that our
   nonparametric framework can automatically learn the appropriate model
   parameters from sensor data without any form of model selection
   procedure and can outperform traditional parametric approaches for human
   routine discovery tasks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents algorithms for diagnosing the severity and location
   of damage in a laboratory bridge model. We use signal processing and
   machine learning approaches to analyze the vibration responses collected
   both directly from the bridge model and indirectly from a vehicle
   passing over the model. Features are selected using principal component
   analysis (PCA), and a regression is performed using the kernel
   regression method. Various ``damage{''} severities and positions are
   simulated on a laboratory bridge model by placing additional mass on the
   bridge. We perform two experiments; one to measure our ability to detect
   damage severity (i.e. size of the mass), and a second to measure our
   ability to detect damage location (i.e. position of the mass). In the
   first experiment, we vary the magnitude of the mass while keeping its
   location constant. In the second experiment, we vary the location of the
   mass while keeping its magnitude constant. In both cases, we use a
   portion of our data to train the algorithm, and another portion to test
   its validity. We report the accuracy of correctly quantifying the nature
   of the mass from the test data as a mean square error (MSE).}},

Abstract = {{The increasing manufacture and implementation of engineered
   nanomaterials (ENMs) will continue to lead to the release of these
   materials into the environment. Reliably assessing the environmental
   exposure risk of ENMs will depend highly on the ability to quantify and
   characterise these materials in environmental samples. However,
   performing these measurements is obstructed by the complexity of
   environmental sample matrices, physiochemical processes altering the
   state of the ENM and the high background of naturally occurring
   nanoparticles (NNPs), which may be similar in size, shape and
   composition to their engineered analogues. Current analytical techniques
   can be implemented to overcome some of these obstacles, but the ubiquity
   of NNPs presents a unique challenge requiring the exploitation of
   properties that discriminate engineered and natural nanomaterials. To
   this end, new techniques are being developed that take advantage of the
   nature of ENMs to discern them from naturally occurring analogues. This
   paper reviews the current techniques utilised in the detection and
   characterisation of ENMs in environmental samples as well as discusses
   promising new approaches to overcome the high backgrounds of NNPs.
   Despite their occurrence in the atmosphere and soil, this review will be
   limited to a discussion of aqueous-based samples containing ENMs, as
   this environment will serve as a principal medium for the environmental
   dispersion of ENMs.}},

Title = {{EVALUATION OF DEPOSITION AND COVERAGE BY AN AIR-ASSISTED SPRAYER AND TWO

Abstract = {{This study evaluated a retrofit air-assisted sprayer, a conventional
   axial-fan air-blast sprayer, and a multifan vertical air-blast sprayer
   for their application efficiency in citrus orchards. Field experiments
   involved three spray application treatments (three sprayers) replicated
   three times. Each replication included two short, two medium, and two
   tall tree canopies. Green cards and water-sensitive papers were used as
   passive samplers to evaluate spray deposition and coverage,
   respectively. The samplers were located laterally on the canopy surface
   and 0.6 m inside the canopy, and vertically at canopy heights of 0.5,
   1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m for short canopies and 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 m for
   medium and tall canopies. Pyranine 10G tracer dye dissolved in water was
   used as the spray mix. Treatments were applied at 2805 L ha(-1) (300 gal
   acre(-1)) for all sprayers, except the retrofit sprayer, for which the
   application rate varied based on the canopy size. Results revealed that
   deposition and coverage on the canopy surface was higher than at 0.6 m
   inside the canopy for all sprayer treatments and canopy sizes. The
   retrofit sprayer resulted in comparable spray deposition with 30\% and
   70\% less spray volume for medium and short canopies, respectively,
   compared to the other two sprayers. The multifan vertical sprayer
   resulted in significantly less deposition and coverage (at the 5\%
   level) for the lower sections of short canopies and for 0.6 m inside
   tall canopies. Thus, a multifan vertical sprayer may be more suited for
   applications in commercial orchards with medium, less dense, and hedged
   canopies, whereas a retrofit air-assisted sprayer may be best for all
   types of citrus canopies, as it adjusts the air-assist and liquid flow
   rates based on canopy size.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy has become a significant concern in modern society as personal
   information about individuals is increasingly collected, used, and
   shared, often using digital technologies, by a wide range of
   organizations. To mitigate privacy concerns, organizations are required
   to respect privacy laws in regulated sectors (e. g., HIPAA in
   healthcare, GLBA in financial sector) and to adhere to self-declared
   privacy policies in self-regulated sectors (e. g., privacy policies of
   companies such as Google and Facebook in Web services). This article
   provides an overview of a body of work on formalizing and enforcing
   privacy policies. We formalize privacy policies that prescribe and
   proscribe flows of personal information as well as those that place
   restrictions on the purposes for which a governed entity may use
   personal information. Recognizing that traditional preventive access
   control and information flow control mechanisms are inadequate for
   enforcing such privacy policies, we develop principled accountability
   mechanisms that seek to encourage policy-compliant behavior by detecting
   policy violations, assigning blame, and punishing violators. We apply
   these techniques to several U. S. privacy laws and organizational
   privacy policies, in particular, producing the first complete logical
   specification and audit of all disclosure-related clauses of the HIPAA
   Privacy Rule.}},

Abstract = {{Transport, toxicity, and therefore risks of engineered nanoparticles
   (ENPs) are unquestionably tied to interactions between those particles
   and surfaces. In this study, we proposed the simple and untested
   hypothesis that coating type can be the predominant factor affecting
   attachment of ENPs to silica surfaces across a range of ENP and coating
   types, effectively masking the contribution of the particle core to
   deposition behaviour. To test this hypothesis, TiO2, Ag-0 and C-60
   nanoparticles with either no coating or one of three types of adsorbed
   macromolecules (poly(acrylic acid), humic acid and bovine serum albumin)
   were prepared. The particle size and adsorbed layer thicknesses were
   characterised using dynamic light scattering and soft particle
   electrokinetic modelling. The attachment efficiencies of the
   nanoparticles to silica surfaces (glass beads) were measured in column
   experiments and compared with predictions from a semi-empirical
   correlation between attachment efficiency and coated particle properties
   that included particle size and layer thickness. For the nanoparticles
   and adsorbed macromolecules in this study, the attachment efficiencies
   could not be explained solely by the coating type. Therefore, the
   hypothesis that adsorbed macromolecules will mask the particle core and
   control attachment was disproved, and information on the properties of
   both the nanoparticle surface (e. g. charge and hydrophobicity) and
   adsorbed macromolecule (e. g. molecular weight, charge density extended
   layer thickness) will be required to explain or predict interactions of
   coated nanoparticles with surfaces in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{A sonochemical Pd seeding method for Cu electroless deposition (Cu ELD)
   is introduced in this study. Pd seeds, used as catalysts for Cu ELD,
   were deposited on a Ta/TaN diffusion barrier by ultrasound irradiation.
   The existence of Pd seeds on the substrate by irradiation was confirmed
   with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Cu
   ELD on the Pd-seeded substrate was successfully achieved. The formation
   of an electroless Cu film was strongly affected by the process
   parameters for sonochemical Pd seeding, such as the distance between the
   tip of the ultrasonic probe and a substrate, chemical composition of the
   seeding solution and ultrasound irradiation time. Those parameters were
   decisive factors in changing the deposition uniformity and number
   density of the Pd seeds. From the parametric study, we obtained a
   continuous electroless Cu film with good adhesion strength and low
   resistivity at the optimum condition. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{We present an overview of results from an enhanced sub-grid scale
   approach to characterize air quality impacts of aircraft emissions at
   the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International airport (in the U.S.) for
   June and July 2002 using an adaptation of CMAQ called the Advanced
   Modeling System for Transport, Emissions, Reactions, and Deposition of
   Atmospheric Matter (AMSTERDAM). Aircraft emissions during the landing
   and takeoff cycle (LTO) and below 3,000 m were represented as
   plume-in-grid (PInG) emissions using AMSTERDAM's PInG treatment. Initial
   results from CMAQ-AMSTERDAM focusing on impacts from aircraft emissions
   to inorganic PM2.5 and total PM2.5 indicated aircraft increased average
   total PM2.5 concentrations by up to 235 ng m(-3) near the airport and by
   1-7 ng m(-3) throughout the Atlanta metro area. However, aircraft
   reduced concentrations by 0.5-1 ng m(-3) downwind of the airport,
   attributable to reductions in sulfate aerosol. The subgrid-scale
   concentrations were an order of magnitude higher than the grid-based
   concentrations due to aircraft. In an earlier study when aircraft
   emissions were modeled by CMAQ as traditional point sources within the
   ATL airport grid cell, we showed that modeled secondary organic aerosol
   (SOA) concentrations increased by 2 \% due to primary organic aerosol
   (POA) emissions from aircraft, which provided additional surface area
   for SOA to partition onto. We now present results from additional
   modeling work performed to a) enhance organic treatment in a 1-D aerosol
   microphysics model used to provide engine-specific emissions parameters
   for CMAQ, and b) examine aircraft's impacts on secondary organic aerosol
   concentrations using the volatility basis set (VBS) within
   CMAQ-AMSTERDAM to represent the formation and aging of organic aerosols.
   Parameterization for the VBS components was determined using current and
   ongoing field study measurements, chamber studies, and box models
   specific to aircraft SOA formation, which showed that non-traditional
   precursors of SOA (NTSOA) were a much higher contributor to
   aircraft-specific SOA than previously understood.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM), PMCAMx-2008, was
   applied to Europe to study the influence of emissions changes on fine PM
   levels. Various emissions scenarios were studied, covering summer and
   winter periods to quantify also the seasonal variation. Reduction of NH3
   emissions seems to be the most effective control strategy for reducing
   PM2.5 over Europe, in both seasons, mainly due to reduction of NH4NO3. A
   reduction of SO2 emissions has a significant effect on PM2.5 levels over
   the Balkans during summer, due to decrease of sulfate, while the
   reduction of anthropogenic OA emissions has a strong effect on total OA
   mainly in areas close to emissions sources. The NOx emissions control
   strategy seems to be problematic in both seasons. Our analysis in
   European Megacities, based on a scenario zeroing all anthropogenic
   emissions, showed that the contribution of local emissions on total
   PM2.5, depends on the chemical component, with local sources being
   especially important mainly for black carbon (BC).}},

   and January 2010. The model includes a state-of-the-art organic aerosol
   module which is based on the volatility basis set framework treating
   both primary and secondary organic components as semivolatile and
   photochemically reactive. The model predicts that fresh primary OA (POA)
   is a small contributor to organic PM concentrations in Europe during the
   summer and spring, and that oxygenated species (oxidized primary and
   biogenic secondary) dominate the ambient OA. During the winter model
   results suggest a significant underestimation of OA emissions from wood
   burning. Use of very high resolution emissions inventory does not result
   in a significant improvement of the predictions of the model over the
   Megacity of Paris.}},

Abstract = {{The specification of requirements is a key activity for achieving the
   goals of any software project and it has long been established and
   recognized by researchers and practitioners. Within Software Product
   Lines (SPL), this activity is even more critical owing to the need to
   deal with common, variable, and product-specific requirements, not only
   for a single product but for the whole set of products. In this paper,
   we present a Feature-Driven Requirements Engineering approach (FeDRE)
   that provides support to the requirements specification of SPL. The
   approach realizes features into functional requirements by considering
   the variability captured in a feature model. It also provides detailed
   guidelines on how to associate chunks of features from a feature model
   and to consider them as the context for the Use Case specification. The
   evaluation of the approach is illustrated in a case study for developing
   an SPL of mobile applications for emergency notifications. This case
   study was applied within 14 subjects, 8 subjects from Universitat
   Politecnica de Valencia and 6 subjects from Federal University of Bahia.
   Evaluations concerning the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness,
   effectiveness and efficiency as regards requirements analysts using the
   approach are also presented. The results show that FeDRE was perceived
   as easy to learn and useful by the participants.}},

Abstract = {{A debate has proceeded in the literature regarding the mechanism of
   reversible-deactivation radical polymerization in the presence of Cu-0.
   The two proposed models are supplemental activator and reducing agent
   atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA ATRP) and single electron
   transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP). In SARA ATRP, Cu-I is
   the major activator of alkyl halides, Cu-0 is a supplemental activator
   and reducing agent of excess Cu-II through comproportionation, and
   disproportionation is negligible. In contrast, in SET-LRP, Cu-0 is the
   major activator, Cu-I does not activate alkyl halides but instead
   undergoes instantaneous disproportionation. In this article we present a
   body of experimental and theoretical data, which supports the SARA ATRP
   mechanism and disagrees with the SET-LRP mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Modern advancements in imaging devices have enabled us to explore the
   subcellular structure of living organisms and extract vast amounts of
   information. However, interpreting the biological information mined in
   the captured images is not a trivial task. Utilizing predetermined
   numerical features is usually the only hope for quantifying this
   information. Nonetheless, direct visual or biological interpretation of
   results obtained from these selected features is non-intuitive and
   difficult. In this paper, we describe an automatic method for modeling
   visual variations in a set of images, which allows for direct visual
   interpretation of the most significant differences, without the need for
   predefined features. The method is based on a linearized version of the
   continuous optimal transport (OT) metric, which provides a natural
   linear embedding for the image data set, in which linear combination of
   images leads to a visually meaningful image. This enables us to apply
   linear geometric data analysis techniques such as principal component
   analysis and linear discriminant analysis in the linearly embedded space
   and visualize the most prominent modes, as well as the most discriminant
   modes of variations, in the dataset. Using the continuous OT framework,
   we are able to analyze variations in shape and texture in a set of
   images utilizing each image at full resolution, that otherwise cannot be
   done by existing methods. The proposed method is applied to a set of
   nuclei images segmented from Feulgen stained liver tissues in order to
   investigate the major visual differences in chromatin distribution of
   Fetal-Type Hepatoblastoma (FHB) cells compared to the normal cells.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of regional left ventricular (LV) function may have
   application in prognosticating timely response and informing choice
   therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this
   study is to characterize LV function through a systematic analysis of 4D
   (3D + time) endocardial motion over the cardiac cycle in an effort to
   define objective, clinically useful metrics of pathological remodeling
   and declining cardiac performance, using standard cardiac MRI data for
   two distinct patient cohorts accessed from CardiacAtlas.org: a) MESA a
   cohort of asymptomatic patients; and b) DETERMINE a cohort of
   symptomatic patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (IHD) or
   myocardial infarction. The LV endocardium was segmented and a signed
   phase-to-phase Hausdorff distance (HD) was computed at 3D uniformly
   spaced points tracked on segmented endocardial surface contours, over
   the cardiac cycle. An LV-averaged index of phase-to-phase endocardial
   displacement (P2PD) time-histories was computed at each tracked point,
   using the HD computed between consecutive cardiac phases. Average and
   standard deviation in P2PD over the cardiac cycle was used to prepare
   characteristic curves for the asymptomatic and IHD cohort. A novel
   biomarker of RMS error between mean patient-specific characteristic P2PD
   over the cardiac cycle for each individual patient and the cumulative
   P2PD characteristic of a cohort of asymptomatic patients was established
   as the RMS-P2PD marker The novel RMS-P2PD marker was tested as a cardiac
   function based feature for automatic patient classification using a
   Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) framework. The RMS-P2PD biomarker indices
   were significantly different for the symptomatic patient and
   asymptomatic control cohorts (p<0.001). BRL accurately classified 83.8\%
   of patients correctly from the patient and control populations, with
   leave-one-out cross validation, using standard indices of LV ejection
   fraction (LV-EF) and LV end-systolic volume index (LV-ESVI). This
   improved to 91.9\% with inclusion of the RMS-P2PD biomarker and was
   congruent with improvements in both sensitivity for classifying patients
   and specificity for identifying asymptomatic controls from 82.6\% up to
   95.7\%. RMS-P2PD, when contrasted against a collective normal reference,
   is a promising biomarker to investigate further in its utility for
   identifying quantitative signs of pathological endocardial function
   which may boost standard image makers as precursors of declining cardiac
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced correlation filters (CFs) were introduced over three decades
   ago to offer distortion-tolerant object recognition and are used in
   applications such as automatic target recognition (AIR) and biometric
   recognition. Some of the advances in CF design include minimum average
   correlation energy (MACE) filters that produce sharp correlations and
   offer excellent discrimination, optimal tradeoff synthetic discriminant
   function (OTSDF) filters that allow the filter designer to control the
   tradeoff between peak sharpness and noise tolerance, maximum average
   correlation height (MACH) filter that removes correlation peak
   constraints to reduce filter design complexity and quadratic correlation
   filters (QCFs) that extend the linear CFs to include second-order
   nonlinearity. In this paper, we summarize two recent major advances in
   CF design. First is the introduction of maximum margin correlation
   filters (MMCFs) that combine the excellent localization properties of
   CFs with the very good generalization abilities of support vector
   machines (SVMs). Second is the introduction of zero-aliasing correlation
   filters (ZACFs) that eliminate the aliasing in CF design due to the
   circular correlation caused by the use of discrete Fourier transforms
   (DFTs).}},

Pages = {{5825-5839}},
Abstract = {{While the field of atmospheric organic aerosol scientific research has
   experienced thorough and insightful progress over the last half century,
   this progress has been accompanied by the evolution of a communicative
   and detailed yet, at times, complex and inconsistent language. The
   menagerie of detailed classification that now exists to describe organic
   compounds in our atmosphere reflects the wealth of observational
   techniques now at our disposal as well as the rich information provided
   by state-of-the-science instrumentation. However, the nomenclature in
   place to communicate these scientific gains is growing disjointed to the
   point that effective communication within the scientific community and
   to the public may be sacrificed. We propose standardizing a naming
   convention for organic aerosol classification that is relevant to
   laboratory studies, ambient observations, atmospheric models, and
   various stakeholders for air-quality problems. Because a critical aspect
   of this effort is to directly translate the essence of complex
   physico-chemical phenomena to a much broader, policy-oriented audience,
   we recommend a framework that maximizes comprehension among scientists
   and non-scientists alike. For example, to classify volatility, it relies
   on straightforward alphabetic terms (e.g., semivolatile, SV;
   intermediate volatility, IV; etc.) rather than possibly ambiguous
   numeric indices. This framework classifies organic material as primary
   or secondary pollutants and distinguishes among fundamental features
   important for science and policy questions including emission source,
   chemical phase, and volatility. Also useful is the addition of an
   alphabetic suffix identifying the volatility of the organic material or
   its precursor for when emission occurred. With this framework, we hope
   to introduce into the community a consistent connection between common
   notation for the general public and detailed nomenclature for highly
   specialized discussion. In so doing, we try to maintain consistency with
   historical, familiar naming schemes, unify much of the scattered
   nomenclature presented in recent literature, reduce the barrier of
   comprehension to outside audiences, and construct a scaffold into which
   insights from future scientific discoveries can be incorporated.}},

Abstract = {{The response of polycrystals to plastic deformation is studied at the
   level of variations within individual grains, and comparisons are made
   to theoretical calculations using crystal plasticity (CP). We provide a
   brief overview of CP and a review of the literature, which is dominated
   by surface observations. The motivating question asks how well CP
   represents the mesoscale behavior of large populations of dislocations
   (as carriers of plastic strain). The literature shows consistently that
   only moderate agreement is found between experiment and calculation. We
   supplement this with a current example of microstructure evolution in
   the interior of a copper sample subjected to tensile deformation.
   Nondestructive measurements of orientation fields were performed using
   the near-field highenergy X-ray diffraction microscopy (nf-HEDM)
   technique at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Starting at highly
   ordered grains, a single two-dimensional slice of microstructure
   containing similar to 150 grains was followed through multiple strain
   states, where it tracked lattice rotations and defect accumulation of up
   to 14\% elongation. In accord with the literature, at the scale of
   individual grains, comparison of observations with CP models indicates
   reasonable qualitative agreement but significant variations between
   simulation and experiment are apparent. The conclusion is that in order
   to be able to quantify the effects of microstructure on the
   distributions of slip, orientation change, and damage accumulation, the
   empirically derived constitutive relations used in continuum-scale
   simulations need to be improved. Equally important will be the
   development of large-scale simulations of polycrystals that directly
   model dislocations.}},

Abstract = {{Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon neoplasm with high mortality and
   short survival. Currently, the gold diagnostic standard is a pleural
   biopsy with subsequent histologic examination of the tissue
   demonstrating invasion by the tumor. The diagnostic tissue is obtained
   through thoracoscopy or open thoracotomy, both being highly invasive
   procedures. Thoracocenthesis, or removal of effusion fluid from the
   pleural space, is a far less invasive procedure that can provide
   material for cytological examination However, it is insufficient to
   definitively confirm or exclude the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma,
   since tissue invasion cannot be determined. In this study, we present a
   computerized method to detect and classify malignant mesothelioma based
   on the nuclear chromatin distribution from digital images of mesothelial
   cells in effusion cytology specimens. Our method aims at determining
   whether a set of nuclei belonging to a patient, obtained from effusion
   fluid images using image segmentation, is benign or malignant, and has a
   potential to eliminate the need for tissue biopsy. This method is
   performed by quantifying chromatin morphology of cells using the optimal
   transportation (Kantorovich-Wasserstein) metric in combination with the
   modified Fisher discriminant analysis, a k-nearest neighborhood
   classification, and a simple voting strategy. Our results show that we
   can classify the data of 10 different human cases with 100\% accuracy
   after blind cross validation. We conclude that nuclear structure alone
   contains enough information to classify the malignant mesothelioma. We
   also conclude that the distribution of chromatin seems to be a
   discriminating feature between nuclei of benign and malignant
   mesothelioma cells.}},

Abstract = {{The spindle is a highly complex and dynamic molecular machine that is
   assembled during cell division for accurate segregation of replicated
   chromosomes. Successful completion of cell division relies on the right
   spindle proteins to be at the right place at the right time to serve

   spatiotemporal behaviors of spindle proteins are therefore essential to
   understanding related cell division mechanisms. The main goal of this
   chapter is to introduce basic concepts and methods for computational
   tracking and analysis of spindle protein spatiotemporal dynamics that is
   visualized and recorded in fluorescence microscopy images. An emphasis
   is placed on providing practical and useful information on related
   software tools. Examples are used to demonstrate applications of related

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the implementation of Field Dislocation
   Mechanics (FDM) theory for media with a periodic microstructure (i.e.
   the Nye dislocation tensor and the elastic moduli tensor are considered
   as spatially periodic continuous fields). In this context, the
   uniqueness of the stress and elastic distortion fields is established.
   This allows to propose an efficient numerical scheme based on Fourier
   transform to compute the internal stress field, for a given spatial
   distribution of dislocations and applied macroscopic stress. This
   numerical implementation is assessed by comparison with analytical
   solutions for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous elastic media. A
   particular insight is given to the critical case of stress-free
   dislocation microstructures which represent equilibrium solutions of the
   FDM theory.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulation of microorganisms with intrinsic motility is a challenging
   yet important task for many biological and biomedical applications.
   Currently, such a task has only been accomplished using optical
   tweezers, while at the risk of averse heating and photodamage of the

   fluidic trapping and two-dimensional transportation of motile
   microorganisms near a solid surface in fluids. We demonstrated selective
   trapping and transportation of individual freely swimming
   multi-flagellated bacteria over a distance of 30 mu m (7.5 body length
   of the carrier) on a surface, using the rotational flows locally induced
   by a rotating magnetic microparticle. Only a weak uniform magnetic field
   (< 3 mT) was applied to actuate the microparticle. The microparticle can
   translate on a glass substrate by rotating at a speed of up to 100 mu m
   s(-1), while providing a fluidic force of a few to tens of pico-Newtons.}},

Abstract = {{The aerosol chemical composition in air masses affected by wildfires
   from the Greek islands of Chios, Euboea and Andros, the Dalmatian Coast
   and Sicily, during late summer of 2012 was characterized at the remote
   background site of Finokalia, Crete. Air masses were transported several
   hundreds of kilometers, arriving at the measurement station after
   approximately half a day of transport, mostly during nighttime. The
   chemical composition of the particulate matter was studied by different
   high-temporal-resolution instruments, including an aerosol chemical
   speciation monitor (ACSM) and a seven-wavelength aethalometer. Despite
   the large distance from emission and long atmospheric processing, a
   clear biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA) profile containing
   characteristic markers is derived from BC (black carbon) measurements
   and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the ACSM organic
   mass spectra. The ratio of fresh to aged BBOA decreases with increasing
   atmospheric processing time and BBOA components appear to be converted
   to oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). Given that the smoke was mainly
   transported overnight, it appears that the processing can take place in
   the dark. These results show that a significant fraction of the BBOA
   loses its characteristic AMS (aerosol mass spectrometry) signature and
   is transformed to OOA in less than a day. This implies that biomass
   burning can contribute almost half of the organic aerosol mass in the
   area during periods with significant fire influence.}},

   items that are used to represent the information needs are categorized,
   a domain-specific query language that can formally represent the query
   statements is formalized, and a library of mechanisms that can
   automatically reason about and retrieve the needed information is
   developed. In order to validate the performance of the query language

Abstract = {{Experimental and clinical data indicate that hemodynamic forces within
   the embryo provide critical biomechanical cues for cardiovascular
   morphogenesis, growth, and remodeling and that perturbed flow is a major
   etiology of congenital heart disease. However, embryonic flow-growth
   relationships are largely qualitative and poorly defined. In this work,
   we provide a quantitative analysis of in vivo flow and growth trends in
   the chick embryo using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to acquire
   simultaneous velocity and structural data of the right vitelline artery
   continuously over a ten hour period beginning at stage 16 (hour 54). We
   obtained 3D vessel volumes (15 mu m lateral, 4.3 mu m axial resolutions,
   6 mu m slice spacing) at 60 minute intervals, taking a B-scan time
   series totaling one cardiac cycle at each slice. Embryos were maintained
   at a constant 37 degrees C and 60\% humidity during the entire
   acquisition period through an in-house built chamber. The 3D vessel
   lumen geometries were reconstructed manually to assess growth. Blood
   flow velocity was computed from the central B-scan using red blood cell
   particle image velocimetry. The use of extended OCT imaging as a
   non-invasive method for continuous and simultaneous flow and structural
   data can enhance our understanding of the biomechanical regulation of
   critical events in morphogenesis. Data acquired will be useful to
   validate predictive finite-element 3D growth models.}},

Pages = {{7967-7972}},
Abstract = {{The continuing discovery of broad classes of materials, such as ionic
   liquids, zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and block copolymers,
   presents an enormous opportunity in developing materials for new
   applications. Polymerized ionic liquid block copolymers (PIL-BCPs) fall
   at the union of two already large sets of materials, and are an emerging
   class of materials useful in gas separation membranes, ion and electron
   conducting materials, and as mechanical actuators. A wide range of ionic
   liquid moieties can be used as pendant groups along the polymer
   backbone, potentially allowing for a wide variation in the resulting
   material properties; however in practice the range of ionic liquids
   explored is hindered by the need to optimize polymerization conditions
   for each new monomer. Here, we present a modular approach to PIL-BCP
   synthesis where a variety of olefin bearing cations are readily
   conjugated to polymers using thiol-Michael click chemistry. This
   approach allowed for the rapid development of a diverse material library
   including phase separated thin films, ion-gels, and liquid PIL-BCPs,
   with a reduced investment in synthetic time. Finally, we demonstrate
   that this approach identified PIL-BCPs with increased CO2 permeability
   relative to PILs, which could find use in carbon capture from flue gas.}},

Abstract = {{Quality of gradient copolymers is evaluated by atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) and correlated with molecular weight distribution (MWD) values.
   ARGET ATRP is employed with decreasing levels of catalyst concentrations
   to generate copolymers with increasing (M) over bar (w)/(M) over bar (n)
   values. The copolymers are transformed into molecular bottlebrushes to
   enable imaging and analysis of individual molecules by AFM. The average
   height (cross-sectional) profile of all bottlebrushes agrees with the
   instantaneous composition (ICHEMA-TMS) of the analogous copolymer
   backbone, as determined by H-1 NMR. The copolymer synthesized with 500
   ppm of catalyst exhibits more narrow distributions of both brush height
   and backbone length when analyzed as a bottlebrush by AFM.
   Correspondingly, the copolymers synthesized with lower catalyst
   concentrations yield bottlebrushes with broader height and length
   distribution. These results establish MWD values as an excellent trait
   to assess quality within gradient copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{Sintering of precompacted metallic and ceramic micro and nanopowders is
   a complex problem influenced by several factors. We quantify the
   influence of both local capillary stresses acting at the surface of one
   pore or particle (usually referred to as Laplace pressure) and the gas
   pressure in pores during sintering of precompacted metallic (micro/nano)
   powdered cylinders. The latter influences only the third phase of
   sintering, that is, the phase in which the porosity is closed.
   The isostatic pressing loading mode, which also covers the case of free
   sintering, is considered. Whereas the Laplace pressure is demonstrated
   to have a beneficial effect on sintering, the gas pressure acts against
   the reduction of the porosity, causing an increase in sintering time.
   This contribution could reach the sum of the stress due to loading and
   the interstitial pressure, thereby preventing the desired porosity to be
   reached.
   For the sake of illustration, a specific aluminum-zinc-magnesium-copper
   alloy is examined in this paper. The purpose is to estimate the effects
   of sintering time and residual porosity and to determine thresholds
   under which the contributions described above are negligible. In order
   to determine the effects of Laplace and gas pressure in pores on the
   stability of the process, a high-order perturbation analysis has been
   performed.}},

   reservoir temperature and pressure}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{17443-17453}},
Abstract = {{The security of long-term CO2 storage following geologic carbon
   sequestration may be impacted by biogeochemical reactions in the
   formation; yet little understanding exists about the impact of CO2
   gradients on microorganisms that drive biogeochemistry in the deep
   subsurface. The effect of CO2 gradients on the microbial community from
   a brine aquifer was examined at reservoir pressure (14 MPa) and
   temperature (40 degrees C). The community was exposed to pCO(2) at 0,
   0.1, 1.4 and 14 MPa for up to 56 days and was examined using 16S rRNA
   gene clone libraries and qPCR. Diversity indices (equitability) were
   also determined. In addition, the effect of lowered pH without CO2
   exposure was examined. Exposure to CO2 resulted in a decrease in
   microbial diversity and a decrease in 16S rRNA gene concentrations.
   After 56 days, no 16S genes were recovered following exposure to 1.4 MPa
   pCO(2) or greater. Exposure to 0.1 MPa pCO(2) resulted in 16S gene
   concentrations an order of magnitude less than 0 MPa pCO(2). The
   equitability of 0 MPa exposure (0.54) decreased with 0.1 MPa exposure to
   0.29. Microbial community with the lowered pH (pH = 4.4) and 0 MPa
   pCO(2) resulted in 5 orders of magnitude increased 16S gene
   concentration than reactors with CO2 exposure, indicating that CO2 was
   detrimental independent of pH. This suggests that even buffered
   reservoirs may have a decreased microbial population due to injected
   CO2. Halotolerant strains Halomonas and Marinobacter appeared to be the
   most tolerant to CO2 exposure and decreased pH. This is the first study
   to examine the initial microbial community response to a gradient of CO2
   that would follow geologic carbon sequestration.}},

Title = {{Active cytoskeletal force and chromatin condensation independently
   modulate intranuclear network fluctuations}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{523-531}},
Abstract = {{Chromatin remodeling, including the movement of genes and regulatory
   factors, precedes or accompanies stimulated changes in gene expression.
   Here we quantify chromatin fluctuations in primary human cells using
   particle-tracking microrheology and determine the physical mechanisms
   which influence chromatin reorganization. We find that intranuclear
   movements are enhanced beyond thermal motion by active force generation
   from cytoskeletal motor activity propagated through the LINC complex;
   intranuclear movements are also dependent on the viscoelasticity of the
   DNA-protein polymer network. Chromatin movements were dramatically
   altered by modulation of chromatin condensation state, which we
   independently verified using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
   (FLIM). These findings suggest that chromatin condensation and
   cytoskeletal force generation play distinct functional roles in
   regulating intranuclear movements, and these effects are decoupled as
   measured by particle tracking. We further utilize this approach in
   identifying the nuclear responsiveness of primary human endothelial
   cells to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): early in the
   response chromatin movements increase and are dominated by cytoskeletal
   force, which transitions at later times to a chromatin decondensation
   event. Given the hierarchical genome organization in primary cells, our
   work generally suggests an important role for force generation and
   chromatin mechanics in altered gene expression kinetics.}},

   how local emissions and pollutant transport affect primary and secondary
   particulate matter mass concentration levels in Paris. During the summer
   and the winter periods examined, only 13\% of the PM2.5 is predicted to
   be due to local Paris emissions, with 36\% coming from mid-range (50-500
   km from the center of the Paris) sources and 51\% from long range
   transport ( more than 500 km from Paris).
   The local emissions contribution to simulated elemental carbon (EC) is
   significant, with almost 60\% of the EC originating from local sources
   during both summer and winter. Approximately 50\% of the simulated fresh
   primary organic aerosol (POA) originated from local sources and another
   45\% from areas 100-500 km from the receptor region during summer.
   Regional sources dominated the secondary PM components. During summer
   more than 70\% of the simulated sulfate originated from SO2 emitted more
   than 500 km away from the center of the Paris. Also more than 45\% of
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was due to the oxidation of VOC
   precursors that were emitted 100-500 km from the center of the Paris.
   The model simulates more contribution from long range secondary PM
   sources during winter because the timescale for its production is longer
   due to the slower photochemical activity.
   PSAT results for contributions of local and regional sources were
   compared with observation-based estimates from field campaigns that took
   place during the MEGAPOLI project. PSAT simulations are in general
   consistent ( within 20\%) with these estimates for OA and sulfate. The
   only exception is that PSAT simulates higher local EC contribution
   during the summer compared to that estimated from observations.}},

Pages = {{766-774}},
Abstract = {{Photoreconfigurable and photodegradable polymeric networks have broad
   utility as functional biomaterials for many applications in medicine and
   biotechnology. The vast majority of these functional polymers are
   synthesized using chemical moieties that may be cytotoxic in vivo.
   Materials synthesized from these substituents also pose unknown risk
   upon implantation and thus will encounter significant regulatory
   challenges prior to use in vivo. This work describes a strategy to
   prepare photodegradable hydrogel networks that are composed of
   well-characterized synthetic polymers and natural melanin pigments found
   within the human body. Self-assembled networks of
   poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol) ABA triblock
   copolymers are doped with melanin nanoparticles to produce
   reconfigurable networks based on photothermal phase transitions.
   Self-assembled hydrogel networks with melanin nanoparticles exhibit a
   storage modulus ranging from 1.5 +/- 0.6 kPa to 8.0 +/- 7.5 kPa as
   measured by rheology. The rate of UV-induced photothermal heating was
   non-monotonic and varied as a function of melanin nanoparticle loading.
   A maximum steady state temperature increase of 20.5 +/- 0.30 degrees C
   was measured. Experimental heating rates were in close agreement with
   predictions based on attenuation of light in melanins via photothermal
   absorption and Mie scattering. The implications of melanin nanoparticles
   on hydrogel network formation and light-induced disintegration were also
   characterized by rheology and dynamic light scattering. Taken together,
   this class of photoreconfigurable hydrogels represents a potential
   strategy for photodegradable polymers with increased likelihood for
   clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of intermixed carbon nanotubes and graphite on the

   Specifically, the performance of NaTi2(PO4)(3) made with ``intimate
   carbons{''} containing carbon nanotubes (or graphite) introduced at the
   precursor stage was compared to the performance of similar materials
   made with the carbons added post synthesis. Specifically, different
   combinations of carbon nanotubes and graphite were used as carbon
   sources both in the precursor blend prior to sintering as well as
   conductive additives in the test electrodes. Graphite-coated
   NaTi2(PO4)(3) with additional carbon nanotubes added (post synthesis) as
   conductive agent exhibited the best overall performance: the first cycle
   discharge specific capacity is 130 mAh/g (close to theoretical value 133
   mAh/g) at 0.1C rate. The combination also exhibits good cycling
   stability in aqueous electrolyte: 86\% capacity retention under
   continuous charge/discharge without relaxation at 1C rate for 100
   cycles. This suggests that fully coating the precursor material with
   carbon is critical for performance, and that a graphite additive in the
   precursor phase is more effective than nanotubes at performing this
   function. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Substrate rigidity has been recognized as an important property that
   affects cellular physiology and functions. While the phenomenon has been
   well recognized, understanding the underlying mechanism may be greatly
   facilitated by creating a microenvironment with designed rigidity
   patterns. This chapter describes in detail an optimized method for
   preparing substrates with micropatterned rigidity, taking advantage of
   the ability to dehydrate polyacrylamide gels for micropatterning with
   photolithography, and subsequently rehydrate the gel to regain the
   original elastic state. While a wide range of micropatterns may be
   prepared, typical composite substrates consist of micron-sized islands
   of rigid photoresist grafted on the surface of polyacrylamide hydrogels
   of defined rigidity. These islands are displaced by cellular traction
   forces, for a distance determined by the size of the island, the
   rigidity of the underlying hydrogel, and the magnitude of traction
   forces. Domains of rigidity may be created using this composite material
   to allow systematic investigations of rigidity sensing and durotaxis.}},

Title = {{Multifunctional photo-crosslinked polymeric ionic hydrogel films}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{2824-2835}},
Abstract = {{A facile approach was developed to prepare crosslinked ionic polymer
   hydrogel films by photo-crosslinking utilizing p-vinylbenzyl
   trimethylammonium chloride (VBTMACl) or p-vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium
   hydroxide (VBTMAOH) as the monomer and poly(ethylene oxide)
   dimethacrylate (PEODMA, M-n = 750) as the crosslinker. The films with
   different crosslinking degrees (20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\%) were
   prepared and characterized by swelling measurements, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection
   Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical
   analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and small-angle X-ray
   scattering (SAXS). It was found that the mechanical and thermal
   properties of the films were largely influenced by the contents of the
   crosslinker in the films. By ion-exchange of the anions in the films
   with various other anions, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the
   films was changed. In addition, fluorescent films were prepared by
   treatment with fluorescein, and paramagnetic films with FeCl4- as a
   counter anion showed catalytic activity for Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   The ionic films with quaternary ammonium chloride groups displayed
   antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) with almost
   100\% killing efficiency. Multifunctional films with various tunable
   properties have significant potential for a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative kinetic models for the A1 to L1(0) transformation in FePt
   and related ternary alloy films are derived for three nucleation
   conditions for both isothermal and constant heating rate annealing. The
   nucleation conditions are: 1) continuous nucleation, 2) burst
   nucleation, and 3) pre-existing nuclei. For the first nucleation
   condition, new nuclei are formed continuously throughout the
   transformation. For the second nucleation condition under isothermal
   annealing, nucleation is constrained to occur at a constant rate over
   only a short period of time. In the limit of this time period going to
   zero, the nucleation sites are saturated very rapidly and nucleation can
   be considered to have occurred as a burst. For the third nucleation
   condition, the nuclei are pre-existing, having formed prior to the start
   of the transformation. No new nuclei form during the transformation. To
   identify the nucleation condition that best describes the transformation
   in FePt and related ternary alloy films, model predictions must be
   compared with experimental kinetic results.}},

Title = {{Probing the effect of electron donation on CO2 absorbing
   1,2,3-triazolide ionic liquids}},

Abstract = {{Development of the next generation materials for effective separation of
   gases is required to address various issues in energy and environmental
   applications. Ionic liquids (ILs) are among the most promising material
   types. To overcome the many hurdles in making a new class of materials
   technologically applicable, it is necessary to identify, access, and
   scale up a range of representative substances. In this work, CO2
   reactive triazolide ILs were synthesized and characterized with the aim
   of developing a deeper understanding of how structural changes affect
   the overall properties of these substances. It was found that
   substituents on the anion play a crucial role in dictating the physical
   properties for CO2 capture. Depending upon the anion substituent, CO2
   capacities between 0.07 and 0.4 mol CO2 per mol IL were observed. It was
   found that less sterically-hindered anions and anions containing
   electron donating groups were more reactive towards CO2. Detailed
   spectroscopic, CO2 absorption, rheological, and simulation studies were
   carried out to understand the nature and influence of these
   substituents. The effect of water content was also evaluated, and it was
   found that water had an unexpected impact on the properties of these
   materials, resulting in an increased viscosity, but little change in the
   CO2 reactivity.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{341-344}},
Abstract = {{Resonant wireless power transfer (WPT) using magneto quasi-static fields
   is an attractive means for delivering power in many applications.
   Central to the efficient delivery of power in these systems is the use
   of high-ratio impedance transformers to impedance-match the load to the
   source via the WPT network. Mini-loop transformers, which use a resonant
   tank for impedance matching, have become popular as they provide
   high-ratio impedance matching and low loss. Key to the low loss is the
   use of high-Q resonators. There are two challenges with this approach.
   The first is impedance matching the resonators to source/load
   impedances, and the second is adjusting the center frequency of
   resonance to exactly match the operating frequency, which can be very
   difficult with helical coils that use their parasitic capacitance for
   resonance. In this letter, we introduce a tri-coil impedance-matching
   network for WPT that provides accurate impedance matching and precise
   frequency tuning for high-Q coils to overcome these limitations.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Lighting accounts for nearly 20\% of overall U.S. electricity
   consumption and 18\% of U.S. residential electricity consumption. A
   transition to alternative energy-efficient technologies could reduce
   this energy consumption considerably. To quantify the influence of
   factors that drive consumer choices for light bulbs, we conducted a
   choice-based conjoint field experiment with 183 participants. We
   estimated discrete choice models from the data, and found that
   politically liberal consumers have a stronger preference for compact
   fluorescent lighting technology and for low energy consumption. Greater
   willingness to pay for lower energy consumption and longer life was
   observed in conditions where estimated operating cost information was
   provided. Providing estimated annual cost information to consumers
   reduced their implicit discount rate by a factor of five, lowering
   barriers to adoption of energy efficient alternatives with higher
   up-front costs; however, even with cost information provided, consumers
   continued to use implicit discount rates of around 100\%, which is
   larger than that experienced for other energy technologies. (C) 2013

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{With the proposed penetration of electric vehicles and advanced metering
   technology, the demand side is foreseen to play a major role in flexible
   energy consumption scheduling. On the other hand, the past several years
   have witnessed utility companies' growing interests to integrate more
   renewable energy resources. These renewable resources, for example, wind
   or solar, due to their intermittent nature, brought great uncertainty to
   the power grid system. In this article, we propose a mechanism that
   attempts to mitigate the grid operational uncertainty induced by
   renewable energies by properly exploiting demand flexibility with the
   help of advanced smart-metering technology. To address the challenge, we
   develop a novel locational marginal price (LMP)-based pricing scheme
   that involves active demand-side participation by casting the network
   objective as a two-stage Stackelberg game between the local grid
   operator and several aggregators. In contrast to the conventional notion
   that generation follows load, our game formulation provides more
   flexibility for the operators and tries to provide adequate incentives
   for the loads to follow the (stochastic renewable) generation. We use
   the solution concept of subgame perfect equilibrium to analyze the
   resulting game. Subsequently, we discuss the optimal real-time
   conventional capacity planning for the local grid operator to achieve
   the minimal mismatch between supply and demand with the wind power
   integration. Finally, we assess our proposed scheme with field data. The
   simulation results show that our proposed scheme works reasonably well
   in the long term, even with simple heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{A model of carbonaceous aerosols has been implemented in the TwO-Moment
   Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics module in the GEOS-Chem chemical
   transport model (CTM), a model driven by assimilated meteorology.
   Inclusion of carbonaceous emissions alongside pre-existing treatments of
   sulfate and sea-salt aerosols increases the number of emitted primary
   aerosol particles by a factor of 2.5 and raises annual-average global
   cloud condensation nuclei at 0.2\% supersaturation (CCN(0.2 \%))
   concentrations by a factor of two. Compared to the prior model without
   carbonaceous aerosols, this development improves the model prediction of
   condensation nuclei with dry diameter larger than 10 nm (CN10) number
   concentrations significantly from -45\% to -7\% bias when compared to
   long-term observations. Inclusion of carbonaceous particles also largely
   eliminates a tendency for the model to underpredict higher cloud
   condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. Similar to other carbonaceous
   models, the model underpredicts organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon
   (EC) mass concentrations by a factor of 2 when compared to EMEP and
   IMPROVE observations. Because primary organic aerosol (POA) and
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) affect aerosol number size distributions
   via different microphysical processes, we assess the sensitivity of CCN
   production, for a fixed source of organic aerosol (OA) mass, to the
   assumed POA-SOA split in the model. For a fixed OA budget, we found that
   CCN(0.2 \%) decreases nearly everywhere as the model changes from a
   world dominated by POA emissions to one dominated by SOA condensation.
   POA is about twice as effective per unit mass at CCN production compared
   to SOA. Changing from a 100\% POA scenario to a 100\% SOA scenario,
   CCN(0.2 \%) concentrations in the lowest model layer decrease by about
   20 \%. In any scenario, carbonaceous aerosols contribute significantly
   to global CCN. The SOA-POA split has a significant effect on global CCN,
   and the microphysical implications of POA emissions versus SOA
   condensation appear to be at least as important as differences in
   chemical composition as expressed by the hygroscopicity of OA. These
   findings stress the need to better understand carbonaceous aerosols
   loadings, the global SOA budget, microphysical pathways of OA formation
   (emissions versus condensation) as well as chemical composition to
   improve climate modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Complex functional materials with three-dimensional micro-or nano-scale
   dynamic compositional features are prevalent in nature. However, the
   generation of three-dimensional functional materials composed of both
   soft and rigid microstructures, each programmed by shape and
   composition, is still an unsolved challenge. Here we describe a method
   to code complex materials in three-dimensions with tunable structural,
   morphological and chemical features using an untethered magnetic
   micro-robot remotely controlled by magnetic fields. This strategy allows
   the micro-robot to be introduced to arbitrary microfluidic environments
   for remote two-and three-dimensional manipulation. We demonstrate the
   coding of soft hydrogels, rigid copper bars, polystyrene beads and
   silicon chiplets into three-dimensional heterogeneous structures. We
   also use coded microstructures for bottom-up tissue engineering by
   generating cell-encapsulating constructs.}},

   mol(-1) in passing from 16 to 92 mol\% NMP. The same effects are
   observed for monomer-free model systems with poly(MMA)-Br as the
   initiator. Investigations into iron-catalyzed ATRP of MMA in less polar
   solvents or even without an additional solvent (i.e., for bulk ATRP)
   yield K-ATRP values, which are by two to three orders of magnitude

Abstract = {{Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been widely used for
   biological applications in recent years, and thus, it is critical to
   understand how these inert nanomaterials influence cell behavior.
   Recently, it has been observed that cellular phenotypes such as
   proliferation, force generation and growth change upon SWCNT treatment,
   and SWCNTs directly affect the organization and redistribution of the
   actin cytoskeleton. However, the interactions between SWCNTs and actin
   at the molecular level or how this interaction changes actin structure
   remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated direct interaction of
   actin with SWCNT using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and NIR
   spectroscopy of actin-dispersed SWCNTs. Actin can stably bind to the
   SWCNT surfaces via hydrophobic interactions but still allows nanotubes
   to slide and rotate on the actin surface. Our results establish several
   nanoscale conformational changes for the actin SWCNT complexes, and we
   suggest these changes likely induce reorganization of actin filaments
   observed at larger scales.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We consider the detection of a binary random state based on measurements
   that can be manipulated by an attacker. The attacker is assumed to have
   full information about the true value of the state to be estimated as
   well as the values of all the measurements. However, the attacker can
   only manipulate of the measurements. The detection problem is formulated
   as a minimax optimization, where one seeks to construct an optimal
   detector that minimizes the ``worst-case{''} probability of error
   against all possible manipulations by the attacker. We show that if the
   attacker can manipulate at least half the measurements (n >= m/2) then
   the optimal worst-case detector should ignore all m measurements and be
   based solely on the a-priori information. When the attacker can
   manipulate less than half of the measurements (n < m/2), we show that
   the optimal detector is a threshold rule based on a Hamming- like
   distance between the (manipulated) measurement vector and two
   appropriately defined sets. For the special case where n = (m-1)/2, our
   results provide a constructive procedure to derive the optimal detector.
   We also design a heuristic detector for the case where n << m, and prove
   the asymptotic optimality of the detector when m -> infinity Finally we
   apply the proposed methodology in the case of i.i.d. Gaussian
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the fragmentation process during rock cutting poses
   significant technical challenges. In this respect, previous research
   related to rock cutting using various numerical methods was reviewed in
   detail. A method for simulating the fragmentation process during the
   mechanical cutting of rock was then introduced using the explicit finite
   element code LS-DYNA. In the numerical simulations, the base rock
   material properties were defined using a damage constitutive model. This
   model simulates the separation of rock chips from the base rock material
   and the subsequent breakage of the chips into multiple fragments. In the
   simulations, a rigid steel cutting tool was translated at various
   sliding velocities (1, 4, 10, 50, and 100 mm/s) against a stationary
   rock material. For a given sliding velocity, simulations were conducted
   for various cutting depths (1, 2, 3, and 4 mm). The variation of
   stresses and the amount of chip formation at different depths of cut and
   velocities were analyzed. The simulations indicated that the cutting
   forces and chip morphology were significantly influenced by sliding
   velocities and cutting depths. Overall, the results indicate that the
   explicit finite element method was a powerful tool for simulating rock
   cutting and the chip fragmentation processes, as it was able to predict
   chip separation behavior from the base rock at different depths of cut
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Polycations have good potential as carriers of proteins and genetic
   material. However, poor control over the release rate and safety issues
   currently limit their use as delivery vehicles. Here we introduce a new
   lysine-based polycation, poly(ethylene lysinylaspartate diglyceride)
   (PELD), which exhibits high cytocompatibility. PELD self-assembles with
   the biological polyanion heparin into a coacervate that incorporates
   proteins with high loading efficiency. Coacervates of varying surface
   charge were obtained by simple alteration of the PELD:heparin ratio and
   resulted in diverse release profiles of the model protein bovine serum
   albumin. Therefore, coacervate charge represents a direct means of
   control over release rate and duration. The PELD coacervate also rapidly
   adsorbed onto a porous polymeric scaffold, demonstrating potential use
   in tissue engineering applications. This coacervate represents a safe
   and tunable protein delivery system for biomedical applications. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: We discuss the role of diversification on dependency and
   security of energy supply. A system dynamics model with especial focus
   on the role of renewable energy resources (as a portfolio) on Finland's
   energy dependency is developed. The purpose is also to cover a part of
   research gap exists in the system dynamics modeling of energy security
   investigations.
   Methods: A causal loops diagram and a system dynamics model evaluate
   Finnish scenarios of renewable energy policies. The analysis describes
   the relationship between dynamic factors such as RE encouragement
   packages, dependency, and energy demand.
   Results: A causal loops diagram and a system dynamics model evaluate
   three different Finnish scenarios of renewable energy policies by 2020.
   Conclusion: Analysis shows that despite 7\% electricity/heat consumption
   growth by 2020 in Finland, dependency on imported sources will decrease
   between 1\% and 7\% depend on the defined scenarios. Practice

Abstract = {{Measurements of aged aerosol scattering in the Eastern Mediterranean at
   ambient and low relative humidity (RH) are combined with measurements of
   its size composition distribution and its aerosol water content to gain
   insights about its hygroscopic and optical properties. The particle
   water uptake above 60\% RH can be explained by the water absorption by
   the inorganic particulate matter in this sulphate rich environment.
   However, the particles were supersaturated aqueous solutions at low RH
   and this water cannot be explained just by the water associated with
   their inorganic components in a metastable state. We estimate that
   approximately 20\% of this water may be contributed by the aged organic
   particulate matter. A semi-empirical equation is derived allowing the
   estimation of the aged aerosol Volume Growth Factor (VGF) from the
   ratios of scattering at ambient and low RH. The predictions of the
   equation are in good agreement with the measurement dataset obtained
   during the study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Untangling drivers of species distributions: Global sensitivity and
   uncertainty analyses of MAXENT}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{296-309}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Untangling drivers of systems and uncertainty for species distribution
   models (SDMs) is important to provide reliable predictions that are
   useful for conservation campaigns. This is particularly true for species
   whose habitat is threatened by climate change that enhances the
   uncertainty in future species distributions. Global sensitivity and
   uncertainty analyses (GSUA) is a robust method to globally investigate
   the uncertainty of SDMs and the importance of species distributions'
   drivers in space and time.
   Here we apply GSUA to MAXENT that is one of the popular presence-only
   SDMs. We consider the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)
   (SP) in Florida that is a shorebird whose habitat is affected by sea
   level rise due to climate change. The importance of intrinsic and
   exogenous input factors to the uncertainty of the species distribution
   is evaluated for MAXENT. GSUA is applied for three projections of the
   habitat (2006, 2060, and 2100) according to the A1B sea level rise
   scenario. The large land cover variation determines a moderate decrease
   in habitat suitability in 2060 and 2100 prospecting a low risk of
   decline for the SP. The regularization parameter for the environmental
   features, the uncertainty into the classification of salt-marsh,
   transitional marsh, and ocean beach, and the maximum number of
   iterations for the model training are in this order the most important
   input factors for the average habitat suitability. These results are
   related to the SP but, in general MAXENT appears as a very non-linear
   model where uncertainty mostly derives from the interactions among input
   factors.
   The uncertainty of the output is a species-specific variable. Thus, GSUA
   need be performed for each case considering local exogenous input
   factors of the model. GSUA allows quantitative informed
   species-management decisions by providing scenarios with controlled
   uncertainty and confidence over factors' importance that can be used by
   resource managers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biogas production from anaerobic biodegradation of livestock waste is a
   potential source of renewable energy. In addition to methane,
   biodegradation of this high-strength waste also produces sulfide that
   must be removed in order to prevent costly corrosive impacts on
   infrastructure. In this work, an anaerobic, phototrophic microbial
   community enriched from the native population in a swine waste lagoon
   was evaluated for its potential to remove sulfide from swine waste
   biogas. Batch experiments with the consortium attained removal
   efficiencies greater than 97\% for sulfide concentrations above 1200
   ppm. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the dominant population was
   most closely related to the isolate Azospirillum strain C5 (similarity
   index of 99\%). Photomicrograph of the enriched consortium revealed the
   presence of cells with intracellular globules resembling sulfur storage.
   The enrichment of Azospirillum-like and the concomitant sulfide
   consumption suggest that this microorganism played an important role in
   sulfide removal in the bioreactor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Grain boundary (GB) motion in polycrystalline materials is expected and
   observed to be dominated by thermally activated processes. This has
   important implications for properties influenced by the presence of GBs.
   Here, the GB motions of a catalog of 388 simulated nickel boundaries
   reveal a rich set of behaviors, which demonstrate that the temperature
   dependencies of GB mobility are far more complex than originally
   believed. In the set of 388 boundaries, four different general classes
   were observed with the following percentages: (I) similar to 57\%
   exhibited traditional thermally activated mobility; (II) similar to 20\%
   exhibited non-thermally activated mobility, where mobility was either
   independent of temperature or mobility decreased with increasing
   temperature (i.e., not thermally activated); (III) similar to 14\%
   exhibited mixed modes of mobility, where different trends were exhibited
   over different temperature regimes (e.g., thermally activated at low
   temperature and non-thermally activated at high temperature); and (IV)
   similar to 9\% exhibited unclassifiable mobility trends or were immobile
   over the studied temperature range. Thus, although the studied set of
   boundaries is not statistically representative of all GBs, it indicates
   that we must expand our preconceived notions to include new and
   interesting phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Soft errors, which have been a significant concern in memories, are now
   a main factor in reliability degradation of logic circuits. This paper
   presents a power-planning-aware methodology using dual supply voltages
   for soft error hardening. Given a constraint on power overhead, our
   proposed framework can minimize the soft error rate (SER) of a circuit
   via selective voltage assignment. In the 70-nm predictive technology
   model, circuit SER can be reduced by 23\% on top of SER-aware gate
   resizing. For power-planning awareness, a bi-partitioning technique
   based on a simplified version of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) algorithm
   is presented. The simplified FM-based partitioning refines the result of
   selective voltage assignment by decreasing the number of connections
   across voltage islands, while maintaining the SER reduction that has
   been accomplished.}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments examined when laypeople attribute unexpected
   experimental outcomes to error, in foresight and in hindsight, along
   with their judgments of whether the data should be published.
   Participants read vignettes describing hypothetical experiments, along
   with the result of the initial observation, considered as either a
   possibility (foresight) or a reality (hindsight). Experiment 1 found
   that the initial observation seemed more likely to be replicated when
   viewed in hindsight than in foresight. The remaining experiments
   contrasted responses to an initial observation from 1 of the 4 studies
   that was either expected or unexpected (based on the predictions of
   participants in Experiment 1). Experiments 2A-C and Experiment 3 found
   that unexpected results were more likely to be attributed to
   methodological problems than were expected ones-but to the same degree
   in foresight and in hindsight. Participants in Experiment 4 had more
   confidence in an explanation for an unexpected outcome when it was
   mentioned before that outcome was revealed than when it was suggested
   only after the surprise was known. In all the experiments, most
   participants recommended collecting more data before publishing the
   results, especially when they attributed the results to multiple causes.
   The results suggest that considering the causes of unexpected
   experimental results in foresight may improve the evaluation and
   communication of those results in hindsight.}},

Abstract = {{Current status of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor material technology
   is evaluated for developing high-performance and reliable power
   electronics switching converters. The study takes into account field
   reliability of silicon power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
   transistors (MOSFETs) in compact computer/telecom power supplies where
   residual material defects present in the silicon space-charge region
   were found to generate local microplasma that eventually caused power
   MOSFETs to fail under long-term repetitive field-switching conditions.
   It is shown that silicon power MOSFETs with increased low-level leakage
   currents are more prone to field failures in high-density power
   supplies. A new single-event burnout (SEB) stress testing methodology is
   proposed; the SEB stress test results are shown to correlate well with
   silicon power MOSFET failures in power supply circuits. Based on these
   results and the current state of the art of silicon carbide (SiC) and
   gallium nitride (GaN) power devices, a ``reliability-driven''
   manufacturing approach is recommended for rapid commercialization and
   market penetration of WBG semiconductor power devices.}},

Title = {{Grain boundary complexions}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{1-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Grain boundaries exhibit phase-like behavior in which their structure,
   chemistry and properties may change discontinuously at critical values
   of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature, pressure and chemical
   potential. Therefore, grain boundaries (and other interfaces such as
   surfaces and heterophase boundaries) can be treated as thermodynamically
   stable interfacial states. To differentiate these interfacial states
   from bulk phases, the term ``complexion{''} has been introduced. A
   variety of terminology has been used to describe complexions and
   complexion transitions. In many cases, several terms exist that describe
   essentially the same phenomenon. We give an overview of
   complexion-related terminology, suggest a preferred nomenclature and
   discuss a classification framework that can be used to categorize
   complexions and complexion transitions. The field of grain boundary
   complexions has evolved rapidly in the past decade due to advances in
   experimental equipment - in particular, aberration-corrected
   transmission electron microscopy - and progress in computational
   simulation methods. Grain boundary complexion transitions are the root
   cause of a wide variety of materials phenomena - such as abnormal grain
   growth, grain boundary embrittlement and activated sintering - that have
   defied mechanistic explanation for years. In this overview, we review
   the history and theory of grain boundary complexion transitions, their
   role in materials processing and their effect on materials properties.

Abstract = {{Purpose Design and evaluate a new micro-machining based approach for
   fabricating dissolvable microneedle arrays (MNAs) with diverse
   geometries and from different materials for dry delivery to skin
   microenvironments. The aims are to describe the new fabrication method,
   to evaluate geometric and material capability as well as reproducibility
   of the method, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of fabricated MNAs
   in delivering bioactive molecules.
   Methods Precise master molds were created using micromilling.
   Micromolding was used to create elastomer production molds from master
   molds. The dissolvable MNAs were then fabricated using the spin-casting
   method. Fabricated MNAs with different geometries were evaluated for
   reproducibility. MNAs from different materials were fabricated to show
   material capability. MNAs with embedded bioactive components were tested
   for functionality on human and mice skin.
   Results MNAs with different geometries and from carboxymethyl cellulose,
   polyvinyl pyrrolidone and maltodextrin were created reproducibly using
   our method. MNAs successfully pierce the skin, precisely deliver their
   bioactive cargo to skin and induce specific immunity in mice.
   Conclusion We demonstrated that the new fabrication approach enables
   creating dissolvable MNAs with diverse geometries and from different
   materials reproducibly. We also demonstrated the application of MNAs for
   precise and specific delivery of biomolecules to skin microenvironments
   in vitro and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, the operation of a membrane reactor network (MRN)
   for the oxidative coupling of methane is optimized. Therefore, three
   reactors, a fixed bed reactor (FBR) and two packed bed-membrane
   reactors, are modeled. For the (CPBMR), a two-dimensional (2-D) model is
   presented. This model incorporates radial diffusion and thermal
   conduction. In addition, two 10 cm long cooling segments for the CPBMR
   are implemented based on the idea of a fixed cooling temperature
   positioned outside the reactor shell. The model is discretized using a
   newly developed 2-D orthogonal collocation on finite elements with a
   combination of Hermite for the radial and Lagrangian polynomials for the
   axial coordinate. Membrane thickness, feed compositions, temperatures at
   the inlet and for the cooling, diameters, and the amount of inert
   packing in the reactors are considered as decision variables. The
   optimization results in C-2 yields of up to 40\% with a selectivity in
   C-2 products of more than 60\%. The MRN consisting of an additional
   packed-bed membrane reactor with an alternative feeding policy and a FBR
   shows a lower yield than the individual CPBMR. (c) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Corticomotoneuronal cells (CMN), located predominantly in the primary
   motor cortex, project directly to alpha motoneuronal pools in the spinal
   cord. The effects of CMN spikes on motoneuronal excitability are
   traditionally characterized by visualizing postspike effects (PSEs) in
   spike-triggered averages (SpTA; Fetz, Cheney, \& German, 1976; Fetz \&
   Cheney, 1980; McKiernan, Marcario, Karrer, \& Cheney, 1998) of
   electromyography (EMG) data. Poliakov and Schieber (1998) suggested a
   formal test, the multiple-fragment analysis (MFA), to automatically
   detect PSEs. However, MFA's performance was not statistically validated,
   and it is unclear under what conditions it is valid. This paper's
   contributions are a power study that validates the MFA; an alternative
   test, the single-snippet analysis (SSA), which has the same
   functionality as MFA but is easier to calculate and has better power in
   small samples; a simple bootstrap simulation to estimate SpTA baselines
   with simulation bands that help visualize potential PSEs; and a
   bootstrap adjustment to the MFA and SSA to correct for nonlinear SpTA
   baselines.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a comprehensive technique for accurate
   determination of three-dimensional (3D) dynamic force measurement
   characteristics of multi-axis dynamometers within a broad range of
   frequencies. Many research and development efforts in machining science
   and technology rely upon being able to make precise measurements of
   machining forces. In micromachining and high-speed machining, cutting
   forces include components at frequencies significantly higher than the
   bandwidth of force dynamometers. Further, the machining forces are
   three-dimensional in nature. This paper presents a new experimental
   technique to determine the three-dimensional force-measurement
   characteristics of multi-axis dynamometers. A custom-designed artifact
   is used to facilitate applying impulsive forces to the dynamometer at
   different positions in three dimensions. Repeatable and high-quality
   impulse excitations are provided from a novel impact excitation system
   with a bandwidth above 25 kHz. The force measurement characteristics are
   presented within 25 kHz bandwidth using 3 x 3 force-to-force frequency
   response functions (F2F-FRFs), which capture both direct and dynamic
   cross-talk components to enable fully three-dimensional
   characterization. The presented approach is used to characterize the
   dynamic behavior of a three-axis miniature dynamometer. The effects of
   force-application position, artifact geometry, and dynamometer-fixturing
   conditions are explored. Moreover, the relationship between the
   force-measurement characteristics and structural dynamics of the
   dynamometer assembly is analyzed. It is concluded that the presented
   technique is effective in determining the force-measurement
   characteristics of multi-axis dynamometers. The changes in dynamometer
   assembly that affect its structural dynamics, including artifact
   (workpiece) geometry and especially the fixturing conditions, were seen
   to have a significant effect on force-measurement characteristics.
   Furthermore, the force-measurement characteristics were seen to change
   substantially with the force-application position. The presented
   technique provides a foundation for future compensation efforts to
   enable measuring forces within a broad range of frequencies. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Consider the problem of assigning implicit-deadline sporadic tasks on a
   heterogeneous multiprocessor platform comprising two different types of
   processors-such a platform is referred to as two-type platform. We
   present two low degree polynomial time-complexity algorithms, SA and
   SA-P, each providing the following guarantee. For a given two-type
   platform and a task set, if there exists a task assignment such that
   tasks can be scheduled to meet deadlines by allowing them to migrate
   only between processors of the same type (intra-migrative), then (i)
   using SA, it is guaranteed to find such an assignment where the same
   restriction on task migration applies but given a platform in which
   processors are times faster and (ii) SA-P succeeds in finding a task
   assignment where tasks are not allowed to migrate between processors
   (non-migrative) but given a platform in which processors are 1+alpha
   times faster. The parameter 0 <alpha a parts per thousand currency sign1
   is a property of the task set; it is the maximum of all the task
   utilizations that are no greater than 1.
   We evaluate average-case performance of both the algorithms by
   generating task sets randomly and measuring how much faster processors
   the algorithms need (which is upper bounded by for SA and 1+alpha for
   SA-P) in order to output a feasible task assignment (intra-migrative for
   SA and non-migrative for SA-P). In our evaluations, for the vast
   majority of task sets, these algorithms require significantly smaller
   processor speedup than indicated by their theoretical bounds.
   Finally, we consider a special case where no task utilization in the
   given task set can exceed one and for this case, we (re-)prove the
   performance guarantees of SA and SA-P.
   We show, for both of the algorithms, that changing the adversary from
   intra-migrative to a more powerful one, namely fully-migrative, in which
   tasks can migrate between processors of any type, does not deteriorate
   the performance guarantees. For this special case, we compare the
   average-case performance of SA-P and a state-of-the-art algorithm by
   generating task sets randomly. In our evaluations, SA-P outperforms the
   state-of-the-art by requiring much smaller processor speedup and by
   running orders of magnitude faster.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been shown to
   outperform Deep Neural Networks for acoustic modelling, producing
   state-of-the-art accuracy in speech recognition tasks. Convolutional
   models provide increased model robustness through the usage of pooling
   invariance and weight sharing across spectrum and time. However,
   training convolutional models is a very computationally expensive
   optimization procedure, especially when combined with large training
   corpora. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for scalable
   training of deep Convolutional Neural Networks across multiple GPUs. Our
   distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm
   incorporates sparse gradients, momentum and gradient decay to accelerate
   the training of these networks. Our approach is stable, neither
   requiring warm-starting or excessively large minibatches. Our proposed
   approach enables convolutional models to be efficiently trained across
   multiple GPUs, enabling a model to be scaled asynchronously across 5 GPU
   workers with 68\% efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Despite best efforts, integrated systems are ``born{''} (manufactured)
   with a unique `personality' that stems from our inability to precisely
   fabricate their underlying circuits, and create software a priori for
   controlling the resulting uncertainty. It is possible to use
   sophisticated test methods to identify the best-performing systems but
   this would result in unacceptable yields and correspondingly high costs.
   The system personality is further shaped by its environment (e.g.,
   temperature, noise and supply voltage) and usage (i.e., the frequency
   and type of applications executed), and since both can fluctuate over
   time, so can the system's personality. Systems also ``grow old{''} and
   degrade due to various wear-out mechanisms (e.g., negative-bias
   temperature instability), and unexpectedly due to various early-life
   failure sources. These ``nature and nurture{''} influences make it
   extremely difficult to design a system that will operate optimally for
   all possible personalities. To address this challenge, we propose to
   develop statistical learning in-chip (SLIC). SLIC is a holistic approach
   to integrated system design based on continuously learning key
   personality traits on-line, for self-evolving a system to a state that
   optimizes performance hierarchically across the circuit, platform, and
   application levels. SLIC will not only optimize integrated-system
   performance but also reduce costs through yield enhancement since
   systems that would have before been deemed to have weak personalities
   (unreliable, faulty, etc.) can now be recovered through the use of SLIC.}},

Abstract = {{The recently proposed ``Information friction{''} model accounts for
   energy losses incurred in moving bits on a computational substrate and
   was first studied in the context of encoding and decoding computations
   for communication. Information friction loss is modeled as being
   proportional to bit-meters, the sum of the lengths over which the bits
   are transported during the computation. Its analysis provides us with an
   understanding of the fundamental energy requirements for computation.
   In this paper, we obtain lower bounds on information friction for
   several canonical computations that have been analyzed to obtain
   ``AT(2){''} bounds in the context of what is called ``VLSI
   complexity{''} and, more recently, in deriving computation throughput in
   the context of wireless sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of communicating data from
   distributed sensors for the goal of inference. Two inference problems of
   linear regression and binary linear classification are investigated.
   Assuming perfect training of the classifier, an approximation of the
   problem of minimizing classification error-probability under Gaussianity
   assumptions leads us to recover Fisher score: a metric that is commonly
   used for feature selection in machine learning. Further, this allows us
   to soften the notion of feature selection by assigning a degree of
   relevance to each feature based on the number of bits assigned to it.
   This relative relevance is used to obtain numerical results on savings
   on number of bits acquired and communicated for classification of neural
   data obtained from Electrocorticography (ECoG) experiments. The results
   demonstrate that significant savings on costs of communication can be
   achieved by compressing Big Data at the source.}},

Abstract = {{The most important challenge in the scaling down of flash memory is its
   increased inter-cell interference (ICI). If side information about ICI
   is known to the encoder, the flash memory channel can be viewed as
   similar to Costa's ``writing on dirty paper (dirty paper coding).{''} We
   first explain why flash memories are dirty due to ICI. We then show that
   ``dirty flash memory{''} can be changed into ``memory with defective
   cells{''} model by using only one pre-read operation. The asymmetry
   between write and erase operations in flash memory plays an important
   role in this change. Based on the ``memory with defective cells{''}
   model, we show that additive encoding can significantly improve the
   probability of decoding failure by using the side information.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the problem of reliable communication with a noisy encoder
   is examined. We explicitly provided the construction of the encoder and
   show that even when all logic gates that constitute the encoder are
   noisy, reliable communication with a positive rate is still possible.
   The encoding complexity is shown to be O(log 1/p(tar) / log 1/epsilon)
   per bit to achieve a target bit error rate p(tar), where epsilon denotes
   the error probability of each noisy gate. This complexity upper bound is
   shown to coincide with a lower bound in order sense, and is hence tight.
   The key technique in the proposed construction is to embed noisy
   decoders inside the noisy encoder, which are utilized repeatedly to
   prevent the bit error rate from escalating. The proposed noisy encoder
   has a direct application in noisy computing of a linear transform.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of working professionals gained through years of experience is
   invaluable for any organization. Extracting this knowledge allows an
   organization to optimize internal processes and facilitate training of
   new hires. Therefore, there has been a significant research effort in
   developing techniques for automated knowledge mining at workplaces.
   However, research in the past have been focused mainly on extracting
   knowledge of stationary professions such as office workers, who perform
   most of their day-to-day tasks at their desk. In this work, we propose
   an approach for mining work knowledge of physically active professions
   such as nurses, firefighters, waiters, housekeepers or janitors. We
   leverage the advances of mobile sensing to extract knowledge from
   workers with high level of mobility and physical activity patterns. We
   demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach on a real-world
   scenario of a janitor as a study subject. We show that using data
   collected from mobile devices carried by a janitor throughout their
   work, we are able to extract knowledge rules that describe generalized
   patterns of janitor's behavior. We expect the proposed method to be
   applied to other fields to mine knowledge from workplaces.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of extensive research in the last decade, activity recognition
   still faces many challenges for real-world applications. On one hand,
   when attempting to recognize various activities, different sensors play
   different on different activity classes. This heterogeneity raises the
   necessity of learning the optimal combination of sensor modalities for
   each activity. On the other hand, users may consistently or occasionally
   annotate activities. To boost recognition accuracy, we need to
   incorporate the user input and incrementally adjust the model. To tackle
   these challenges, we propose an adaptive activity recognition with
   dynamic heterogeneous sensor fusion framework. We dynamically fuse
   various modalities to characterize different activities. The model is
   consistently updated upon arrival of newly labeled data. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework, we incorporate it into popular
   feature transformation algorithms, e.g., Linear Discriminant Analysis,
   Marginal Fisher's Analysis, and Maximum Mutual Information in the
   proposed framework. Finally, we carry out experiments on a real-world
   dataset collected over two weeks. The result demonstrates the practical
   implication of our framework and its advantage over existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of real-life mobile sensing applications are becoming
   available, especially in the life-logging, fitness tracking and health
   monitoring domains. These applications use mobile sensors embedded in
   smart phones to recognize human activities in order to get a better
   understanding of human behavior. While progress has been made, human
   activity recognition remains a challenging task. This is partly due to
   the broad range of human activities as well as the rich variation in how
   a given activity can be performed. Using features that clearly separate
   between activities is crucial. In this paper, we propose an approach to
   automatically extract discriminative features for activity recognition.
   Specifically, we develop a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNN), which can capture local dependency and scale invariance of a
   signal as it has been shown in speech recognition and image recognition
   domains. In addition, a modified weight sharing technique, called
   partial weight sharing, is proposed and applied to accelerometer signals
   to get further improvements. The experimental results on three public
   datasets, Skoda (assembly line activities), Opportunity (activities in
   kitchen), Actitracker (jogging, walking, etc.), indicate that our novel
   CNN-based approach is practical and achieves higher accuracy than
   existing state-of-the-art methods.}},

   of an innovative engineer in the different stages of the innovation
   process (or the Framework for Innovative Engineering, or Framework) was
   the goal of a team of 14 engineers, entrepreneurs and engineering
   faculty who participated in two focus group discussions on how
   successful innovative engineers behave during the innovative process.
   The first focus group discussion was held in October 2012 during the NSF
   sponsored Epicenter retreat at Stanford's Sierra Camp. The second focus
   group discussion was sponsored by the NCIIA and was held for two days in
   Atlanta, Georgia at Georgia Tech in June 2013 following the annual ASEE
   meeting,
   The research question discussed at those two meetings was:
   What are the most important characteristics (knowledge, skills or
   attributes) of an innovative engineer in discovering, developing and
   implementing and sustaining an improvement-in, or a new or novel,
   product, process or concept?
   The purpose of this paper is to document and share the processes used
   and the resulting definitions and identification of innovative
   engineering characteristics that were developed during those two
   Framework focus group discussions.}},

Abstract = {{Internships prepare students for the workplace by giving them
   opportunities to develop relevant skills. The Committee on the
   Assessment of 21st Century Skills of the U.S. National Research Council
   (NRC), the operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), has
   been developing definitions of workplace skills enabling individuals to
   face 21st Century challenges. In 2010 the Committee defined three
   categories of skills underpinning a broad range of jobs: cognitive,
   interpersonal, and intrapersonal. The goal of this paper is to identify
   the NRC 21st Century skills that are related to measured internship
   performance outcomes.
   The three outcomes we studied are execution of the internship main
   tasks, learning task-related new knowledge, and overall internship
   performance. The subjects for this study include interns, participating
   in a Mexican National Internship Program from summer 2006 to summer 2010
   working at a multinational enterprise in the global steel industry,
   Ternium Mexico. Intern performance data had been collected using a
   unique instrument that was developed to evaluate the professional
   performance of the full time employees of the firm. A general model of
   internship outcomes was created using the three categories of 21st
   Century skills. Linear regression was used to predict main task and
   learning performance internship outcomes, and ordered logistic
   regression was used to predict overall internship performance. The
   results confirmed that (1) cognitive intelligence or technical skills
   are necessary but not sufficient for success in executing professional
   tasks and (2) certain interpersonal and intrapersonal skills were also
   significantly associated with better professional performance as an
   intern.}},

Abstract = {{The undergraduate program in Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie
   Mellon University is a unique additional major program for students
   earning a BS degree in a traditional engineering field. Started in 1969,
   the program continues today with the aim of expanding the skill set of
   traditional engineers to better address today's technological issues as
   they relate to society and policy. The premise of the undergraduate
   program in EPP is that engineering does not operate in a vacuum separate
   from society. The program has been educating engineers to broadly
   approach engineering problems, to work effectively in multidisciplinary
   teams, and to consider nontechnical perspectives, long before the
   characteristics of the ``Engineer of 2020{''} 1 was ever defined.
   This paper discusses the EPP program over its four decades and how the
   program integrates with the traditional engineering programs. We discuss
   the curriculum over time, the course selections students make, and the
   benefits our alumni receive from the program. We will give an overview
   of our capstone EPP Projects course, a truly interdisciplinary teamwork
   situation addressing current technology issues. Finally we reflect on
   how the program achieves the ABET (a) through (k) outcomes and work in
   the ABET system, and how the program has been successful these past 40
   years.
   We do not expect other institutions to duplicate our program
   necessarily, as it requires a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration
   and extensive commitment at all levels of the university for success and
   longevity. However, we want to share the elements of our curriculum and
   courses with others with similar endeavors (certificate programs,
   minors) and with others considering creating broad interdisciplinary
   courses across majors. Our experience can guide decisions for developing
   these programs and courses and help deal with the challenges these
   programs and courses might have.}},

Abstract = {{To support a multi-standard platform using Software Defined Radio (SDR),
   reconfigurable Radio Frequency (RF) front-ends have recently been
   proposed as a more reliable front-end than the currently used fixed
   wide-band RF front-ends. With these reconfigurable front-ends, each
   possible configuration must be characterized in terms of its RF
   impairments, to decide its suitability for a particular communication
   standard. RF impairment estimation has previously been studied for fixed
   RF front-ends, with respect to the impairment most likely to affect a
   particular standard. However, in a reconfigurable RF system, several RF
   impairments may simultaneously be present, since only a few of the many
   possible configurations will be suitable as a front-end. In this paper,
   we show how several RF parameters can simultaneously be estimated using
   the baseband signal. The RF parameters chosen are the ones that are most
   likely to affect the heterodyne front-ends that are popular in current
   SDRs; namely nonlinearity, frequency offset, noise figure and gain. The
   invariance of each parameter's estimator to the other parameters is
   accomplished by using a subspace-based approach based on a carefully
   chosen bilinear model. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed
   invariant estimators are more accurate than previous estimators, since
   the latter are designed for single impairment estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Background fluorescence is a frequently encountered problem in
   biological fluorescence microscopy. It often significantly lowers the
   image signal-to-noise ratio and poses substantial challenges to
   subsequent computational image analysis. Here we propose a general
   computational method for separating and removing background fluorescence
   from a single fluorescence microscopy image. The method is formulated as
   solving a constrained convex optimization problem and assumes that the
   background signal is low-rank and additive to the sparse foreground
   signal. Solution of the optimization problem is found using a
   forward-backward algorithm. Our method only requires a single image and
   can be used in a broad range of biological fluorescence applications. We
   first validate performance of our method using synthetic image data. We
   then demonstrate applications of the method to actual biological image
   data.}},

   studies. Mean-shift clustering provides a powerful approach for
   automated biological shape classification because it is a nonparametric
   clustering technique that does not impose artificial constraints on the
   number and distributions of the shape classes. However, the
   high-dimensionality of the shape space often causes significant
   performance deterioration in kernel density estimation in mean-shift
   clustering. To address this problem, we developed a dimension reduction
   approach that preserves the geometrical structure of the shape space
   while allowing a significant acceleration of mean-shift clustering
   computation by more than one order of magnitude. We validated
   performance of the algorithm on a generic shape dataset and then used
   the algorithm to analyze morphology of axonal mitochondria in neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Multichannel microscopy has emerged as a technique for imaging multiple
   targets (molecules, protein distributions, etc.) simultaneously.
   Discovering the relative changes in these targets (i.e. distribution of
   different proteins) is fundamental for understanding cell structure and
   function. We describe a new method for quantifying and visualizing
   relationships between multiple targets, from a set of segmented
   multichannel cells. The method is based on combining the canonical
   correlation analysis technique with a framework for analyzing images
   based on the concept of optimal mass transportation. We apply the method
   towards understanding chromatin distribution in cancer nuclei as a
   function of nuclear envelope shape. We also show that sub cellular
   distribution of mitochondria can be used to predict the sub cellular
   localization of actin fibers in yeast cells. Finally, we also describe
   the application of the method towards understanding relationships
   between nuclear and cellular shapes in 2D HeLa cells. We believe that
   the method could serve as a general tool for mining relationships
   between different sub cellular protein/molecule distributions as well as
   organelle shapes.}},

Abstract = {{Localization-based super-resolution techniques are revolutionizing
   biological research by breaking the diffraction limit of fluorescence
   microscopy. Each super-resolution image is reconstructed from a time
   series of images of randomly activated fluorophores. Here, a fundamental
   question is to determine the minimal imaging length so that the
   reconstructed image faithfully reflects the biological structures under
   observation. So far, proposed methods focus entirely on image
   resolution, which reflects localization uncertainty and fluorophore
   density, without taking into account the fact that images of biological
   structures are structured rather than random patterns. Here, we propose
   a different approach to determine imaging length based on direct
   quantification of image structural information using Gabor filters.
   Experimental results show that this approach is superior over approaches
   that only account for image-intensity distribution, confirming the
   importance of using structural information. In contrast to
   resolution-based methods, our method does not require an artificial
   selection of image resolution and provides a statistically rigorous
   strategy for determining imaging length based on image structural
   information.}},

   technique for imaging extended defects in single crystals. While similar
   to transmission electron microscopy, ECCI is performed in a scanning
   electron microscope and requires little sample preparation. Here, we
   first show that ECCI can be used to characterize a variety of extended
   defects, including threading dislocations, misfit dislocations, and
   stacking faults, in heteroepitaxially grown samples of GaP on Si. Then,
   as a proof of concept, misfit dislocations are characterized across a 4
   `' wafer of GaP/Si. Imaging over such a large area is a prime example of
   an application that would be difficult to perform by TEM, but can easily
   be performed by ECCI.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address a communication network design problem for
   distributed computation with privacy guarantees. More precisely, given a
   possible communication graph between different agents in a network, the
   objective is to design a protocol, by proper selection of the weights in
   the dynamics induced by the communication graph, such that 1) weighted
   average consensus of the initial states of all the agents will be
   reached; and 2) there are privacy guarantees, where each agent is not
   able to retrieve the initial states of non-neighbor agents, with the
   exception of a small subset of agents ( that will be precisely
   characterized). In this paper, we assume that the network is
   cooperative, i.e., each agent is passive in the sense that it executes
   the protocol correctly and does not provide incorrect information to its
   neighbors, but may try to retrieve the initial states of non-neighbor
   agents. Furthermore, we assume that each agent knows the communication
   protocol.}},

   modeling of power system dynamics which includes dynamics of
   power-electronically controlled devices, such as Flexible AC
   Transmission Systems (FACTS) and High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)
   lines. This approach proposes an interaction variable-based power system

   contribution is an ectropy-based cooperative controller for FACTS
   capable of transiently stabilizing generator dynamics and extending the

Abstract = {{Ensuring the security of control systems against integrity attacks is a
   major challenge. Due to the events of Stuxnet, replay attacks in
   particular have been considered by the research community. Replaying
   previous measurements of a system in steady state allows an adversary to
   generate statistically correct virtual outputs which can bypass
   traditional detectors. The adversary can then inject destabilizing
   inputs to cause damage to the plant. The method of injecting secret
   noisy control inputs, or physical watermarking, has recently been
   proposed to detect replay attacks. However, the proposed watermarking
   design methods assume that the adversary does not use his potential
   access to real time communication channels to create stealthy virtual
   outputs to send to the defender. In this paper, we formulate an attack
   model for an adversary who uses knowledge of the system as well as
   access to a subset of real time control inputs and sensor outputs to
   construct stealthy virtual outputs. A robust physical watermark and
   detector to counter such an adversary is proposed.}},

   collection of modular server blocks which cooperatively process
   multi-class, inter-dependent workload. We propose a coordinated
   two-stage control strategy of data centers based on the adaptive robust
   optimization framework. In stage 1, the optimal capacity of each server
   block is found based on predicted arrival rates of future workload,
   taking into account the potential QoS cost in stage 2; Then in stage 2,
   the load balancer distributes incoming workload to server blocks to
   achieve optimal QoS, after observing the actual workload. We show
   through simulations that the proposed approach achieves lower total
   costs as well as less QoS variations compared to a start-of-art baseline
   approach with reasonable level of conservativeness.}},

Abstract = {{The massive growth in mobile devices is likely to give rise to the
   leasing out of compute and data resources on mobile devices to
   third-parties to enable applications to be run across multiple mobile
   devices. However, users who lease their mobile devices out need to run
   applications from unknown third parties, and these untrusted
   applications may harm their devices or access unauthorized personal
   data. We propose STOVE, a data and execution model for structuring
   untrusted applications to be secure by construction, to achieve strict
   and verifiable execution isolation, and observable access control for
   data. STOVE uses formal logic to verify that untrusted code meets
   isolation properties which imply that hosts running the code cannot be
   harmed, and that untrusted code cannot directly access host data. STOVE
   performs all data accesses on behalf of untrusted code, allowing all
   access control decisions to be reliably performed in one place. Thus,
   users can run untrusted applications structured using the STOVE model on
   their systems, with strong guarantees, based on formal proofs, that
   these applications will not harm their system nor access unauthorized
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth in mobile devices will give rise to the trend of the
   leasing out of compute and data resources on mobile devices to
   third-parties for applications to be run on multiple mobile devices.
   However, these third-party applications running on leased mobile devices
   are typically written by unknown entities, and cannot be trusted by
   mobile device owners. Current mobile device platforms (e.g. Android)
   have permissions and access control systems designed for mobile apps
   that are written by reputable developers and vetted by authoritative app
   stores, and they are not suitable for untrusted apps. We propose
   STOVEPipe, an observable access control system for user data on mobile
   devices for untrusted third-party applications. STOVEPipe ensures that
   untrusted code is isolated and cannot directly access system data, and
   performs all data accesses on behalf of untrusted apps. This enables
   STOVEPipe to observe all data accessed by untrusted apps, implement
   content-based access control, perform accounting and auditing on
   accessed data easily, and perform privacy-preserving data
   transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromorphic computing system (NCS) is a promising architecture to
   combat the well-known memory bottleneck in Von Neumann architecture. The
   recent breakthrough on memristor devices made an important step toward
   realizing a low-power, small-footprint NCS on-a-chip. However, the
   currently low manufacturing reliability of nano-devices and the voltage
   IR-drop along metal wires and memristors arrays severely limits the
   scale of memristor crossbar based NCS and hinders the design
   scalability. In this work, we propose a novel system reduction scheme
   that significantly lowers the required dimension of the memristor
   crossbars in NCS while maintaining high computing accuracy. An IR-drop
   compensation technique is also proposed to overcome the adverse impacts
   of the wire resistance and the sneak-path problem in large memristor
   crossbar designs. Our simulation results show that the proposed
   techniques can improve computing accuracy by 27.0\% and 38.7\% less
   circuit area compared to the original NCS design.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel subset simulation (SUS) technique to
   efficiently estimate the rare failure rate for nanoscale circuit blocks
   (e.g., SRAM, DFF, etc.) in high-dimensional variation space. The key
   idea of SUS is to express the rare failure probability of a given
   circuit as the product of several large conditional probabilities by
   introducing a number of intermediate failure events. These conditional
   probabilities can be efficiently estimated with a set of Markov chain
   Monte Carlo samples generated by a modified Metropolis algorithm, and
   then used to calculate the rare failure rate of the circuit. To
   quantitatively assess the accuracy of SUS, a statistical methodology is
   further proposed to accurately estimate the confidence interval of SUS
   based on the theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our
   experimental results of two nanoscale circuit examples demonstrate that
   SUS achieves significantly enhanced accuracy over other traditional
   techniques when the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a
   few hundred.}},

Abstract = {{Physically Asynchronous/Logically Synchronous (PALS) is an architecture
   pattern that allows developers to design and verify a system as though
   all nodes executed synchronously. The correctness of PALS protocol was
   formally verified. However, the implementation of PALS adds additional
   code that is otherwise not needed. In our case, we have a middleware
   (PALSWare) that supports PALS systems. In this paper, we introduce a
   verification framework that shows how we can apply Software Model
   Checking (SMC) to verify a PALS system at the source code level. SMC is
   an automated and exhaustive source code checking technology. Compared to
   verifying (hardware or software) models, verifying the actual source
   code is more useful because it minimizes any chance of false
   interpretation and eliminates the possibility of missing software bugs
   that were absent in the model but introduced during implementation. In
   other words, SMC reduces the semantic gap between what is verified and
   what is executed.
   Our approach is compositional, i.e., the verification of PALSWare is
   done separately from applications. Since PALSWare is inherently
   concurrent, to verify it via SMC we must overcome the statespace
   explosion problem, which arises from concurrency and asynchrony. To this
   end, we develop novel simplification abstractions, prove their
   soundness, and then use these abstractions to reduce the verification of
   a system with many threads to verifying a system with a relatively small
   number of threads. When verifying an application, we leverage the
   (already verified) synchronicity guarantees provided by the PALSWare to
   reduce the verification complexity significantly. Thus, our approach
   uses both ``abstraction{''} and ``composition{''}, the two main
   techniques to reduce statespace explosion. This separation between
   verification of PALSWare and applications also provides better
   management against upgrades to either. We validate our approach by
   verifying the current PALSWare implementation, and several
   PALSWare-based distributed real time applications.}},

Abstract = {{The operating environment of cellular networks can be in a constant
   state of change. One Singaporean operator expressed difficulty with the
   coverage assertion (CA) problem of whether regulated minimum coverage is
   met, especially in urban areas. Currently, the operator manually
   appraises coverage through laborious and expensive walk/drive-tests.
   In this paper, we propose Tattle, a distributed, low-cost and
   comprehensive cellular network measurement collection and processing
   framework. We exemplify Tattle by leveraging on participating UEs to
   report on network coverage in real-time.
   Tattle exploits wireless local-area interfaces to exchange RSCP
   measurements amongst devices to preserve the co-locality of readings and
   conserve power. We propose U-CURE, a clustering algorithm which
   considers sample location uncertainty and the knowledge of device
   co-location to remove erroneously localized readings. We develop a
   prototype app on the Android (TM) platform as a proof-of-concept of the
   Tattle framework. We then use the Tattle framework to perform extensive
   RSCP measurement collection and processing in various areas in
   Singapore, collecting over 3.78 million readings. We present
   visualizations of mean signal coverage and RSCP CDFs for various areas
   of interest. The latter is a key output of Tattle, which helps operators
   to appraise coverage and solve the CA problem by relying on subscriber
   measurements, instead of expensive, laborious and limited-scale
   walk-/drive-tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of identifying the minimum number of
   entities (agents), referred to as information gatherers, that are able
   to infer all the states in a dynamical social network. The information
   gatherers can be, for instance, service providers and the remaining
   agents the clients, each comprising several dynamic states associated
   with the services and personal information. The problem of identifying
   the minimum number of information gatherers can constitute a way to
   create coalitions to oversee the entire state of the system, and
   consequently the behavior of the agents in the social network. The
   dynamical social network is assumed to be modelled as a linear
   time-invariant system, and we will make use of the structural systems
   concept, i.e., by considering only the sparsity pattern (location of
   zeroes/non-zeroes) of the system coupling matrix. As a consequence, the
   design guarantees derived hold for almost all numerical parametric
   realizations of the system. In this paper, we show that this problem is
   NP-hard: in addition, we provide a reduction of the coalition problem to
   a minimum set covering problem that, in practice, leads to efficient
   (polynomial complexity) approximation schemes for solving the coalition
   problem with guaranteed optimality gaps. Finally, an example is provided
   which illustrates the analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Localizing a source of diffusion is a crucial task in various
   applications such as epidemics quarantine and identification of
   trendsetters in social networks. We analyze the problem of selecting the
   minimum number of observed nodes that would lead to unambiguous source
   localization, i.e. achieve network observability, when both infection
   times of all the nodes, as well as the network structure cannot be fully
   observed. Under a simple propagation scenario, we model the assumption
   that, while the structure of local communities is well known, the
   connections between different communities are often unobserved. We
   present a necessary and sufficient condition for the minimum number of
   observed nodes in networks where all components have either a tree, a
   grid, a cycle or a complete graph structure. Additionally, we provide a
   sufficient condition for the selection of observed nodes when the
   components are of arbitrary structure. Through simulation, we illustrate

Abstract = {{Small cell size and dense cell placement have been considered in the
   Long Term Evolution standard. However, small cell may result in high
   interference between cells. Moreover, the random geographic topology of
   small cell networks make them hard to analyze. In this paper, a new
   approach called matrix graph is proposed which is robust to interference
   and random topology, and takes advantage of the small cell size. Based
   on theoretical properties of matrix graphs, an asymptotically optimal
   algorithm is obtained to address the frequency allocation problem with
   interference constraints, which is usually NP-hard. The computation
   complexity decreases with cell size and grows linearly with network
   size. Simulation results also support the theoretical performance gains.
   The proposed matrix graph approach is capable of designing and analyzing
   the next-generation dense cellular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Bond percolation is a network process that traditionally addresses the
   question when there is a path between two sites or two clusters in a
   network. This has been used to study the circulation of goods or flows
   in networked structures as well as network resilience. This paper
   proposes and analyzes a dynamic bond percolation model where bonds
   (i.e., edges) open (i.e., form) or close (i.e., terminate) according to
   random micro interactions. We model the edge dynamics through topology
   independent and topology-dependent processes-spontaneous formation or
   termination of edges and the formation of edge \{a, b\}between two sites
   a and b that depends on the current number of existing edges at a and b.
   We show that the resulting network process is Markov and reversible, and
   we determine analytically its equilibrium distribution, avoiding having
   to solve a eigenvalue-eigenvector problem that quickly becomes
   intractable for even moderate sized networks.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of tissues by palpation has been a regular part of physical
   examination for generations yet it relies on the experience and judgment
   of a clinician to derive clinical meaning from the sense of touch.
   Palpation of breast tissues is universally considered a key component in
   early detection and improving breast cancer outcomes, especially in low-
   and middle-income countries. We describe a diagnostic device based on an
   optical tonometer that uses an optical signal and a highly deformable
   elastomer to quantify the differential mechanical stiffness of
   interrogated tissues. Preliminary analyses of video and still images
   from palpation, both in-vivo and with synthetic analog tissues, with the
   system are described. This system offers an economical alternative to
   expensive imaging with the ability to be deployed on a mobile phone

Abstract = {{Memory layout transformations via data reorganization are very common
   operations, which occur as a part of the computation or as a performance
   optimization in data- intensive applications. These operations require
   inefficient memory access patterns and roundtrip data movement through
   the memory hierarchy, failing to utilize the performance and energy-
   efficiency potentials of the memory subsystem. This paper proposes a
   highbandwidth and energy- efficient hardware accelerated memory layout
   transform (HAMLeT) system integrated within a 3Dstacked DRAM. HAMLeT
   uses a low- overhead hardware that exploits the existing infrastructure
   in the logic layer of 3Dstacked DRAMs, and does not require any changes
   to the DRAM layers, yet it can fully exploit the locality and
   parallelism within the stack by implementing efficient layout transform
   algorithms. We analyze matrix layout transform operations (such as
   matrix transpose, matrix blocking and 3D matrix rotation) and
   demonstrate that HAMLeT can achieve close to peak system utilization,
   offering up to an order of magnitude performance improvement compared to
   the CPU and GPU memory subsystems which does not employ HAMLeT.}},

Abstract = {{Big data has been becoming ubiquitous and applied in numerous fields
   recently. The challenges to solve a large-scale machine learning problem
   in big data scenario generally lie in three aspects. Firstly, a proposed
   machine learning algorithm has to be appropriated for the distributed
   optimization problem. Secondly, it needs a platform for the distributed
   implementation. Finally, the communication delays different machines may
   cause problems in convergence even though the non-distributed algorithm
   shows a good convergence rate. In order to solve these challenges, we
   propose a new machine learning approach named Distributed
   Class-dependent Feature Analysis (DCFA), to combine the advantages of
   sparse representation in an over-complete dictionary. The classifier is
   based on the estimation of class-specific optimal filters, by solving an
   l(1)-norm optimization problem. We demonstrate how this problem is
   solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and also
   explore relevant convergency details. More importantly, our proposed
   framework can be efficiently implemented on a robust distributed
   framework. Thus, it improves both accuracy and computational time in
   large-scale databases. Our method achieves very high classification
   accuracies in face recognition in the presence of occlusions on AR
   database. It also outperforms the state of the art methods in object
   recognition on two challenging large-scale object databases, i.e.
   Caltech101 and Caltech256. It hence shows its applicability to general
   computer vision and pattern recognition problems. In addition,
   computational time experiments show our distributed method achieves high
   speedup of 7.85x on Caltech256 databases with just 10 machine nodes
   compared to the non-distributed version and can gain even more with more
   computing resources.}},

Abstract = {{In sparse highway vehicular networks, the high probability for network
   disconnection at the initial stages of introducing the DSRC technology
   can be mitigated by the deployment of fixed infrastructure points known
   as Road Side Units (RSU). However, due to the cost associated with the
   deployment and maintenance of significant numbers of RSUs, it is highly
   unlikely that the majority of highways will be seeing RSU support in the
   near future.
   In this paper we study the impact of specific vehicular network
   parameters in the communication delays in infrastructure-less highway
   scenarios: first, the deceleration of vehicles, and consequently, a
   decrease in their separation from succeeding vehicles; and second, the
   transmission power of the IEEE 802.11p radio, which can be increased to
   achieve faster connectivity with the succeeding vehicle. Our results
   show that the connectivity of sparse vehicular networks can be improved
   substantially by varying these parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Super-resolution localization microscopy (SRLM) is a new imaging
   modality that is capable of resolving cellular structures at nanometer
   resolution, providing unprecedented insight into biological processes.
   Each SRLM image is reconstructed from a time series of images of
   randomly activated fluorophores that are localized at nanometer
   resolution and represented by clusters of particles of varying spatial
   densities. SRLM images differ significantly from conventional
   fluorescence microscopy images because of fundamental differences in
   image formation. Currently, however, quantitative image analysis
   techniques developed or optimized specifically for SRLM images are
   lacking, which significantly limit accurate and reliable image analysis.
   This is especially the case for image segmentation, an essential
   operation for image analysis and understanding. In this study, we
   propose a simple SRLM image segmentation technique based on estimating
   and smoothing spatial densities of fluorophores using adaptive
   anisotropic kernels. Experimental results showed that the proposed
   method provided robust and accurate segmentation of SRLM images and
   significantly outperformed conventional segmentation approaches such as
   active contour methods in segmentation accuracy.}},

   vanishing points and road structure. Regarding the challenges, we
   propose a feature that can simultaneously capture local appearance and

   appearance variations such as shadows and ground markers. Therefore, we
   propose a novel conditional random field (CRF) model which includes
   hidden states indicating confident nodes and propagate their confidence

   polycrystalline materials reveal some interesting challenges {[}1].
   Addressing first the image processing issues, electron back-scatter
   diffraction (EBSD) {[}2] relies heavily on image transformations of
   electron diffraction patterns. High energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM)
   {[}3] also relies on thresholding of the diffractograms for peak
   identification {[}4]. By contrast to the standard finite element method,
   an image-based approach {[}5] that relies on the Fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT) has started to be used for simulating plastic deformation because
   it offers a more efficient solution of the same equations (e.g.
   mechanical equilibrium). It is possible, for example, to import directly
   a measured 3D image from HEDM into the FFT simulation code and simulate
   with no need for the time-consuming step of creating a 3D mesh. Common
   filters applied to orientation maps in particular, include grain average
   strain, Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM), Grain Orientation Spread

Abstract = {{Markov random field (MRF) models have become extremely popular for
   regularization in image segmentation. They are useful for imposing local
   constraints, but they have limited capability for imposing global
   constraints. Marked Point Process (MPP) models incorporate global
   information, such as shape, as a prior, but local constraints, such as
   pixel-wise interaction, are not easily modeled. In this paper, we
   propose a combined MRF and MPP model and demonstrate its usefulness for
   micrograph analysis. Our hybrid model imposes both local and global
   constraints, at the pixel level as well as the object level. A multiple
   birth and death algorithm is then used to approximate the MAP
   segmentation using the hybrid model. We present experimental results to
   show the advantage of our model over the MPP for object identification
   and the MRF for segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Vitreoretinal microsurgery requires precise hand-eye coordination to
   manipulate delicate structures within the eye on the order of tens of
   microns. To achieve these tasks, surgeons use tools of diameter 0.9 mm
   or less to access the eye's interior structures. The level of force
   required during these manipulations is often below the human tactile
   threshold, requiring the surgeon to rely on subtle visual cues or to
   apply larger forces above the tactile threshold for feedback. However,
   both of these methods can lead to tissue damage. Excursions can be made
   into tissues which are not felt by the surgeon, while larger forces have
   a higher chance of damaging tissue within the eye. To prevent damage to
   the retina and other anatomy, we present the implementation of hybrid
   position/force control operating in the sub-tactile force range for a
   handheld robotic system. This approach resulted in a 42\% reduction in
   the mean force and 52\% reduction in maximum force during peeling tasks.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the Partial View Heat Kernel (PVHK) descriptor, for the
   purpose of 3D object representation and recognition from partial views,
   assumed to be partial object surfaces under self occlusion. PVHK
   describes partial views in a geometrically meaningful way, i.e., by
   establishing a unique relation between the shape of the view and the
   descriptor. PVHK is also stable with respect to sensor noise and
   therefore adequate for sensors, such as the current active 3D cameras.
   Furthermore, PVHK takes full advantage of the dual 3D/RGB nature of
   current sensors and seamlessly incorporates appearance information onto
   the 3D information. We formally define the PVHK descriptor, discuss
   related work, provide evidence of the PVHK properties and validate them
   in three purposefully diverse datasets, and demonstrate its potential
   for recognition tasks.}},

Abstract = {{One major challenge for untethered micro-scale mobile robotics is the
   manipulation of external objects in the robot's three-dimensional (3D)
   work environment. Here, we present a method to use the capillary force
   at a solid-liquid-gas interface to reversibly attach objects to a mobile
   magnetic microrobot. This is accomplished by the addition of a cavity in
   the hydrophobic microrobot, in which an air bubble is captured when the
   microrobot is placed in a water environment. The extension of the air
   bubble from the cavity is adjusted dynamically by controlling the
   pressure of the workspace environment. A peak switching ratio between
   the maximum and minimum gripping forces of 14:1 is shown for controlled
   attachment/detachment experiments, which allows for reliable
   pick-and-place operation. This work introduces an analytical capillary
   adhesion model and demonstrates control of the bubble size for
   pick-and-place gripping. A proof-of-concept demonstration of 3D
   manipulation in a fluidic environment shows the potential of capillary
   gripping for future use in confined environments such as inside
   microfluidic devices for transportation or assembly of hydrophobic

   capture prey. Since these grasping maneuvers are predominantly in the
   sagittal plane, we consider the planar system and present mathematical
   models and algorithms for motion planning and control, required to
   incorporate similar capabilities in quadrotors equipped with a monocular
   camera. In particular, we develop a dynamical model directly in the
   image space, show that this is a differentially-flat system with the
   image features serving as flat outputs, outline a method for generating
   trajectories directly in the image feature space, develop a geometric
   visual controller that considers the second order dynamics (in contrast
   to most visual servoing controllers that assume first order dynamics),
   and present validation of our methods through both simulations and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel synthesis method for the design of
   micro-scale robotic flexure mechanisms. A structural optimization
   method, termed the mechanism-based approach, is used to identify the
   optimal topology and shape of the flexure mechanisms based on their lump
   stiffness characteristics. Using several different fitness functions,
   several optimal flexure designs have been synthesized for use in
   millimeter-scale mobile grippers (mu-grippers). The stiffness
   characteristics of the optimal mu-grippers are shown to be better than
   the thin-beam designs developed using human intuition. Two large-scale
   prototypes are constructed and experiments are conducted to validate the
   stiffness analysis. The experimental results are within 20\% of the
   analytical expectations. As a proof of concept, at-scale mu-grippers are
   constructed based on photolithography and replica molding methods, and
   demonstrated in simple actuation. The optimal mu-grippers can be
   applicable for cell manipulations in future works.}},

Abstract = {{In a grid with highly distributed resources, an effective distributed
   algorithm for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) will result in eff cient
   resource allocation across the system. This paper investigates the
   impact of communication on the performance of a fully distributed DC OPF
   algorithm, which solves the f rst order optimality conditions through an
   iterative process. In this distributed algorithm, at each iteration,
   every bus exchanges information with its physically connected
   neighboring buses and updates the local variables by evaluating a simple
   function. This paper suggests that sharing additional information
   between buses without physical connections across the system can speed
   up the convergence of the algorithm. A key aspect is the constrained
   selection of these additional communication links and the effective
   integration of this information in the update of the local variables
   which is the focus of this paper. A proof of concept is given using the
   IEEE-118 bus test system as a test case.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Technology has significantly contributed to the advancement of
   Protection and Automation gear; recent years have witnessed a great
   development of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) which can be
   described as multipurpose and multifunctional relays. These devices are
   fitted with various communication interfaces such as serial and
   Ethernet. Proprietary protocols for the communication of IEDs are no
   longer sufficient. Hence, protocols such as IEC1850, which utilize
   Ethernet networks, were developed to harness the full potential of
   IED-to-IED communication, as well as to standardise all aspects of
   Control and Automation communication functions. However, connecting
   several IEDs from different vendors via IEC 61850 standard and
   configuring them is not a trivial task. Various parameters should be
   known and inputted to communication software. This paper illustrates how
   IEC61850 based Protection IEDs are deployed, configured and managed over
   Omicron's IEDScout software. Victoria University's portable IEC 61850
   test rack which is composed of several IEDs has been utilized in this
   research work. It provides valuable hands-on experiences to researchers
   and professionals who would like to keep abreast with IEC61850 standard
   and the equipment which is compatible with it. There many vendors with
   many Software packages to interact with relays and carry out the
   necessary configuration. Future work will discuss other substation
   automation packages and procedures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by major needs for fast and accurate on-line
   data analysis tools in the emerging electric energy systems, due to the
   recent penetration of distributed green energy, distributed
   intelligence, and plug-in electric vehicles. Instead of taking the
   traditional complex physical model based approach, this paper proposes a
   data-driven method, leading to an effective topology estimation approach
   for the smart grid. Specifically, we first introduce the data-driven
   topology estimation problem. Then, a novel Logistic Kernel Regression is
   proposed in a Bayesian framework based on Nearest Neighbors search.
   Notably, unlike many machine learning approaches that do not account for
   physical constraints, and distinctive from deterministic engineering
   modeling defined solely by physical laws, this paper for the first time
   combines the two into one single regression modeling for topology
   estimation. Simulation results of the proposed method show that the new
   method produces a topology estimate excelling the current industrial
   approach. Finally, the proposed method can be implemented given recent
   advances in machine learning, which are becoming drivers and sources of
   data previously unavailable in the electric power industry.}},

Abstract = {{As industry continues to embrace incremental software development, many
   projects run into the challenge of incrementally evolving cross-cutting
   concerns such as performance. To better understand how projects are
   handling this challenge in practice, we captured experiences from two
   financial services that made a series of performance improvements over
   several months. We discovered some commonality in how these projects
   refine the work, enabling incremental requirements analysis and
   allocation of work. In this paper, we describe two key aspects of this
   evolution: refining the concern by breaking it into its constituent
   parts to drive design tasks and allocating the parts to iterations as
   the software evolves. Two practices we observed that support this
   evolution include ratcheting broadened to conceptually describe the
   refinement approach in dimensions of response to stimuli in a given
   context and analysis conducted concurrently and loosely coupled from
   implementation work. This refinement supports ongoing exploration of the
   problem and solution, and evolutionary development, such as course
   changes, when new information is acquired.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic assignment and re-assignment of large number of simple and cheap
   robots across multiple sites is relevant to applications like autonomous
   survey, environmental monitoring and reconnaissance. In this paper, we
   present supervisory control laws for cost-effective (re)-distribution of
   a robotic swarm among multiple sites. We consider a robotic swarm
   consisting of tens to hundreds of simple robots with limited battery
   life and limited computation and communication capabilities. The robots
   have the capability to recognize the site that they are in and receive
   messages from a central supervisory controller, but they cannot
   communicate with other robots. There is a cost (e.g., energy, time) for
   the robots to move from one site to another. These limitations make the
   swarm hard to control to achieve the desired configurations. Our goal is
   to design control laws to move the robots from one site to another such
   that the overall cost of redistribution is minimized. This problem can
   be posed as an optimal control problem (which is hard to solve
   optimally), and has been studied to a limited extent in the literature
   when the cost objective is time. We consider the total energy consumed
   as the cost objective and present a linear programming based heuristic
   for computing a stochastic transition law for the robots to move between
   sites. We evaluate our method for different objectives and show through
   Monte Carlo simulations that our method outperforms other proposed
   methods in the literature for the objective of time as well as more
   general objectives (like total energy consumed).}},

Abstract = {{Software development processes are fundamentally based on efficient and
   effective communication. Communication between engineers, between
   engineers and managers, and between teams and clients are all essential
   components of a successful project. Requirements must be effectively
   transferred from client to engineer, specifications must be transitioned
   from architect to engineer, and constant communication between project
   team members, managers, and clients throughout the project life cycle is
   critical to the success of projects of any complexity. To succeed in a
   world where technologies, requirements, ideas, tools, and timelines are
   constantly changing, information must be accurate, readily available,
   easily found, and ideally delivered constantly, in real-time, to all
   team members. To meet these challenges, modern software development has
   evolved to encompass key concepts of adaptability to change and
   data-driven project management. A recent movement dubbed DevOps has
   attempted to use automated systems to bridge the information gap between
   project team entities and to enforce rigorous processes to ensure
   real-time communications.
   In this paper, the authors frame this challenge as a communications
   problem that can be addressed by the introduction of specifically
   designed autonomous system actors and processes. Successful
   implementation of such a methodology will enable efficient, effective,
   and immediate data collection, synthesis, and transfer of information
   between all requisite entities within the software project. A
   generalized model of DevOps will be presented and analyzed, offering a
   formalization of the communications and actors requisite to any
   effective software development process. These concepts will be further
   developed to illustrate the information flow between human and system
   actors, and explore how this model can be used to optimize the processes
   of a software development team to maximize productivity and quality of
   work products.}},

Abstract = {{Communication skills are critical to the success of students entering
   the working world as professional engineers because effective writing
   underpins many of their duties. Unfortunately, engineering curricula are
   usually filled with discipline-specific courses, leaving little room for
   communication-related electives. Some engineering programs have started
   to integrate communication instruction into their existing curricula.
   However, subject instructors frequently struggle to teach communication
   skills in their courses as lessons often extend beyond their areas of
   expertise, and Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) programs are not
   available at every school. Our project addresses this problem through
   the development of an online self-learning resource that incorporates
   video lessons, self-assessment activities, and hands-on exercises. This
   paper describes a major challenge that we encountered while testing our
   online self-learning resource-motivating students to try the tool when
   they are not required to use it-and how we addressed the problem by
   conducting a testing exercise of motivation approaches that lead us to
   modify the ways we engage students in the online self-learning resource.}},

Abstract = {{Formal user and system documentation is often completely ignored by
   development teams. This is a direct result of the pain standard
   documentation tools and processes cause to technical teams. Traditional
   documentation models hamper the velocity of development. User and/or
   system documentation is often created and maintained using clunky binary
   files (i.e. {*}.docx). Generally, collaboration systems include passing
   updated versions through long email chains, or network file shares.
   Additionally, proprietary formats tend to suffer from inconsistencies
   across operating systems, which can lead to data corruption across teams
   with disparate work environments. Storing binary files in version
   control systems is a solution to some of these problems, but versioning
   binary files is still challenging. Automating and integrating this into
   a software development life cycle is problematic at best, often
   resulting in documents languishing behind the pace of a project, or
   being deprecated entirely. In our organization, we developed a new
   process to rapidly produce PDFs, HTML, and Word-based documentation from
   multiple authors and integrated it with our existing automated build
   system. The process is tool/environment independent and takes full
   advantage of a version control system. This has increased our
   efficiency, communication and collaboration in an oft-overlooked area in
   the software development process.}},

Abstract = {{Software defined radio has been developed for supporting multi-standard
   radio receivers, but remains vulnerable to interference. In order to
   overcome this interference challenge, this paper proposes replacing the
   fixed wide-band Radio Frequency (RF) front-end in software radio
   receivers with a reconfigurable RF front-end. We show that a software
   radio with an optimally chosen reconfigurable RF front-end outperforms
   fixed RF software radios, when the latter suffers from inter-modulation
   of blockers caused by non-linearity of its RF front-end. Moreover, we
   propose a fast optimization algorithm for selecting an optimal
   configuration of the reconfigurable RF front-end in radio environments
   with interference. This algorithm selects from among the available
   configurations of the RF front-end, and improves SINR by adapting to the
   blockers present, while requiring only a small number of trials to
   select the appropriate configuration. Thus, a reconfigurable RF
   front-end, when used in conjunction with a software radio, can
   effectively realize the development of multi-standard wireless
   communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the application of the Markov decision problem (MDP)
   framework for optimizing the autonomous charging of individual plug-in
   electric vehicles (EVs). Two infinite horizon average cost MDP
   formulations are described, one for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
   (PHEVs) and one for battery only electric vehicles (BEVs). In both
   formulations, we assume no direct input from the driver to the smart
   charger about the driver's travel schedule. Instead, we use stochastic
   models of plug-in and unplug behaviors as well as energy required for
   transportation to represent a driver's charging requirements. We also
   assume that electric energy prices follow a Markov random process. These
   stochastic models can be built from historical data on vehicle usage.
   The objective of the MDPs is to minimize the sum of electric energy
   charging costs, driving costs, and the cost of any driver inconvenience.
   We demonstrate the solution of the MDP for a BEV and analyze the
   results. This work presents a new approach to minimizing EV charging
   costs while reducing the need for trip planning by a driver.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new heterogeneous interior positioning system
   using Wi-Fi and GPS signals. It uses the continuous Naive Bayes
   classifier to incorporate different sources of signal in a single
   probability estimate. The algorithm assumes that the signals are
   distributed normally in each location, and the parameters of these
   distributions (i.e. mean value and standard deviation) depend on the
   location only. Its accuracy of room-level positioning reached 97.1\%,
   which exceeds the performance of other systems (Redpin, WASP, ProbIN)
   tested under similar conditions. This system does not require any
   auxiliary infrastructure, but due to its heterogeneous nature can
   benefit from it. For example, stationary sensors with locations known a
   priori can be used to provide a constantly updating reference for the
   signal levels in different locations. The system can also easily
   incorporate other sources of signals such as cellular signal or
   stationary Bluetooth beacons.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an actor-oriented computer platform, which is a
   natural outgrowth of our Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems
   (DYMONDS) modeling, communications and control paradigm for smart grids.
   We summarize this approach which is physics-based and explain how its
   actor-oriented structure can support a possible multi-level computer
   platform. By combining principles of model-based Ptolemy II computer
   platform with these models, we sketch out the basis for implementing a
   DYMONDS-based computer platform for smart grids. Both the dynamic
   internal models of polymorphic actors, as well as the system model of
   computing and communication protocols relating their external interfaces
   are described. Perhaps, most important is the fact that the proposed
   computer platform can evolve dynamically as operating conditions and
   status of actors vary, and, longer-term, as different components are
   added to the physical system and different smarts are being embedded,
   rather than having to re-program every time as the physical system
   changes; this is because new semantics are introduced at the component
   interaction level rather than at the programming language level.}},

   first the source of diffusion needs to be localized. We analyze the
   problem of source localization, based on infection times of a subset of
   nodes in incompletely observed tree networks, under a simple propagation
   model. Our scenario reflects the assumption that having access to all
   the nodes and full network topology is often not feasible. We evaluate
   the number of possible topologies that are consistent with the observed
   incomplete tree. We provide a sufficient condition for the selection of
   observed nodes, such that correct localization is possible, i.e. the
   network is observable. Finally, we formulate the source localization
   problem under these assumptions as a binary linear integer program. We
   then provide a small simulation example to illustrate the effect of the
   number of observed nodes on the problem complexity and on the number of
   possible solutions for the source.}},

Abstract = {{To minimize testing and technology upgrade costs for safety-critical
   systems, a thorough understanding and analysis of architectural
   dependencies is essential. Unmanaged dependencies create cost overruns
   and degraded qualities in systems. Architecture dependency analysis in
   practice, however, is typically performed in retrospect using code
   structures, the runtime image of a system, or both. Retrospective
   analysis can miss important dependencies that surface earlier in the
   life cycle. Development artifacts such as the software architecture
   description and the software requirements specification can augment the
   analysis process; however, the quality, consistency, and content of
   these artifacts vary widely. In this paper, we apply a commonly used
   dependency analysis metric, stability, and a visualization technique,
   the dependency structure matrix, to an architecture common to
   safety-critical systems that was re-engineered to reduce safety testing
   and upgrade cost. We describe the gaps observed when running the
   analysis and discuss the need for early life-cycle dependency analysis
   for managing rework costs in industrial software development
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Although different approaches to decision-making in self adaptive
   systems have shown their effectiveness in the past by factoring in
   predictions about the system and its environment (e.g., resource
   availability), no proposal considers the latency associated with the
   execution of tactics upon the target system. However, different
   adaptation tactics can take different amounts of time until their
   effects can be observed. In reactive adaptation, ignoring adaptation
   tactic latency can lead to suboptimal adaptation decisions (e.g.,
   activating a server that takes more time to boot than the transient
   spike in traffic that triggered its activation). In proactive
   adaptation, taking adaptation latency into account is necessary to get
   the system into the desired state to deal with an upcoming situation. In
   this paper, we introduce a formal analysis technique based on model
   checking of stochastic multiplayer games (SMGs) that enables us to
   quantify the potential benefits of employing different types of
   algorithms for self-adaptation. In particular, we apply this technique
   to show the potential benefit of considering adaptation tactic latency
   in proactive adaptation algorithms. Our results show that factoring in
   tactic latency in decision making improves the outcome of adaptation. We
   also present an algorithm to do proactive adaptation that considers
   tactic latency, and show that it achieves higher utility than an
   algorithm that under the assumption of no latency is optimal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of sensor placement design for efficient
   dynamic real-time state estimation in electric power networks. Given a
   (linearized) dynamic physical model of the power system, efficient
   sensor placement strategies are proposed that minimize the observability
   index of the system. The observability index plays a key role in
   determining the minimum window length of filters that guarantee stable
   estimation error and minimizing this index allows the design of memory
   and computationally efficient filtering schemes with performance
   guarantees. Specifically, given the system dynamics, the paper addresses
   the following two sensor placement design problems: (1) determining the
   minimal number and placement of sensors that achieves a certain desired
   system observability index, and (2) given the number of sensors to be
   deployed, obtaining the placement achieving minimal system observability
   index. These problems are addressed in a structural systems framework,
   i.e., the placement strategies are obtained on the basis of the sparsity
   pattern (location of zeroes/non-zeroes) of the system coupling matrix,
   and the design guarantees hold for almost all numerical parametric
   realizations of the system. Finally, an example is provided which
   illustrates the analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Two frequency-domain methods for predicting phonon frequencies and

   methods draw input from molecular dynamics simulations and lattice
   dynamics calculations, but differ in the form of the phonon spectral
   energy density. One phonon spectral energy density expression (referred
   to as 43) can be formally derived from lattice dynamics theory. A
   similar approach in the time domain has been validated {[}Turney et al.
   Phys. Rev. B 79, 224305 (2009)]. The other phonon spectral energy
   denSity expression (referred to as Phi) has been proposed {[}Thomas et
   al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 081411(R) (2010)] but not validated. The
   expressions for Phi and Phi are presented and then applied to predict
   the phonon properties and thermal conductivities of three systems:
   Lennard-Jones argon, Stillinger-Weber silicon, and a carbon nanotube
   modeled using the Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential. (V does not
   capture the total phonon spectral energy density predicted by <13 and
   therefore cannot correctly predict the phonon lifetimes or thermal
   conductivity. Its use in future work is discouraged and we recommend the
   use of cl).}},

Abstract = {{The simple fact that human fingers are large and mobile devices are
   small has led to the perennial issue of limited surface area for
   touch-based interactive tasks. In response, we have developed Toffee, a
   sensing approach that extends touch interaction beyond the small
   confines of a mobile device and onto ad hoc adjacent surfaces, most
   notably tabletops. This is achieved using a novel application of
   acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) correlation. Previous
   time-of-arrival based systems have required semipermanent
   instrumentation of the surface and were too large for use in mobile
   devices. Our approach requires only a hard tabletop and gravity - the
   latter acoustically couples mobile devices to surfaces. We conducted an
   evaluation, which shows that Toffee can accurately resolve the bearings
   of touch events (mean error of 4.3 degrees with a laptop prototype).
   This enables radial interactions in an area many times larger than a
   mobile device; for example, virtual buttons that lie above, below and to
   the left and right.}},

Abstract = {{Production-inventory systems model the interaction of manufacturing
   processes with internal and external customers. The role of inventory in
   these systems is to buffer mismatches between production and demand
   caused by process uncertainty. Often, production and demand variability
   is described using simplified probabilistic models that ignore
   underlying characteristics such as skewness or autocorrelation. These
   models lead to suboptimal inventory policies that result in higher
   costs. This work presents a novel analysis of the impact of uncertainty
   in the performance of production-inventory systems. It quantifies the
   effect of different probabilistic descriptions of production capacity
   and demand in systems subject to lost sales or backorders. The analysis
   is based on the results of discrete-event simulations. The flexibility
   offered by simulation allows studying diverse conditions that arise in
   production-inventory systems. The results clearly illustrate the
   importance of appropriately quantifying variability and performance for
   inventory management in process networks.}},

Abstract = {{GPU performance depends not only on thread/warp level parallelism (TLP)
   but also on instruction-level parallelism (ILP). It is not enough to
   schedule instructions within basic blocks, it is also necessary to
   exploit opportunities for ILP optimization beyond branch boundaries.
   Unfortunately, modern GPUs cannot dynamically carry out such
   optimizations because they lack hardware branch prediction and cannot
   speculatively execute instructions beyond a branch.
   We propose to circumvent these limitations by adapting Trace Scheduling,
   a technique originally developed for microcode optimization. Trace
   Scheduling divides code into traces (or paths), and optimizes each trace
   in a context-independent way. Adapting Trace Scheduling to GPU code
   requires revisiting and revising each step of microcode Trace Scheduling
   to attend to branch and warp behavior, identifying instructions on the
   critical path, avoiding warp divergence, and reducing divergence time.
   Here, we propose ``Warp-Aware Trace Scheduling{''} for GPUs. As
   evaluated on the Rodinia Benchmark Suite using dynamic profiling, our
   fully-automatic optimization achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1.10x
   on a real system by increasing instructions executed per cycle (IPC) by
   a harmonic mean of 1.12x and reducing instruction serialization and
   total instructions executed.}},

Abstract = {{Water-ling technologies in rural areas of the developing world have
   enormous potential to stimulate agricultural and economic growth. The
   treadle pump, a human-powered low-cost pump designed for irrigation in
   developing countries, can help farmers maximize financial return on
   small plots of land by ending their dependency on rain-fed irrigation
   systems. The treadle pump uses a suction piston to draw groundwater to
   the surface by way of a foot-powered treadle attached to each suction
   piston. Current treadle pump designs lift water from depths up to 7
   meters at a flow-rate of 1-5 liters per second. This work seeks to
   optimize the design of the Dekhi style treadle pump, which has gained
   significant popularity due to its simplicity. A mathematical model of
   the working fluid and treadle pump structure has been developed in this
   study. Deterministic optimization methods are then employed to maximize
   the flow rate of the groundwater pumped, maximize the lift height, and
   minimize the volume of material used for manufacturing. Design variables
   for the optimization included the dimensions of the pump, well depth,
   and speed of various parts of the system. The solutions are subject to
   constraints on the geometry of the system, the bending stress in the
   treadles, and ergonomic factors. Findings indicate that significant
   technical improvements can be made on the standard Dekhi design, such as
   increasing the size of the pump cylinders and hose, while maintaining a
   standard total treadle length. These improvements could allow the Dekhi
   pump to be implemented in new regions and benefit additional rural
   farmers in the developing world.}},

Abstract = {{When most designers set out to develop a new product they solicit
   feedback from potential consumers. These data are incorporated into the
   design process in an effort to more effectively meet customer
   requirements. Often these data are used to construct a model of consumer
   preference capable of evaluating candidate designs. Although the
   mechanics of these models have been extensively studied there are still
   some open questions, particularly with respect to models of aesthetic
   preference. When constructing preference models, simplistic product
   representations are often favored over high fidelity product models in
   order to save time and expense. This work investigates how choice of
   product representation can affect model performance in visual conjoint
   analysis. Preference models for a single product, a table knife, are
   derived using three different representation schemes; simple sketches,
   solid models, and 3D printed models. Each of these representations is
   used in a separate conjoint analysis survey. The results from this study
   showed that consumer responses were inconsistent and potentially
   contradictory between different representations. Consequently, when
   using conjoint analysis for product innovation, obtaining a true
   understanding of consumer preference requires selecting representations
   based on how accurately they convey the product details in question.}},

Abstract = {{Physical prototyping is an important stage of product design where
   designers have a chance to physically evaluate and alter digitally
   created surfaces. In these scenarios, designers generate a digital
   model, manufacture and alter the prototype as needed, and redigitize the
   prototype through scanning. Despite the variety of reverse engineering
   tools, redigitizing the prototypes into forms amenable to further
   digital editing remains a challenge. This is because current
   digitization methods cannot take advantage of the key elements of the
   original digital model such as the wireframe topology and surface flows.
   This paper presents a new reverse engineering method that augments
   conventional digitization with the knowledge of the original digital
   model's curve topology to enhance iterative shape design activities. Our
   algorithm takes as input a curve network topology forming a subdivision
   control cage and a 3D scan of the physically modified prototype. To
   facilitate the digital capture of the physical modifications, our
   algorithm performs a series of registration, correspondence and
   deformation calculations to compute the new configuration of the initial
   control cage. The key advantage of the proposed technique is the
   preservation of the edge flows and initial topology while transferring
   surface modifications from prototypes. Our studies show that the
   proposed technique can be particularly useful for bridging the gap
   between physical and digital modeling in the early stages of product
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Complex systems are challenging for engineers to understand and design.
   This work demonstrates a synergistic cognitive and agent based
   methodology for developing and implementing rule-based strategies that
   improve human search performance in optimization design tasks. The
   domain of our study is the design of synthetic myosin-based systems, the
   biologically-based building block of muscle. We began with an initial
   cognitive study of users solving design tasks with three varied
   difficulties using a graphical user interface, and tracked how they
   manipulated design variables in their search process. User search
   behaviors resulting in the best and worst designs were then examined.
   Trends were identified that were used to formulate three strategies
   automated by computational agents solving the same tasks as the users.
   The most successful identified strategy implemented by the agents was a
   combination of univariate searches to learn parameter relationships and
   then applying that knowledge in greedy local searches. On one of the
   three tasks, an initial random search improved results. A subsequent
   cognitive study was conducted with users implementing the best
   agent-tested strategies. Users implementing the strategy performed
   significantly better than users performed in the first study with no
   provided strategy. These results show the power of synergistic human and
   agent-based approaches, in that cognitive-based findings can provide a
   starting place for computational search algorithms to begin testing
   strategies. Experimentation through agent-based methods via fast and
   extensive automated searches can then produce effective strategies that
   are given back to users. Our primary findings demonstrate that these
   agent-tested strategies significantly improve human search performance
   in designing these complex systems.}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant interest from consumers, sustainable products often
   struggle to find success in the marketplace. This failure is often
   attributed to the perception that consumers remain unwilling to
   sacrifice product attributes such as form, function, or price in order
   to adopt a product whose environmental impact is less than that of a
   competing product. This work aims to better understand how knowing a
   product's environmental impact affects preference for that product's
   disparate attributes. Three products of various complexities are
   explored through a conjoint analysis experiment that uncovers consumer
   preference for discrete form, function and price attributes. In this
   work, single use spoons, reusable water bottles, and home washing
   machines were used for analysis. These three products were decomposed
   into form, function, and price attributes that were varied at discrete
   levels. After a form only ratings-based conjoint analysis study was
   conducted to find high, medium, and low preference form designs for each
   participant, two separate form-function-price discrete choice studies
   were conducted for each of the three products. These two discrete choice
   trials were identical in all aspects except in the second trial
   participants were provided with calculated environmental impact values
   for all design configurations; the presented environmental impact
   information was a dependent variable based on a Life Cycle Analysis
   calculation using the current product configuration being shown to the
   participant. Results show that when participants are provided with this
   additional piece of information, their preference for form, function,
   and price attributes of a product is greatly impacted. In particular we
   find that the importance of functional attributes increases in the
   context of environmental impact metrics, while the importance of form
   decreases and the importance of price decreases modestly.}},

Abstract = {{Many design tasks are subject to changes in goals or constraints. For
   instance, a client might modify specifications after design has
   commenced, or a competitor may introduce a new technology or feature. A
   design team often cannot anticipate such changes, yet they pose a
   considerable challenge. This paper presents a study where engineering
   teams sought to solve a design task that was subject to two large,
   unexpected changes in problem formulation that occurred during problem
   solving. Continuous design data was collected to observe how the
   designers responded to the changes. We show that high- and
   low-performing teams demonstrated very different approaches to solving
   the problem and overcoming the changes. In particular, high-performing
   teams achieved simple designs and extensively explored small portions of
   the design space; low-performing teams explored complex designs with
   little exploration around a target area of the design space. These
   strategic differences are interpreted with respect to cognitive load
   theory and goal theory. The results raise questions as to the
   relationship between characteristics of design problems and solution
   strategies. In addition, an attempt at increasing the teams' resilience
   in the face of unexpected changes is introduced by encouraging early

   a separate batch of water for subsequent cycles, increasing the number

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{619-628}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Graphene has unique mechanical properties in that it is simultaneously
   very strong and stretchy, which severely hampers the prediction of its
   orientation-dependent fracture behavior based on conventional theories
   used for common brittle or ductile materials. For the first time, by
   exploring the entire range of available tensile orientations, this study
   reveals the unique anisotropic fracture response of graphene using
   molecular dynamics simulations. We found that, as the uniaxial tensile
   direction rotates from armchair (0 degrees) to zigzag orientation (30
   degrees), both the tensile strength and strain remain almost constant up
   to an orientation angle of similar to 12 degrees, then they rapidly
   increase (exponential growth), resulting in a remarkable degradation of
   the tensile strength compared to brittle fracture counterpart
   (inverse-sinusoidal growth). This typical fracture pattern holds for
   100-700 K. We propose a model that can explain its physical origin in
   good agreement with the simulation results. We also found that the
   elastic behavior of graphene is quasi-isotropic for all tensile
   orientations, in contrast to its anisotropic fracture behavior. Using
   indentation simulations of graphene, we showed that the
   anisotropic/isotropic features of fracture/elasticity are also
   well-preserved in the two-dimensional tensile systems but its fracture
   anisotropicity is greatly attenuated due to the inherent sixfold
   symmetry of graphene. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface subdivision gains popularity in surface design owing to its
   flexible applications for geometry with complicated topology and simple
   computational scheme, and the geometric partial differential equation
   (GPDE) method is an advanced technology for constructing high-quality
   smooth surfaces. In this paper, we composite these two ingredients to
   form a unified method for freeform surface design. We choose the mean
   curvature flow and Willmore flow as our driven GPDEs, and the finite
   element method coupled with a hybrid Loop and Catmull-Clark subdivision
   algorithm as the numerical simulation method. This research presents a
   novel technique to evaluate the finite element basis functions and the
   first attempt for constructing the GPDE subdivision surface with hybrid
   control meshes consisting of triangles and quadrilaterals. Numerical
   experiments show that the construction method is efficient and robust,
   yielding high-quality hybrid subdivision surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Streamline-like, free-form features that ``flow{''} on a base shape are
   often utilized in the design of products ranging from automobiles to
   everyday consumer products. Providing computational support for the
   design of such features is challenging, because of the open-endedness of
   the design explorations involved, and the necessity to rapidly and
   precisely capture the design intents expressed in very simple forms,
   such as free-form sketches. We present a novel approach for designing
   streamline-based, free-form surface features in the context of product
   design. Using our approach, the user first designs a network of
   streamlines on the base shape, by performing a stroke-constrained mesh
   parameterization. Then, the user utilizes these streamlines as a
   curvilinear scaffold for creating 3D free-form features that are bounded
   and parameterized by these streamlines. The user is able to apply
   fine-grained control of the outline, profile and extent of the resulting
   3D features by manipulating the streamlines. We demonstrate the
   capability of this approach on several product models. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Pages = {{19-34}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of an optimal sigmoidal rate-level
   function that is a component of many models of the peripheral auditory
   system. The optimization makes use of a set of criteria defined
   exclusively on the basis of physical attributes of the input sound that
   are inspired by physiological evidence. The criteria developed attempt
   to discriminate between a degraded speech signal and noise to preserve
   the maximum amount of information in the linear region of the sigmoidal
   curve, and to minimize the effects of distortion in the saturating
   regions. The performance of the proposed optimal sigmoidal function is
   validated by text-independent speaker-verification experiments with
   signals corrupted by additive noise at different SNRs. The experimental
   results suggest that the approach presented in combination with cepstral
   variance normalization can lead to relative reductions in equal error
   rate as great as 40\% when compared with the use of baseline MFCC
   coefficients for some SNRs. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solar energy is an attractive renewable energy source because the sun's
   energy is plentiful and carbon-free. However, solar energy is
   intermittent and not suitable for base load electricity generation
   without an energy backup system. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is
   unique among other renewable energy options because it can approach base
   load generation with molten salt thermal energy storage (TES). This
   paper describes the development of an engineering economic model that
   directly compares the performance, cost, and profit of a 110-MW
   parabolic trough CSP plant operating with a TES system, natural
   gas-fired backup system, and no backup system. Model results are
   presented for 0-12 h backup capacities with and without current U.S.
   subsidies. TES increased the annual capacity factor from around 30\%
   with no backup to up to 55\% with 12 h of storage when the solar field
   area was selected to provide the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
   Using TES instead of a natural gas-fired heat transfer fluid heater (NC)
   increased total plant capital costs but decreased annual operation and
   maintenance costs. These three effects led to an increase in the LCOE
   for PT plants with Us and NC backup compared with no backup. LCOE
   increased with increasing backup capacity for plants with TES and NC
   backup. For small backup capacities (1-4 h), plants with TES had
   slightly lower LCOE values than plants with NC backup. For larger backup
   capacities (5-12 h), plants with TES had slightly higher LCOE values
   than plants with NC backup. At these costs, current U.S. federal tax
   incentives were not sufficient to make PT profitable in a market with
   variable electricity pricing. Current U.S. incentives combined with a
   fixed electricity price of \$200/MWh made PT plants with larger backup
   capacities more profitable than PT plants with no backup or with smaller
   backup capacities. In the absence of incentives, a carbon price of
   \$100-\$160/tonne CO2eq would be required for these PT plants to compete
   with new coal-fired power plants in the U.S. If the long-term goal is to
   increase renewable base load electricity generation, additional
   incentives are needed to encourage new CSP plants to use thermal energy
   storage in the U.S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effects of gasification feedstock chemistries on the infiltration of
   slag into the porous high chromia refractory and their reaction products}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{248-263}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic slags with compositions representative of carbonaceous
   feedstock derived from coal and petroleum coke were infiltrated into
   90\% Cr2O3-10\% Al2O3 refractory material with a temperature gradient
   induced along the penetration direction of the slag. Experiments were
   conducted with a hot-face temperature of 1723 K (1450 degrees C) in a
   CO/CO2 gas mixture with a ratio of 1.8, which corresponded to an
   approximate oxygen partial pressure of 10 (8) atm. Interactions between
   the slags and the refractory produced solid-solution spinel layers on
   the top interfaces of the refractory samples, whose chemistries
   reflected the compositions of major constituents of the starting slags.
   FeCr2O4 formed when samples were infiltrated with slag composition rich
   in FeO, which was typical for coals derived from eastern USA. (Mg,
   Fe)Cr2O4 formed when samples were infiltrated with slags, containing
   considerable concentrations of both MgO and FeO that were common in
   western US coals. In slags resulted from substituting 50\% (by weight)
   of the coal feedstock by petcoke, similar solid solution phases formed
   as the pure coal counterparts, but with addition of V2O3, which
   originated from the petcoke feedstock. The chromium spinel layers, to a
   reasonable extent, limited infiltration by hindering the slag from
   flowing into the porous microstructure of the refractory and the
   formation mechanisms of the product layers were discussed. The
   Fe(Cr,V)(2)O-4 layer that formed in the presence of petcoke ash
   exhibited an uneven morphology. As compared to the FeO rich slags, MgO
   rich slags penetrated further beyond the protective layers and into the
   refractory. Both of these phenomena could lead to increased refractory
   spallation rates in actual gasification conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chiral inorganic materials predated life on Earth, and their
   enantiospecific surface chemistry may have played a role in the origins
   of biomolecular homochirality. However, enantiospecific differences in
   the interaction energies of chiral molecules with chiral surfaces are
   small and typically lead to modest enantioselectivities in adsorption,
   catalysis, and chemistry on chiral surfaces. To yield high
   enantioselectivities, small energy differences must be amplified by
   reaction mechanisms such as autocatalytic surface explosions which have
   nonlinear kinetics. Herein, we report the first observations of
   superenantiospecificity resulting from an autocatalytic surface
   explosion reaction of a chiral molecule on a naturally chiral surface.
   R,R- and S,S-tartaric acid decompose via a vacancy-mediated surface
   explosion mechanism on Cu single crystal surfaces. When coupled with
   surface chirality, this leads to decomposition rates that exhibit
   extraordinarily high enantiospecificity. On the enantiomorphs of
   naturally chiral Cu(643)(R\&S), Cu(17,5,1)(R\&S), Cu(531)(R\&S) and
   Cu(651)(R\&S) single crystal surfaces, R,R- and S,S-tartaric acid
   exhibit enantiospecific decomposition rates that differ by as much as 2
   orders of magnitude, despite the fact that the effective rates constants
   for decomposition differ by less than a factor of 2.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear planning and scheduling models for crude-oil atmospheric and
   vacuum distillation units are essential to manage increased complexities
   and narrow margins present in the petroleum industry. Traditionally,
   conventional swing-cut modeling is based on fixed yields with fixed
   properties for the hypothetical cuts that swing between adjacent light
   and heavy distillates, which can subsequently lead to inaccuracies in
   the predictions of both its quantity and quality. A new extension is
   proposed to better predict quantities and qualities for the distilled
   products by taking into consideration that we require corresponding
   light and heavy swing-cuts with appropriately varying qualities. By
   computing interpolated qualities relative to its light and heavy
   swing-cut quantities, we can show an improvement in the accuracy of the
   blended or pooled quality predictions. Additional nonlinear variables
   and constraints are necessary in the model, but it is shown that these
   are relatively easy to deal with in the nonlinear optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable electronics represents an attractive and emerging paradigm
   in medical devices by harnessing simultaneous advantages afforded by
   electronically active systems and obviating issues with chronic
   implants. Integrating practical energy sources that are compatible with
   the envisioned operation of transient devices is an unmet challenge for
   biodegradable electronics. Although high-performance energy storage
   systems offer a feasible solution, toxic materials and electrolytes
   present regulatory hurdles for use in temporary medical devices. Aqueous
   sodium-ion charge storage devices combined with biocompatible electrodes
   are ideal components to power next-generation biodegradable electronics.
   Here, we report the use of biologically derived organic electrodes
   composed of melanin pigments for use in energy storage devices. Melanins
   of natural (derived from Sepia officinalis) and synthetic origin are
   evaluated as anode materials in aqueous sodium-ion storage devices.
   Na+-loaded melanin anodes exhibit specific capacities of 30.4 +/- 1.6
   mAhg(-1). Full cells composed of natural melanin anodes and lambda-MnO2
   cathodes exhibit an initial potential of 1.03 +/- 0.06 V with a maximum
   specific capacity of 16.1 +/- 0.8 mAhg(-1). Natural melanin anodes
   exhibit higher specific capacities compared with synthetic melanins due
   to a combination of beneficial chemical, electrical, and physical
   properties exhibited by the former. Taken together, these results
   suggest that melanin pigments may serve as a naturally occurring
   biologically derived charge storage material to power certain types of
   medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Photonic structures can exhibit significant absorption enhancement when
   an object's length scale is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength
   of light. This property has enabled photonic structures to be an
   integral component in many applications such as solar cells, light
   emitting diodes, and photothermal therapy. To characterize this
   enhancement at the single particulate level, conventional methods have
   consisted of indirect or qualitative approaches which are often limited
   to certain sample types. To overcome these limitations, we used a
   bilayer cantilever to directly and quantitatively measure the spectral
   absorption efficiency of a single silicon microwire in the visible
   wavelength range. We demonstrate an absorption enhancement on a per unit
   volume basis compared to a thin film, which shows good agreement with
   Mie theory calculations. This approach offers a quantitative approach
   for broadband absorption measurements on a wide range of photonic
   structures of different geometric and material compositions. (C) 2013

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{High throughput and high content screening involve determination of the
   effect of many compounds on a given target. As currently practiced,
   screening for each new target typically makes little use of information
   from screens of prior targets. Further, choices of compounds to advance
   to drug development are made without significant screening against
   off-target effects. The overall drug development process could be made
   more effective, as well as less expensive and time consuming, if
   potential effects of all compounds on all possible targets could be
   considered, yet the cost of such full experimentation would be
   prohibitive. In this paper, we describe a potential solution:
   probabilistic models that can be used to predict results for unmeasured
   combinations, and active learning algorithms for efficiently selecting
   which experiments to perform in order to build those models and
   determining when to stop. Using simulated and experimental data, we show
   that our approaches can produce powerful predictive models without
   exhaustive experimentation and can learn them much faster than by
   selecting experiments at random.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic liquids are widely used as solvents and reaction media due to low
   volatility, stability up to high temperature, and large dipole moment.
   Emergent applications also aim at the anisotropic growth of metal
   nanostructures in ionic liquids through facet-selective interactions
   although the governing mechanisms remain poorly understood. We employed
   a combination of quantum mechanical and classical simulations to analyze
   the structure and energetics of the self-assembly of ionic liquids on
   metal surfaces from single ion pairs to multilayers, using the example
   of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ({[}EMIM]{[}ES]) on the
   crystallographic \{111\}, \{100\}, and \{110\} facets of gold.
   Adsorption is controlled by the interplay of soft epitaxy, ionic
   interactions, induced charges, and steric effects related to the
   geometry of the cation and anion. These factors lead to characteristic
   molecular patterns on individual surfaces. Binding energies are similar
   irrespective of surface coverage and only slightly increase from \{111\}
   to \{100\} and \{110\} surfaces due to stronger surface corrugation and
   higher induced charge. The results explain specific experimental
   observations and aid in understanding particle growth in ionic liquid
   media. A mechanistic hypothesis for the formation of anisotropic gold
   nanorods in the presence of silver ions is made, in which silver retards
   the growth along \{100\} and \{110\} facets through underpotential
   deposition.}},

Abstract = {{When subjected to controlled cyclic deformation, the response of
   austenitic stainless steel typically involves primary hardening followed
   by softening, and eventually cyclic stabilization with or without
   secondary hardening. If a continuously drifting mean strain is
   superposed to an alternating strain path (i.e. strain controlled
   ratcheting), the response in terms of mean stress and strain amplitude
   is significantly different. A series of low cycle fatigue and ratcheting
   experiments are performed at room temperature on round specimens
   extracted from a batch of AISI 316L hot rolled plate. The experiments
   are interrupted at cycle numbers selected to correspond with the
   different strain controlled cycle response stages. The as-received
   material and the fatigued specimens are analyzed by means of
   transmission electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure and
   its evolution with cyclic loading. The low cycle fatigue experiments,
   performed to establish a reference point for the zero mean strain
   loading condition, are in line with observations reported for AISI 316L
   stainless steel by other authors. The continuously increasing mean
   strain is found to induce higher dislocation densities in the channels
   of the evolving microstructure, being responsible for the
   macroscopically observed additional hardening. The observed polarized
   dislocation walls at least partially accommodate the continuously
   drifting mean strain and play a role in the non-zero mean stress
   response. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials are highly dynamic in biological and environmental media.
   A critical need for advancing environmental health and safety research
   for nanomaterials is to identify physical and chemical transformations
   that affect the nanomaterial properties and their toxicity. Silver
   nanoparticles, one of the most toxic and well-studied nanomaterials,
   readily react with sulfide to form Ag(0)/Ag2S core-shell particles.
   Here, we show that sulfidation decreased silver nanoparticle toxicity to
   four diverse types of aquatic and terrestrial eukaryotic organisms
   (Danio rerio (zebrafish), Fundulus heteroclitus (killifish),
   Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm), and the aquatic plant Lemna
   minuta (least duckweed)). Toxicity reduction, which was dramatic in
   killifish and duckweed even for low extents of sulfidation (about 2 mol
   \% S), is primarily associated with a decrease in Ag+ concentration
   after sulfidation due to the lower solubility of Ag2S relative to
   elemental Ag (Ag-0). These results suggest that even partial sulfidation
   of AgNP will decrease the toxicity of AgNPs relative to their pristine
   counterparts. We also show that, for a given organism, the presence of
   chloride in the exposure media strongly affects the toxicity results by
   affecting Ag speciation. These results highlight the need to consider
   environmental transformations of NPs in assessing their toxicity to
   accurately portray their potential environmental risks.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic glasses (MGs) exhibit greater elastic limit and stronger
   resistance to plastic deformation than their crystalline metal
   counterparts. Their capacity to withstand plastic straining is further
   enhanced at submicrometer length scales. For a range of
   micro-electromechanical applications, the resistance of MGs to damage
   and cracking from thermal and mechanical stress or strain cycling under
   partial or complete constraint is of considerable scientific and
   technological interest. However, to our knowledge, no real-time,
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations are
   available of crystallization, damage, and failure from the controlled
   imposition of cyclic strains or displacements in any metallic glass.
   Here we present the results of a unique in situ study, inside a
   high-resolution transmission electron microscope, of glass-to-crystal
   formation and fatigue of an Al-based MG. We demonstrate that cyclic
   straining progressively leads to nanoscale surface roughening in the
   highly deformed region of the starter notch, causing crack nucleation
   and formation of nanocrystals. The growth of these nanograins during
   cyclic straining impedes subsequent crack growth by bridging the crack.
   In distinct contrast to this fatigue behavior, only distributed
   nucleation of smaller nanocrystals is observed with no surface
   roughening under monotonic deformation. We further show through
   molecular dynamics simulation that these findings can be rationalized by
   the accumulation of strain-induced nonaffine atomic rearrangements that
   effectively enhances diffusion through random walk during repeated
   strain cycling. The present results thus provide unique insights into
   fundamental mechanisms of fatigue of MGs that would help shape
   strategies for material design and engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{The grain-by-grain orientation relationships between an Fe2O3 film,
   grown using pulsed laser deposition, and a polycrystalline SrTiO3
   substrate were determined using electron backscatter diffraction. This
   high-throughput investigation, we call combinatorial substrate epitaxy,
   enables the characterization of film growth on all grain orientations in
   a single experiment, allowing the determination of the preferred
   epitaxial orientation (PEO) of this non-isostructural film/substrate
   pair. Heavily-twinned rhombohedral alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite) grew
   epitaxially over the entire orientation space of the cubic perovskite
   substrate. Over 500 local orientation relationships (ORs) were
   investigated and more than 90\% of these ORs, regardless of the
   interface plane normal, could be described using a single epitaxial OR:
   (0001) {[}10 (1) over bar0](Fe2O3)vertical bar vertical bar (111) {[}1
   (1) over bar0](SrTiO3) . This OR aligns the eutactic (nearly
   close-packed) planes and directions between these dissimilar crystal
   structures. Importantly, the growth of Fe2O3 on a single crystalline
   (100)-SrTiO3 results in several different orientation relationships.
   These results suggest that growth on high Miller-index (low-symmetry)
   surfaces provides more general information about the PEO than growth on
   low Miller-index (high-symmetry) surfaces. The epitaxial film growth on
   high Miller-index surfaces and the overwhelming observation of the
   eutaxial OR support the hypothesis that a very small number of simple
   crystallographic descriptors guide epitaxial film growth over all of
   orientation space, even for non-isostructural film/substrate pairs. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction: Expeditionary spaceflight is fraught with significant
   risks to human health, including trauma and other emergency medical
   events. To address several of the basic challenges of surgical care in
   reduced gravity, we are developing the Aqueous Immersion Surgical System
   (AISS), an optically clear enclosure pressurized by a fluid medium. The
   AISS is designed to prevent contamination of the spacecraft with blood
   and tissue debris, reduce intraoperative blood loss, and maintain
   visualization of the operative field. Methods: An early prototype of the
   AISS was tested in reduced gravity during parabolic flight. A clear,
   aqueous field was created in a watertight chamber containing a mock
   vascular network. Hemorrhage was simulated by severing several of the
   analogue vessels. Experiments were performed to evaluate the benefits of
   surrounding a surgical cavity with fluid medium, as compared to an air
   environment, with respect to maintaining a clear view and achieving
   hemostasis. Results: Qualitative evaluation of audio and video recorded
   during parabolic flight confirm AISS capacity to maintain visualization
   of the surgical field during a hemorrhage situation and staunch bleeding
   by raising interchamber pressure. Discussion: Evaluation of the AISS in
   reduced gravity corroborates observations in the literature regarding
   the difficulty in maintaining visualization of the surgical field when
   performing procedures in an air environment. By immersing the surgical
   field in fluid we were able to apply suction directly to the hemorrhage
   and also achieve hemostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation propagation, similar to tracking, is the problem of
   transferring a segmentation of an image to a neighboring image in a
   sequence. This problem is of particular importance to materials science,
   where the accurate segmentation of a series of 2D serial-sectioned
   images of multiple, contiguous 3D structures has important applications.
   Such structures may have distinct shape, appearance, and topology, which
   can be considered to improve segmentation accuracy. For example, some
   materials images may have structures with a specific shape or appearance
   in each serial section slice, which only changes minimally from slice to
   slice, and some materials may exhibit specific inter-structure topology
   that constrains their neighboring relations. Some of these properties
   have been individually incorporated to segment specific materials images
   in prior work. In this paper, we develop a propagation framework for
   materials image segmentation where each propagation is formulated as an
   optimal labeling problem that can be efficiently solved using the
   graph-cut algorithm. Our framework makes three key contributions: 1) a
   homomorphic propagation approach, which considers the consistency of
   region adjacency in the propagation; 2) incorporation of shape and
   appearance consistency in the propagation; and 3) a local
   non-homomorphism strategy to handle newly appearing and disappearing
   substructures during this propagation. To show the effectiveness of our
   framework, we conduct experiments on various 3D materials images, and
   compare the performance against several existing image segmentation
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrated solar power (CSP) is unique among intermittent renewable
   energy options because for the past four years, utility-scale plants
   have been using an energy storage technology that could allow a CSP
   plant to operate as a baseload renewable energy generator in the future.
   No study to-date has directly compared the environmental implications of
   this technology with more conventional CSP backup energy options. This
   study compares the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water
   consumption, and direct, onsite land use associated with one MW h of
   electricity production from CSP plants with wet and dry cooling and with
   three energy backup systems: (1) minimal backup (MB), (2) molten salt
   thermal energy storage (TES), and (3) a natural gas-fired heat transfer
   fluid heater (NG). Plants with NG had 4-9 times more life cycle GHG
   emissions than plants with TES. Plants with TES generally had twice as
   many life cycle GHG emissions as the MB plants. Dry cooling reduced life
   cycle water consumption by 71-78\% compared to wet cooling. Plahts with
   larger backup capacities had greater life cycle water consumption than
   plants with smaller backup capacities, and plants with NG had lower
   direct, onsite life cycle land use than plants with MB or TES. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The design and planning of an integrated ethanol and gasoline supply
   chain is addressed, and is composed of harvesting and production sites
   for ethanol, petroleum refineries, distribution centers where blending
   takes place, and the retail gas stations where blends of gasoline and
   ethanol are sold. We postulate a superstructure that combines all the
   components of the supply chain and different means of transportation,
   and model this multiscale design problem as a multiperiod MILP model. In
   order to identify regions where investments are needed and the optimal
   configuration of the network, a strategic planning model is considered
   in which gasoline stations are aggregated in different regions. A
   detailed formulation is considered where regions are disaggregated into
   gas stations to determine the retrofit projects for the selection of
   blending pumps over their expected life. Also, the application of these
   MILP models with two large-scale problems are illustrated. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Bacteria-based networks are formed using native or engineered bacteria
   that communicate at nano-scale. This definition includes the micro-scale
   molecular transportation system which uses chemotactic bacteria for
   targeted cargo delivery, as well as genetic circuits for intercellular
   interactions like quorum sensing or light communication. To characterize
   the dynamics of bacterial networks accurately, we introduce BNSim, an
   open-source, parallel, stochastic, and multiscale modeling platform
   which integrates various simulation algorithms, together with genetic
   circuits and chemotactic pathway models in a complex 3D environment.
   Moreover, we show how this platform can be used to model synthetic
   bacterial consortia which implement a XOR function and aggregate nearby
   bacteria using light communication. Consequently, the results
   demonstrate how BNSim can predict various properties of realistic
   bacterial networks and provide guidance for their actual wet-lab
   implementations .}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a modification is proposed to the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) to enable identification of areas where the
   implementation of best management practices would likely result in the
   most significant improvement in downstream water quality. To
   geospatially link potential locations to individual land owners, a
   land-use layer that incorporated specific crops and crop rotations
   needed to be developed. Model results obtained using the new land-use
   layer are compared to those obtained using a more conventional land-use
   layer. Results indicate that water flow and nutrient loadings are
   similar at the basin outlet, confirming the overall consistency of the
   approach. Water flow results at upland subbasin outlets appear similar;
   however, nutrient loadings are different since the crop distributions in
   the alternative approach are more representative of actual practice in
   the basin. These results suggest that the alternative,
   crop-rotation-specific method can be used to provide additional
   information for spatially resolved decision making regarding nutrient
   loading and downstream nutrient concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a reproducing kernel triangular B-spline-based finite element
   method (FEM) as an improvement to the conventional triangular B-spline
   element for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In the
   latter, unexpected errors can occur throughout the analysis domain
   mainly due to the excessive flexibilities in defining the B-spline. The
   performance therefore becomes unstable and cannot be controlled in a
   desirable way. To address this issue, the proposed improvement adopts
   the reproducing kernel approximation in the calculation of B-spline
   kernel function. Three types of PDE problems are tested to validate the
   present element and compare against the conventional triangular
   B-spline. It has been shown that the improved triangular B-spline
   satisfies the partition of unity condition even for extreme conditions
   including corners and holes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate tunable electrical and thermal conductivities through
   freezing rate control in solution-based nanocomposites. For a
   prototypical suspension of 1 vol \% multilayer graphene suspended in
   hexadecane, the solid liquid electrical conductivity contrast ratio can
   be tuned from 1 to 4.5 orders of magnitude for freezing rates between
   10(-2) and 10(-3) degrees C/min. We hypothesize that this dramatic
   variation stems from ice-templating, whereby crystal growth drives
   nanoparticles into concentrated intercrystal regions, increasing the
   percolation pathways and reducing the internanoparticle electrical
   resistance. Optical microscopy supports the ice-templating hypothesis,
   as these dramatic property changes coincide with changing crystal size.
   Under the same range of freezing rates, the nanocomposite solid-liquid
   thermal conductivity contrast ratio varies between 23 and 3.0, while
   pure hexadecane's varies between 2.1 and 2.6. The nanocomposite's
   thermal conductivity contrast ratios and solid phase enhancements are
   greater than effective medium theory predictions. We suggest this is due
   to ice-templating, consistent with our electrical measurements, as well
   as nanoparticle-induced molecular alignment of alkanes.}},

Abstract = {{Deploying roadside units, RSUs, for increasing the connectivity of
   vehicular ad hoc networks is deemed necessary for coping with the
   partial penetration of DSRC radios into the market in the initial stages
   of DSRC deployment. Several factors, including cost, complexity,
   existing systems, and lack of cooperation between government and private
   sectors, have impeded the deployment of RSUs. In this article, we
   propose to solve this formidable problem by using a biologically
   inspired self-organizing network approach whereby certain vehicles serve
   as RSUs. The proposed solution is based on designing local rules and the
   corresponding algorithms that implement them. Results show that the
   proposed approach can increase the message reachability and connectivity
   substantially.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present the optimization of the production methanol
   from glycerol and its integration in the production of biodiesel from
   algae. We propose a limited superstructure where the glycerol from
   biodiesel is first reformed for which steam reforming and autoreforming
   are evaluated. The gas obtained is cleaned up and its composition is
   adjusted in terms of the ratio CO/H-2 using three possible alternatives
   (bypass, PSA and water gas shift). Next, the removal of CO2 is performed
   by means of PSA and the syngas is fed to the methanol synthesis reactor
   and the products obtained are separated. This synthesis is coupled with
   the production of biodiesel from algae using heterogeneous catalyzed
   reaction based on previous results. The optimization of the system is
   formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) that is
   solved for the simultaneous optimization and heat integration of the
   production of biodiesel with recycle of methanol followed by water
   integration. The best process involves the use of autoreforming for a
   production cost of \$0.66 gal(-1), 3.65 MJ/gal of energy consumption and
   water consumption of 0.79 gal/gal. The integrated process is \$0.2
   gal(-1) more expensive than the one that directly uses methanol but
   reduces in more than half the dependency of the process on fossil fuels.

Title = {{New Distraction Osteogenesis Device With Only Two Patient-Controlled
   Joints by Applying the Axis-Angle Representation on Three-Dimensional
   Bone Deformation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Distraction osteogenesis is a procedure to correct bone deformity by
   breaking the bone and slowly pulling the fragments apart to stimulate
   bone growth. General bone deformities are three-dimensional in nature,
   requiring correcting of bone angles in 3D space and also bone length.
   However, commercially available external fixators are either unable to
   simultaneously correct for both angular and length deformity or are
   bulky and require as many as six joints that are adjusted by patients.
   In this paper, we propose a novel concept of correcting a 3D bone
   deformity using only two active degrees of freedom (2DOF), or two
   patient controlled joints, by expressing the orientation deformity of
   the bone using the axis-angle representation and the length discrepancy
   as a translation in 3D space. This requires a new device design with two
   patient-controlled joints, a revolute joint and a prismatic joint, that
   can be placed in any orientation and position to allow multiple
   configurations of the device. This in turn allows it to correct for all
   typical 3D deformities. The aim of our project is to develop the 2DOF
   axial external fixator and an algorithm for a planner to find the
   optimal fixator configuration and the correction schedule for a given
   deformity. An algorithm for the placement of the two patient-controlled
   joints relative to the osteotomy site was developed. A set of test data
   extracted from a deformed sawbone was used to check the performance of
   the proposed computational method. The desired bone trajectory was
   defined as a straight line from initial to target position, and the
   optimal position of the revolute joint gives an error of only 0.8 mm. We
   conclude that the proposed 2DOF device and the computational planner can
   correct typical bone deformity and works well for the test case in
   simulation.}},

   device with all ohmic contacts, which is composed of
   glass/ITO/MoOx/4,4,4-tris{[}2-naphthyl-phenyl-amino]triphenylamine
   (2-TNATA)/MoOx/Al, the elements of the electronic structures of
   MoOx-on-2-TNATA interface and 2-TNATA-on-MoOx interface were
   investigated by photoemission spectroscopy, with regards to interface
   energetics, formative mechanism, and a potential charge carrier
   injection. The electronic structures revealed that the behavior of the
   interface between MoOx and 2-TNATA was different whether MoOx was
   deposited on (2-TNATA) or vice versa. The bottom interfaces of
   2-TNATA-on-MoOx in this hole-only devices showed no hole-injecting
   barrier height (Phi(h)(B)) when the thickness of 2-TNATA was deposited
   in the range of 0.1 to 5.0 nm on the 10.0 nm-thick MoOx thin films. This
   has been explained to be attributed to both metal-induced gap states and
   a chemical reaction at the interfaces. The top interfaces of
   MoOx-on-2-TNATA in this hole-only device structure also showed no
   Phi(h)(B) when a hole was injected from the MoOx-on-2-TNATA interfaces
   to cathode. The hole-ohmic property in the top interfaces depends on
   interface dipole by the formation of charge transfer complexes as well
   as interdiffusion of MoOx into the 2-TNATA film in these interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns mathematical conditions under which a system-level
   optimization of supply and demand scheduling can be implemented as a
   distributed optimization in which users and suppliers, as well as the
   load serving entities, are decision makers with well-defined
   sub-objectives. We start by defining the optimization problem of the
   system that includes the sub-objectives of many different players, both
   supply and demand entities in the system, and decompose the problem into
   each player's optimization problem, using Lagrange dual decomposition. A
   demand entity or a load serving entity's problem is further decomposed
   into problems of the many different end-users that the load serving
   entity serves. By examining the relationships between the global
   objectives and the local/individual objectives in these multiple layers
   and the optimality conditions of these decomposable problems, we define
   the requirements of these different objectives to converge. We propose a
   novel set of methods for coordinating supply and demand over different
   time horizons, namely day-ahead scheduling and real-time adjustment. We
   illustrate the ideas by simulating simple examples with different
   conditions and objectives of each entity in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-and nano-mechanical switches are being considered as complements
   to solid state transistors. While several different device designs may
   satisfy performance requirements, contact reliability due to hydrocarbon
   contamination remains a critical concern in each. This issue can be
   addressed by identifying contact materials and environments that
   optimize immunity to contaminants. Here we demonstrate that RuO2, a
   conducting oxide, does not exhibit contaminant-induced degradation at up
   to 130 parts per million (PPM) benzene in a nitrogen/oxygen background,
   and experiences minimal electrical resistance rise at 1,300 PPM. In
   comparison, Pt-coated switches degrade significantly at only 0.02 PPM
   benzene contaminant level in nitrogen background. This paper establishes
   that a proper selection of materials and environment is a promising path
   toward achieving reliable micro- and nanoswitches.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Analyzing and interpreting the activity of a heterogeneous
   population of neurons can be challenging, especially as the number of
   neurons, experimental trials, and experimental conditions increases. One
   approach is to extract a set of latent variables that succinctly
   captures the prominent co-fluctuation patterns across the neural
   population. A key problem is that the number of latent variables needed
   to adequately describe the population activity is often greater than 3,
   thereby preventing direct visualization of the latent space. By
   visualizing a small number of 2-d projections of the latent space or
   each latent variable individually, it is easy to miss salient features
   of the population activity. Approach. To address this limitation, we
   developed a Matlab graphical user interface (called DataHigh) that
   allows the user to quickly and smoothly navigate through a continuum of
   different 2-d projections of the latent space. We also implemented a
   suite of additional visualization tools (including playing out
   population activity timecourses as a movie and displaying summary
   statistics, such as covariance ellipses and average timecourses) and an
   optional tool for performing dimensionality reduction. Main results. To
   demonstrate the utility and versatility of DataHigh, we used it to
   analyze single-trial spike count and single-trial timecourse population
   activity recorded using a multi-electrode array, as well as
   trial-averaged population activity recorded using single electrodes.
   Significance. DataHigh was developed to fulfil a need for visualization
   in exploratory neural data analysis, which can provide intuition that is
   critical for building scientific hypotheses and models of population
   activity.}},

   inductor in a resonator, two LC voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs)
   based on: 1) a SC and 2) a coupling-controlled (CC) resonator are
   developed. Designed and fabricated in 0.13-mu m CMOS in conjunction with
   an in-house GeTe process, the VCOs can switch their operating frequency
   over widely separated bands. Wide tuning ranges of 2.89-4.23/(4.93-7.79)
   and 4.80-8.53/(5.28-10.20) GHz were achieved in the off/on state for the

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that over 50 GW of offshore
   wind power will be required for the United States to generate 20\% of
   its electricity from wind. Developers are actively planning offshore
   wind farms along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts and several leases
   have been signed for offshore sites. These planned projects are in areas
   that are sometimes struck by hurricanes. We present a method to estimate
   the catastrophe risk to offshore wind power using simulated hurricanes.
   Using this method, we estimate the fraction of offshore wind power
   simultaneously offline and the cumulative damage in a region. In Texas,
   the most vulnerable region we studied, 10\% of offshore wind power could
   be offline simultaneously because of hurricane damage with a 100-year
   return period and 6\% could be destroyed in any 10-year period. We also
   estimate the risks to single wind farms in four representative
   locations; we find the risks are significant but lower than those
   estimated in previously published results. Much of the hurricane risk to
   offshore wind turbines can be mitigated by designing turbines for higher
   maximum wind speeds, ensuring that turbine nacelles can turn quickly to
   track the wind direction even when grid power is lost, and building in
   areas with lower risk.}},

Title = {{Aortic Outflow Cannula Tip Design and Orientation Impacts Cerebral
   Perfusion During Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Bypass Procedures}},

Abstract = {{Poor perfusion of the aortic arch is a suspected cause for peri- and
   post-operative neurological complications associated with
   cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). High-speed jets from 8 to 10FR
   pediatric/neonatal cannulae delivering similar to 1 L/min of blood can
   accrue sub-lethal hemolytic damage while also subjecting the aorta to
   non-physiologic flow conditions that compromise cerebral perfusion.
   Therefore, we emphasize the importance of cannulation strategy and
   hypothesize engineering better CPB perfusion through a redesigned aortic
   cannula tip. This study employs computational fluid dynamics to
   investigate novel diffuser-tipped aortic cannulae for shape sensitivity
   to cerebral perfusion, in an in silico cross-clamped aortic arch model
   modeled with fixed outflow resistances. 17 parametrically altered
   configurations of an 8FR end-hole and several diffuser cone angled tips
   in combination with jet incidence angles toward or away from the
   head-neck vessels were studied. Experimental pressure-flow
   characterizations were also conducted on these cannula tip designs. An
   8FR end-hole aortic cannula delivering 1 L/min along the transverse
   aortic arch was found to give rise to backflow from the brachicephalic
   artery (BCA), irrespective of angular orientation, for the chosen
   ascending aortic insertion location. Parametric alteration of the
   cannula tip to include a diffuser cone angle (tested up to 7A degrees)
   eliminated BCA backflow for any tested angle of jet incidence.
   Experiments revealed that a 1 cm long 10A degrees diffuser cone tip
   demonstrated the best pressure-flow performance improvement in contrast
   with either an end-hole tip or diffuser cone angles greater than 10A
   degrees. Performance further improved when the diffuser was preceded by
   an expanded four-lobe swirl inducer attachment-a novel component. In
   conclusion, aortic cannula orientation is crucial in determining net
   head-neck perfusion but precise angulations and insertion-depths are
   difficult to achieve practically. Altering the cannula tip to include a
   diffuser cone angle has been shown for the first time to have potential
   in ensuring a net positive outflow at the BCA. Cannula insertion
   distanced from the BCA inlet may also avoid backflow owing to the
   Venturi effect, but the diffuser tipped cannula design presents a
   promising solution to mitigate this issue irrespective of in vivo
   cannula tip orientation.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction from shale produces
   waste brine known as flowback that is impounded at the surface prior to
   reuse and/or disposal. During impoundment, microbial activity can alter
   the fate of metals including radionuclides, give rise to odorous
   compounds, and result in biocorrosion that complicates water and waste
   management and increases production costs. Here, we describe the
   microbial ecology at multiple depths of three flowback impoundments from
   the Marcellus shale that were managed differently. 16S rRNA gene clone
   libraries revealed that bacterial communities in the untreated and
   biocide-amended impoundments were depth dependent, diverse, and most
   similar to species within the taxa -proteobacteria, -proteobacteria,
   -proteobacteria, Clostridia, Synergistetes, Thermotogae, Spirochetes,
   and Bacteroidetes. The bacterial community in the pretreated and aerated
   impoundment was uniform with depth, less diverse, and most similar to
   known iodide-oxidizing bacteria in the -proteobacteria. Archaea were
   identified only in the untreated and biocide-amended impoundments and
   were affiliated to the Methanomicrobia class. This is the first study of
   microbial communities in flowback water impoundments from hydraulic
   fracturing. The findings expand our knowledge of microbial diversity of
   an emergent and unexplored environment and may guide the management of
   flowback impoundments.}},

Abstract = {{Even though it might be beneficial to have continuous baseline data
   upfront, today's hospitalized patients are put on a vital signs monitor
   not earlier than they become bed-ridden. The aim of this study is to
   show the feasibility of a broader monitoring concept, embracing many
   more subjects, by monitoring contactless vital signs with sensors
   embedded in non-ICU settings. In order to conduct the experiments, a
   system was designed to measure electrocardiograms (ECG) unobtrusively by
   capacitive sensors in various patient fitments e.g., stretchers,
   hospital-beds and wheelchairs. Contact ECG and contactless ECG
   measurements by shielded textile electrodes are contrasted to each other
   to display the potential of contactless monitoring. Our experiments
   demonstrate that the contactless ECG recordings are of sufficient
   quality and later used for further standard ECG analysis like
   QRS-complex detection. We believe that our results are motivating for
   the potential future care facility featuring a personal, non-obtrusive

   approach for analyzing the system performance that considers
   compressible flow and heat transfer with a large deformable mesh. The
   regenerator pressure drop and effectiveness are first explored to
   determine the optimal porosity. A value near 0.9 is found to maximize
   the coefficient of performance. To overcome the computational complexity
   brought about by the fine pillar structure in the regenerator, a porous
   medium model is used to allow for modeling of a full element. Parametric
   studies demonstrate the effect of the operating frequency on the cooling
   capacity and the coefficient of performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) in the presence of
   Cu-0 is a versatile technique that can be used to create well-controlled
   polymers with complex architectures. Despite the facile nature of the
   technique, there has been a vigorous debate in the literature as to the
   mechanism of the reaction. One proposed mechanism, named supplemental
   activator and reducing agent atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA
   ATRP), has Cu-I as the major activator of alkyl halides, Cu-0 acting as
   a supplemental activator, an inner-sphere electron transfer occurring
   during the activation step, and relatively slow comproportionation and
   disproportionation. In SARA ATRP slow activation of alkyl halides by
   Cu-0 and comproportionation of Cu-II with Cu-0 compensates for the small
   number of radicals lost to termination reactions. Alternatively, a
   mechanism named single electron transfer living radical polymerization
   (SET-LRP) assumes that the Cu-I species do not activate alkyl halides,
   but undergo instantaneous disproportionation, and that the relatively
   rapid polymerization is due to a fast reaction between alkyl halides and
   ``nascent{''} Cu-0 through an outer-sphere electron transfer. In this
   article a critical assessment of the experimental data are presented on
   the polymerization of methyl acrylate in DMSO with Me6TREN as the ligand
   in the presence of Cu-0, in order to discriminate between these two
   mechanisms. The experimental data agree with the SARA ATRP mechanism,
   since the activation of alkyl halides by Cu-I species is significantly
   faster than Cu-0, the activation step involves inner-sphere electron
   transfer rather than an outer-sphere electron transfer, and in DMSO
   comproportionation is slow but occurs faster than disproportionation,
   and activation by Cu-I species is much faster than disproportionation.
   The rate of deactivation by Cu-II is essentially the same as the rate of
   activation by Cu-I, and the system is under ATRP equilibrium. The role
   of Cu-0 in this system is to slowly and continuously supply Cu-I
   activating species and radicals, by supplemental activation and
   comproportionation, to compensate for Cu-I lost due to the unavoidable
   radical termination reactions. With the mechanistic understanding gained
   by analyzing the experimental data in the literature, the reaction
   conditions in SARA ATRP can be tailored toward efficient synthesis of a
   new generation of complex architectures and functional materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a damage diagnosis algorithm for civil structures
   that uses a sequential change point detection method. The general change
   point detection method uses the known pre- and post-damage feature
   distributions to perform a sequential hypothesis test. In practice,
   however, the post-damage distribution is unlikely to be known a priori,
   unless we are looking for a known specific type of damage. Therefore, we
   introduce an additional algorithm that estimates and updates this
   distribution as data are collected using the maximum likelihood and the
   Bayesian methods. We also applied an approximate method to reduce the
   computation load and memory requirement associated with the estimation.
   The algorithm is validated using a set of experimental data collected
   from a four-story steel special moment-resisting frame and multiple sets
   of simulated data. Various features of different dimensions have been
   explored, and the algorithm was able to identify damage, particularly
   when it uses multidimensional damage sensitive features and lower false
   alarm rates, with a known post-damage feature distribution. For unknown
   feature distribution cases, the post-damage distribution was
   consistently estimated and the detection delays were only a few time
   steps longer than the delays from the general method that assumes we
   know the post-damage feature distribution. We confirmed that the
   Bayesian method is particularly efficient in declaring damage with
   minimal memory requirement, but the maximum likelihood method provides
   an insightful heuristic approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Almost all of the water used for developing Marcellus Shale gas is
   withdrawn from surface water sources. State environmental and interstate
   water authorities take different approaches to managing these
   withdrawals. In the Upper Ohio River Basin, which covers the western
   third of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
   Protection requires that all water sources used for development have an
   approved water management plan. For surface water sources the plans
   stipulate the amount and timing of withdrawals from each source as a
   function of annual streamflow statistics. Neighboring regulatory
   authorities and some environmental groups now favor the use of monthly
   streamflow statistics to establish the conditions for water withdrawals.
   Our analysis indicates that, given the state of flow measurement data in
   the Upper streamflow statistics are more likely to prevent water
   withdrawals during the driest times of the year when aquatic ecosystems
   are most stressed, and to result in fewer and smaller occurrences of
   computed low-flow ecodeficits.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial communities associated with produced water from hydraulic
   fracturing are not well understood, and their deleterious activity can
   lead to significant increases in production costs and adverse
   environmental impacts. In this study, we compared the microbial ecology
   in prefracturing fluids (fracturing source water and fracturing fluid)
   and produced water at multiple time points from a natural gas well in
   southwestern Pennsylvania using 16S rRNA gene-based clone libraries,
   pyrosequencing, and quantitative PCR. The majority of the bacterial
   community in prefracturing fluids constituted aerobic species affiliated
   with the class Alphaproteobacteria. However, their relative abundance
   decreased in produced water with an increase in halotolerant,
   anaerobic/facultative anaerobic species affiliated with the classes
   Clostridia, Bacilli, Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria,
   Bacteroidia, and Fusobacteria. Produced water collected at the last time
   point (day 187) consisted almost entirely of sequences similar to
   Clostridia and showed a decrease in bacterial abundance by 3 orders of
   magnitude compared to the prefracturing fluids and produced water
   samplesfrom earlier time points. Geochemical analysis showed that
   produced water contained higher concentrations of salts and total
   radioactivity compared to prefracturing fluids. This study provides
   evidence of long-term subsurface selection of the microbial community
   introduced through hydraulic fracturing, which may include significant
   implications for disinfection as well as reuse of produced water in
   future fracturing operations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion MRI tractography has emerged as a useful and popular tool for
   mapping connections between brain regions. In this study, we examined
   the performance of quantitative anisotropy (QA) in facilitating
   deterministic fiber tracking. Two phantom studies were conducted. The
   first phantom study examined the susceptibility of fractional anisotropy
   (FA), generalized factional anisotropy (GFA), and QA to various partial
   volume effects. The second phantom study examined the spatial resolution
   of the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and QA-aided tractographies. An in vivo
   study was conducted to track the arcuate fasciculus, and two
   neurosurgeons blind to the acquisition and analysis settings were
   invited to identify false tracks. The performance of QA in assisting
   fiber tracking was compared with FA, GFA, and anatomical information
   from T-1-weighted images. Our first phantom study showed that QA is less
   sensitive to the partial volume effects of crossing fibers and free
   water, suggesting that it is a robust index. The second phantom study
   showed that the QA-aided tractography has better resolution than the
   FA-aided and GFA-aided tractography. Our in vivo study further showed
   that the QA-aided tractography outperforms the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and
   anatomy-aided tractographies. In the shell scheme (HARDI), the FA-aided,
   GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies have 30.7\%, 32.6\%, and
   24.45\% of the false tracks, respectively, while the QA-aided
   tractography has 16.2\%. In the grid scheme (DSI), the FA-aided,
   GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies have 12.3\%, 9.0\%, and
   10.93\% of the false tracks, respectively, while the QA-aided
   tractography has 4.43\%. The QA-aided deterministic fiber tracking may
   assist fiber tracking studies and facilitate the advancement of human
   connectomics.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between electrolyte solution pH and the local retention
   of electrochemically-generated hydrogen under extreme bias conditions
   for highly receptive activated carbons was studied for the first time.
   Hydrogen was generated through electrolysis on the surface of
   custom-made activated carbon electrodes in aqueous solutions with a
   range of pH (approximately 2-10). The carbon's ability to retain this
   generated hydrogen was analyzed via a galvanostatic test protocol, while
   the pH was monitored in situ. A rise in the basicity and corresponding
   Pourbaix shift was observed for tests performed in intermediate pH
   solutions, in contrast to that observed for strongly acidic or alkaline
   solutions. For the three intermediate pH solutions, an increased
   hydrogen evolution overvoltage was observed and was correlated to an
   increased hydrogen storage efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate
   the importance of pH control to extract maximum degree of hydrogen
   storage in idealized carbons, and show that the optimal pH for this
   effect is in the range of approximately 4-8. Furthermore, these high
   surface area carbons were found to have over 300 mAh g(-1) of energy
   storage capacity when charged with hydrogen in the proper pH range. (C)

Abstract = {{A fabrication method is introduced that utilizes masked deposition and
   selective wetting to produce hyperelastic electronic circuits that are
   composed of a thin elastomer film embedded with microchannels of
   liquid-phase gallium-indium (Ga-In) alloy. This method exploits the low
   melting-point and controllable wetting dynamics of Ga-In alloys, as well
   as the ability for Ga-In alloys to form irregularly-shaped,
   free-standing, micrometer-scale structures via gallium surface
   oxidation. Masked deposition eliminates the need for manual injection
   filling, which enables certain geometries that cannot be produced by
   injection and allows for the automated, high-volume production of Ga-In
   based liquid-embedded elastomer electronics (LE3). With this approach,
   LE3 circuits can be produced with isolated features that have planar
   dimensions of less than 200 m and edge-to-edge feature separations as
   small as 25 m.}},

Pages = {{334-343}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Optimizing process economics in model predictive control traditionally
   has been done using a twostep approach in which the economic objectives
   are first converted to steady-state operating points, and then the
   dynamic regulation is designed to track these setpoints. Recent research
   has shown that process economics can be optimized directly in the
   dynamic control problem, which can take advantage of potential higher
   profit transients to give superior economic performance. However, in
   practice, solution of such nonlinear MPC dynamic control problems can be
   challenging due to the nonlinearity of the model and/ or nonconvexity of
   the economic cost function. In this work we propose the use of direct
   methods to formulate the nonlinear control problem as a large-scale NLP,
   and then solve it using an interior point nonlinear solver in
   conjunction with automatic differentiation. Two case studies demonstrate
   the computational performance of this approach along with the economic
   performance of economic MPC formulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In some multitubular packed bed catalytic reactors, a graded reactor
   activity profile in the axial direction is created by loading the
   reactor with mixtures of active and inert pellets. This graded bed
   technique is developed to balance the reaction heat generation with
   reactor heat removal capacities and potentially improve reactor
   performance. In this study, we propose a model-based mathematical
   optimization approach to systematically design the optimal catalytic
   activity profile, taking the partial oxidation of ortho-xylene as the
   example. To carry out the task, we propose a multizone optimization
   formulation where the constraints are complicated by
   differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) from the reactor model. The
   reactor is described by one-dimensional mass and energy balance
   equations adopted from the so-called a model. We discretize the DAEs
   with orthogonal collocation over finite elements, which gives rise to a
   translated nonlinear optimization problem that can be built in generic
   algebraic modeling system (GAMS) and solved with off-the-shelf nonlinear
   programming (NLP) solvers. Our optimization results show that for
   ortho-xylene oxidation, compared with uniform catalyst distribution, the
   addition of a second optimized activity zone increases production by
   26\%, and further improvements are available with more zones. The
   methodology presented is generic and can accommodate different
   chemistries and constraints, which may result in significantly different
   optimization results and grading patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Contractile function of cardiac cells is driven by the sliding
   displacement of myofilaments powered by the cycling myosin crossbridges.
   Critical to this process is the availability of ATP, which myosin
   hydrolyzes during the cross-bridge cycle. The diffusion of adenine
   nucleotides through the myofilament lattice has been shown to be
   anisotropic, with slower radial diffusion perpendicular to the filament
   axis relative to parallel, and is attributed to the periodic hexagonal
   arrangement of the thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments. We
   investigated whether atomistic-resolution details of myofilament
   proteins can refine coarse-grain estimates of diffusional anisotropy for
   adenine nucleotides in the cardiac myofibril, using homogenization
   theory and atomistic thin filament models from the Protein Data Bank.
   Our results demonstrate considerable anisotropy in ATP and ADP diffusion
   constants that is consistent with experimental measurements and
   dependent on lattice spacing and myofilament overlap. A
   reaction-diffusion model of the half-sarcomere further suggests that
   diffusional anisotropy may lead to modest adenine nucleotide gradients
   in the myoplasm under physiological conditions.}},

   model predictions where the ammonium sulfate was assumed not to directly
   affect succinic acid evaporation. The model captured the evaporation
   rates for droplets with large organic content but overestimated the
   droplet size change when the molar concentration of succinic acid was
   similar to or lower than that of ammonium sulfate, suggesting that
   ammonium sulfate enhances the partitioning of dicarboxylic acids to
   aqueous particles more than currently expected from simple mixture
   thermodynamics. If extrapolated to the real atmosphere, these results
   imply enhanced partitioning of secondary organic compounds to
   particulate phase in environments dominated by inorganic aerosol.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil fuel wastewaters disposed of to surface waters used as sources
   for potable water supply have the potential to affect finished drinking
   water quality since these produced waters contain high concentrations of
   constituents that are of concern to drinking water providers (including
   dissolved solids, sulfate, chloride, and bromide). A 3-year field study
   in the Monongahela River was conducted to determine how constituent
   concentrations and associated loads changed in the river basin, and
   whether these changes were caused by surface discharges associated with
   shale gas extraction. Low flow during the dry summer of 2010 contributed
   to increases in bromide concentrations at drinking water intakes;
   however, similar low flow conditions in summer of 2012 did not,
   indicating bromide loads discharged to the river decreased from 2010 to
   2012. Analysis of bromide to chloride ratios as an indicator of fossil
   fuel associated wastewaters showed significant increases in Br/Cl at
   drinking water intakes over the first year of the study (2009-2010).
   This indicator ratio declined in the final year of the study
   (2011-2012), likely associated with a voluntary decrease in the use of
   surface-discharging treatment plants for shale gas wastewater disposal.
   Predictions of future concentrations based on historical flow data are
   also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Surface conductivity can complicate the determination of a sample's zeta
   potential from electrokinetic measurements. Correction factors have been
   derived to mitigate the problem for common systems such as particles,
   plates, and porous plugs. These factors are functions of the Dukhin
   number Du given by K-s/Ka where K-s is the surface conductivity, K is
   the electrolyte conductivity, and a is a length scale appropriate for
   the sample geometry. Here, the correction factor for the rotating disk
   geometry, in terms comparable to equations for particles, capillaries,
   and porous plugs, is shown to be f(Du) similar or equal to 1 + 1.516Du +
   0.135Du(2). The reciprocal of the f(Du) equation expresses the factor by
   which surface conductivity reduces the measured streaming potential for
   a given sample's true zeta potential. The theory shows that surface
   conductivity is negligible in the rotating disk geometry for essentially
   all ionic strengths because the disk radius is the natural length scale
   for Du. The correction for surface conductivity for a KCl solution with
   an ionic strength equivalent to the ionic strength of pure water would
   be only 1\% for a disk 10 mm in diameter. The ohmic resistance to the
   return of surface current from the disk's periphery through the bulk
   liquid to the axis is always much smaller than the resistance to the
   return of surface current back through the diffuse charge cloud of the
   double layer. The rotating disk geometry is unusual in this regard.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the design of grouping of
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, based on the Chinese
   remainder theorem (CRT). Grouping allows verifying the integrity of a
   collection of objects without the requirement for accessing external
   systems, and can be extended to identify missing objects. Motivated by
   the redundancy property of the Chinese remainder representation, we
   propose grouping of RFID tags via the CRT. The proposed scheme not only
   provides designated decoding guarantees, but also offers flexibility in
   constructing group generation matrices. We also characterize the key
   objects needed to study decoding guarantees of grouping and its extended
   counterpart, called rank-deficient and dead-end sets, respectively,
   which enable theoretical analyses of error rates. The two key objects
   are related to the minimum and stopping distances of a linear code,
   respectively. As such, the characterization offers direct connection
   with coding theory that helps in the understanding of the
   verification/identification problems being studied. Theoretical and
   simulation results are presented, demonstrating that the proposed scheme
   is an efficient approach to the design of grouping of RFID tags.}},

Abstract = {{Capture and subsurface co-sequestration of acid gas (a mixture of CO2
   and H2S) is a geologic sequestration approach that can reduce the
   emission of both CO2 and sulfur-containing ``sour{''} gas. To
   investigate the effects of co-sequestration on pozzolan-amended wellbore
   cement, samples were mixed, cured and exposed to mixtures of H2S and CO2
   under geologic sequestration conditions (50 degrees C, 15.1 MPa) for
   various periods of time. The resulting samples were characterized using
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microhardness testing. These analyses
   showed significant alteration at the surfaces of pozzolan-amended cement
   samples after 28 days of exposure to 21 mole\% H2S in a mixture with
   CO2. Results of samples exposed for 28 days also revealed that the
   samples with higher pozzolan amount (65\% pozzolan by volume) allowed
   faster CO2 and H2S penetrations than those with lower pozzolan amount
   (35\% pozzolan by volume). Analyses showed that there was formation of
   carbonate species in the interior ``core{''} region of pozzolan-amended
   cement samples with 65 vol\% pozzolan after 28 days of exposure, which
   was not the case for the samples with 35 vol\% pozzolan. In addition,
   the microhardness test results showed that the rim region of the 35
   vol\% pozzolan samples exhibited a higher microhardness than that of the
   core region for the same sample, whereas the different regions of the 65
   vol\% pozzolan samples exhibited similar microhardness values. In
   summary, the pozzolan-amended cement samples with 35 vol\% pozzolan
   exhibited better H2S-resisting performance than the samples with 65
   vol\% pozzolan. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{The influence of inertia and charge relaxation on electrohydrodynamic
   drop deformation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We quantify the transient deformation of a droplet immersed in a weakly
   conductive (leaky dielectric) fluid upon exposure to a uniform DC
   electric field. Capillary forces are assumed to be sufficiently large
   that the drop only slightly deviates from its equilibrium spherical
   shape. In particular, we account for transient (or linear) fluid inertia
   via the unsteady Stokes equations, and also account for a finite
   electrical relaxation time over which the drop interface charges. The
   temporal droplet deformation is governed by two dimensionless groups:
   (i) the ratio of capillary to momentum diffusion time scales: an
   Ohnesorge number Oh and (ii) the ratio of charge relaxation to momentum
   diffusion time scales, which we denote by Sa. If charge and momentum
   relaxation occur quickly compared to interface deformation, Sa << 1 and
   Oh >> 1 for the droplet and medium, a monotonic deformation is acquired.
   In contrast, Sa > 1 and Oh < 1 for either phase can lead to a
   non-monotonic development in the deformation. Numerical values for the
   deformation are calculated by inverting an analytical expression
   obtained in the Laplace domain, and are corroborated by asymptotic
   expansions at early and late times. The droplet and medium behave as
   perfect dielectrics at early times, which always favors an initial
   prolate (parallel to the applied field) deformation. As a consequence,
   for a final oblate (normal to the applied field) deformation, there is a
   shape transition from prolate to oblate at intermediate times. This
   transition is caused by the accumulation of sufficient charge at the
   interface to generate electrical and viscous shear stresses. Notably,
   after the transition, there may be an ``overshoot{''} in the
   deformation, i.e., the magnitude exceeds its steady-state value, which
   is proceeded by an algebraic tail describing the arrival towards the
   final, steady deformation. Our work demonstrates that transient inertia
   or a non-zero electrical relaxation time can yield non-monotonic
   electrohydrodynamic drop deformation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   behind a cylinder}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A computational analysis of vortex-shedding-induced vibration of a
   flexible splitter plate behind a cylinder at a low Reynolds number is
   conducted to understand effects of the length and flexibility of a
   splitter plate on the drag and lift of a cylinder and vibration of the
   attached plate. The drag and lift coefficients, the Strouhal number of
   vortex shedding, and the magnitude of tip displacements of a flexible
   splitter plate are found to be intricate functions of the plate
   flexibility. The deflection shape of a flexible splitter plate is
   dependent on the length of the plate, while the deflection magnitude is
   a function of the bending stiffness and natural frequencies of the
   corresponding plate. It is concluded in the present work that the
   Strouhal number of vortex shedding or the frequency of plate deflection
   is difficult to estimate using natural frequencies of the plate, which
   are calculated by inducing free vibration, since the fluid loading is
   distributed non-uniformly over the plate rather than concentrated at the
   tip of the plate. The present study suggests that the flexibility of a
   splitter plate, in general, adversely modulates the drag and lift forces
   acting on the cylinder surface while it promotes the oscillation of the
   plate. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Few data are available to quantify the risks and benefits
   of microvascular decompression (MVD) in elderly patients with hemifacial
   spasm. Methods: Twenty-seven patients >65 years of age and 104 younger
   patients who underwent MVD for hemifacial spasm (HFS) over a 3-year
   period were analyzed retrospectively and compared. Results: Twenty-six
   (96.3\%) elderly patients and 93 of 104 (89.4\%) young patients reported
   a spasm-free status at a mean follow-up of 26.5 months after MVD. No
   significant difference in spasm-free status was noted. Cranial nerve
   complications and other major complications were compared, with no
   significant differences observed. Conclusions: Although this study does
   not offer definitive inclusion or exclusion criteria or clearly
   establish the safety of MVD for HFS in the elderly, our experience
   suggests that many elderly patients with HFS can undergo MVD safely,
   with outcomes and risk profiles similar to those of younger patients.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of acid gas cosequestration requires investigation of
   the potential for acid gas leakage along existing wellbores at
   sequestration sites. In this study, the interaction between
   pozzolan-amended wellbore cement (35 vol \% pozzolan/65 vol \% cement,
   hereafter referred to as 35:65 sample) and acid gas (e.g., a mixture of
   CO2 and H2S) was simulated using the reactive transport code CrunchFlow.
   The model was applied to describe, interpret, and extrapolate scanning
   electron microscopy-backscattered electron (SEM-BSE) and scanning
   electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) results on
   pozzolan-amended cement samples exposed to a 1 wt \% NaCl solution
   saturated with an acid gas mixture of 21 mol \% H2S and 79 mol \% CO2
   under the temperature of 50 degrees C and pressure of 150 bar.
   Simulation outputs included calcite volume percentage, total Ca and S
   weight percentages in the solid phase, porosity, and effective
   permeability from the surface to the interior of pozzolan-amended
   wellbore cement. The model reproduced the observed calcite zone formed
   in the brine-cement interface region of the sample after 2.5 days of
   exposure. The model also predicted that the calcite layer became dense
   (calcite vol \% in the layer reached 55\%) after 90 days of exposure,
   consistent with the experimental observation. C-S-H was the primary Ca2+
   source to form the calcite layer, followed by C3S and Ca(OH)(2). The
   main observed products of reaction between the 35:65 sample and H2S were
   pyrite and ettringite. Pyrite was primarily formed within 0.5 mm from
   the brine-cement interface; ettringite mainly formed within 1 mm from
   the interface. The model simulated these reactions that only the
   interface region (up to 2 mm distance from the surface) of the 35:65
   sample became porous after 30 years of exposure. However, this narrow
   porous region could still serve as a migration pathway for acid gas,
   which was indicated by the increase in effective parallel permeability
   values determined from the simulation results. Those results show
   consistency with results of neat cement samples exposed under similar
   conditions. An increase in H2S content (in the range of 0 mol \% to 40
   mol \%) results in more dissolution of Ca-bearing minerals in cement and
   more precipitation of calcite. Overall, this study indicates that an
   increase of porosity and permeability of pozzolan-amended wellbore
   cement at the cement interface with brine saturated with CO2 and H2S can
   cause significant changes in effective permeability of the cement.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured Bi1-xSbx alloys constitute a convenient system to study
   charge transport in a nanostructured narrow-gap semiconductor with
   promising thermoelectric properties. In this work, we developed the
   colloidal synthesis of monodisperse sub-10 nm Bi1-xSbx alloy
   nanocrystals (NCs) with controllable size and compositions. The surface
   chemistry of Bi1-xSbx NCs was tailored with inorganic ligands to improve
   the interparticle charge transport as well as to control the carrier
   concentration. Temperature-dependent (10-300 K) electrical measurements
   were performed on the Bi1-xSbx NC based pellets to investigate the
   effect of surface chemistry and grain size (similar to 10-40 nm) on
   their charge transport properties. The Hall effect measurements revealed
   that the temperature dependence of carrier mobility and concentration
   strongly depended on the grain size and the surface chemistry, which was
   different from the reported bulk behavior. At low temperatures, electron
   mobility in nanostructured Bi1-xSbx was directly proportional to the
   average grain size, while the concentration of free carriers was
   inversely proportional to the grain size. We propose a model explaining
   such behavior. Preliminary measurements of thermoelectric properties
   showed a ZT value comparable to those of bulk Bi1-xSbx alloys at 300 K,
   suggesting a potential of Bi1-xSbx NCs for low-temperature
   thermoelectric applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background Current immunosuppressive therapy after heart transplantation
   either generally suppresses the recipient's entire immune system or is
   mainly targeting T-lymphocytes. Monocytes/macrophages are recognized as
   a hallmark of acute allograft rejection, but the roles that they play
   are not well characterized in vivo, because the tools for accessing in
   situ macrophage infiltration are lacking. In this study, we used MRI to
   investigate the role of macrophages in acute heart allograft rejection
   by cellular and functional MRI with selectively depleted systemic
   macrophages without affecting other leukocyte population, as well as to
   explore the possibility that macrophages could be an alternative
   therapeutic target.
   Methods and Results A rodent heterotopic working heart-lung
   transplantation model was used for studying acute allograft rejection.
   Systemic macrophages were selectively depleted by treating recipient
   animals with clodronate-liposomes. Macrophage infiltration in the graft
   hearts was monitored by cellular MRI with in vivo ultrasmall
   superparamagnetic iron oxide particles labeling. Graft heart function
   was evaluated by tagging MRI followed by strain analysis.
   Clodronate-liposome treatment depletes circulating monocytes/macrophages
   in transplant recipients, and both cellular MRI and pathological
   examinations indicate a significant reduction in macrophage accumulation
   in the rejecting allograft hearts. In clodronate-liposome-treated group,
   allograft hearts exhibited preserved tissue integrity, partially
   reversed functional deterioration, and prolonged graft survival,
   compared with untreated controls.
   Conclusions Cardiac cellular and functional MRI is a powerful tool to
   explore the roles of targeted immune cells in vivo. Our results indicate
   that macrophages are essential in acute cardiac allograft rejection, and
   selective depletion of macrophages with clodronate-liposomes protects
   hearts against allograft rejection, suggesting a potential therapeutic
   avenue. Our findings show that there is a finite risk of forming an
   intraventricular mass, presumably from the cellular debris or lipid
   material. Further optimization of the dosing protocol is necessary
   before clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In-home displays, dynamic pricing, and automated devices aim to reduce
   residential electricity use overall and during peak hours. We present a
   meta-analysis of 32 studies of the impacts of these interventions,
   conducted in the US or Canada. We find that methodological problems are
   common in the design of these studies, leading to artificially inflated
   results relative to what one would expect if the interventions were
   implemented in the general population. Particular problems include
   having volunteer participants who may have been especially motivated to
   reduce their electricity use, letting participants choose their
   preferred intervention, and having high attrition rates. Using estimates
   of bias from medical clinical trials as a guide, we recalculate impact
   estimates to adjust for bias, resulting in values that are often less
   than half of those reported in the reviewed studies. We estimate that
   in-home displays were the most effective intervention for reducing
   overall electricity use (similar to 4\% using reported data; similar to
   3\% after adjusting for bias), while dynamic pricing significantly
   reduced peak demand (similar to 11\% reported; similar to 6\% adjusted),
   especially when used in conjunction with home automation (similar to
   25\% reported; similar to 14\% adjusted). We conclude with
   recommendations that can improve pilot studies and the soundness of
   decisions based on their results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{697-706}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Karnataka has been among the most successful markets for solar lighting
   systems (SLS) among Indian states. In order to understand the dynamics
   of systems adoption and operation, that have fostered market based
   adoption of solar lighting, we interviewed rural households from six
   districts that had purchased solar lighting systems using loans at
   market rates, the rural banks that provided loans and the solar firms
   that marketed the technology. We found that a large proportion of
   households in our sample were connected to the grid but chose to install
   solar lighting because they considered the power supply from the grid to
   be unreliable. Households in our sample reported savings on electricity
   costs and reduced kerosene usage for lighting. In addition to providing
   credit, banks also play a key role in ensuring good service and
   maintenance; the viability of the SLS market is thus critically
   dependent on the role that the banks play as intermediaries between
   consumers and solar firms in rural areas. Government programs should be
   carefully designed to match the incentives of firms, banks and consumers
   if the successes of the `Karnataka model' are to be repeated and
   amplified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of simplifying outreach materials for energy conservation
   programs that target low-income consumers}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{1157-1164}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Critics have speculated that the limited success of energy conservation
   programs among low-income consumers may partly be due to recipients
   having insufficient literacy to understand the outreach materials.
   Indeed, we found outreach materials for low-income consumers to require
   relatively high levels of reading comprehension. We therefore improved
   the Flesch-Kincaid readability statistics for two outreach brochures, by
   using shorter words and shorter sentences to describe their content. We
   examined the effect of that simplification on low-income consumers'
   responses. Participants from low-income communities in the greater
   Pittsburgh area, who varied in literacy, were randomly assigned to
   either original communications about energy conservation programs or our
   simplified versions. Our findings suggest that lowering readability
   statistics successfully simplified only the more straightforward
   brochure in our set of two, likely because its content lent itself
   better to simplification. Findings for this brochure showed that
   simplification improved understanding of its content among both
   low-literacy and high-literacy recipients, without adversely affecting
   their evaluation of the materials, or their intention to enroll in the
   advertised programs. We discuss strategies for improving communication
   materials that aim to reach out to low-income populations. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A pneumatically-driven robot traverses surfaces with different traction
   by adopting an undulatory mode of locomotion. The robot is composed of
   soft elastomer (elastic modulus similar to 100 kPa), an inextensible but
   flexible neutral plane, and embedded pneumatic channels. In contrast to
   conventional robots and wheeled vehicles, the robot deforms elastically
   to make ground contact over a relatively large area, where interfacial
   tractions have a unique role in controlling both the speed and direction
   of locomotion. Here, we demonstrate that for the same undulatory gait,
   the robot will either move forward or backward depending on the ground
   composition. Building on mathematical principles of elasticity and
   friction, we introduce a theoretical model that identifies the
   tribological properties that determine the direction of locomotion.
   Though overlooked in the past, this tribology-controlled phenomenon
   represents a central feature of undulation on smooth, soft, and slippery
   surfaces. These insights provide a starting point for identifying
   locomotion strategies that allow soft robots, like their natural
   invertebrate counterparts, to navigate a broad range of surfaces and
   terrains.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a methodology is proposed for evaluating sampling
   locations in an existing river water quality monitoring network. The
   dynamic factor analysis is utilized to extract the independent dynamic
   factors from time series of water quality variables. Then, the entropy
   theory is applied to the independent dynamic factors to construct
   transinformation-distance (T-D) curves. The computation time in the case
   of using dynamic factors is significantly less than when the raw data is
   used because the number of independent dynamic factors is usually much
   less than the number of monitored water quality variables. In this
   paper, it is also shown that by clustering the study area to some
   homogenous zones and developing T-D curves for each zone, the accuracy
   of the results is significantly increased. To evaluate the applicability
   and efficiency of the proposed methodology, it is applied to the Karoon
   River which is the most important river system in Iran.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to further our understanding of how embeddedness affects
   the research output and impact of scientists. The analysis uses an
   extensive panel data that allows an analysis of within person variation
   overtime, It explores the simultaneous effects of different dimensions
   of network embeddedness over time at individual level. These include the
   establishment of direct ties, the strengths of these ties, as well as
   the density, structural holes, centrality, and cross-disciplinary links.
   Results suggest that the network dynamics behind the generation of
   quality output contrasts dramatically with that of quantity. We find
   that the relational dimension of scientists matters for quality, but not
   for output, while cognitive dimensions have the opposite effect, helping
   output, while being indifferent toward impact. The structural dimension
   of the network is the only area where there is some degree of
   convergence between output quantity and quality; here, we find a
   prevalence for the role of brokerage over cohesion. It concludes by
   discussing implications for both network research and science policy.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the global optimization of the short term
   scheduling for hydroelectric power generation. A tailored deterministic
   global optimization approach, denominated sHBB, is developed and its
   performance is analyzed. This approach is applied to the optimization of
   a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for cascades of
   hydro plants, each one with multiple turbines, and characterized by a
   detailed representation of the net head of water, and a nonlinear
   hydropower generation function. A simplified model is also considered
   where only the linear coefficients of the forebay and tailrace
   polynomial functions are retained. For comparison purposes, four case
   studies are addressed with the proposed global optimization strategy and
   with a commercial solver for global optimization. The results show that
   the proposed approach is more efficient than the commercial solver in
   terms of finding a better solution with a smaller optimality gap, using
   less CPU time. The proposed method can also find alternative and
   potentially more profitable power production schedules. Significant
   insights were also obtained regarding the effectiveness of the proposed
   relaxation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel H-based approach called advanced frequency
   control (AFC) to integrate storage into frequency control. The objective
   is to split the task of balancing frequency deviations introduced by
   renewable energy source (RES) and load variations according to the
   capabilities of storage and generators. Hence, via frequency dependent
   weighting functions, a so-called frequency separation objective is
   achieved: the conventional generators mainly balance the low-frequency
   components of the RES and load variations while the energy storage
   devices compensate the high-frequency components. First, a state-space
   structure-preserving model of the power system is derived, which is
   needed for the design of the controller. In order to enable the
   controller design for storage devices located at buses with no
   generators, a model for the frequency at such a bus is developed. Then,
   AFC controllers are synthesised through decentralised static output
   feedback to reduce the complexity in the practical implementation of
   such controllers. An existing linear matrix inequality algorithm is
   improved and employed to solve the involved H problem. Finally, the WECC
   9-bus test system is used to verify the performance of the AFC design.}},

Title = {{Thermal analysis and design of a multi-layered rigidity tunable
   composite}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{271-278}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Elastomer-based composites embedded with thermally-responsive material
   (TRM) and a liquid-phase Joule heater are capable of reversibly changing
   their elastic rigidity by up to four orders of magnitude. At room
   temperature, the TRM layer is rigid and prevents the surrounding
   elastomer from elastically bending or stretching. When activated, the
   embedded Joule heater softens or melts the TRM, which leads to a
   dramatic reduction in the elastic rigidity of the composite. In this
   manuscript, we examine the activation of these composites by performing
   analytical, numerical, and experimental studies of the temperature
   distribution, thermal history, and phase transition. We consider both
   low melting point (LMP) metal alloys (e.g. Field's metal) and shape
   memory polymer (SMP). An analytical solution using the Galerkin Based
   Integral (GBI) method is derived for the cases where no phase change is
   involved, while a numerical scheme using the Latent Heat Accumulation
   (LHA) method is utilized to probe scenarios where phase change has a
   central role in the elastic rigidity change. The analytical and
   numerical studies predict a temperature history that is in good
   agreement with experimental measurements obtained with an IR
   thermometer. Analysis of the internal temperature distribution leads to
   scaling laws for determining the required activation time and allowable
   input power rate for composites containing either LMP alloys or SMP.
   These scaling laws could potentially be used to inform the design of
   rigidity tunable composites (RTC) used in assistive wearable
   technologies and biologically-inspired soft-matter robotics. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A model-based experimental design is formulated and solved as a
   large-scale NLP problem. The key idea of the proposed approach is the
   extension of model equations with sensitivity equations forming an
   extended sensitivities-state equation system. The resulting system is
   then totally discretized and simultaneously solved as constraints of the
   NLP problem. Thereby, higher derivatives of the parameter sensitivities
   with respect to the control variables are directly calculated and exact.
   This is an advantage in comparison with proposed sequential approaches
   to model-based experimental design so far, where these derivatives have
   to be additionally integrated throughout the optimization steps. This
   can end up in a high-computational load especially for systems with many
   control variables. Furthermore, an advanced sampling strategy is
   proposed which combines the strength of the optimal sampling design and
   the variation of the collocation element lengths while fully using the
   entire optimization space of the simultaneous formulation. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper discusses volunteer bias in residential energy efficiency
   studies. We briefly evaluate the bias in existing studies. We then show
   how volunteer bias can be corrected when not avoidable, using an on-line
   study of intentions to enroll in an in-home display trial as an example.
   We found that the best predictor of intentions to enroll was expected
   benefit from the in-home display. Constraints on participation, such as
   time in the home and trust in scientists, were also associated with
   enrollment intentions. Using Breiman's classification tree algorithm we
   found that the best model of intentions to enroll contained only five
   variables: expected enjoyment of the program, presence in the home
   during morning hours, trust (in friends and in scientists), and
   perceived ability to handle unexpected problems. These results suggest
   that a short questionnaire, that takes at most 1 min to complete, would
   allow better control of volunteer bias than a more extensive
   questionnaire. This paper should allow researchers who employ field
   studies involving human behavior to be better equipped to address
   volunteer bias. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new Stirling microrefrigeration system composed of arrays of silicon
   MEMS cooling elements has been designed and evaluated. The cooling
   elements are to be fabricated in a stacked array on a silicon wafer. A
   regenerator is placed between the compression (hot side) and expansion
   (cold side) diaphragms, which are driven electrostatically. Air at a
   pressure of 2 bar is the working fluid and is sealed in the system.
   Under operating conditions, the hot and cold diaphragms oscillate
   sinusoidally and out of phase such that heat is extracted to the
   expansion space and released from the compression space. Parametric
   study of the design shows the effects of phase lag between the hot space
   and cold space, swept volume ratio between the hot space and cold space,
   and dead volume ratio on the cooling power. Losses due to regenerator
   nonidealities are estimated and the effects of the operating frequency
   and the regenerator porosity on the cooler performance are explored. The
   optimal porosity for the best system coefficient of performance (COP) is
   identified.}},

   Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new computational method for the automatic
   generation of geometric feature patterns for industrial design. Such
   patterns include speaker holes, showerhead holes, and bumpy textures on
   a grip, and they play a key role in making a designed object
   aesthetically pleasing and functional. While modern CAD packages support
   the automated creation of basic patterns, rectangular grids, and radial
   grids, they are not applicable to more general cases required in
   industrial design, including arbitrarily shaped target geometry and
   graded feature sizes. The proposed computational method takes as input a
   target region along with sizing metrics and generates feature patterns
   automatically in three steps: (1) packing circles tightly in the target
   region, (2) scaling features according to the specified sizing metrics,
   and (3) adding features on the base geometry. The proposed method is
   installed as a plugin module to a commercial CAD package, and a pattern
   of hundreds of features can be added to a 3D CAD model in less than 5
   min. This allows the industrial designer to explore more design
   alternatives by avoiding the tedious and time-consuming manual
   generation of patterns.}},

   Building Information Models generated from point cloud data}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{507-516}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Generating three-dimensional (3D) as-is Building Information Models
   (BIMs), representative of the existing conditions of buildings, from
   point cloud data collected by laser scanners is becoming common
   practice. However, generation of such models currently is mostly
   performed manually, and errors can be introduced during data collection,
   pre-processing, and modeling. This paper presents a method for assessing
   the quality of as-is BlMs generated from point cloud data by analyzing
   the patterns of geometric deviations between the model and the point
   cloud data. The fundamental assumption is that the point cloud and the
   as-is BIM generated from the point cloud should corroborate in the
   depiction of the components and their spatial attributes. Major
   geometric deviations between as-is models and point clouds can indicate
   potential errors introduced during data collection, processing and/or
   model generation. The research described in this paper provides a
   taxonomy for patterns of deviations and sources of errors and
   demonstrates that it is possible to identify the source, magnitude, and
   nature of errors by analyzing the deviation patterns. The method is
   validated through a comparison with the currently adopted physical
   measurement method in a case study. The results show that the deviation
   analysis method is capable of identifying almost six times more errors
   with more than 40\% time savings compared to the physical measurement
   method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the flow of granular materials is important for its impact on
   both industrial applications and natural phenomena. A fundamental
   understanding of the flow of granular materials is lacking, and this
   results in difficulties in modeling and predicting their flow behavior.
   The discrete element method (DEM) is often used as the ``gold
   standard{''} both for predicting the results of experiments as well as
   for comparison to continuum-level theories of granular material flows
   due to its derivation from first-principal constructs, like contact
   mechanics. In this paper, we continue our work on quantitative
   validation of DEM simulations using detailed measurements of simple,
   well-characterized flows that allow us to examine the effect of rough
   surfaces and rotational rates on granular flow using an annular shear
   cell. Experimentally, we use digital particle tracking velocimetry
   (DPTV) to obtain velocity, solids fraction, and granular temperature
   profiles. Computationally, we compare the results obtained using
   different contact mechanics force laws to those from experimental
   measurements as well as perform a sensitivity analysis on device and
   particle geometry and different material properties employed. In
   previous work on stainless steel beads, we have found that an
   elasto-plastic normal force model is critical to obtaining accurate
   results as is detailed matching of both particle and system geometry,
   while the choice of friction model is found to be unimportant. Here, we
   examine the robustness of these observations to both particle materials
   properties as well as systemic variables (such as total system solids
   fraction). We find that the choice of frictional force model has little
   effect across all the profiles and all models, while the accuracy of the
   normal force model is material-dependent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Development of design-by-analogy tools is a promising design innovation
   research avenue. Previously, a method for computationally structuring
   patent databases as a basis for an automated design-by-analogy tool was
   introduced. To demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses, a
   computationally-generated structure is compared to four expert
   designers' mental models of the domain. Results indicate that, compared
   to experts, the computationally-generated structure is sensible in
   clustering of patents and organization of clusters. The
   computationally-generated structure represents a space in which experts
   can find common ground/consensus - making it promising to be
   intuitive/accessible to broad cohorts of designers. The computational
   method offers a resource-efficient way of usefully conceptualizing the
   space that is sensible to expert designers, while maintaining an element
   of unexpected representation of the space. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A multilayer data-driven framework for robust structural health
   monitoring based on a comprehensive application of machine learning and
   signal processing techniques is introduced. This paper focuses on
   demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework for damage detection in
   a steel pipe under environmental and operational variations. The pipe
   was instrumented with piezoelectric wafers that can generate and sense
   ultrasonic waves. Damage was simulated physically by a mass scatterer
   grease-coupled to the surface of the pipe. Benign variations included
   variable internal air pressure and ambient temperature over time.
   Ultrasonic measurements were taken on three different days with the
   scatterer placed at different locations on the pipe. The wave patterns
   are complex and difficult to interpret, and it is even more difficult to
   differentiate the changes produced by the scatterer from the changes
   produced by benign variations. The sensed data were characterized by 365
   features extracted from a variety of signal-processing techniques.
   Automated feature selection methods were then developed using an
   adaptive boosting algorithm to identify the most effective features for
   damage detection. With the selected features, five machine-learning
   classifiers were formulated based on adaptive boosting and support
   vector machines and achieved 98.5-99.8\% average accuracy during random
   testing and 84.2-89\% average accuracy during systematic testing. In
   addition, other metrics for classifier evaluation generated from a
   confusion matrix and from a receiver operating characteristic curve are
   reported. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{High angle annular dark field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron
   microscope (STEM) data is increasingly being used in the physical
   sciences to research materials in 3D because it reduces the effects of
   Bragg diffraction seen in bright field TEM data. Typically, tomographic
   reconstructions are performed by directly applying either filtered back
   projection (FBP) or the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique
   (SIRT) to the data. Since HAADF-STEM tomography is a limited angle
   tomography modality with low signal to noise ratio, these methods can
   result in significant artifacts in the reconstructed volume. In this
   paper, we develop a model based iterative reconstruction algorithm for
   HAADF-STEM tomography. We combine a model for image formation in
   HAADF-STEM tomography along with a prior model to formulate the
   tomographic reconstruction as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
   estimation problem. Our formulation also accounts for certain missing
   measurements by treating them as nuisance parameters in the MAP
   estimation framework. We adapt the iterative coordinate descent
   algorithm to develop an efficient method to minimize the corresponding
   MAP cost function. Reconstructions of simulated as well as experimental
   data sets show results that are superior to FBP and SIRT
   reconstructions, significantly suppressing artifacts and enhancing
   contrast.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the magnetostriction of Nd6Fe13-xCoxSi (x = 0, 1)
   intermetallic compounds with tetragonal Nd6Fe13Si-type structure, using
   the strain gauge method in the temperature range of 77-600 K under
   applied magnetic fields up to 1.5 T. The anisotropic magnetostriction
   (Delta lambda) versus temperature of the studied samples has shown
   almost similar field-dependence behavior. Below the spin reorientation
   temperature (T-SR), Delta lambda changes its sign from positive to
   negative value at an applied threshold field which increases with
   decreasing temperature. This behavior may originate from the reduction
   of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy with temperature. It is also
   observed that absolute value of Delta lambda increases by Co
   substitution. On the other hand, the volume magnetostriction (Delta V/V)
   versus field shows different behavior. The Delta V/V curves of
   Nd6Fe12CoSi tend to have a nearly quadratic dependence on applied field
   near magnetic ordering temperature as expected for the parastrictive
   behavior. The temperature dependence of magnetostriction values is
   discussed based on the magnetostriction relation of the tetragonal
   structure to determine the signs of some of magnetostriction constants
   for these polycrystalline compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An elastic deterministic contact mechanics model is applied to the
   compressed micro-porous (MPL) and catalyst layer (CL) interfaces in
   polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) to elucidate the interfacial
   morphology. The model employs measured two-dimensional surface profiles
   and computes local surface deformation and interfacial gap, average
   contact resistance, and percent contact area as a function of
   compression pressure. Here, we apply the model to one interface having a
   MPL with cracks and one with a crack-free MPL. The void size
   distributions and water retention curves for the two sets of CL vertical
   bar MPL interfaces under compression are also computed. The CL vertical
   bar MPL interfaces with cracks are observed to have higher roughness,
   resulting in twice the interfacial average gap compared to the
   non-cracked interface at a given level of compression. The results
   indicate that the interfacial contact resistance is roughly the same for
   cracked or non-cracked interfaces due to cracks occupying low percentage
   of overall area. However, the cracked CL vertical bar MPL interface
   yields higher liquid saturation levels at all capillary pressures,
   resulting in an order of magnitude higher water storage capacity
   compared to the smooth interface. The van Genuchten water retention
   curve correlation for log-normal void size distributions is found to fit
   non-cracked CL vertical bar MPL interfaces well. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{As resource management efforts move towards more comprehensive
   approaches that spin multiple sectors and stakeholder groups, decision
   makers are faced with the challenge of deciding how important each group
   is, and how much weight their concerns should have, when making
   decisions. These decisions must be made transparently if they are to
   have credibility. This paper describes a systematic approach to
   eliciting such preferences, illustrated through a regional application
   of the Ocean Health Index in the California Current. The Index provides
   an ideal case study as it includes a comprehensive set of goals designed
   to-assess the benefits people derive from coasts and oceans. The
   approach leverages the strengths of two different methods for eliciting
   preferences, one based on random utility theory and the other on
   analytical deliberative methodologies. Results showed that the methods
   were accessible to individuals with diverse backgrounds and, in this
   case, revealed surprising consensus about fundamental values that may
   have been missed in deliberations around a specific action, rather than
   evaluating a spectrum of management priorities. Specifically,
   individuals, even extractive users, assigned higher weights to cultural
   and conservation goals compared to extractive ones. The approach offers
   a general procedure for eliciting explicit preferences through
   constructive deliberations among diverse stakeholders. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Restructuring of metals by chiral molecules represents an important
   route to inducing and controlling enantioselective surface chemistry.
   Tartaric acid adsorption on Cu(110) has served as a useful system for
   understanding many aspects of chiral molecule adsorption and ordering on
   a metal surface, and a number of chiral and achiral unit cells have been
   reported. Herein, we show that given the appropriate annealing
   treatment, singly deprotonated tartaric acid monolayers can restructure
   the Cu metal itself, and that the resulting structure is both highly
   ordered and chiral. Molecular resolution scanning tunneling microscopy
   reveals that singly deprotonated tartaric acid extracts Cu atoms from
   the Cu(110) surface layer and incorporates them into highly ordered,
   chiral adatom arrays capped by a continuous molecular layer. Further
   evidence for surface restructuring comes from images of atom-deep
   trenches formed in the Cu(110) surface during the process. These
   trenches also run in low symmetry directions and are themselves chiral.
   Simulated scanning tunneling microscopy images are consistent with the
   appearance of the added atom rows and etched trenches. The chiral
   imprinting results in a long-range, highly ordered ((2)(6) (-1)(7)) unit
   cell covering the whole surface as confirmed by low energy electron
   diffraction. Details of the restructuring mechanism were further
   investigated via time-lapse imaging at elevated temperature. This work
   reveals the stages of nanoscale surface restructuring and offers an
   interesting method for chiral modification of an achiral metal surface.}},

Abstract = {{To compare cyclic performances of different Sn based materials as anodes

   conditions, the SnO/Sn/Cu6Sn5 three-layer film was prepared by a facile

   at 200 degrees C in atmosphere for 48 h. Microstructure and morphology
   of the three-layer film were characterized by X-ray diffraction and SEM.
   Both the Sn film and three-layer film were assembled as anodes in Li-ion
   battery. Their electrochemical properties were studied by
   charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and ac impedance spectra. Compared
   with Sn anode, SnO/Sn/Cu6Sn5 three-layer anode shows much smaller SEI
   film, charge transfer and diffusion resistance. Capacities of SnO, Sn
   and Cu6Sn5 phases were obtained from analysis of charge/discharge
   curves. Among all three phases, Cu6Sn5 shows both the highest capacity

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity in non-metallic crystalline materials results from
   cumulative contributions of phonons that have a broad range of mean free
   paths. Here we use high frequency surface temperature modulation that
   generates non-diffusive phonon transport to probe the phonon mean free
   path spectra of GaAs, GaN, AlN, and 4H-SiC at temperatures near 80 K,
   150 K, 300 K, and 400 K. We find that phonons with MFPs greater than 230
   +/- 120 nm, 1000 +/- 200 nm, 2500 +/- 800 nm, and 4200 +/- 850 nm
   contribute 50\% of the bulk thermal conductivity of GaAs, GaN, AlN, and
   4H-SiC near room temperature. By non-dimensionalizing the data based on
   Umklapp scattering rates of phonons, we identified a universal phonon
   mean free path spectrum in small unit cell crystalline semiconductors at

   degenerate optimization problems}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Barrier nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers exploit sparse Newton-based
   algorithms and are characterized by fast performance and global
   convergence properties. This makes them especially suitable for very
   large process optimization problems. On the other hand, they are
   frequently challenged by degenerate and indefinite problems, which lead
   to ill-conditioned Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems. Such problems arise
   when process optimization models contain linearly dependent constraints,
   or the reduced Hessian is not positive definite at the solution. This
   can lead to poor solver performance and may preclude finding successful
   NLP solutions. Moreover, such optimization models occur in blending
   problems and NLP subproblems generated by MINLP or global optimization
   strategies. To deal with these difficulties we present a structured
   regularization strategy for barrier methods that identifies and excludes
   dependent constraints in the KKT system while leaving independent
   constraints unchanged. As a result, more accurate Newton directions can
   be obtained and much faster convergence can be expected for the KKT
   system over the conventional regularization approach. Numerical
   experiments with examples derived from the CUTE and COPS test sets as
   well as two nonlinear blending problems demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method and significantly better performance of the NLP
   solver. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report here a rapid process to synthesize microporous carbon from
   nongraphitic carbon source through microwave-assisted exfoliation in a
   non-inert environment. A ternary compound of potassium-nongraphitic
   carbon-tetrahydrofuran (THF) was prepared and then heating by microwave
   irradiation for 2 min widens the interstices between adjacent graphene
   layers in ternary compound, inducing microporous texture with a large
   amount of ultramicropores. Exploiting microwave heating allows for
   efficient and rapid synthesis of activated carbon compared with commonly
   used chemical activation process. After microwave irradiation on
   nongraphitic carbon, the constituent stacked graphene layers were broken
   and the specific surface area of 563 m(2) g(-1) was developed. The
   feasibility of an electrode material for supercapacitor was estimated by
   cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling. The
   specific areal capacitance reveals as high as 16.4 mu f cm(-2) in 1 M
   NaNO3 aqueous solution, which is significantly larger than values found
   in traditional activated carbons made for use in electrochemical double
   layer capacitors. Without restrictive processing conditions of chemical
   activation, microporous structure carbon can be efficiently and rapidly
   synthesized via microwave irradiation for possible electrochemical
   capacitor electrode. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sparse Solution of Fiber Orientation Distribution Function by Diffusion
   Decomposition}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Fiber orientation is the key information in diffusion tractography.
   Several deconvolution methods have been proposed to obtain fiber
   orientations by estimating a fiber orientation distribution function
   (ODF). However, the L-2 regularization used in deconvolution often leads
   to false fibers that compromise the specificity of the results. To
   address this problem, we propose a method called diffusion
   decomposition, which obtains a sparse solution of fiber ODF by
   decomposing the diffusion ODF obtained from q-ball imaging (QBI),
   diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), or generalized q-sampling imaging
   (GQI). A simulation study, a phantom study, and an in-vivo study were
   conducted to examine the performance of diffusion decomposition. The
   simulation study showed that diffusion decomposition was more accurate
   than both constrained spherical deconvolution and ball-and-sticks model.
   The phantom study showed that the angular error of diffusion
   decomposition was significantly lower than those of constrained
   spherical deconvolution at 30 degrees crossing and ball-and-sticks model
   at 60 degrees crossing. The in-vivo study showed that diffusion
   decomposition can be applied to QBI, DSI, or GQI, and the resolved fiber
   orientations were consistent regardless of the diffusion sampling
   schemes and diffusion reconstruction methods. The performance of
   diffusion decomposition was further demonstrated by resolving crossing
   fibers on a 30-direction QBI dataset and a 40-direction DSI dataset. In
   conclusion, diffusion decomposition can improve angular resolution and
   resolve crossing fibers in datasets with low SNR and substantially
   reduced number of diffusion encoding directions. These advantages may be
   valuable for human connectome studies and clinical research.}},

Title = {{Disruption of superlattice phonons by interfacial mixing}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations are
   used to study the vibrational modes and thermal transport in
   Lennard-Jones superlattices with perfect and mixed interfaces. The
   secondary periodicity of the superlattices leads to a vibrational
   spectrum (i.e., dispersion relation) that is distinct from the bulk
   spectra of the constituent materials. The mode eigenvectors of the
   perfect superlattices are found to be good representations of the
   majority of the modes in the mixed superlattices for up to 20\%
   interfacial mixing, allowing for extraction of phonon frequencies and
   lifetimes. Using the frequencies and lifetimes, the in-plane and
   cross-plane thermal conductivities are predicted using a solution of the
   Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), with agreement found with
   predictions from the Green-Kubo method for the perfect superlattices.
   For the mixed superlattices, the Green-Kubo and BTE predictions agree
   for the cross-plane direction, where thermal conductivity is dominated
   by low-frequency modes whose eigenvectors are not affected by the
   mixing. For the in-plane direction, mid-frequency modes that contribute
   to thermal transport are disrupted by the mixing, leading to an
   underprediction of thermal conductivity by the BTE. The results
   highlight the importance of using a dispersion relation that includes
   the secondary periodicity when predicting phonon properties in perfect
   superlattices and emphasize the challenges of estimating the effects of
   disorder on phonon properties.}},

Abstract = {{We compare battery performance simulations from a commercial lithium-ion
   battery modeling software package against manufacturer performance
   specifications and laboratory tests to assess model validity. A set of
   commercially manufactured spiral wound lithium-ion cells were
   electrochemically tested and then disassembled and physically
   characterized. The Battery Design Studio (R) (BDS) software was then
   used to create a mathematical model of each battery, and discharge
   simulations at constant C-rates ranging from C/5 to 2C were compared
   against laboratory tests and manufacturer performance specifications.
   Results indicate that BDS predictions of total energy delivered under
   our constant C-rate battery discharge tests are within 6.5\% of
   laboratory measurements for a full discharge and within 2.8\% when a
   60\% state of charge window is considered. Average discrepancy is
   substantially lower. In all cases, the discrepancy in simulated vs.
   manufacturer specifications or laboratory results of energy and capacity
   delivered was comparable to the discrepancy between manufacturer
   specifications and laboratory results. Results suggest that BDS can
   provide sufficient accuracy in discharge performance simulations for
   many applications. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{We analyse electron and hole transport in organic light-emitting diodes
   (OLEDs) via the drift-diffusion equations. We focus on
   space-charge-limited transport, in which rapid variations in charge
   carrier density occur near the injecting electrodes, and in which the
   electric field is highly non-uniform. This motivates our application of
   singular asymptotic analysis to the drift-diffusion equations. In the
   absence of electronhole recombination, our analysis reveals three
   regions within the OLED: (i) `space-charge layers' near each electrode
   whose width (lambda) over cap (s) is much smaller than the device width
   (L) over cap, wherein carrier densities decay rapidly and the electric
   field is intense; (ii) a ` bulk' region whose width is on the scale of
   (L) over cap, where carrier densities are small; and (iii) intermediate
   regions bridging (i) and (ii). Our analysis shows that the current (J)
   over cap scales as (J) over cap proportional to (epsilon) over cap (mu)
   over cap (V) over cap (2)/ (L) over cap (2) (lambda) over cap (s), where
   (V) over cap is the applied voltage, (epsilon) over cap is the
   permittivity and (mu) over cap is the electric mobility, in contrast to
   the familiar diffusion-free scaling (J) over cap proportional to
   (epsilon) over cap (mu) over cap (V) over cap (2)/ (L) over cap (3).
   Thus, diffusion is seen to lead to a large O( (L) over cap/ (lambda)
   over cap (s)) increase in current. Finally, we derive an asymptotic
   recombination-voltage relation for a kinetically limited OLED, in which
   charge recombination occurs on a much longer time scale than diffusion
   and drift.}},

Title = {{Electrostatic forces on two almost touching nonspherical charged
   conductors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Analytical expressions are derived for the electrostatic forces on two
   almost touching nonspherical conductors held at unequal voltages or
   carrying dissimilar charges in an insulating medium. Each conductor is a
   body of revolution whose surface is defined by the equation r(n) + z(n)
   = a(n), where r and z are radial and axial cylindrical co-ordinates,
   respectively, 2a is the equatorial width, and n is a parameter that
   controls the particle shape. The two objects are of identical shape and
   placed in a coaxial configuration, in which case the electrostatic
   forces are solely along their line of centers. The calculation of the
   forces is performed via a local analysis of the electrostatics in the
   thin gap region separating the particles. At a fixed potential
   difference, the magnitude of the attractive force F on the particles
   scales with the minimum gap height h(0) as F similar to h(0)(2(1/n-1)) 0
   for n > 1 and F similar to lnh(0) for n = 1, to leading order as h(0)/a
   -> 0. The force increases as the gap region becomes flatter (increasing
   n), due to the intense electric field in the gap acting over a larger
   surface area. The opposite is found for particles carrying fixed
   charges: here, F similar to h(0)(-2/n) for n > 2 and F similar to
   h(0)(-1)0 {[}ln(a/h(0))](-2) for n = 2. In this case, the potential
   difference between the conductors diminishes as the gap region becomes
   flatter, which overpowers the increase in gap area. Our results
   demonstrate that like-charge attraction occurs for a broad class of
   nonspherical conductors at close separations. The predicted sensitivity
   of the electrostatic force to particle shape is relevant to probe-based
   microscopy: specifically, to quantify the influence of tip-geometry on
   the force experienced by a charged probe near a conducting surface. (C)

Abstract = {{The design and preparation of porous materials with controlled
   structures and functionalities is crucial to a variety of absorption- or
   separation-relevant applications, including CO2 capture. Here, novel
   functional polymeric materials with three-dimensionally ordered
   macroporous (3DOM) structures are prepared by using colloidal crystals
   as templates using relatively simple, rapid, and inexpensive approaches.
   These ordered structures are used for the reversible CO2 capture from
   ambient air by humidity swing. Typically, the colloidal crystal template
   is synthesized from polymer latex particles of poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PMMA) or polystyrene (PS). To maintain the functionality of the
   material, it is important to prevent the porous structure collapsing,
   which can occur by the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in conventional
   crosslinkers under basic conditions. This hydrolysis can be prevented by
   using a water-soluble crosslinker containing two quaternary ammonium
   moieties, which can be used to prepare stable porous crosslinked
   polymers with the monomer (vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride
   (VBTMACl) and using a PMMA-based colloidal crystal template. The
   hydroxide-containing monomer and dicationic crosslinker are synthesized
   from their chloride precursors, avoiding the ion-exchange step which
   causes shrinkage of the pores. An analysis of different methods for
   infiltrating the monomer solution into the colloidal crystal template
   shows that infiltration using capillary forces leads to fewer defects
   than infiltration under a partial vacuum. In addition, functional
   macroporous films with micrometer thickness are prepared from a template
   of PS-based colloidal crystals in a thin film. In general, the colloidal
   crystal templated materials showed improved CO2 absorption/desorption
   rates and swing sizes compared to a commercially available material with
   similar functional groups. This work could easily be extended to create
   a new generation of ordered macroporous polymeric materials with tunable
   functionalities for other applications.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the United States, as elsewhere, state and federal governments have
   considered or implemented a range of policies to create more sustainable
   energy generation systems in response to concerns over climate change,
   security of fuel supply, and environmental impacts. These policies
   include both regulatory instruments such as renewable portfolio
   standards (RPSs) and market incentives such as tax credits. While these
   policies are primarily geared towards increasing renewable generation
   capacity, they can indirectly affect innovation in associated
   technologies through a `demand-pull' dynamic. Other policies, such as
   public research and development (R\&D) funding, directly incentivize
   innovation through `technology-push' means. In this letter, we examine
   these effects on innovation in the United States wind energy industry.
   We estimate a set of econometric models relating a set of US federal and
   state policies to patenting activity in wind technologies over the
   period 1974-2009. We find that RPS policies have had significant
   positive effects on wind innovation, whereas tax-based incentives have
   not been particularly effective. We also find evidence that the effects
   of RPS incentives differ between states. Finally, we find that public
   R\&D funding can be a significant driver of wind innovation, though its
   effect in the US has been modest.}},

Title = {{Towards automated appliance recognition using an EMF sensor in NILM
   platforms}},

Abstract = {{Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been studied for a few decades
   now as a method of disaggregating information about appliance level
   power consumption in a building from aggregate measurements of voltage
   and/or current obtained at a centralized location in the electrical
   system. When such information is provided to the electricity consumer as
   feedback, they can then take the necessary steps to modify their
   behavior and conserve electricity. Research has shown potential for
   savings of up to 20\% through this kind of feedback. The training phase
   required to allow the algorithms to recognize appliances in the home at
   the beginning of a NILM setup is a big hindrance to wide adoption of the
   technique. One of the recent advances in this research area includes the
   addition of an Electro-Magnetic Field (EMF) sensor that measures the
   electric and magnetic field nearby an appliance to detect its
   operational state. This information, when coupled with the aggregate
   power consumption data for the home, can help to train a NILM system,
   which is a significant step forward in automating the training phase.
   This paper explores the theory behind the operation of the EMF sensor
   and discusses the feasibility of automating the training and
   classification process using these devices. A case study is presented,
   where magnetic field measurements of eight appliances are analyzed to
   determine the viability of using these signals alone to determine the
   type of appliance that the EMF sensor has been placed next to. Various
   dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the collected data,
   and the resulting feature vectors are used to train a variety of common
   machine learning classifiers. A vector subspace obtained using
   Independent Component Analysis (ICA), along with a k-NN classifier, was
   found to perform best among the different alternatives explored.
   Possible reasons behind the findings are discussed and areas for further
   exploration are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for
   more than 15\% of the total energy consumption in the US. In order to
   improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems, researchers have
   developed hundreds of algorithms to automatically analyze their
   performance. However, the complex information, such as configurations of
   HVAC systems, layouts and materials of building elements and dynamic
   data from the control systems, required by these algorithms inhibits the
   process of deploying them in real-world facilities. To address this
   challenge, we envision a framework that automatically integrates the
   required information items and provides them to the performance analysis
   algorithms for HVAC systems. This paper presents an approach to identify
   and document the information requirements from the publications that
   describe these algorithms. We extend the Information Delivery Manual
   (IDM) approach so that the identified information requirements can be
   mapped to multiple information sources that use various formats and
   schemas. This paper presents the extensions to the IDM approach and the
   results of using it to identify information requirements for performance
   analysis algorithms of HVAC systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We report a three-dimensional (3D), pore-scale analysis of morphological
   and transport properties for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)
   catalyst layer. The 3D structure of the platinum/carbon/Nafion electrode
   was obtained using nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography
   (nano-CT). The 3D nano-CT data was analyzed according to several
   morphological characteristics, with particular focus on various
   effective pore diameters used in modeling gas diffusion in the Knudsen
   transition regime, which is prevalent in PEFC catalyst layers. The pore
   diameter metrics include those based on chord length distributions,
   inscribed spheres, and surface area. Those pore diameter statistics are
   evaluated against computational pore-scale diffusion simulations with
   local gas diffusion coefficients determined from the local pore size
   according to the Bosanquet formulation. According to our comparison,
   simulations that use local pore diameters defined by inscribed spheres
   provide effective diffusion coefficients that are consistent with
   chord-length based estimations for an effective Knudsen length scale. By
   evaluating transport rates in regions of varying porosity within the
   nano-CT data, we identified a Bruggeman correction scaling factor for
   the effective diffusivity.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{68-74}},

Abstract = {{Amine solvents are of great interest for post-combustion CO2 capture
   applications. Although the development of new solvents is predominantly
   conducted at the laboratory scale, the ability to assess the performance
   of newly developed solvents at the process scale is crucial to
   identifying the best solvents for CO2 capture. In this work we present a
   methodology to evaluate and objectively compare the process performance
   of different solvents. We use Aspen Plus, with the electrolyte-NRTL
   thermodynamic model for the solvent CO2 interactions, coupled with a
   multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization to determine the best
   process design and operating conditions for each solvent. This ensures
   that the processes utilized for the comparison are those which are best
   suited for the specific solvent. We evaluate and compare the process
   performance of monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and
   2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) in a 90\% CO2 capture process from a
   550 MW coal fired power plant. From our analysis the best process
   specifications are amine specific and with those specific, optimized
   specifications DEA has the potential to be a better performing solvent
   than MEA, with a lower energy penalty and lower capital cost investment.

Abstract = {{Reducing energy consumption in multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs)
   where communication happens via the network-on-chip (NoC) approach calls
   for multiple voltage/frequency island (VFI)-based designs. In turn, such
   multi-VFI architectures need efficient, robust, and accurate runtime
   control mechanisms that can exploit the workload characteristics in
   order to save power. Despite being tractable, the linear control models
   for power management cannot capture some important workload
   characteristics (e. g., fractality, nonstationarity) observed in
   heterogeneous NoCs; if ignored, such characteristics lead to inefficient
   communication and resources allocation, as well as high power
   dissipation in MPSoCs. To mitigate such limitations, we propose a new
   paradigm shift from power optimization based on linear models to control
   approaches based on fractal-state equations. As such, our approach is
   the first to propose a controller for fractal workloads with precise
   constraints on state and control variables and specific time bounds. Our
   results show that significant power savings can be achieved at runtime

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented to calculate the TCC (total combined cost) of
   water sourcing, water treatment and condenser fouling in the
   recirculating cooling systems of thermoelectric power plants. The
   methodology is employed to evaluate the economic viability of using
   treated MWW (municipal wastewater) to replace the use of freshwater as
   makeup water to power plant cooling systems. Cost analyses are presented
   for a reference power plant and five different tertiary treatment
   scenarios to reduce the scaling tendencies of MWW. Results indicate that
   a 550 MW sub-critical coal fired power plant with a makeup water
   requirement of 29.3 ML/day has a TCC of \$3.0-3.2 million/yr associated
   with the use of treated MWW for cooling. (All costs USD (United States
   dollars) 2009). This translates to a freshwater conservation cost of
   \$0.29/kL, which is considerably lower than that of dry air cooling
   technology, \$1.5/kL, as well as the 2020 conservation cost target set
   by the U.S. Department of Energy, \$0.74/kL. Results also show that if
   the available price of freshwater exceeds that of secondary-treated MWW
   by more than \$0.13-0.14/kL, it can be economically advantageous to
   purchase secondary MWW and treat it for utilization in the recirculating
   cooling system of a thermoelectric power plant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates how consumers make preference judgments when
   taking into account both product form and function. In prior work, where
   aesthetic preference is quantified using visual conjoint methods,
   aesthetic preference and functional preference were handled separately.
   Here, we introduce a new methodology, metaconjoint analysis, for testing
   the hypothesis that when consumers make decisions taking into account
   both a product's form and its function they employ a more complex
   decision-making strategy than when basing their decisions on form or
   function alone. We anticipate that this strategy will involve both
   analytical and emotional processes. When compared with participant
   ratings of form and function combinations across 28 subjects, the
   metaconjoint model is shown to have a correlation that was not
   statistically different from an additive model of form and function.
   However, unlike the additive model, the metaconjoint model gave
   additional information about how participants make tradeoffs between
   form and function. Next, we developed a novel paradigm using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine what parts of the brain
   are primarily involved with a given tradeoff between form and function.
   While in the scanner, study participants were asked to make decisions in
   trials where only form varied, where only function varied, and where
   both form and function varied. Results from 14 participants suggest that
   choices based on products that vary in both form and function involve
   some unique and some common brain networks as compared to choices based
   on form or function alone; notably, emotion-related regions are
   activated during these complex decisions where form and function are in
   conflict. These results are consistent with the inclusion of emotion in
   decision-making with regards to product choice and demonstrate the
   feasibility of using fMRI to address questions about the mental
   processes underlying consumer decisions. Studying preference decisions
   together with their accompanying neurological activity will give
   engineers and designers greater insight into the consumer
   decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{The atomic layer etching (ALET) of Al2O3 has been studied for possible
   application in precise etch control and low damage etching of the Al2O3
   layer for use as the interface passivation layer (IPL) between the
   high-k dielectric and the III-V compound semiconductors. Under the ALET
   condition, about 1 angstrom/cycle of Al2O3 corresponding to one
   monolayer per etch cycle and surface roughness similar to that of the
   reference, regardless of the number of etch cycles, were obtained.
   Therefore, etch depth could be controlled with atomic scale precision.
   In addition, during the ALET, the stoichiometry of Al2O3 and the Al/O
   ratio were maintained the same as those of the reference. Therefore, it
   is believed that the ALET of Al2O3 can reduce the plasma induced damage
   at the edge of an IPL because it can decrease the sidewall leakage by
   maintaining the stoichiometry of the sidewall Al2O3 surface, in addition
   to, precisely controlling the etch depth and minimizing the amount of
   substrate recess. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new framework to automate, augment, and accelerate steps in
   computer-aided molecular design is presented. The problem is tackled in
   three stages: (1) composition design, (2) structure determination, and
   (3) extended design. Composition identification and structure
   determination are decoupled to achieve computational efficiency. Using
   approximate group-contribution methods in the first stage, molecular
   compositions that fit design targets are identified. In the second
   stage, isomer structures of solution compositions are determined
   systematically, and structure-based property corrections are used to
   refine the solution pool. In the final stage, the design is extended
   beyond the scope of group-contribution methods by using problem-specific
   property models. At each design stage, novel optimization models and
   graph theoretic algorithms generate a large and diverse pool of
   candidates using an assortment of property models. The wide
   applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology
   are illustrated through three case studies. (c) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{The middle longitudinal fascicle (MdLF) was originally described in the
   monkey brain as a pathway that interconnects the superior temporal and
   angular gyri. Only recently have diffusion tensor imaging studies
   provided some evidence of its existence in humans, with a connectivity
   pattern similar to that in monkeys and a potential role in the language
   system. In this study, we combine high-angular-resolution fiber
   tractography and fiber microdissection techniques to determine the
   trajectory, cortical connectivity, and a quantitative analysis of the
   MdLF. Here, we analyze diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) studies in 6
   subjects (subject-specific approach) and in a template of 90 DSI studies
   (NTU-90 Atlas). Our tractography and microdissection results show that
   the human MdLF differs significantly from the monkey. Indeed, the human
   MdLF interconnects the superior temporal gyrus with the superior
   parietal lobule and parietooccipital region, and has only minor
   connections with the angular gyrus. On the basis of the roles of these
   interconnected cortical regions, we hypothesize that, rather than a
   language-related tract, the MdLF may contribute to the dorsal
   ``where{''} pathway of the auditory system.}},

Title = {{Effects on peptide binding affinity for TNF alpha, by PEGylation and

Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2968-2975}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Conjugation of cytokine-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to
   hyaluronic acid (HA) having M-w, of 1.6 MDa was previously shown to be
   an effective strategy for localized delivery to sites of inflammation.
   Despite the disparity in size of the mAb and HA, the mAb-HA conjugate
   was found bind tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) as strongly as
   the non-conjugated antibody, suggesting conjugation to this charged
   polysaccharide can provide an alternative to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   conjugation, which has been shown to reduce binding interactions for
   many proteins. To explore conjugation chemistries more systematically,
   we report a study on a model peptide inhibitor of tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha to investigate the effects of site-specific conjugation to
   HA and PEG. We compared the binding affinities of a variety of WP9QY
   peptide-polymer conjugates for TNF alpha in order to examine the effects
   of PEG molecular weight as well as the effects of PEG versus
   functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugation. The results indicate
   that the binding affinity of the PEG conjugates decreases in comparing
   PEG with mass 2 k, 10 k, and 30 k, which was attributed to PEG shrouding
   of the peptide, while conjugation to a 66 kDa HA chain preserved peptide
   binding affinity. We attribute this difference to the increased
   solubility of HA compared to PEG, potentially due to the carboxylic acid
   functional groups. In addition, the results demonstrate that conjugation
   to HA via a short PEG linker significantly enhances the association rate
   k(on),which may reflect an increased peptide accessibility. By balancing
   both the advantages associated with the PEG conjugates and with the HA
   conjugates, the HA-PEG2k-WP9QY conjugate was able to improve the binding
   affinity of the peptide for TNF alpha by a factor of two. Optimization
   of polymer chemistry could be used to improve delivery of protein
   therapeutics for localized and systemic administration. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In contrast to the numerous research works that integrate a niching
   scheme with an existing single-objective evolutionary algorithm to
   perform multimodal optimization, a few approaches have recently been
   taken to recast multimodal optimization as a multiobjective optimization
   problem to be solved by modified multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.
   Following this promising avenue of research, we propose a novel
   biobjective formulation of the multimodal optimization problem and use
   differential evolution (DE) with nondominated sorting followed by
   hypervolume measure-based sorting to finally detect a set of solutions
   corresponding to multiple global and local optima of the function under
   test. Unlike the two earlier multiobjective approaches (biobjective
   multipopulation genetic algorithm and niching-based nondominated sorting
   genetic algorithm II), the proposed multimodal optimization with
   biobjective DE (MOBiDE) algorithm does not require the actual or
   estimated gradient of the multimodal function to form its second
   objective. Performance of MOBiDE is compared with eight state-of-the-art
   single-objective niching algorithms and two recently developed
   biobjective niching algorithms using a test suite of 14 basic and 15
   composite multimodal problems. Experimental results supported by
   nonparametric statistical tests suggest that MOBiDE is able to provide
   better and more consistent performance over the existing well-known
   multimodal algorithms for majority of the test problems without
   incurring any serious computational burden.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a 3-D localization method for a magnetically
   actuated soft capsule endoscope (MASCE). The proposed localization
   scheme consists of three steps. First, MASCE is oriented to be coaxially
   aligned with an external permanent magnet (EPM). Second, MASCE is
   axially contracted by the enhanced magnetic attraction of the
   approaching EPM. Third, MASCE recovers its initial shape by the
   retracting EPM as the magnetic attraction weakens. The combination of
   the estimated direction in the coaxial alignment step and the estimated
   distance in the shape deformation (recovery) step provides the position
   of MASCE in 3-D. It is experimentally shown that the proposed
   localization method could provide 2.0-3.7 mm of distance error in 3-D.
   This study also introduces two new applications of the proposed
   localization method. First, based on the trace of contact points between
   the MASCE and the surface of the stomach, the 3-D geometrical model of a

Abstract = {{Sharp dynamic thermal gradient (delta T approximate to 45 degrees C

   (c-BCP) films filled with PS-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs; d(NP)

   influence of increasing AuNP loading fraction on dispersion and assembly
   of AuNPs within c-BCP (PS-PMMA) films is investigated via both static
   and dynamic thermal gradient fields. With phi(NP)increasing, a sharp
   transition from vertical to random in-plane horizontal cylinder
   orientation is observed due to enrichment of AuNPs at the substrate side
   and favorable interaction of PMMA chains with gold cores. Furthermore, a
   detachable capping elastomer layer can self-align these random oriented

Abstract = {{In this review, we examine two new trait-based models of community
   assembly that predict the relative abundance of species from a regional
   species pool. The models use fundamentally different mathematical
   approaches and the predictions can differ considerably. Maxent obtains
   the most even probability distribution subject to community-weighted
   mean trait constraints. Traitspace predicts low probabilities for any
   species whose trait distribution does not pass through the environmental
   filter. Neither model maximizes functional diversity because of the
   emphasis on environmental filtering over limiting similarity. Traitspace
   can test for the effects of limiting similarity by explicitly
   incorporating intraspecific trait variation. The range of solutions in
   both models could be used to define the range of natural variability of
   community composition in restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Appropriate choice of Fontan pathway requires keen
   preoperative examination of angiographic anatomy. We hypothesize that
   surgical choices may be better informed by lessons learned from
   postoperative hemodynamic evaluation in different Fontan connection
   strategies.
   Methods. High-performance computational fluid dynamics is employed to
   evaluate hemodynamics in five unique Fontan anatomies. Our cohort
   included one lateral tunnel, extracardiac conduit, intraatrial conduit,
   intra/extracardiac conduit, and direct cavopulmonary connection (DCPC)
   Fontan pathway. Theoretical cardiac cycle-averaged power loss (E-loss)
   and hepatic flow distribution (HFD) were compared after modeling
   identical physiologic pulsatile caval flow and time-resolved pulmonary
   artery flow distribution. The E-loss was also evaluated at instants of
   peak inferior vena cava flow and peak superior vena cava flow to study
   caval anastomosis shape sensitivity on hemodynamics.
   Results. Quantitative examination of E-loss and HFD revealed minimum
   cycle-averaged E-loss in the extracardiac conduit Fontan; however, at
   the cost of the poorest HFD (left pulmonary artery/right pulmonary
   artery {[}84.5\%/15.5\%). In contrast, DCPC Fontan was found to have the
   best trade-off between mean E-loss (5.87 mW, 2.44\%) and HFD (left
   pulmonary artery/right pulmonary artery {[}38.9\%/61.1\%). Except for
   intraatrial conduit, the instantaneous superior vena cava and inferior
   vena cava peak flow E-loss exceeded the cycle average E-loss. The peak
   inferior vena cava flow E-loss of DCPC Fontan nearly equaled its
   cycle-averaged Eloss (w5.69 mW).
   Conclusions. Considering cycle-averaged E-loss, HFD, and peak inferior
   vena cava flow E-loss, DCPC had the best hemodynamic performance.
   Intraatrial conduit Fontan is an efficient modification of lateral
   tunnel Fontan that offers possibility for excellent streamlining of
   inferior vena cava and superior vena cava with the pulmonary arteries.

Abstract = {{Neurons and other cells require intracellular transport of essential
   components for viability and function. Previous work has shown that
   while net amyloid precursor protein (APP) transport is generally
   anterograde, individual vesicles containing APP move bi-directionally.
   This discrepancy highlights our poor understanding of the in vivo
   regulation of APP-vesicle transport. Here, we show that reduction of
   presenilin (PS) or suppression of gamma-secretase activity substantially
   increases anterograde and retrograde velocities for APP vesicles.
   Strikingly, PS deficiency has no effect on an unrelated cargo vesicle
   class containing synaptotagmin, which is powered by a different kinesin
   motor. Increased velocities caused by PS or gamma-secretase reduction
   require functional kinesin-1 and dynein motors. Together, our findings
   suggest that a normal function of PS is to repress kinesin-1 and dynein
   motor activity during axonal transport of APP vesicles. Furthermore, our
   data suggest that axonal transport defects induced by loss of
   PS-mediated regulatory effects on APP-vesicle motility could be a major
   cause of neuronal and synaptic defects observed in Alzheimer's Disease
   (AD) pathogenesis. Thus, perturbations of APP/PS transport could
   contribute to early neuropathology observed in AD, and highlight a
   potential novel therapeutic pathway for early intervention, prior to
   neuronal loss and clinical manifestation of disease.}},

   model considers the coupled reactions of the reduction of silica, iron

Abstract = {{Recent observations suggest that increased silicon levels improve ladle
   desulfurization of aluminum-killed steel. A kinetic model was developed
   and presented in part I of this paper, demonstrating that increased
   silicon levels in steel suppress the consumption of aluminum by
   parasitic reactions like silica reduction and FeO/MnO reduction, thus
   making more aluminum available at the interface for desulfurization. The
   results are increases in the rate and the extent of desulfurization.
   Predictions were compared with laboratory induction furnace melts using
   1 kg of steel and 0.1 kg slag. The experimental results demonstrate the
   beneficial effect of silicon on the desulfurization reaction and that
   alumina can be reduced out of the slag and aluminum picked up by the
   steel, if the silicon content in the steel is high enough. The
   experimental results are in close agreement with the model predictions.
   Plant trials also show that with increased silicon content, both the
   rate and extent of desulfurization increase; incorporating silicon early
   into the ladle desulfurization process leads to considerable savings in
   aluminum consumption. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and

Abstract = {{Magnetoresistance having a field and current dependence like that of GMR
   (but a rather small magnitude) has been observed in Co70Fe30/GeTe and
   Co70Fe30/Ge2Sb2Te5 granular films. Film stacks were fabricated using
   tandem (multilayer) deposition and annealing was required for the films
   to develop the GMR-type response. This GMR-type behavior is distinct
   from AMR, which is observed before annealing. With films having the
   structure {[}CoFe 4 nm/GeTe 6 nm](10), a magnetoresistance (MR) of 0.19
   \%, which has the GMR-type character can be observed after an optimal
   annealing temperature of 450 A degrees C. TEM and X-ray reflectometry
   suggest that columnar granules with layered Fe form during deposition
   and with annealing. Magnetoresistive transport is believed to be between
   the discontinuous layers in each columnar grain. These discontinuous
   layers are observed to be superparamagnetic in SQUID ZFC-FC measurements
   measured from 5-300 K. Magnetoresistance can be fitted by the quadratic
   relation appropriate for GMR in granular films, especially at higher
   GeTe compositions. When Ge2Sb2Te5 is used instead of GeTe, higher anneal
   temperatures are required before the MR with GMR character appears. This
   GMR type response does not appear when pure Fe is used instead of the
   CoFe alloy, with the samples showing only AMR in this case. This is due
   to the absence of Co which seems to cause a more granular growth.}},

Abstract = {{The gas-particle partitioning of the primary organic aerosol (POA)
   emissions from fifty-one light-duty gasoline vehicles (model years
   1987-2012) was investigated at the California Air Resources Board
   Haagen-Smit Laboratory. Each vehicle was operated over the cold-start
   unified cycle on a chassis dynamometer and its emissions were sampled
   using a constant volume sampler. Four independent yet complementary
   approaches were used to investigate POA gas-particle partitioning:
   sampling artifact correction of quartz filter data, dilution from the
   constant volume sampler into a portable environmental chamber, heating
   in a thermodenuder, and thermal desorption/gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry analysis of quartz filter samples. This combination of
   techniques allowed gas-particle partitioning measurements to be made
   across a wide range of atmospherically relevant conditions -
   temperatures of 25-100 degrees C and organic aerosol concentrations of
   <1-600 mu g m(-3). The gas-particle partitioning of the POA emissions
   varied continuously over this entire range of conditions and essentially
   none of the POA should be considered non-volatile. Furthermore, for most
   vehicles, the low levels of dilution used in the constant volume sampler
   created particle mass concentrations that were greater than a factor of
   10 or higher than typical ambient levels. This resulted in large and
   systematic partitioning biases in the POA emission factors compared to
   more dilute atmospheric conditions, as the POA emission rates may be
   over-estimated by nearly a factor of four due to gas-particle
   partitioning at higher particle mass concentrations. A volatility
   distribution was derived to quantitatively describe the measured
   gas-particle partitioning data using absorptive partitioning theory.
   Although the POA emission factors varied by more than two orders of
   magnitude across the test fleet, the vehicle-to-vehicle differences in
   gas-particle partitioning were modest. Therefore, a single volatility
   distribution can be used to quantitatively describe the gas-particle
   partitioning of the entire test fleet. This distribution is designed to
   be applied to quartz filter POA emission factors in order to update
   emissions inventories for use in chemical transport models. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The removal of spatially correlated noise is an important step in
   processing multichannel recordings. Here, a technique termed the
   adaptive common average reference (ACAR) is presented as an effective
   and simple method for removing this noise. The ACAR is based on a
   combination of the well-known common average reference (CAR) and an
   adaptive noise canceling (ANC) filter. In a convergent process, the CAR
   provides a reference to an ANC filter, which in turn provides feedback
   to enhance the CAR. This method was effective on both simulated and real
   data, outperforming the standard CAR when the amplitude or polarity of
   the noise changes across channels. In many cases, the ACAR even
   outperformed independent component analysis. On 16 channels of simulated
   data, the ACAR was able to attenuate up to approximately 290 dB of noise
   and could improve signal quality if the original SNR was as high as 5
   dB. With an original SNR of 0 dB, the ACAR improved signal quality with
   only two data channels and performance improved as the number of
   channels increased. It also performed well under many different
   conditions for the structure of the noise and signals. Analysis of
   contaminated electrocorticographic recordings further showed the
   effectiveness of the ACAR.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional die-stacking architectures have been proposed as a
   promising solution to the increasing interconnect delay that is observed
   in scaled technologies. Although prior research has extensively
   evaluated the performance advantage of moving from a 2-D to a 3-D design
   style, the impact of process parameter variations on 3-D designs has not
   been studied in detail. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by
   proposing a variability-aware design framework for fully synchronous
   (FS) and multiple clock-domain (MCD) 3-D systems. To mitigate the impact
   of process variations on 3-D designs, we propose the variability-aware
   3-D integration strategy for MCD 3-D systems that maximizes the
   probability of the design meeting specified system performance
   constraints. The proposed optimization strategy is shown to
   significantly outperform the FS and MCD 3-D implementations that are
   conventionally assembled, for example, the MCD designs assembled with
   the proposed integration strategy provide, on average, 44\% and 16.33\%
   higher absolute yield than the FS and conventional MCD designs,
   respectively, at the 50\% yield point of the conventional MCD designs.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for the simulation of dynamic electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD) patterns is introduced. The computational approach
   merges deterministic dynamic electron-scattering computations based on
   Bloch waves with a stochastic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the energy,
   depth, and directional distributions of the backscattered electrons
   (BSEs). An efficient numerical scheme is introduced, based on a modified
   Lambert projection, for the computation of the scintillator electron
   count as a function of the position and orientation of the EBSD
   detector; the approach allows for the rapid computation of an individual
   EBSD pattern by bi-linear interpolation of a master EBSD pattern. The
   master pattern stores the BSE yield as a function of the electron exit
   direction and exit energy and is used along with weight factors
   extracted from the MC simulation to obtain energy-weighted simulated
   EBSD patterns. Example simulations for nickel yield realistic patterns
   and energy-dependent trends in pattern blurring versus filter window
   energies are in agreement with experimental energy-filtered EBSD
   observations reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The governing parameters controlling the glass transition temperature of
   polymer-grafted particle systems are analyzed for the particular case of
   polystyrene (PS)-grafted silica colloids in the dense grafting limit. At
   a given degree of polymerization of surface-grafted chains the glass
   transition temperature is found to increase as compared to linear chain
   polymers of equivalent degree of polymerization. The difference in the
   glass transition temperature between polymer-grafted particle systems
   and their respective linear polymer analogs increases with decreasing
   degree of polymerization of surface-grafted chains and levels off at
   similar plateau values for particle brushes of distinct particle core
   size. The trend toward increased glass transition temperature is
   interpreted as a consequence of the increased steric hindrance in
   polymer-grafted particles that counteracts the relaxation of
   surface-grafted polymer chains. The increase in glass transition
   temperature is shown to be approximately consistent with the chain
   conformational regimes that are predicted on the basis of a Daoud-Cotton

Abstract = {{Polymer-based protein engineering (PBPE) offers an attractive method to
   predictably modify and enhance enzyme structure and function. Using
   polymers that respond to stimuli such as temperature and pH, enzyme
   activity and stability can be predictably modified without a dependence
   on molecular biology. Herein, we demonstrate that temperature responsive
   enzyme-polymer conjugates show increased stability while retaining
   bioactivity and substrate affinity. The bioconjugates were synthesized
   using a ``grafting from{''} approach, where polymers were grown from a
   novel water-soluble initiator on the surface of a protein using atom
   transfer radical polymerization. Prior to polymer synthesis, the
   polymerization initiating molecule was covalently attached to surface
   accessible primary amines (lysine, N-terminal) of chymotrypsin, forming
   a macroinitiator. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and
   poly{[}N,N'-dimethyl(methacryloylethyl) ammonium propane sulfonate] were
   grown separately from the initiator modified chymotrypsin. Both polymers
   were selected because of their temperature-dependent conformations. We
   observed that the enzyme-polymer conjugates retained
   temperature-dependent changes in conformation while still maintaining
   enzyme function. The conjugates exhibited dramatic increases in enzyme
   stability over a wide range of temperatures. We can now predictably
   manipulate enzyme kinetics and stability using polymer-based protein
   engineering without the need for molecular biology dependent
   mutagenesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was developed to simulate ammonia stripping in wet
   recirculating cooling systems. The model can be used to predict ammonia
   concentration in cooling systems using makeup water containing ammonia,
   such as secondary treated municipal wastewater (MWW). The model revealed
   that ammonia stripping in a cooling system is a function of makeup water
   quality, pH, and air and water flow rates in the cooling tower.
   Pilot-scale cooling towers designed and constructed previously for the
   investigation of biofouling, scaling, and corrosion issues in the reuse
   of treated MWW for cooling were used in this study for model
   verification. Data from pilot-scale testing using a particular
   ammonia-containing makeup water were used to calibrate the model. The
   overall mass transfer coefficient based on gas film for ammonia
   stripping in the cooling tower was found to be 2.3 x 10(-3) m/s.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that even under only slightly alkaline
   conditions (pH 8), a significant portion of ammonia can be removed
   through water-to-air stripping, which is consistent with low ammonia
   measurements in cooling towers reported in the literature. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient and novel geometric flow-driven method
   for mesh optimization of multicomponent tetrahedral meshes with
   non-manifold boundaries. The presented method is composed of geometric
   optimization and topological transformation techniques, so that both
   location and topology of mesh vertices are optimized. Due to the
   complexity of non-manifold boundaries, we categorize the boundary
   vertices into three groups: surface vertices, curve vertices, and fixed
   vertices. Each group of boundary vertices is modified by different
   shape-preserving geometric flows in order to smooth and regularize
   boundary meshes. Meanwhile, all vertices are relocated by minimizing an
   energy functional which is relevant to the quality measure of
   tetrahedra. In addition, face-swapping and edge-removal operations are
   employed to eliminate poorly-shaped elements. Finally, the performance
   of our method is compared with a state of the art technique, named
   Stellar, for a dozen single-component meshes. We obtain similar or even
   better results with much less running time. Moreover, we validate the
   presented method on several multi-component tetrahedral meshes, and the
   results demonstrate that the mesh quality is improved significantly. (C)

Abstract = {{Properties of complex oxide thin films can be tuned over a range of
   values as a function of mismatch, composition, orientation, and
   structure. Here, we report a strategy for growing structured epitaxial
   thermoelectric thin films leading to improved Seebeck coefficient.
   Instead of using single-crystal sapphire substrates to support epitaxial
   growth, Ca3Co4O9 films are deposited, using the Pulsed Laser Deposition
   technique, onto Al2O3 polycrystalline substrates textured by spark
   plasma sintering. The structural quality of the 2000 angstrom thin film
   was investigated by transmission electron microscopy, while the
   crystallographic orientation of the grains and the epitaxial
   relationships were determined by electron backscatter diffraction. The
   use of a polycrystalline ceramic template leads to structured films that
   are in good local epitaxial registry. The Seebeck coefficient is about
   170 mu/K at 300 K, a typical value of misfit material with low carrier
   density. This high-throughput process, called combinatorial substrate
   epitaxy, appears to facilitate the rational tuning of functional oxide
   films, opening a route to the epitaxial synthesis of high quality
   complex oxides. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   the heat flux vector, we use a recently derived constitutive equation

   gradient, the density gradient, and the velocity gradient in an
   appropriate frame invariant formulation. We use two different boundary
   conditions at the inclined surface: a constant temperature boundary
   condition and an adiabatic condition. A parametric study is performed to
   examine the effects of the material dimensionless parameters. The
   derived governing equations are coupled nonlinear second-order ordinary
   differential equations, which are solved numerically, and the results
   are shown for the temperature, volume fraction, and velocity profiles.

   faults were 8H Shockley-type faults. The Burgers vector of the

   nucleate within the epilayer at early stages of growth. Defect
   nucleation is directly correlated with high initial growth rate and is
   not related to any defects/heterogeneities in the substrate or epilayer.

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict the energy
   accommodation coefficients (EACs) between the noble gases He, Ne, and Ar
   and the outside of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with diameters
   between 0.41 and 6.10 nm at a temperature of 300 K. The EAC increases
   monotonically with CNT diameter and approaches the value predicted for
   graphene. The EAC also increases monotonically with gas atom mass. The
   CNT EAC data collapse to a linear trend when they are normalized by the
   graphene EAC and plotted versus the depth of their potential energy well
   on the CNT normalized by that for graphene. The EACs are used to
   estimate that the thermal boundary conductance between noble gases and
   graphene will be of order 0.1 MW/m(2).K at a gas pressure of 1 atm,
   corresponding to a gas Kapitza length of order 100 nm.}},

Abstract = {{The feeling of being observed or merely participating in an experiment
   can affect individuals' behavior. Referred to as the Hawthorne effect,
   this inconsistently observed phenomenon can both provide insight into
   individuals' behavior and confound the interpretation of experimental
   manipulations. Here, we pursue both topics in examining how the
   Hawthorne effect emerges in a large field experiment focused on
   residential consumers' electricity use. These consumers received five
   postcards notifying, and then reminding, them of their participation in
   a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne
   (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity
   use-even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives
   to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect
   reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with
   that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention
   ended.}},

Title = {{A small-scale flow-through column system to determine the rates of
   mineral dissolution at high temperature and pressure}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{354}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Mineral dissolution is a critical phenomenon in many geochemical
   systems, including those of geologic CO2 storage. It affects the
   mobilization, fate and transport of toxic metals in subsurface waters. A
   small-scale plug-flow system was designed and demonstrated for use in
   determining dissolution rates and simulating mineral-water interactions
   under awide range of conditions, including high pressure (P, up to 300
   bar) and temperature (T, up to 120 degrees C). The system enables rapid
   achievement of steady-state rates, and minimizes the experimental time
   to study suchmineral-water systems. The performance of the systemwas
   evaluated through study of the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite
   (FeAsS (s)). Rates of arsenic release induced by dissolved Fe3+ (10(-4)
   M) in anoxic systems at 25 degrees C and pressures of 1 bar and 100 bar
   were measured. The performance testing confirmed the ability to obtain
   reproducible results under the wide range of conditions tested, and to
   obtain similar results to certain benchmark cases, e. g., the FeAsS (s)
   dissolution rate of 10(-8.09) mol As/m(2) s at 25 degrees Cand 1 bar was
   comparable to previously reported values. Potentialmass-transfer
   limitations associatedwith the system were studied and results indicate
   such limitations can be avoided at flow-rates higher than 0.8 mL/min.

Abstract = {{Motivation: Evaluation of previous systems for automated determination
   of subcellular location from microscope images has been done using
   datasets in which each location class consisted of multiple images of
   the same representative protein. Here, we frame a more challenging and
   useful problem where previously unseen proteins are to be classified.
   Results: Using CD-tagging, we generated two new image datasets for
   evaluation of this problem, which contain several different proteins for
   each location class. Evaluation of previous methods on these new
   datasets showed that it is much harder to train a classifier that
   generalizes across different proteins than one that simply recognizes a
   protein it was trained on.
   We therefore developed and evaluated additional approaches,
   incorporating novel modifications of local features techniques. These
   extended the notion of local features to exploit both the protein image
   and any reference markers that were imaged in parallel. With these, we
   obtained a large accuracy improvement in our new datasets over existing
   methods. Additionally, these features help achieve classification
   improvements for other previously studied datasets.}},

   by Papoulias and Grossmann (1983). It is supplemented with a set of
   logical relationships related to the relative position of the inlet
   temperatures of process streams and the dynamic temperature intervals.
   In the extreme situation of fixed inlet and outlet temperatures, the
   model reduces to the ``transshipment model{''}. Several examples with

   increase in resistivity at a width of similar to 15 nm, relative to the
   thin film resistivity (i.e., an infinitely wide wire). The observed

Abstract = {{The measurement of Water-Soluble Organic Carbon (WSOC) in atmospheric
   aerosol is usually carried out by sample collection on filters,
   extraction in ultrapure water, filtration, and measurement of the total
   organic carbon. This paper investigates the role of different conditions
   of sampling and extraction as well as the range of solubilities of the
   organic compounds that contribute to the WSOC. The sampling and
   extraction of WSOC can be described by a single parameter, P, expressing
   the ratio of water used per volume of air sampled on the analyzed
   filter. Two cases are examined in order to bound the range of
   interactions of the various organic aerosol components with each other.
   In the first we assume that the organic species form an ideal solution
   in the particle and in the second that the extraction of a single
   compound is independent of the presence of the other organics. The ideal
   organic solution model predicts that species With water solubility as
   low as 10(-4) g L-1 contribute to the measured WSOC. In the other end,
   the independent compounds model predicts that low-solubility (as low as
   10(-7) g L-1) compounds are part of the WSOC. Studies of the WSOC
   composition are consistent with the predictions of the ideal organic
   solution model. A value of P = 0.1 cm(3) m(-3) is proposed for the
   extraction of WSOC for typical organic aerosol concentrations (1-10 mu g
   m(-3)). WSOC measurements under high concentration conditions often used
   during source sampling will tend to give low WSOC values unless higher P
   values are used.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADHESION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{1921-1932}},

Abstract = {{Geckos exhibit a unique ability to adhere repeatedly and reversibly to a
   variety of surfaces. Considerable scientific and engineering efforts
   over the last decade have produced gecko-inspired adhesives which can
   outperform the gecko in some regards. However, the best results come
   from adhesives which are difficult to mass-produce, or degrade through
   repeated use. Here, we propose a method for fabricating
   micrometer-scale, gecko-inspired adhesive structures with mushroom tips
   in densely packed arrays using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and soft
   mold replication. We use xenon difluoride etching to release the cured
   polymer structures from the DRIE-processed silicon wafer, and soft mold
   replication to avoid surface fluorination in the final adhesive patches.
   The patterned adhesives exhibit more than an order of magnitude increase
   in pull-off force compared to an unstructured, flat control sample. More
   importantly, the adhesives' structures retain 80\% of their original
   attachment strength through repeated use, even after 1000 contact
   cycles. To investigate the importance of three parameters described in
   theoretical works, we characterize the effect of boundary conditions on
   friction, the effect of backing layer on pull-off force, and the effect
   of retraction speed on pull-off force. Our fabrication approach could be
   used to mass produce wafer-size patches of structured adhesive that
   exhibit higher repeatability and the utilized experimental adhesive
   characterization methods will allow better optimization of future
   gecko-inspired adhesive designs.}},

Title = {{Greedy Feature Selection for Subspace Clustering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{2487-2517}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Unions of subspaces provide a powerful generalization of single subspace
   models for collections of high-dimensional data; however, learning
   multiple subspaces from data is challenging due to the fact that
   segmentation-the identification of points that live in the same
   subspace-and subspace estimation must be performed simultaneously.
   Recently, sparse recovery methods were shown to provide a provable and
   robust strategy for exact feature selection (EFS)-recovering subsets of
   points from the ensemble that live in the same subspace. In parallel
   with recent studies of EFS with l(1)-minimization, in this paper, we
   develop sufficient conditions for EFS with a greedy method for sparse
   signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Following
   our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection
   strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize
   the gap between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based
   approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods
   provide significant advantages over NN methods and that the gap between
   the two approaches is particularly pronounced when the sampling of
   subspaces in the data set is sparse. Our results suggest that OMP may be
   employed to reliably recover exact feature sets in a number of regimes
   where NN approaches fail to reveal the subspace membership of points in
   the ensemble.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal properties and transport control are important for many
   applications, for example, low thermal conductivity is desirable for
   thermoelectrics. Knowledge of mode-wise phonon properties is crucial to
   identify dominant phonon modes for thermal transport and to design
   effective phonon barriers for thermal transport control. In this paper,
   we adopt time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD) normal-mode analyses
   to investigate mode-wise phonon properties and to calculate phonon
   dispersion relations and phonon relaxation times in bismuth telluride.
   Our simulation results agree with the previously reported data obtained
   from ultrafast time-resolved measurements. By combining
   frequency-dependent anharmonic phonon group velocities and lifetimes,
   mode-wise thermal conductivities are predicted to reveal the
   contributions of heat carriers with different wavelengths and
   polarizations.}},

Abstract = {{Risk communications aim to affect recipients' understanding of specific
   risks, their trust and liking of the materials, affective responses, and
   associated behaviors. We developed communications about the number of
   construction workers expected to get hurt if building were permitted at
   the former Fort Ord weapons training site in California, despite its
   contamination with unexploded ordnance (UXO). We created eight versions,
   which presented text only or bar graph with text, the numerator of the
   risk (the number of workers expected to be hurt) with or without
   emphasis on the denominator (the total number of workers), and
   uncertainty information (the probability that different numbers of
   workers would be hurt) or not. Recipients varied in numeracy. We
   examined the effect of these communication features on recipients' (1)
   understanding, (2) trust and liking of the materials, (3) affective
   responses, and (4) support for construction and for construction workers
   if construction were to be implemented. Low-numerate individuals showed
   less understanding across all versions of the communication, yet
   preferred graph-with-text displays relatively more than text-only
   displays as compared to high-numerate individuals. Emphasizing the
   denominator increased understanding of text-only displays but decreased
   support for construction and construction workers for all communication
   versions. Moreover, recipients were more supportive of construction and
   construction workers after receiving text-only displays without
   uncertainty information or graph-with-text displays with uncertainty
   information, seemingly due to communications with those features being
   trusted and liked more. We discuss the implications for communicating
   risks in general and for communicating UXO-related risks to the
   community surrounding Fort Ord.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced (or engineered) geothermal systems (EGS) for generating
   electricity may provide significant reductions in greenhouse gas
   emissions, if they can be successfully sited. One potential threat to
   that siting is induced seismicity, which has led to EGS projects being
   stopped in Switzerland and Germany. We create and implement a framework
   for identifying regions with low risk of induced seismicity risk. Using
   a widely known and used model with high spatial resolution, we find
   that, to a first approximation, 60\% of the best areas for EGS plants
   based on purely geological considerations meet this standard. Taking
   advantage of this potential requires two next steps in these regions.
   One is using the best available tools for local modeling of triggered
   seismicity, rather than the first-order national model used here. The
   second is creating a viable social process for securing the informed
   consent of local communities.}},

   finite Peclet number}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{731}},
Pages = {{64+}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The role of neutral solute advection on the diffusiophoretic motion of
   colloidal particles is quantified. Theoretical analyses of this
   phenomenon usually assume that the solute concentration evolves solely
   via diffusion; that is, the Peclet number (Pe) for solute transport is
   identically zero. This leads to the conclusion that the translational
   diffusiophoretic velocity of a colloid is independent of its size,
   shape, and orientation with respect to the imposed solute gradient,
   provided that the colloid has uniform surface properties and that the
   length scale of interaction between the solute and the particle surface
   is much smaller than the particle size (Morrison, J. Colloid Interface
   Sci. vol. 34, 1970, p. 210). For a single spherical colloid, we show
   that the particle velocity decreases monotonically with increasing P e.
   Moreover, the solute concentration and fluid flow around the colloid
   become markedly fore-aft asymmetric as P e is increased. Next, an
   asymptotic expansion at small P e predicts that solute advection leads
   to relative phoretic motion between two identical spherical colloids,
   which ultimately align in a plane normal to the imposed gradient (there
   is no relative motion at Pe = 0). Finally, asymptotic analysis of the
   diffusiophoretic motion of a slightly non-spherical colloid at small P e
   demonstrates that advection leads to a shape-and orientation-dependent
   particle velocity, in contrast to the insensitivity of the velocity to
   shape and orientation at Pe = 0.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has gained widespread
   attention due to its ability to handle variable bounds and deal with
   multi-input, multi-output systems. However, it is susceptible to
   computational delay, especially when the solution time of the nonlinear
   programming (NLP) problem exceeds the sampling time. In this paper we
   propose a fast NMPC method based on NLP sensitivity, called
   advanced-multi-step NMPC (amsNMPC). Two variants of this method are
   developed, the parallel approach and the serial approach. For the
   amsNMPC method, NLP problems are solved in background multiple sampling
   times in advance, and manipulated variables are updated on-line when the
   actual states are available. We present case studies about a continuous
   stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a distillation column to show the
   performance of amsNMPC. Nominal stability properties are also analyzed.

Abstract = {{Grain size data were taken from four three- and two-dimensional
   microstructures, including simulated grain growth, thin film and
   superalloy data sets. Probability plots revealed approximately
   log-normal distributions for experimental grain size data sets, but with
   systematic differences in the upper tails. A simulated grain size data
   set obtained from Potts model growth exhibited strong deviation from
   log-normality. A peaks-over-threshold analysis was applied to quantify
   the differences in the upper tails. Potts model simulation of normal
   grain growth shows the shortest tail, whereas the thin film data showed
   the longest tail (i.e. closest to log-normal), with an intermediate tail
   shape in the superalloy. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{One size does not fit all: Averaged data on household electricity is
   inadequate for residential energy policy and decisions}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{132-144}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Residential electricity users need more detail than monthly bills to
   reduce consumption. With the emergence of technologies that provide
   detailed usage estimates for energy consumption, two questions arise.
   First, how many different energy-consuming appliances contribute to
   household electricity load, and secondly which appliances? Using
   national average penetration rates, the Residential Energy Consumption
   Survey (RECS), estimates that 42 unique appliances account for 93\% of
   electricity consumption, while 12 appliances account for 80\% of average
   household electric load. A typical scenario is developed from national
   and regional penetration rates and find that eight appliances are
   responsible for 80\% of a household's electric load in the United
   States. Four household scenarios are developed: a house that uses
   electric appliances, gas appliances, the average household, and typical
   household. It is concluded that RECS cannot be used as a representative
   household as it overestimates the number of appliances that contribute
   to a household electric load. The number of significant appliances is
   affected by appliance ownership and use, which is more variable between
   homes than between census divisions. These results can be used to design
   and maximize the value of residential energy information and management
   systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With urban space at a premium, roofs are being targeted as an
   opportunity to deploy sustainable energy technologies for buildings.
   This research evaluates the combination of green roofs and solar
   photovoltaics specifically through their temperature and electricity
   production relationship. Measurements over a one year study period from
   July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 from a large field project in Pittsburgh,
   Pennsylvania were used to determine the differences in power output from
   green and black roofs as well as to derive two regression functions for
   back-surface panel temperature and photovoltaic (PV) output. These
   estimation functions were applied to three different cities (San Diego,
   CA; Huntsville, AL; and Phoenix, AZ) chosen to represent a wide range of
   irradiance and temperature values. Based on the specific test-bed
   configuration, the green or black roof choice under the PV panels had
   little impact on the PV performance. The difference in magnitude of
   power generation for green roof-PV compared with black roof-PV
   assemblies was small (0.5\%) corresponding to an annual loss of \$9160
   panels in Pittsburgh and a benefit of approximately \$8/60 panels per
   year in Phoenix. Results also suggest that sites consistently above 25 C
   (77 F) will most likely see a small, positive impact from a green
   roof-PV combination. Building managers and designers should consider
   this temperature and power output interaction a minor economic factor in
   roof decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several judgment and decision-making tasks are assumed to involve memory

   underlying these tasks remain. In a study on 568 adults between 25 and
   80 years of age, hypotheses were tested on the specific relationships
   between individual differences in working memory, episodic memory, and
   semantic memory, respectively, and 6 main components of decision-making
   competence, In line with the hypotheses, working memory was positively
   related with the more cognitively demanding tasks (Resistance to
   Framing, Applying Decision Rules, and Under/Overconfidence), whereas
   episodic memory was positively associated with a more experience-based
   judgment task (Recognizing Social Norms). Furthermore, semantic memory
   was positively related with 2 more knowledge-based decision-making tasks
   (Consistency in Risk Perception and Resistance to Sunk Costs). Finally,
   the age-related decline observed in some of the decision-making tasks
   was (partially or totally) mediated by the age-related decline in
   working memory or episodic memory. These findings are discussed in
   relation to the functional roles fulfilled by different memory processes

Abstract = {{A large-stroke (8 mu m) parametric resonator excited by an in-plane
   `shaped-finger' electrostatic comb drive is fabricated using a 15 mu m
   thick silicon-on-insulator microelectromechanical systems (SOI-MEMS)

   The excitation of the nonlinear parametric resonance is realized by
   selecting an appropriate combination of the linear and cubic
   electrostatic stiffness coefficients through a specific varying-gap
   comb-finger design. The large-amplitude parametric resonance promotes
   high signal-to-noise ratio for potential use in sensitive chemical

Abstract = {{Nano and micromechanical switches are of great interest in applications
   that require high speed, low-power consumption and high electrical
   isolation. There is strong evidence that airborne hydrocarbon
   accumulation on the contact surfaces of the switch is a key cause for
   device failure. Relatively unexplored contact materials such as RuO2 are
   of interest because they are believed to be less prone to hydrocarbon
   deposit accumulation than more commonly used materials such as Pt and
   Au. Here, we measure the reliability of RuO2 and Pt-coated microswitches
   in hydrocarbon-rich environments with N-2 and N-2:O-2 background gases.
   The RuO2 material performs very poorly in contaminated N-2, but very
   well in contaminated N-2:O-2. Furthermore, RuO2 performs much better
   than Pt in the contaminated N-2:O-2. It is demonstrated that the
   deposit, initially being an insulator, can be electrically broken-down,
   thereby substantially lowering switch resistance. It is further shown
   that the passage of electrical current through the contacts augments
   deposit accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled
   trial tested two behavioral economics mechanisms (substitutability and
   delay discounting) to explain outcomes using contingency management (CM)
   for methamphetamine dependence. Frequency and purchase type
   (hedonic/utilitarian and consumable/durable) of CM payments were also
   examined. Methods: A total of 82 methamphetamine-dependent gay/bisexual
   men randomly assigned to conditions delivering CM received monetary
   vouchers in exchange for stimulant-negative urine samples in a 16-week
   trial requiring thrice weekly visits (Shoptaw et al., 2005). At any
   visit participants could redeem vouchers for goods. A time-lagged
   counting process Cox Proportional Hazards model for recurrent event
   survival analysis examined aspects of the frequency and type of these CM
   purchases. Results: After controlling for severity of baseline
   methamphetamine use and accumulated CM wealth, as measured by cumulative
   successful earning days, participants who redeemed CM earnings at any
   visit ({''}spenders{''}) were significantly more likely to produce
   stimulant-negative urine samples in the subsequent visit, compared with

   substitutability of CM purchases and explain trial outcomes as a
   function of frequency of CM purchases rather than frequency or
   accumulated total CM earnings. Promotion of frequent purchases in
   incentive-based programs should facilitate substitution for the
   perceived value of methamphetamine and improve abstinence outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a vector version of Witsenhausen's counterexample was
   considered and it was shown that in the asymptotic limit of infinite
   vector length, certain vector-quantization-based control strategies are
   provably within a constant factor of the asymptotically optimal cost for
   all possible problem parameters. While suggestive, a constant factor
   result for the finite-dimensional problem has remained elusive. In this
   paper, we provide a resolution to this issue. By applying a
   large-deviation ``sphere-packing{''} philosophy, we derive a lower bound
   to the optimal cost for the finite dimensional case that uses
   appropriate shadows of an existing vector lower bound that is the same
   for all dimensions. Using this new lower bound, we show that good
   lattice-quantization-based control strategies achieve within a constant
   factor of the optimal cost uniformly over all possible problem
   parameters, including the vector length. For Witsenhausen's original
   problem-which is the scalar case-the gap between regular
   lattice-quantization-based strategies and the lower bound is provably
   never more than a factor of 100, and computer calculations strongly
   suggest that the factor in fact may be no larger than 8. Finally, to
   obtain a numerical understanding of the possible room for improvement in
   costs using alternative strategies, we also include numerical comparison
   with strategies that are conjectured to be optimal. Using this
   comparison, we posit that there is more room for improvement in our
   lower bounds than in our upper bounds.}},

Title = {{Control of ventricular unloading using an electrocardiogram-synchronized
   Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Current pulsatile ventricular assist devices operate
   asynchronous with the left ventricle in fixed-rate or fill-to-empty
   modes because electrocardiogram-triggered modes have been abandoned. We
   hypothesize that varying the ejection delay in the synchronized mode
   yields more precise control of hemodynamics and left ventricular
   loading. This allows for a refined management that may be clinically
   beneficial.
   Methods: Eight sheep received a Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular
   assist device (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) via ventriculo-aortic
   cannulation. Left ventricular pressure and volume, aortic pressure,
   pulmonary flow, pump chamber pressure, and pump inflow and outflow were
   recorded. The pump was driven by a clinical pneumatic drive unit (Medos
   Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) synchronously with the native
   R-wave. The start of pump ejection was delayed between 0\% and 100\% of
   the cardiac period in 10\% increments. For each of these delays,
   hemodynamic variables were compared with baseline data using paired t
   tests.
   Results: The location of the minimum of stroke work was observed at a
   delay of 10\% (soon after aortic valve opening), resulting in a median
   of 43\% reduction in stroke work compared with baseline. Maximum stroke
   work occurred at a median delay of 70\% with a median stroke work
   increase of 11\% above baseline. Left ventricular volume unloading
   expressed by end-diastolic volume was most pronounced for copulsation
   (delay 0\%).
   Conclusions: The timing of pump ejection in synchronized mode yields
   control over left ventricular energetics and can be a method to achieve
   gradual reloading of a recoverable left ventricle. The traditionally
   suggested counterpulsation is not optimal in ventriculo-aortic
   cannulation when maximum unloading is desired.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete-continuous optimization problems are commonly modeled in
   algebraic form as mixed-integer linear or nonlinear programming models.
   Since these models can be formulated in different ways, leading either
   to solvable or nonsolvable problems, there is a need for a systematic
   modeling framework that provides a fundamental understanding on the
   nature of these models. This work presents a modeling framework,
   generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), which represents problems in
   terms of Boolean and continuous variables, allowing the representation
   of constraints as algebraic equations, disjunctions and logic
   propositions. An overview is provided of major research results that
   have emerged in this area. Basic concepts are emphasized as well as the
   major classes of formulations that can be derived. These are illustrated
   with a number of examples in the area of process systems engineering. As
   will be shown, GDP provides a structured way for systematically deriving
   mixed-integer optimization models that exhibit strong continuous
   relaxations, which often translates into shorter computational times.

Abstract = {{We investigate the connectivity of wireless sensor networks under the
   random pairwise key predistribution scheme of Chan et al. Under the
   assumption of full visibility, this reduces to studying the connectivity
   in the so-called random K-out graph; here, is the number of nodes and K
   < n is an integer parameter affecting the number of keys stored at each
   node. We show that if K >= 2(respectively, K = 1), the probability that
   H(n; K) is a connected graph approaches 1 (respectively, 0) as goes to
   infinity. For the one-law this is done by establishing an explicitly
   computable lower bound on the probability of connectivity. Using this
   bound, we see that with high probability, network connectivity can
   already be guaranteed (with K >= 2) by a relatively small number of
   sensors. This corrects earlier predictions made on the basis of a
   heuristic transfer of connectivity results available for Erdos-Renyi
   graphs.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to develop a robust method for human
   abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) centerline detection that can contribute
   to the accurate computation of features for the prediction of AAA
   rupture risk. A semiautomatic algorithm is proposed for detecting the
   lumen centerline in contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography
   images based on online adaboost classifiers, which does not require
   prior image segmentation. The algorithm was developed and applied to
   thirty ruptured and thirty unruptured AAA image data sets and the
   tortuosities of the detected centerline were measured to assess the
   correlation between AAA tortuosity and the binary ruptured and
   unruptured labels. The lumen of each data set was segmented manually by
   a trained radiologist and the resulting centerlines of each data set
   were defined as the gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of the
   algorithm and to compare it against two widely used segmentation
   techniques. The average mean relative accuracy of the offline adaboost
   classifier is 91.9\% with a standard deviation of 1.6\%; for the online
   adaboost classifier it is 93.6\% with a standard deviation of 1.9\%
   (p<0.05). The online adaboost classifier outperforms the offline
   adaboost classifier while their computational costs are similar.
   Aneurysm tortuosity computed from an accurately derived lumen centerline
   using online adaboost is statistically higher for ruptured aneurysms
   compared to unruptured aneurysms, indicating that tortuosity can be used
   to assess rupture risk in the vascular clinic. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published

Abstract = {{We describe a template-based framework to bind class-specific
   information to a set of image patterns and retrieve that information by
   matching the template to a query pattern of the same class. This is done
   by mapping the class-specific information to a set of spatial
   translations which are applied to the set of image patterns from which a
   template is designed, taking advantage of the properties of correlation
   filters. The bound information is retrieved during matching with an
   authentic query by estimating the spatial translations applied to the
   images that were used to design the template. In this paper, we focus on
   the problem of binding information to biometric signatures as an
   application of our framework. Our framework is flexible enough to allow
   spreading the information to be bound over multiple pattern classes
   which, in the context of biometric key-binding, enables multiclass and
   multimodal biometric key-binding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed scheme via extensive numerical results on multiple

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the fundamental concepts and the terminology of
   wetting. In particular, it focuses on high temperature wetting phenomena
   of primary interest to materials scientists. We have chosen to split
   this review into two sections: one related to macroscopic (continuum)
   definitions and the other to a microscopic (or atomistic) approach,
   where the role of chemistry and structure of interfaces and free
   surfaces on wetting phenomena are addressed. A great deal of attention
   has been placed on thermodynamics. This allows clarification of many
   important features, including the state of equilibrium between phases,
   the kinetics of equilibration, triple lines, hysteresis, adsorption
   (segregation) and the concept of complexions, intergranular films,
   prewetting, bulk phase transitions versus ``interface transitions{''},
   liquid versus solid wetting, and wetting versus dewetting.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A new high-order local Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) has been
   recently proposed for use on an artificial boundary for time-dependent
   elastic waves in unbounded domains, in two dimensions. It is based on
   the stress-velocity formulation of the elastodynamics problem, and on
   the general Complete Radiation Boundary Condition (CRBC) approach,
   originally devised by Hagstrom and Warburton in 2009. The work presented
   here is a sequel to previous work that concentrated on the stability of
   the scheme; this is the first known high-order ABC for elastodynamics
   which is long-time stable. Stability was established both theoretically
   and numerically. The present paper focuses on the accuracy of the
   scheme. In particular, two accuracy-related issues are investigated.
   First, the reflection coefficients associated with the new CRBC for
   different types of incident and reflected elastic waves are analyzed.
   Second, various choices of computational parameters for the CRBC, and
   their effect on the accuracy, are discussed. These choices include the
   optimal coefficients proposed by Hagstrom and Warburton for the acoustic
   case, and a simplified formula for these coefficients. A finite
   difference discretization is employed in space and time. Numerical
   examples are used to experiment with the scheme and demonstrate the
   above-mentioned accuracy issues.}},

Title = {{Two Independent Contributions to Step Variability during Over-Ground
   Human Walking}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Human walking exhibits small variations in both step length and step
   width, some of which may be related to active balance control. Lateral
   balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through
   adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater
   variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations
   are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to
   increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow
   and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should
   have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral
   balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by
   healthy young adults (N = 14, age < 40 yrs.). We found that slow
   fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3\% coefficient of
   variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59\%, P <
   0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5\%
   coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite
   precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over
   faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with
   variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P < 0.01) after
   accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified
   by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of
   lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in
   precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the
   variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to
   balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale
   into balance-and speed-related components. The separation of factors not
   related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical
   for the nervous system to control.}},

Abstract = {{Oxynitridation of Ge surfaces by nitric oxide (NO) is an important
   method to synthesize the gate dielectric for Ge-based microelectronics.
   Understanding the atomic processes of NO oxynitridation on Ge(100) is
   highly desirable to improve the N incorporation efficiency. Adsorption
   and dissociation of NO on Ge(100) were investigated on periodic models
   using DFT calculations. The nondissociative precursors can transform
   into various dissociative products, resulting in lowering the system
   energy as well as increasing the coordination numbers of N and O atoms.
   The transition state search shows that both monomeric and dimeric
   dissociative pathways are possible. The interdimer route for monomeric
   dissociation is unfavorable at low temperatures due to the relatively
   large barriers. In contrast, the intradimer dissociation is preferable
   due to the existence of an intermediate state, in which the N-O bond is
   significantly weakened. When a high concentration of NO molecules is
   adsorbed on Ge(100), three dimeric adsorption structures with two O
   atoms attached on surfaces are thermodynamically and kinetically
   favorable to form but difficult to dissociate even at room temperature.
   Their further release of N-2 at elevated temperatures would deteriorate
   the nitrogen incorporation ratio. Our results are useful for optimizing
   the oxynitridation of Ge(100) by nitric oxide.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the spatial relation between local Na+ and K+
   imbalances in the ischemic core in a rat model of focal ischemic stroke.
   Quantitative {[}Na+] and {[}K+] brain maps were obtained by Na-23 MRI
   and histochemical K+ staining, respectively, and calibrated by emission
   flame photometry of the micropunch brain samples. Stroke location was
   verified by diffusion MRI, by changes in tissue surface reflectivity and
   by immunohistochemistry with microtubule-associated protein 2 antibody.
   Na+ and K+ distribution within the ischemic core was inhomogeneous, with
   the maximum {[}Na+] increase and {[}K+] decrease typically observed in
   peripheral regions of the ischemic core. The pattern of the {[}K+]
   decrease matched the maximum rate of {[}Na+] increase ('slope'). Some
   residual mismatch between the sites of maximum Na+ and K+ imbalances was
   attributed to the different channels and pathways involved in transport
   of the two ions. A linear regression of the {[}Na+](br) vs. {[}K+](br)
   in the samples of ischemic brain indicates that for each K+ equivalent
   leaving ischemic tissue, 0.8 +/- 0.1 Eq, on average, of Na+ enter the
   tissue. Better understanding of the mechanistic link between the Na+
   influx and K+ egress would validate the Na-23 MRI slope as a candidate
   biomarker and a complementary tool for assessing ischemic damage and
   treatment planning. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{As members of a democratic society, individuals face complex decisions
   about whether to support climate change mitigation, vaccinations,
   genetically modified food, nanotechnology, geoengineering, and so on. To
   inform people's decisions and public debate, scientific experts at
   government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other
   organizations aim to provide understandable and scientifically accurate
   communication materials. Such communications aim to improve people's
   understanding of the decision-relevant issues, and if needed, promote
   behavior change. Unfortunately, existing communications sometimes fail
   when scientific experts lack information about what people need to know
   to make more informed decisions or what wording people use to describe
   relevant concepts. We provide an introduction for scientific experts
   about how to use mental models research with intended audience members
   to inform their communication efforts. Specifically, we describe how to
   conduct interviews to characterize people's decision-relevant beliefs or
   mental models of the topic under consideration, identify gaps and
   misconceptions in their knowledge, and reveal their preferred wording.
   We also describe methods for designing follow-up surveys with larger
   samples to examine the prevalence of beliefs as well as the
   relationships of beliefs with behaviors. Finally, we discuss how
   findings from these interviews and surveys can be used to design
   communications that effectively address gaps and misconceptions in
   people's mental models in wording that they understand. We present
   applications to different scientific domains, showing that this approach
   leads to communications that improve recipients' understanding and
   ability to make informed decisions.}},

Abstract = {{We study the biomechanical interactions between the lipid bilayer and
   the cytoskeleton in a red blood cell (RBC) by developing a general
   framework for mesoscopic simulations. We treated the lipid bilayer and
   the cytoskeleton as two distinct components and developed a unique
   whole-cell model of the RBC, using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).
   The model is validated by comparing the predicted results with
   measurements from four different and independent experiments. First, we
   simulated the micropipette aspiration and quantified the cytoskeletal
   deformation. Second, we studied the membrane fluctuations of healthy
   RBCs and RBCs parasitized to different intraerythrocytic stages by the
   malaria-inducing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Third, we subjected the
   RBC to shear flow and investigated the dependence of its tank-treading
   frequency on shear rate. Finally, we simulated the bilayer-cytoskeletal
   detachment in channel flow to quantify the strength of such interactions
   when the corresponding bonds break. Taken together, these experiments
   and corresponding systematic DPD simulations probe the governing
   constitutive response of the cytoskeleton, elastic stiffness, viscous
   friction, and strength of bilayer-cytoskeletal interactions as well as
   membrane viscosities. Hence, the DPD simulations and comparisons with
   available independent experiments serve as validation of the unique
   two-component model and lead to useful insights into the biomechanical
   interactions between the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton of the RBC.
   Furthermore, they provide a basis for further studies to probe cell
   mechanistic processes in health and disease in a manner that guides the
   design and interpretation of experiments and to develop simulations of
   phenomena that cannot be studied systematically by experiments alone.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a computational framework is proposed for the synthesis of
   flexible and controllable heat exchanger networks. The synthesis is
   projected to operate over a specified range of expected variations in
   the inlet temperatures and flowrates of the process streams using a
   decentralized control system, such that the total annual cost involving
   the utility consumption and the investment are optimized simultaneously.
   The framework is based on a two-stage strategy. A design stage is
   performed prior to the operability analysis where the design variables
   are chosen. In the second stage, the control variables are adjusted
   during operation on the realizations of the uncertain parameters. The
   framework yields a HEN design, which is guaranteed to operate with the
   designed control system under varying conditions ensuring stream
   temperature targets and optimal energy integration. The application of
   the proposed framework and its computational efficiency are illustrated
   with some numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effects of O-2 and SO2 on the Capture Capacity of a Primary-Amine Based
   Polymeric CO2 Sorbent}},

Abstract = {{Postcombustion CO2 capture is most commonly carried out using an amine
   solution that results in a high parasitic energy cost in the stripper
   unit due to the need to heat the water, which comprises a majority of
   the amine solution. It is also well-known that amine solvents suffer
   from stability issues due to amine leaching and poisoning by flue gas
   impurities. Solid sorbents provide an alternative to solvent systems
   that would potentially reduce the energy penalty of carbon capture.
   However, the cost of using a particular sorbent is greatly affected by
   the usable lifetime of the sorbent. This work investigated the stability
   of a primary amine-functionalized ion-exchange resin in the presence of
   O-2 and SO2, both of which are constituents of flue gas that have been
   shown to cause degradation of various amines in solvent processes. The
   CO2 capture capacity was measured over multiple capture cycles under
   continuous exposure to two simulated flue gas streams, one containing 12
   vol \% CO2, 4\% O-2, 8496 N-2, and the other containing 12.5 vol \% CO2,
   4\% 02, 431 ppm SO2, balance N-2 using a custom-built packed bed
   reactor. The resin maintained its CO2 capture capacity of 1.31 mol/kg
   over 17 capture cycles in the presence of O-2 without SO2. However, the
   CO2 capture capacity of the resin decreased rapidly under exposure to
   SO2 by an amount of 1.3 mol/kg over 9 capture cycles. Elemental analysis
   revealed the resin adsorbed 1.0 mol/kg of SO2. Thermal regeneration was
   determined to not be possible. The poisoned resin was however, partially
   regenerated with exposure to 1.5 M NaOH for 3 days resulting in a 43\%
   removal of sulfur, determined through elemental analysis, and a 35\%
   recovery of CO2 capture capacity. Evidence was also found for amine loss
   upon prolonged (7 days) continuous exposure to high temperatures (120
   degrees C) in air. It is concluded that desulfurization of the flue gas
   stream prior to CO2 capture will greatly improve the economic viability
   of using this solid sorbent in a postcombustion CO2 capture process.}},

Abstract = {{Rupture risk assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) by means of
   biomechanical analysis is a viable alternative to the traditional
   clinical practice of using a critical diameter for recommending elective
   repair. However, an accurate prediction of biomechanical parameters,
   such as mechanical stress, strain, and shear stress, is possible if the
   AAA models and boundary conditions are truly patient specific. In this
   work, we present a complete fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework
   for patient-specific AAA passive mechanics assessment that utilizes
   individualized inflow and outflow boundary conditions. The purpose of
   the study is two-fold: (1) to develop a novel semiautomated methodology
   that derives velocity components from phase-contrast magnetic resonance
   images (PC-MRI) in the infrarenal aorta and successfully apply it as an
   inflow boundary condition for a patient-specific fully coupled FSI
   analysis and (2) to apply a one-way-coupled FSI analysis and test its
   efficiency compared to transient computational solid stress and fully
   coupled FSI analyses for the estimation of AAA biomechanical parameters.
   For a fully coupled FSI simulation, our results indicate that an inlet
   velocity profile modeled with three patient-specific velocity components
   and a velocity profile modeled with only the axial velocity component
   yield nearly identical maximum principal stress (sigma(1)), maximum
   principal strain (epsilon(1)), and wall shear stress (WSS)
   distributions. An inlet Womersley velocity profile leads to a 5\%
   difference in peak sigma(1), 3\% in peak epsilon(1), and 14\% in peak
   WSS compared to the three-component inlet velocity profile in the fully
   coupled FSI analysis. The peak wall stress and strain were found to be
   in phase with the systolic inlet flow rate, therefore indicating the
   necessity to capture the patient-specific hemodynamics by means of FSI
   modeling. The proposed one-way-coupled FSI approach showed potential for
   reasonably accurate biomechanical assessment with less computational
   effort, leading to differences in peak sigma(1), epsilon(1), and WSS of
   14\%, 4\%, and 18\%, respectively, compared to the axial component inlet
   velocity profile in the fully coupled FSI analysis. The transient
   computational solid stress approach yielded significantly higher
   differences in these parameters and is not recommended for accurate
   assessment of AAA wall passive mechanics. This work demonstrates the
   influence of the flow dynamics resulting from patient-specific inflow
   boundary conditions on AAA biomechanical assessment and describes
   methods to evaluate it through fully coupled and one-way-coupled
   fluid-structure interaction analysis.}},

Title = {{The Importance of Patient-Specific Regionally Varying Wall Thickness in
   Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Biomechanics}},

Abstract = {{Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular condition where the use of
   a biomechanics-based assessment for patient-specific risk assessment is
   a promising approach for clinical management of the disease. Among
   various factors that affect such assessment, AAA wall thickness is
   expected to be an important factor. However, regionally varying
   patient-specific wall thickness has not been incorporated as a modeling
   feature in AAA biomechanics. To the best our knowledge, the present work
   is the first to incorporate patient-specific variable wall thickness
   without an underlying empirical assumption on its distribution for AAA
   wall mechanics estimation. In this work, we present a novel method for
   incorporating regionally varying wall thickness (the ``PSNUT{''}
   modeling strategy) in AAA finite element modeling and the application of
   this method to a diameter-matched cohort of 28 AAA geometries to assess
   differences in wall mechanics originating from the conventional
   assumption of a uniform wall thickness. For the latter, we used both a
   literature-derived population average wall thickness (1.5 mm; the
   ``UT{''} strategy) as well as the spatial average of our
   patient-specific variable wall thickness (the ``PSUT{''} strategy). For
   the three different wall thickness modeling strategies, wall mechanics
   were assessed by four biomechanical parameters: the spatial maxima of
   the first principal stress, strain, strain-energy density, and
   displacement. A statistical analysis was performed to address the
   hypothesis that the use of any uniform wall thickness model resulted in
   significantly different biomechanical parameters compared to a
   patient-specific regionally varying wall thickness model. Statistically
   significant differences were obtained with the UT modeling strategy
   compared to the PSNUT strategy for the spatial maxima of the first
   principal stress (p = 0.002), strain (p = 0.0005), and strain-energy
   density (p = 7.83 e-5) but not for displacement (p = 0.773). Likewise,
   significant differences were obtained comparing the PSUT modeling
   strategy with the PSNUT strategy for the spatial maxima of the first
   principal stress (p = 9.68 e-7), strain (p = 1.03 e-8), strain-energy
   density (p = 9.94 e-8), and displacement (p = 0.0059). No significant
   differences were obtained comparing the UT and PSUT strategies for the
   spatial maxima of the first principal stress (p = 0.285), strain (p =
   0.152), strain-energy density (p = 0.222), and displacement (p =
   0.0981). This work strongly recommends the use of patient-specific
   regionally varying wall thickness derived from the segmentation of
   abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans if the AAA finite element
   analysis is focused on estimating peak biomechanical parameters, such as
   stress, strain, and strain-energy density.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the origin of elastic nonlinearities in
   aluminium nitride contour mode resonators (CMRs). Our study highlights
   that the nonlinear behavior is due to thermal effects when the
   resonators are electrically excited and the input is slowly (slow with
   respect to the device thermal time constant) swept through the
   excitation frequencies close to the main resonance. An analytical
   expression that relates the nonlinear behavior of the device to its
   geometry and material properties is derived. Amplitude-frequency (A-f)
   and third-order intermodulation (IMD3) measurements on 1-GHz AlN CMRs
   are employed to demonstrate the theoretical reasoning. The two
   experiments confirm the validity of the analytical derivation when the
   system is dominated by thermally induced nonlinearities. In the case of
   large frequency difference between the modulation frequencies, purely
   elastic nonlinearity can also be extracted from the IMD3 measurements.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a nonlinear model based dynamic optimization
   approach for optimal control for thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP)
   processes. The method is based on nonlinear model predictive control
   (NMPC) technique with an economic objective function. In our previous
   work {[}1], an economically oriented NMPC (econNMPC) was presented for a
   two-stage TMP process with high consistency (HC) refiners. The two-stage
   TMP process was simulated up to the secondary refiner. In this study, we
   extend the previous study to multiple stages that include low
   consistency (LC) refining. Here we can exploit the complexity of
   interactions of multiple stage TMP for both performance and optimal
   operations. The first process is a conventional refining process with
   two stages of HC refining with a primary and a secondary refiner,
   followed by a latency chest and a third-stage LC refiner. The second TMP
   process has only a HC primary refiner, and the secondary stage HC
   refiner is replaced by multiple stages of LC refiners after the latency
   chest. Both TMP schemes are dynamically optimized against disturbances
   to produce the same target final pulp qualities while minimizing
   specific energy consumption of the processes. The simulation results
   show the potential economic benefits of the proposed method, through a
   reduction in total specific energy, about 24\%, for the second TMP
   process. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   that privacy-enhanced matchmaking cannot be provided by solutions to
   seemingly related problems such as secret handshakes, set intersection,
   and trust negotiation. We define an adversary model, which captures the
   key security properties of privacy-enhanced matchmaking, and show that a
   simple, practical protocol derived by a two-step transformation of a

   a provable manner (in the standard model of cryptographic security).}},

Abstract = {{There are many advantages of solar photovoltaic technology in providing
   lighting for rural homes-scalability, minimal maintenance and well
   developed business models. This study seeks to study the impact of the
   transition from Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) to Light Emitting Diodes
   based lights (LED) on the solar home lighting system market. Changing
   the lighting fixtures from CFL to LED would lead to the requirement of
   smaller panels and batteries and consequently, a reduction in prices.
   Would this reduction significantly increase the adoption of these
   systems? Would the requirement for financing or government support
   change? To understand this changing landscape of the rural solar
   lighting industry, this study analyses the current products,
   distribution network, and operations of seven diverse solar firms
   operating in different parts of India. Four of these firms exclusively
   make LED based products - lanterns and small home lighting systems - and
   the rest have some LED based systems in their portfolio. There are
   several factors to be considered, product configuration, luminosity,
   price effects and service and maintenance. While the price reduction is
   found to be significant (about 20\%), affordability may still remain an
   issue for poorer households. LED lighting allows for the introduction of
   plug and play systems, and reduces institutional requirements for
   installation and maintenance. (C) 2013 International Energy Initiative.

Abstract = {{We present experimental results of coal gasification with and without
   the addition of calcium oxide and potassium hydroxide as
   dual-functioning catalyst capture agents. using different coal types and
   temperatures 700 and 900 degrees C, we studied the effect of these
   catalyst-capture agents on (1) the syngas composition, (2) CO2 and H2S
   capture, and (3) the stem-coal gasification kinetic rate. The syngas
   composition from the gasifier was roughly 20\% methane, 70\% hydrogen,
   and 10\% other species when a CaO/C molar ratio of 0.5 was added. We
   demonstrated significantly enhanced steam-coal gasification kinetic rate
   when adding small amounts of potassium hydroxide to coal when operating
   a CaO-CaCO3 chemical looping gasification reactor. For example, the
   steam-coal, gasification kinetic rate increased 250\% when dry mixing
   calcium oxide at a Ca/C molar ratio of 0.5 with a sub-bituminous coal,
   and the kinetic rate increased 1000\% when aqueously mixing calcium
   oxide at a Ca/C molar ratio of 0.5 along with potassium-hydroxide at a
   K/C molar, ratio of 0.06. In addition, we conducted multi-cycle studies
   in which CaCO3 was calcined by heating to 900 degrees C regenerate the
   CaO, which was then reused repeated CaO-CaCO3 cycles. The increased
   steam-coal gasification kinetics rates for both CaO and CaO + KOH
   persisted even when the material was reused in six cycles of
   gasification and calcination. The ability of CaO to capture carbon
   dioxide decreased roughly 2-4\% per CaO-CaCO3 cycle. We also discuss an
   important application of this combined gasifier-calciner to electricity
   generation and selling the purge stream as a precalcined feedstock to a
   cement kiln. In this scenario, the amount of purge stream required is
   fixed not by the degradation in the capture ability but rather by the
   requirements cement at the cement kiln on the amount of CaSO4 and ash in
   the precalcined feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{State and federal governments are considering performance standards to
   limit carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new fossil-fuel-fired
   electric-generating units. This study employs a newly developed
   computational tool to compare the performance and cost impacts of
   applying a technology-neutral CO2 emission performance standard to
   pulverized coal (PC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants
   and to evaluate the role of CO2 utilization in accelerating carbon
   capture and storage (CCS) deployments. We explore the impacts of
   performance standards between 1000 and 300 lb of CO2/MWh gross, a range
   more stringent than the recently proposed standard by the United Stated
   Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Meeting such standard would
   require CO2 emission reductions of roughly 45-85\% for new PC baseload
   plants and 0-65\% for new NGCC baseload plants. Adding current
   amine-based CGS to meet these standards increases the plant levelized
   cost of electricity by 35-66\% for PC plants and 0-26\% for NGCC plants.
   On an absolute basis, meeting the most stringent standard of 300 lb/MWh
   gross would add \$38.9/MWh to the cost of the PC plant but only
   \$16.5/MWh for the NGCC plant. This cost advantage of NGCC plants
   relative to PC plants is strongly affected by plant capacity factor and
   natural gas price and could be diminished by gas prices above
   approximately \$9.0/GJ for new baseload plants subject to a range of
   performance standards. Our analysis of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
   option shows that, at a price of roughly \$40/metric ton of CO2, the
   revenue from selling the captured CO2 for the EOR could fully offset the
   capture cost for PC plants. Higher CO2 prices would be required to fully
   pay for CO2 capture at NGCC plants. Using the captured CO2 for EOR thus
   would facilitate continued coal use for low-carbon electricity
   generation, even under the most stringent performance standard modeled.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of synthetic and cell-free biology has made tremendous
   strides towards creating artificial cellular nanosystems using concepts
   from solution-based chemistry, where only the concentrations of reacting
   species modulate gene expression rates. However, it is known that
   macromolecular crowding, a key feature in natural cells, can
   dramatically influence biochemical kinetics via volume exclusion
   effects, which reduce diffusion rates and enhance binding rates of
   macromolecules. Here, we demonstrate that macromolecular crowding can
   increase the robustness of gene expression by integrating synthetic
   cellular components of biological circuits and artificial cellular
   nanosystems. Furthermore, we reveal how ubiquitous cellular modules,
   including genetic components, a negative feedback loop and the size of
   the crowding molecules can fine-tune gene circuit response to molecular
   crowding. By bridging a key gap between artificial and living cells, our
   work has implications for efficient and robust control of both synthetic
   and natural cellular circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of the composition of the algae for the simultaneous

   alternative technologies for the biodiesel synthesis from algae oil,
   enzymatic or homogeneous alkali catalyzed that are coupled with
   bioethanol production from algae starch. In order to determine the
   optimal operating conditions, we not only couple the technologies, but
   simultaneously optimize the production of both biofuels and heat
   integrate them while optimizing the water consumption. Multi-effect
   distillation is included to reduce the energy and cooling water
   consumption for ethanol dehydration. In both cases, the optimal algae
   composition results in 60\% oil, 30\% starch, and 10\% protein. The best
   alternative for the production of biofuels corresponds to a production
   price of 0.35 \$/gal, using enzymes, with energy and water consumption
   values (4.00 MJ/gal and 0.59 gal/gal). (c) 2013 American Institute of

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We use a phase-changing metal alloy to reversibly tune the elastic
   rigidity of an elastomer composite. The elastomer is embedded with a
   sheet of low-melting-point Field's metal and an electric Joule heater
   composed of a serpentine channel of liquid-phase gallium-indium-tin
   (Galinstan (R)) alloy. At room temperature, the embedded Field's metal
   is solid and the composite remains elastically rigid. Joule heating
   causes the Field's metal to melt and allows the surrounding elastomer to
   freely stretch and bend. Using a tensile testing machine, we measure
   that the effective elastic modulus of the composite reversibly changes
   by four orders of magnitude when powered on and off. This dramatic
   change in rigidity is accurately predicted with a model for an elastic
   composite. Reversible rigidity control is also accomplished by replacing
   the Field's metal with shape memory polymer. In addition to
   demonstrating electrically tunable rigidity with an elastomer, we also
   introduce a new technique to rapidly produce soft-matter electronics and
   multifunctional materials in several minutes with laser-patterned
   adhesive film and masked deposition of liquid-phase metal alloy.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{An experimental system was developed to tissue engineer skeletal muscle
   thin films with well-defined tissue architecture and to quantify the
   effect on contractility. Using the C2C12 cell line, the authors tested
   whether tailoring the width and spacing of micropatterned fibronectin
   lines can be used to increase myoblast differentiation into functional
   myotubes and maximize uniaxial alignment within a 2-D sheet. Using a
   combination of image analysis and the muscular thin film contractility
   assay, it was demonstrated that a fibronectin line width of 100 mu m and
   line spacing of 20 mu m is able to maximize the formation of
   anisotropic, engineered skeletal muscle with consistent contractile
   properties at the millimeter length scale. The engineered skeletal
   muscle exhibited a positive force-frequency relationship, could achieve
   tetanus and produced a normalized peak twitch stress of 9.4 +/- 4.6 kPa
   at 1 Hz stimulation. These results establish that micropatterning
   technologies can be used to control skeletal muscle differentiation and
   tissue architecture and, in combination with the muscular thin film
   contractility, assay can be used to probe structure-function
   relationships. More broadly, an experimental platform is provided with
   the potential to examine how a range of microenvironmental cues such as
   extracellular matrix protein composition, micropattern geometries and
   substrate mechanics affect skeletal muscle myogenesis and contractility.

Abstract = {{With technology scaling, logical errors arising due to single-event
   upsets and timing errors arising due to dynamic variability effects are
   increasing in logic circuits. Existing techniques for online resilience
   to logical and timing errors are limited to detection of errors, and
   often result in significant performance penalty and high area/power
   overhead. This paper proposes approximate logic circuits as a design
   approach for low cost concurrent error masking. An approximate logic
   circuit predicts the value of the outputs of a given logic circuit for a
   specified portion of the input space, and can indicate uncertainty about
   the outputs over the rest of the input space. Using portions of the
   input space that are most vulnerable to errors as the specified input
   space, we show that approximate logic circuits can be used to provide
   low overhead concurrent error masking support for a given logic circuit.
   We describe efficient algorithms for synthesizing approximate circuits
   for concurrent error masking of logical and timing errors. Results
   indicate that concurrent error masking based on approximate logic
   circuits can mask 88\% of targeted logical errors for 34\% area overhead
   and 17\% power overhead, 100\% timing errors on all timing paths within
   10\% of the critical path delay for 23\% area overhead and 8\% power
   overhead, and 100\% timing errors on all timing paths within 20\% of the

Abstract = {{The independent component analysis (ICA) tractography method has
   improved the ability to isolate intravoxel crossing fibers; however, the
   accuracy of ICA is limited in cases with voxels in local clusters
   lacking sufficient numbers of fibers with the same orientations. To
   overcome this limitation, the ICA was combined with a ball-stick model
   (BSM) {[}ICA+BSM]. An ICA approach is applied to identify crossing fiber
   components in voxels of small cluster, which are maximally independent
   in orientation. The eigenvectors of these components are numerically
   optimized via the subsequent BSM procedure. Simulation studies for two
   or three crossing fibers demonstrate that ICA+BSM overcomes the
   limitation of the original ICA method by refining regional ICA solutions
   in diffusion measurement of a single voxel. It shows 2 degrees-5 degrees
   of angular errors to isolate two or three fibers, providing a better
   recovery of simulated fibers compared with ICA alone. Human studies show
   that ICA+BSM achieves high anatomical correspondence of corticospinal
   tracts compared with postmortem corticospinal histology, yielding 92.2\%
   true positive detection including both lateral and medial projections,
   compared with 84.1\% for ICA alone. This study demonstrates that the
   intravoxel crossing fiber problem in clinical diffusion MRI may be
   sorted out more efficiently by combining ICA with BSM. Magn Reson Med

Abstract = {{Intraatrial-conduit Fontan is considered a modification of both
   extracardiac and lateral-tunnel Fontan. In this study, the
   patient-specific hemodynamic performance of intraatrial-conduit and
   lateral-tunnel Fontan with fenestration, considered as conversion
   templates, was investigated based on the authors' patient cohort.
   Pulsatile computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed using
   patient-specific models of intraatrial-conduit and lateral-tunnel Fontan
   patients. Real-time ``simultaneous{''} inferior and superior vena cava,
   pulmonary artery, and fenestration flow waveforms were acquired from
   ultrasound. Multiple hemodynamic performance indices were investigated,
   with particular focus on evaluation of the pulsatile flow performance.
   Power loss inside the lateral-tunnel Fontan appeared to be significantly
   higher than with the intraatrial-conduit Fontan for patient-specific
   cardiac output and normalized connection size. Inclusion of the 4-mm
   fenestration at a 0.24 L/min mean flow resulted in a lower cavopulmonary
   pressure gradient and less time-averaged power loss for both Fontan
   connections. Flow structures within the intraatrial conduit were
   notability more uniform than within the lateral tunnel. Hepatic flow
   majorly favored the left lung in both surgical connections: conversion
   from lateral-tunnel to intraatrial-conduit Fontan resulted in better
   hemodynamics with less power loss, a lower pressure gradient, and fewer
   stagnant flow zones along the conduit. This patient-specific
   computational case study demonstrated superior hemodynamics of
   intraatrial-conduit Fontan over those of lateral-tunnel Fontan with or
   without fenestration and improved performance after conversion of the
   lateral tunnel to the intraatrial conduit. The geometry-specific effect
   of the nonuniform hepatic flow distribution may motivate new rationales
   for the surgical design.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a magnetically actuated multimodal drug
   release mechanism using a tetherless soft capsule endoscope for the
   treatment of gastric disease. Because the designed capsule has a drug
   chamber between both magnetic heads, if it is compressed by the external
   magnetic field, the capsule could release a drug in a specific position
   locally. The capsule is designed to release a drug in two modes
   according to the situation. In the first mode, a small amount of drug is
   continuously released by a series of pulse type magnetic field
   (0.01-0.03 T). The experimental results show that the drug release can
   be controlled by the frequency of the external magnetic pulse. In the
   second mode, about 800 mm(3) of drug is released by the external
   magnetic field of 0.07 T, which induces a stronger magnetic attraction
   than the critical force for capsule's collapsing. As a result, a
   polymeric coating is formed around the capsule. The coated area is
   dependent on the drug viscosity. This paper presents simulations and
   various experiments to evaluate the magnetically actuated multimodal
   drug release capability. The proposed soft capsules could be used as
   minimally invasive tetherless medical devices with therapeutic
   capability for the next generation capsule endoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Robust facial hair detection and segmentation is a highly valued soft
   biometric attribute for carrying out forensic facial analysis. In this
   paper, we propose a novel and fully automatic system, called SparCLeS,
   for beard/moustache detection and segmentation in challenging facial
   images. SparCLeS uses the multiscale self-quotient (MSQ) algorithm to
   preprocess facial images and deal with illumination variation. Histogram
   of oriented gradients (HOG) features are extracted from the preprocessed
   images and a dynamic sparse classifier is built using these features to
   classify a facial region as either containing skin or facial hair. A
   level set based approach, which makes use of the advantages of both
   global and local information, is then used to segment the regions of a
   face containing facial hair. Experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our proposed system in detecting and segmenting facial
   hair regions in images drawn from three databases, i.e., the NIST
   Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC) still face database, the NIST
   Color Facial Recognition Technology FERET database, and the Labeled
   Faces in the Wild (LFW) database.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic global-coefficient mixed subgrid-scale eddy-viscosity model
   for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows in complex geometries is
   developed. In the present model, the subgrid-scale stress is decomposed
   into the modified Leonard stress, cross stress, and subgrid-scale
   Reynolds stress. The modified Leonard stress is explicitly computed
   assuming a scale similarity, while the cross stress and the
   subgrid-scale Reynolds stress are modeled using the global-coefficient
   eddy-viscosity model. The model coefficient is determined by a dynamic
   procedure based on the global-equilibrium between the subgrid-scale
   dissipation and the viscous dissipation. The new model relieves some of
   the difficulties associated with an eddy-viscosity closure, such as the
   nonalignment of the principal axes of the subgrid-scale stress tensor
   and the strain rate tensor and the anisotropy of turbulent flow fields,
   while, like other dynamic global-coefficient models, it does not require
   averaging or clipping of the model coefficient for numerical
   stabilization. The combination of the global-coefficient eddy-viscosity
   model and a scale-similarity model is demonstrated to produce improved
   predictions in a number of turbulent flow simulations. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Deformation (e.g. cyclic hardening, softening and saturation) response
   and the corresponding microstructural evolution of AISI 316L during
   cyclic loading at room temperature are exhaustively studied. In
   particular, the physical interpretation and the role of internal
   stresses are thoroughly evaluated in order to better comprehend the
   relationship between microstructural evolution and cyclic deformation
   response. The understanding obtained provides a basis for the
   development of a physically-based evolutionary constitutive model which
   aims to accurately represent the complex cyclic deformation response of
   the material. The developed constitutive model represents the change in
   microstructural condition and its relationship with internal stress
   variables. The model parameters are identified by a systematic
   evaluation of mechanical and microstructural observations from a number
   of experimental tests. The proposed model is shown to effectively
   represent the complex cyclic elasto-plastic deformation behaviour of the
   material for a range of strain amplitudes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In-home electricity displays (IUDs) are digital devices that can give
   near-real-time information about electricity usage in the home. These
   devices have the potential to provide the kind of personalized feedback
   necessary to effect behavioral change among residential consumers.
   However, for consumers to be able to act on the information provided on
   IHDs, they must first be able to understand it. We present an approach
   to in-home display design that uses research on customer preferences to
   determine which features to experimentally examine for customer
   comprehension. Additionally, we compare these preferences against
   experimental data to determine whether people have insight into what
   information best works for an increased understanding of energy saving.
   Using a computer-based simulated IHD, we find that the types of feedback
   information that consumers prefer (appliance-specific and
   dollar-feedback) are not as effective for learning about appliance
   energy use as the less-preferred aggregated kW h feedback. Moreover, it
   appears that a simpler more generalized format of information provision
   has the potential to be more effective than a personalized IHD. We
   discuss how consumer preferences and experimental tests can jointly be
   used to inform the design of feedback technologies. (c) 2013 Elsevier

   porous media on the transport of polyacrylic acid modified nZVI
   (PAA-nZVI). Increasing the proportion of carbonate sand in the porous
   media resulted in less transport of PAA-nZVI. Predicted travel distances
   were reduced to a few centimeters in pure carbonate sand compared to
   approximately 1.6 m in quartz sand. Transport modeling showed that the

Abstract = {{We derive the time reversal likelihood ratio optimal detector for a
   target in stationary random multipath clutter, extending prior work
   where both are assumed to be deterministic. We suppress the stationary
   clutter through adaptive power allocation. We show that the Time
   Reversal Likelihood Ratio Test performs much better than the
   conventional Weighted Energy Detector. We provide analytical results on
   the performance of the time reversal detector by approximating it with
   the Time Reversal Linear Quadratic detector, which models the received
   signal as a Complex Gaussian. Our simulations show that the Linear
   Quadratic detector is a good approximation to the Time Reversal
   Likelihood Ratio Test and that both show a significant improvement of 4
   to 7 dB effective signal-to-noise ratio gain over the Weighted Energy
   Detector. This gain is dependent on the target and clutter power
   spectral densities.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel registration-based image interpolation approach in
   this paper. The proposed method is divided into two steps: image
   registration and intensity interpolation. An image registration method
   is developed to construct a corresponding transformation, which is
   represented by the bicubic B-spline vector-valued function, between the
   given images so that the image features are well matched. To match
   features from coarse to fine, a multi-resolution strategy is applied
   with different numbers of B-spline control points adopted at various
   resolution levels. After registration, the intensity values of
   in-between images are calculated by linear/cubic interpolation along the
   matching lines. Experimental results demonstrate that our interpolation
   approach is effective, robust, and capable of producing continuously
   deformed in-between images with clear shape features. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-28}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Software design, development and evolution commonly require programmers
   to model design decisions, visualize implemented programs, and detect
   conflicts between design and implementation. However, common design
   notations rarely reconcile theoretical concerns for rigor and minimality
   with the practical concerns for abstraction, scalability and automated
   verifiability. The language of Codecharts was designed to overcome these
   challenges by narrowing its scope to visual specifications that
   articulate automatically-verifiable statements about the structure and
   organization of object-oriented programs. The tokens in its visual
   vocabulary stand for the building-blocks of object-oriented design, such
   as inheritance class hierarchies, sets of dynamically-bound methods, and
   their correlations. The formalism was tailored for those pragmatic
   concerns which arise from modeling class libraries and design patterns,
   and for visualizing programs of any size at any level of abstraction. We
   describe design verification, a process of proving or refuting that a
   Java program (i.e. its native code) conforms to the Codechart specifying
   it. We also describe a toolkit which supports modeling and visualization
   with Codecharts, as well as a fully-automated design verification tool.
   We conclude with empirical results which suggest gains in both speed and
   accuracy when using Codecharts in software design, development and
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{A Cu-Cu multilayer processed by accumulative roll bonding was deformed
   to large strains and further annealed. The texture of the deformed Cu-Cu
   multilayer differs from the conventional fcc rolling textures in terms
   of higher fractions of Bs and RD-rotated cube components, compared with
   the volume fraction of Cu component. The elongated grain shape
   significantly affects the deformation characteristics. Characteristic
   microstructural features of both continuous dynamic recrystallization
   and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization were observed in the
   microtexture measurements. X-ray texture measurements of annealing of
   heavily deformed multilayer demonstrate constrained recrystallization
   and resulted in a bimodal grain size distribution in the annealed
   material at higher strains. The presence of cube- and BR-oriented grains
   in the deformed material confirms the oriented nucleation as the major
   influence on texture change during recrystallization. Persistence of
   cube component throughout the deformation is attributed to dynamic
   recrystallization. Evolution of RD-rotated cube is attributed to the
   deformation of cube components that evolve from dynamic
   recrystallization. The relaxation of strain components leads to Bs at
   larger strains. Further, the Bs component is found to recover rather
   than recrystallize during deformation. The presence of predominantly Cu
   and Bs orientations surrounding the interface layer suggests constrained
   annealing behavior.}},

Title = {{Grain growth and the puzzle of its stagnation in thin films: The curious

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The underlying cause of stagnation of grain growth in thin metallic
   films remains a puzzle. Here it is re-visited by means of detailed
   comparison of experiments and simulations, using a broad range of
   metrics that, in addition to grain size, includes the number of sides
   and the average side class of nearest neighbors. The experimental grain
   size data reported is large and comprises nearly 35,000 grains from 27
   thin film samples of Al and Cu with thicknesses in the range of 25-158
   nm. The size distributions for the Al and Cu films are remarkably
   similar to each other despite the many and significant differences in
   experimental conditions, which include sputtering target purity,
   substrate type, film thickness, deposition temperature, actual as well
   as homologous annealing temperatures, annealing time, absolute grain
   size, and the twin density within the grains. This similarity argues for
   a universal experimental grain size distribution, which for grain
   diameters is lognormal as found previously for thin films at stagnation.
   Comparison of the experimental grain size distribution with that for two
   dimensional grain growth simulations with isotropic boundary energy
   shows the distributions to differ in two regions, termed the ``ear{''}
   and the ``tail{''}. It is shown that the excess small grains in the
   region of the ``ear{''} are primarily the 3 and 4-sided grains, whereas
   the excess of large grains in the ``tail{''} region are grains with more
   than nine sides. The excesses in the ear and tail regions of the
   experimental distributions are necessarily balanced by a deficiency in
   the mid-sized grains with 6-8 sides. Five causes are examined to
   identify the puzzling difference between simulations with isotropic
   boundary energy and experiments. These are (i) driving forces other than
   grain boundary energy reduction, (ii) anisotropy of grain boundary
   energy, (iii) grain boundary grooving, (iv) solute drag and (v) triple
   junction drag. No single cause is seen to provide an explanation for the
   observed experimental behavior. However, it is speculated that a
   combination of causes that include the anisotropy of grain boundary
   energy will be needed to explain the experimental behavior. (C) 2013

Title = {{CO2 implications of coal-to-liquids (CTL) plants}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{50-60}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, plant-level techno-economic models are developed and
   applied to systematically evaluate the performance, emissions and costs
   of a much broader range of coal-to-liquids (CTL) plant designs than have
   previously been studied. These include two plant configurations (a
   liquids-only plant similar to current commercial technology, and a
   co-production plant producing both liquids and electricity), two types
   of coal gasification systems (slurry-feed and dry-feed gasifiers), and
   three types of coal feedstock (bituminous, sub-bituminous and lignite).
   For all twelve designs, the additional cost of carbon dioxide capture
   and storage (CCS) and the effects of a price or tax on plant-level CO2
   emissions, as well as the option of sale of CO2 for enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR), also are studied. The potential of the co-production
   configuration to reduce overall CO2 emissions by displacing conventional
   pulverized coal power plants is also investigated.
   The economic feasibility of CCS depends strongly on the CO2 price/tax
   and electricity selling price. In general for liquids-only plants, CCS
   is the more economical option than paying even the ``low{''} CO2 tax of
   \$20/tonne for the non-CCS cases. For co-production plants, a higher CO2
   tax is required to make CCS feasible because of the foregone revenues
   from electricity sales (due to CCS energy requirements). EOR options
   generally have the lowest cost of liquids produced, in the range of
   \$45-\$100/barrel, across all cases. Co-production is more efficient
   than the separate production of liquids and power, and this difference
   in efficiency increases with the addition of CCS. This advantage can be
   utilized to achieve a net reduction in overall CO2 emissions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study uses a process lifecycle inventory (LCI) to compare the
   lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
   operations using different sources for CO2 and to non-CO2 EOR methods.
   All EOR techniques were compared to the base case of natural-source
   CO2-EOR, which had net emissions of 0.52 +/- 0.03 metric tons of CO2-e
   per barrel of oil recovered (t/bbl) (85.1 +/- 4.9g CO2-e/MJ oil (g/MJ)),
   the same as the net emissions of 0.52 +/- 0.02 t/bbl (84.3 +/- 3.0 g/MJ)
   when using CO2 derived from a coal-fueled synthetic natural gas (SNG)
   plant. Net emissions were lowered to 0.36 +/- 0.03 t/bbl (58.5 +/- 5.2
   g/MJ) for EOR using CO2 derived from a coal-fed Integrated Gasification
   Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant. Net emissions were further reduced to 0.18
   +/- 0.11 t/bbl (28.6 +/- 18.7 g/MJ) using switchgrass grown on marginal
   land in an IGCC plant. Similar to coal, net emissions were 0.34 +/- 0.03
   t/bbl (55.3 +/- 5.5 g/MJ) for EOR using CO2 derived from a Natural Gas
   Combined Cycle (NGCC) plant, and 039 +/- 0.03 t/bbl (63.3 +/- 4.4 g/MJ)
   when using livestock manure biogas for NGCC. Net emissions of methane-
   and nitrogen-EOR were 10-15\% greater than for natural-source CO2-EOR.
   For the allocations used in this study, all sources of CO2 derived from
   IGCC or NGCC plants resulted in between about 25\% and 60\% lower net
   CO2-e emissions per barrel of oil recovered compared to natural-source
   CO2-EOR, and were also approximately 25-60\% lower than average domestic
   U.S. oil lifecycle emissions of 0.50 +/- 0.02 t/bbl (82.4 +/- 2.5 g/MJ).
   These results suggest that coal and biomass IGCC CO2-EOR, as well as
   natural gas and biogas NGCC CO2-EOR, may be alternatives for reducing
   GHG emissions associated with fossil fuel use during the slow transition
   from fossil fuels to other energy sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   exchangers with different geometric parameters which are plate height,

   resistance is compatible with experimental data that it can help to
   optimize the design of plate heat exchangers. This investigation
   significantly simplifies the fouling analysis of complex flow fields and

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal particles can function as probes of local electrochemical
   current density if a functional relationship between the response of the
   particles and the electric field in the vicinity of the particles can be
   established. The nanometer scale movement of a single colloidal particle
   during cyclic voltammetry can be observed with the aid of total internal
   reflection microscopy. The intensity of scattered light can be related
   back to the current density local to that particle, and hence the method
   is called imaging. amperometry. Data acquisition and optical
   constraints, however, make a single-particle method impractical for
   analysis of macro-scale (similar to 1 cm(2)) surfaces covered by several
   hundred thousand particles. Subdivision of the electrode into small
   patches, each containing an ensemble of particles, solves this problem
   if the scattering from the ensembles can be related to the local
   electric field. For example, a 100 x 100 array of square 100 mu m
   patches each containing approximately two dozen particles would form a
   mosaic of electrochemical activity with 0.01\% area resolution on a 1
   cm(2) electrode having location-dependent electrocatalytic properties.
   The focus of this contribution, therefore, is adaptation of the method
   from single particles to particle ensembles. The algebraic relationship
   between current density and scattering intensity for single particles
   holds for ensembles if the mean scattering intensity is corrected to its
   mode. Currents calculated from particle light scattering at different
   locations on a single ITO/gold patterned electrode agree well with
   currents measured on these two electrode materials, which have quite
   different electrocatalytic properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, a two-phase, two-dimensional model is developed to
   investigate the role of interfacial voids at the microporous layer (MPL)
   and catalyst layer (CL) interface on the polymer electrolyte fuel cell
   (PEFC) performance. The model incorporates the MPL vertical bar CL
   interfacial region as a separate domain and simulates two-phase
   transport within the interfacial voids. Different case studies,
   including the experimentally-measured MPL vertical bar CL interface and
   a perfect contact interface, are conducted. Model simulations indicate
   that the MPL vertical bar CL interfacial morphology has a significant
   effect on performance, particularly in the high current density region
   (>1.0 A/cm(2)). The interfacial voids at the MPL vertical bar CL
   interface are found to retain liquid water during operation and induce
   mass transport resistance, resulting in nearly a 20\% reduction in the
   limiting current density when compared to perfect interfacial contact.
   The liquid water saturation retained at the interface and the magnitude
   of the mass and charge transport resistance induced by the interface are
   found to be highly dependent upon the geometry and size of the
   interfacial voids. Finally, simulations indicate that the morphology of
   the MPL vertical bar CL interface affects the location where reactions
   tend to occur in the CL, and also has a direct impact on the temperature
   distribution within the cathode. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{This work deals with the closed-loop robust stability of nonlinear model
   predictive control (NMPC) coupled with an extended Kalman filter (EKF).
   First, we point out the gaps between the practical formulations and
   theoretical research. Then, we show that the estimation error dynamics
   of an EKF are input-to-state stable (ISS) in the presence of
   nonvanishing perturbations. Moreover, a target setting optimization
   problem is proposed to solve the target state corresponding to the
   desired set points, which are used in the objective function in NMPC
   formulation. Thus, the objective function is a Lyapunov function
   candidate, and the input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) of the
   closed-loop system can be established. Moreover, we see that the
   stability property deteriorates because of the estimation error.
   Simulation results of the proposed scheme are presented.Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) was successfully mediated by
   copper(II) acetylacetonate, {[}Cu(acac)(2)], or copper(II)
   hexafluoroacetylacetonate, {[}Cu(hfa)(2)], in conjunction with
   1-cyano-1-methylethyl diethyldithiocarbamate (MAN-DC) or
   2-(N,N-diethyldithiocarbamyl)ethyl isobutyrate (EMA-DC)
   initiators/transfer agents in the absence of additional reducing agents.
   Linear first-order kinetic plots were obtained for the polymerization of
   MMA in the presence of {[}Cu(hfa)(2)] or {[}Cu(acac)(2)] and MAN-DC.
   {[}Cu(lifa)(2)] provided better control than {[}Cu(acac)(2)] for the
   polymerization of MMA, leading to PMMA with narrow molecular weight
   distribution, M-w/M-n similar to 1.1. Polymerization of St was
   successfully carried out with either MAN-DC or EMA-DC in the presence of
   {[}Cu(hfa)(2)], also resulting in polymers with low M-w/M-n values. In
   the absence of alkyl dithiocarbamates or copper acetylacetonates, the
   polymerizations resulted in only trace amounts of polymers or polymers
   with high values of M-w/M-n. Thus, the combination of alkyl
   dithiocarbamates and copper(II) acetylacetonates provides a convenient
   way to prepare well-controlled PMMA and PSt. NMR analysis of low-MW
   polymers reveals the presence of DC groups as chain ends. DFT
   calculations show that DC group transfer from a H-MMA-DC model of the
   growing chain to the Cu(II) complexes is energetically accessible and
   more favorable than Br atom transfer, thus rationalizing the need for
   the Cu(II)/dithiocarbamate combination for successful control and
   suggesting that the process takes place by reversible DC group transfer
   involving a Cu-II/Cu-III couple. Attempts to synthesize complexes
   {[}Cu(acac)(2)(DC)] and {[}Cu(hfa)(2)(DC)], in combination with DFT
   calculations, suggest that these complexes are thermodynamically
   unstable relative to the bis(diketonate)copper(II) and dithiuram
   disulfide, but this does not preclude the involvement of the Cu(III)
   species as a spin trap in RDRP controlled by DC group transfer.}},

Abstract = {{The governing parameters controlling the miscibility of particle
   additives within polymeric host media are analyzed for the particular
   case of silica particle fillers embedded within a poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. For athermal polymer-graft modification of
   particles (corresponding to equal chemical composition of graft and
   matrix polymer), compatibility is found to be a sensitive function of
   the degree of polymerization of graft and host polymer chains as well as
   the particle radius. In agreement with theoretical predictions, uniform
   particle dispersion is observed if the degree of polymerization of
   grafted chains is comparable to (or exceeds) the corresponding value of
   the polymer matrix. The resulting restriction to high degree of
   polymerization limits the accessible inorganic fraction that is
   attainable in athermal particle/polymer blends. In contrast, favorable
   interaction between grafted polymer chains and the polymeric host (as
   realized in the case of poly(styrene-r-acrylonitrile)-grafted particles
   embedded within PMMA matrix) is shown to facilitate thermodynamically
   stable and uniform particle dispersion across the entire compositional
   range even in the limit of large particle size, short grafted chains,
   and high molecular matrix chains. The synthesis of thermoplastic
   composite materials with inorganic fraction exceeding 50 vol \%
   combining quantitative optical limiting within the UV frequency range
   and polymer-like mechanical properties is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The virtual crystal (VC) approximation for mass disorder is evaluated by
   examining two model alloy systems: Lennard-Jones argon and
   Stillinger-Weber silicon. In both material systems, the perfect crystal
   is alloyed with a heavier mass species up to equal concentration. The
   analysis is performed using molecular dynamics simulations and lattice
   dynamics calculations. Mode frequencies and lifetimes are first
   calculated by treating the disorder explicitly and under the VC
   approximation, with differences found in the high-concentration alloys
   at high frequencies. Notably, the lifetimes of high-frequency modes are
   underpredicted using the VC approximation, a result we attribute to the
   neglect of higher-order terms in the model used to include point-defect
   scattering. The mode properties are then used to predict thermal
   conductivity under the VC approximation. For the Lennard-Jones alloys,
   where high-frequency modes make a significant contribution to thermal
   conductivity, the high-frequency lifetime underprediction leads to an
   underprediction of thermal conductivity compared to predictions from the
   Green-Kubo method, where no assumptions about the thermal transport are
   required. Based on observations of a minimum mode diffusivity, we
   propose a correction that brings the VC approximation thermal
   conductivities into better agreement with the Green-Kubo values. For the
   Stillinger-Weber alloys, where the thermal conductivity is dominated by
   low-frequency modes, the high-frequency lifetime underprediction does
   not affect the thermal conductivity prediction and reasonable agreement
   is found with the Green-Kubo values. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of new lipidic anchor molecule HC18
   {[}Z-20-(Z-octadec-9-enyloxy)-3,6,9,12,15,18,22-heptaoxatetracont-31-ene
   -1-thiol] and mixed HC18/beta-mercaptoethanol (beta ME) SAMs were
   studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry, contact angle measurements,
   reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and were evaluated in tethered bilayer
   lipid membranes (tBLMs). Our data indicate that HC18, containing a
   double bond in the alkyl segments, forms highly disordered SAMs up to
   anchor/beta ME molar fraction ratios of 80/20 and result in tBLMs that
   exhibit higher lipid diffusion coefficients relative to those of
   previous anchor compounds with saturated alkyl chains, as determined by
   fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. EIS data shows HC18 tBLMs,
   completed by rapid solvent exchange or vesicle fusion, form more easily
   than with saturated lipidic anchors, exhibit excellent electrical
   insulating properties indicating low defect densities, and readily
   incorporate the pore-forming toxin, alpha-hemolysin. Neutron
   reflectivity measurements on HC18 tBLMS confirm the formation of
   complete tBLMs, even at low, tether compositions and high ionic lipid
   compositions. Our data indicate that HC18 results in tBLMs with improved
   physical properties for the incorporation of integral membrane proteins
   (IMPs) and that 80\% HC18 tBLMs appear to be optimal for practical
   applications such as biosensors where high electrical insulation and
   IMP/peptide reconstitution are imperative.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present and demonstrate a low complexity elastic wave
   signaling and reception method to achieve high data rate communication
   on dispersive solid elastic media, such as metal pipes, using
   piezoelectric transducers of PZT (lead zirconate titanate). Data
   communication is realized using pulse position modulation (PPM) as the
   signaling method and the elastic medium as the communication channel.
   The communication system first transmits a small number of training
   pulses to probe the dispersive medium. The time-reversed probe signals
   are then utilized as the information carrying waveforms. Rapid timing
   acquisition of transmitted waveforms for demodulation over elastic
   medium is made possible by exploring the reciprocity property of guided
   elastic waves. The experimental tests were conducted using a National
   Instrument PXI system for waveform excitation and data acquisition. Data
   telemetry bit rates of 10 kbps, 20 kbps, 50 kbps and 100 kbps with the
   average bit error rates of 0, 5.75 x 10-(4), 1.09 x 10-(2) and 5.01 x
   10-(2), respectively, out of a total of 40, 000 transmitted bits were
   obtained when transmitting at the center frequency of 250 kHz and a 500
   kHz bandwidth on steel pipe specimens. To emphasize the influence of
   time reversal, no complex processing techniques, such as adaptive
   channel equalization or error correction coding, were employed.}},

Abstract = {{The L1(0) phase in FePt films with compositions in the range of 47-50
   at.\%Pt is found to form more readily (lower kinetic ordering
   temperatures), to have a higher degree of tetragonality (lower c/a), to
   be more perfectly ordered (higher values of the order parameter) and to
   have higher values of magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant compared to
   compositions outside of this range. It is argued that the ease of L1(0)
   formation, as measured by the kinetic ordering temperature, and the more
   perfect ordering of the L1(0) phase, as measured by the order parameter,
   are related to the higher atomic mobilities in films with compositions
   in this optimal range. Comparison of experimental results from
   isothermal kinetic experiments with predicted results using kinetic data
   from nonisothermal experiments and different assumptions regarding the
   nucleation of the L1(0) phase shows that the L1(0) formation kinetics is
   best described by growth from a fixed density of preexisting nuclei
   (athermal nucleation).}},

Abstract = {{We present modeling of a novel device structure with possible
   application as a heat assisted magnetic recording source. The structure
   consists of a mesa of GaAs containing InAs quantum dots (QD's), on a
   GaAs substrate. An Au dot atop the MESA is in proximity to a HAMR
   medium. The Au dot acts as a resonant absorber of the QDemission and
   also provides coupling between the optical transducer and recording
   medium. The device is illuminated through the substrate, with light that
   is absorbed by the QD's and re-emitted at a longer wavelength,
   characteristic of the dots. For varied polarization of the QD light
   emission, finite element modeling was used to compute the
   electromagnetic field structure of the device, along with the resultant
   temperature field in the recording medium and the device. We show that
   certain polarization emission are preferable for attaining more intense
   excitation of resonance in the Au dot atop the mesa. Temperature ratios
   (medium versus the Au dots) greater than 60 times were seen, due to the
   good heat sinking of the Au dot provided by the GaAs mesa and substrate.
   Coupling efficiencies between the device and medium were low, with
   typically less than 0.3\% of the power emitted by all radiators coupling
   into the full-width half-maximum of the medium hot spot. While
   improvements may be possible, even at low efficiency this device shows
   promise in keeping the near field transducer cool relative to the
   medium.}},

   Two-step-deposited RuAl layers are developed to make a more open
   microstructure. By sputtering the top RuAl layers at low power and high
   Ar pressure, it is shown that there is a one-to-one grain matching

Abstract = {{At the head disk interface (HDI), the stability of the
   perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricant and carbon overcoat (COC) materials
   must be preserved under HAMR conditions. In this work, we investigate
   this issue by comparing the effects of transient versus steady heating
   of Zdol to replicate the precise pulsed heating of the HAMR system.
   These effects include changes in intermolecular lubricant bonding,
   molecular decomposition and desorption. In order to accurately account
   for potential changes in covalent and intermolecular bonds, we utilize
   the cutting-edge molecular simulation method of ab initio molecular
   dynamics. To simulate constant heating, a series of constant temperature
   simulations are performed at temperatures ranging from 300 K-700 K where
   the temperature is maintained via the Nose Hoover thermostat. For the
   transient heating simulations, the temperature is ramped over 100 K
   intervals with initial temperatures ranging from 300 K to 700 K. These
   heating studies are performed for bulk PFPE systems as well as PFPE-COC
   configurations to highlight the effect of PFPE-COC adhesion on lubricant
   thermal stability at the HDI. In the PFPE-COC simulations, we evaluate
   the amount of desorption versus decomposition as a function of initial
   temperature. Through our analysis, we are able to reveal the molecular
   mechanism of PFPE depletion as a function of functional group
   composition and, thereby, provide design criteria for lubricant
   molecular architecture in HAMR applications.}},

Abstract = {{MRAM has come into the spotlight as a potential candidate for universal
   memory. In this paper, we introduce chainlink, a concept for
   all-magnetic, nonvolatile memory. Two conductive paths form a chain
   through which data shifts. Each path is composed of short magnetic
   nanowires, or links, that store magnetization representing data bits.
   Data is moved along a link by spin-transfer torque and propagates to an
   adjacent, electrically-insulated link in the opposite path via magnetic
   coupling. Distinct phases of current pulses are applied to the paths to
   ensure the operation is fully digital and collision of data tokens is
   avoided. Multiple shift registers can be addressed with all magnetic
   elements; no transistors are required to access each bitcell.
   Micromagnetic and SPICE simulation of bit propagation and architecture
   elements demonstrate successful operation with 30 MA/cm(2), 2 ns current

Abstract = {{It is well known that the environment in which micromechanical systems
   operate significantly affects their performance. It is, therefore,
   important to characterize micromachine behavior in environments where
   the humidity, pressure, and chemical composition of the ambient can be
   precisely controlled. Achieving such a level of environmental control
   presents significant challenges in view of the required instrumentation.
   To that end, a custom micromachine characterization system is built that
   allows for full environmental control (pressure, humidity, and gas
   composition) while retaining full micromachine characterization
   techniques (long working distance interferometry, electrical probe
   connectivity, actuation scripting capability). The system also includes
   an effective in situ surface cleaning mechanism. As an example of the
   system's utility, a microcantilever crack healing experiment is
   conducted and surface adhesion energy measurements are tracked over time
   after a step change in humidity is applied. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic biodegradable elastomers are an emerging class of materials
   that play a critical role in supporting innovations in bioabsorbable
   medical implants. This paper describes the synthesis and
   characterization of poly(glycerol-co-sebacate)-cinnamate (PGS-CinA), a
   biodegradable elastomer based on hyperbranched polyesters derivatized
   with pendant cinnamate groups. PGS-CinA can be prepared via
   photodimerization in the absence of photoinitiators using monomers that
   are found in common foods. The resulting network exhibits a Young's
   modulus of 50.5-152.1 kPa and a projected in vitro degradation half-life
   time between 90 and 140 days. PGS-CinA elastomers are intrinsically
   cell-adherent and support rapid proliferation of fibroblasts. Spreading
   and proliferation of fibroblasts are loosely governed by the substrate
   stiffness within the range of Young's moduli in PGS-CinA networks that
   were prepared. The thermo-mechanical properties, biodegradability and
   intrinsic support of cell attachment and proliferation suggest that
   PGS-CinA networks are broadly applicable for use in next generation
   bioabsorable materials including temporary medical devices and scaffolds
   for soft tissue engineering. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   cross-linked polyester networks based on Diels-Alder coupling reactions.
   Hyperbranched furan-modified polyester precursors based on
   poly(glycerol-co-sebacate) are coupled with bifunctional maleimide
   cross-linking agents. The chemical and thermomechanical properties of
   the elastomers are characterized at various stages of network formation.
   Experimental observations of gel formation are compared to theoretical
   predictions derived from Flory-Stockmayer relationships. This
   cross-linking strategy confers unique advantages in processing and
   properties including the ability to fabricate biodegradable
   reconfigurable covalent networks without. additional catalysts or
   reaction byproducts. Reconfigurable biodegradable networks. Using
   Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions permit the fabrication of
   shape-memory polymers with complex permanent geometries. Biodegradable
   elastomers based on polyester networks with molecular reconfigurability
   achieve vastly expanded properties and processing capabilities for
   potential applications in medicine and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization analysis of short DNA and RNA targets presents many
   challenges for detection. The commonly employed sandwich hybridization
   approach cannot be implemented for these short targets due to
   insufficient probe-target binding strengths for unmodified DNA probes.
   Here, we present a method capable of rapid and stable sandwich
   hybridization detection for 22 nucleotide DNA and RNA targets. Stable
   hybridization is achieved using an n-alkylated, polyethylene glycol
   gamma-carbon modified peptide nucleic acid (gamma PNA) amphiphile. The
   gamma PNA's exceptionally high affinity enables stable hybridization of
   a second DNA-based probe to the remaining bases of the short target.
   Upon hybridization of both probes an electrophoretic mobility shift is
   measured via interaction of the n-alkane modification on the gamma PNA
   with capillary electrophoresis running buffer containing nonionic
   surfactant micells. We find that sandwich hybridization of both probes
   is stable under multiple binding configurations and demonstrate single
   base mismatch discrimination. The binding strength of both probes is
   also stabilized via coaxial stacking on adjacent hybridization to
   targets. We conclude with a discussion on the implementation of the
   proposed sandwich hybridization assay as a high-throughput microRNA
   detection method.}},

   Flexible Transparent Conductive Films}},
Journal = {{JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{A flexible transparent electrically conductive film (FTCF) was formed on
   a poly(ethylene terephthalate) film by spraying single-walled carbon
   nanotubes dispersed with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate in water and,
   to improve the electrical conductivity of FTCF, the effect on plasma
   treatment followed by nitric acid treatment was investigated. The Ar
   plasma treatment was effective in dissociating the surfactant and
   removing impurities attached to the surface of the carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs). Therefore, through a cyclic treatment composed of an Ar plasma
   treatment and nitric acid treatment, more effective removal of
   surfactant and impurities attached to the spray-coated CNTs could be
   obtained than a cyclic treatment without the plasma treatment. With the
   optimized cyclic treatment, the sheet resistance (Omega(s)) of the
   spray-coated CNTs could be decreased up to 45\% by removing most of the
   surfactant and impurities. Using the repeated cyclic treatment, the FTCF
   having the Omega(s) of 160 Omega/Pi at 81.5\% optical transmittance at
   the wavelength of 550nm could be obtained. (C) 2013 The Japan Society of

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization
   problems using algorithms that require only the availability of
   objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to
   these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing
   number of applications in science and engineering, the development of
   derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it
   has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many
   derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also
   appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms,
   followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using
   a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex
   problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were
   tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria,
   including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex
   problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal
   solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that
   the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes
   with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study,
   TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on
   average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality
   within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local
   solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and
   TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a
   near-optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{Buffer leakage in aluminum gallium nitride/gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN)
   heterostructure transistors is recognized as an issue that has
   deleterious consequences on device performance for high-power,
   high-frequency transistors and has been related to the presence of
   uncharged threading screw dislocations. In this study, we demonstrate
   that measurements of buffer leakage in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown
   on bulk gallium nitride (GaN) substrates are consistent with a mechanism
   based on the concept of dislocations acting as quantum wires in series
   with unintentional silicon (Si) impurity incorporation at the bulk GaN
   substrate/GaN buffer interface. The number of electronic channels N
   deduced from the leakage data using Landauer's formula for the quantum
   resistance of N electronic channels is consistent with the number of
   dislocations along the ohmic contact pads determined from panchromatic
   cathodoluminescence and x-ray diffraction measurements of the
   dislocation density. This mechanism is consistent with Shockley's
   suggestion that dislocations can act as one-dimensional conductors due
   to the presence of edge states along the dislocation core.}},

   logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) to show that
   placing ICT in schools does have significant spill-over effects outside
   schools. This effect is larger for ICT in primary schools than secondary
   schools, and larger in schools with both Internet and computers than
   schools with just computers. The effects are observed in households of
   all incomes and educational levels. Considering these spill-over effects
   when allocating resources should lead to greater welfare gains for the
   amount of resources spent. The study also finds that there is a sizable
   portion of the adult population that chooses not to use ICT even after
   adopting this ICT in their households for their children, thereby
   eliminating any barriers to use related to cost and convenience. For
   this group, policy-makers should seek ways to decrease other impediments
   to ICT use, such as increasing ICT literacy through training. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the
   interaction between a faceted pore and an anisotropic grain boundary
   (GB). Nickel was chosen as a convenient model system. In order to
   establish the equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) of the pore, studies were
   also conducted on isolated pores. Isolated pores were found to be
   subject to the nucleation inhibition of equilibration that has been
   predicted by Rohrer et al. (J Am Ceram Soc 2000;83:214, 2001;84: 2099).
   This work shows that configurations close to the ECS can be obtained if
   supersaturation within a pore is artificially increased by adding mobile
   adatoms to the internal surfaces of the pores. In the case of pores
   located at GBs, the nucleation energy barriers to facet displacement are
   not present for facets in contact with the GB at the triple line, but
   may still persist for facets that have no contact with the GB. This
   problem can be overcome by approaching the equilibrium shape from
   different initial configurations. The configuration of the GB in the
   vicinity of the pore has been found to be essentially planar, indicating
   that GB puckering in the vicinity of anisotropic pores is not generally
   necessary. The present calculations show that incompatibilities between
   misoriented pore facets that meet at the triple line with the GB are
   easily accommodated by local atomic rear-rangements at the disordered
   region of intersection with the GB. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The reactor modeling and recipe optimization of conventional semibatch
   polyether polyol processes, in particular for the polymerization of
   propylene oxide to make polypropylene glycol, is addressed. A rigorous
   mathematical reactor model is first developed to describe the dynamic
   behavior of the polymerization process based on first-principles
   including the mass and population balances, reaction kinetics, and
   vapor-liquid equilibria. Next, the obtained differential algebraic model
   is reformulated by applying a nullspace projection method that results
   in an equivalent dynamic system with better computational performance.
   The reactor model is validated against plant data by adjusting model
   parameters. A dynamic optimization problem is then formulated to
   optimize the process recipe, where the batch processing time is
   minimized, given a target product molecular weight as well as other
   requirements on product quality and process safety. The dynamic
   optimization problem is translated into a nonlinear program using the
   simultaneous collocation strategy and further solved with the interior
   point method to obtain the optimal control profiles. The case study
   result shows a good match between the model prediction and real plant
   data, and the optimization approach is able to significantly reduce the
   batch time by 47\%, which indicates great potential for industrial
   applications. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J,

Abstract = {{Particle-based modeling approaches, such as the discrete element method,
   require the definition of accurate contact (collision) models. An
   essential parameter within these models is the coefficient of
   restitution (e), which mathematically defines the ratio of postcollision
   to precollision relative velocity during the collision of two materials.
   More generally, the coefficient of restitution provides a way of
   accounting for the kinetic energy lost during the collision of
   materials. This becomes important during particle-particle and
   particle-boundary collisions in both dry granular and multiphase flow
   models. This work studies e for particle-boundary type collisions
   through detailed experimental investigations of falling spheres
   colliding with thin stationary plates over a range of impact velocities.
   The results of these studies are also examined against analytical
   formulations for the coefficient of restitution. Experiments are
   performed on various sphere-plate material combinations, which include
   several tribologically relevant materials, such as low-carbon steel,
   tungsten carbide, and NiTiNOL 60. Experimental results for metallic
   material combinations displayed a decreasing trend in e for increased
   impact velocities. These metallic combinations also showed the lowest
   overall e values, whereas collisions involving glass showed the highest
   e values.}},

Abstract = {{Brines generated from oil and natural gas production, including flowback
   water and produced water from hydraulic fracturing of shale gas, may
   contain elevated concentrations of bromide (similar to 1 g/L). Bromide
   is a broad concern due to the potential for forming brominated
   disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment.
   Conventional treatment processes for bromide removal is costly and not
   specific. Selective bromide removal is technically challenging due to
   the presence of other ions in the brine, especially chloride as high as
   30-200 g/L. This study evaluates the ability of solid graphite
   electrodes to selectively oxidize bromide to bromine in flowback water
   and produced water from a shale gas operation in Southwestern PA. The
   bromine can then be outgassed from the solution and recovered, as a
   process well understood in the bromine industry. This study revealed
   that bromide may be selectively and rapidly removed from oil and gas
   brines (similar to 10 h(-1) m(-2) for produced water and similar to 60
   h(-1) m(-2) for flowback water). The electrolysis occurs with a current
   efficiency between 60 and 90\%, and the estimated energy cost is similar
   to 6 kJ/g Br. These data are similar to those for the chlor-alkali
   process that is commonly used for chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide
   production. The results demonstrate that bromide may be selectively
   removed from oil and gas brines to create an opportunity for
   environmental protection and resource recovery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The current clinical management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
   disease is based to a great extent on measuring the aneurysm maximum
   diameter to decide when timely intervention is required. Decades of
   clinical evidence show that aneurysm diameter is positively associated

   causing or predisposing the AAA to rupture. Geometric factors such as
   vessel tortuosity, intraluminal thrombus volume, and wall surface area
   are implicated in the differentiation of ruptured and unruptured AAAs.
   Biomechanical factors identified by means of computational modeling
   techniques, such as peak wall stress, have been positively correlated
   with rupture risk with a higher accuracy and sensitivity than maximum
   diameter alone. The objective of this review is to examine these
   factors, which are found to influence AAA disease progression, clinical

Abstract = {{Interfacial phenomena between the wafer and the polishing pad during
   chemical mechanical polishing are an area of great interest as they
   affect post-chemical mechanical polishing wafer topographies.
   Traditionally, the Reynolds equation has been used to predict the fluid
   pressure between the wafer and the polishing pad. However, with
   computational fluid dynamics it is possible to predict the fluid
   pressure and obtain insight into the fluid motion at the leading edge
   and trailing edge of the wafer. Additionally, computational fluid
   dynamics allows for the added ability to increase the resolution of the
   fluid physics to the asperity scale. In this study, a model is developed
   to predict phenomena related to mixed lubrication chemical mechanical
   polishing using computational fluid dynamics. Contact mechanics between
   the wafer and the pad are resolved through a Winkler elastic foundation
   formulation. The wafer is mounted on a ball joint which allows free
   rotation to occur. Friction between the wafer and the polishing pad
   causes the wafer to assume a position which produces a sub-ambient
   pressure distribution similar to that obtained from experiments. The
   effects of different table speeds on the interfacial fluid pressure, as
   predicted by the computational fluid dynamics are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental approach to analyze radial and axial
   error motions of miniature ultra-high-speed (UHS) spindles. The present
   work focuses on identifying the sources of error motions and quantifying
   them, specifically for the UHS spindles with hybrid ceramic bearings.
   Since effective application of micromachining processes, which commonly
   utilize miniature UHS spindles, require a high level of dimensional
   accuracy, form accuracy, and surface finish, the (unwanted) motions of
   the UHS spindles (and the associated tool-tip runout) must be
   well-understood. In this work, a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV)-based
   measurement technique is used to measure radial and axial motions of the
   spindle from a sphere-on-stem precision artifact. The influence of
   temperature fluctuations, dynamically-induced effects, contact-bearing
   defects, and tool-attachment errors are analyzed. The spindle speeds are
   varied from 40 krpm to 160 krpm, and the over-hang lengths of 15 mm and
   7.5 mm are considered. The variations arising from tool attachment to
   the collet are also studied. It is seen that (1) the thermal state of
   the spindle exhibits a cyclic behavior that results in significant
   changes to the spindle motions, (2) spindle speed and over-hang length
   significantly affect the spindle motions, and (3) the variations arising
   from the tool attachment to the collet can be described using a normal
   distribution, and may cause more than +/- 50\% amplitude variations to
   the spindle motions. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{API650-2008 is one of the prominent codes consisting of seismic
   specifications to design steel storage tanks for earthquakes resistance.
   In spite of the code's broad application, there are some failure modes
   such as slide bottom, elephant-foot buckling, sloshing and uplift
   needing more evaluation. In this paper, 161 existing tanks in an oil
   refinery complex have been classified into 24 groups and investigated
   using both API650-2008 rules and numerical FEM models. Failure modes and
   dynamic characteristics of studied models have been calculated by
   numerical FEM analysis and compared with code requirements. The results
   demonstrate that, in some cases, there are some imperfections in the
   code requirements that require further investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-order cubic Hermite finite elements have been valuable in modeling
   cardiac geometry, fiber orientations, biomechanics, and
   electrophysiology, but their use in solving three-dimensional problems
   has been limited to ventricular models with simple topologies. Here, we
   utilized a subdivision surface scheme and derived a generalization of
   the ``local-to-global{''} derivative mapping scheme of cubic Hermite
   finite elements to construct bicubic and tricubic Hermite models of the
   human atria with extraordinary vertices from computed tomography images
   of a patient with atrial fibrillation. To an accuracy of 0.6 mm, we were
   able to capture the left atrial geometry with only 142 bicubic Hermite
   finite elements, and the right atrial geometry with only 90. The left
   and right atrial bicubic Hermite meshes were G1 continuous everywhere
   except in the one-neighborhood of extraordinary vertices, where the mean
   dot products of normals at adjacent elements were 0.928 and 0.925. We
   also constructed two biatrial tricubic Hermite models and defined fiber
   orientation fields in agreement with diagrammatic data from the
   literature using only 42 angle parameters. The meshes all have good
   quality metrics, uniform element sizes, and elements with aspect ratios
   near unity, and are shared with the public. These new methods will allow
   for more compact and efficient patient-specific models of human atrial
   and whole heart physiology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy and environmental technology is one of the most important debates
   among citizens and the government of Finland. As development of
   renewable energy utilization depends on geographical situation, the
   policy and strategic decisions of renewable promotion should focus more
   on regionals studies. Ostrobothnia and its capital Vaasa are among the
   best regions with high potentials of new renewable energy resources
   including wind power, smart grids, biofuels, and geothermal energy in
   Finland. However, high penetration of renewable energies creates
   challenges from supply chain viewpoint including environmental grid
   operators and maintain reliable service. This article discusses the
   development and performance of renewables supply chain in Ostrobothnia
   region and Vaasa city. The presented framework provides managerial
   insights to policy makers of governments and municipalities, as well as
   researchers and other stockholders to consider different aspects of
   diffusion of renewable energy technologies in the regional levels. The

Abstract = {{The objective of the current study is to provide the foundation for a
   computerized training platform for cryosurgery. Consistent with clinical
   practice, the training process targets the correlation of the frozen
   region contour with the target region shape, using medical imaging and
   accepted criteria for clinical success. The current study focuses on
   system design considerations, including a bioheat transfer model,
   simulation techniques, optimal cryoprobe layout strategy, and a
   simulation core framework. Two fundamentally different approaches were
   considered for the development of a cryosurgery simulator, based on a
   finite-elements (FE) commercial code (ANSYS) and a proprietary
   finite-difference (FD) code. Results of this study demonstrate that the
   FE simulator is superior in terms of geometric modeling, while the FD
   simulator is superior in terms of runtime. Benchmarking results further
   indicate that the FD simulator is superior in terms of usage of memory
   resources, preprocessing, parallel processing, and post-processing. It
   is envisioned that future integration of a human-interface module and
   clinical data into the proposed computer framework will make
   computerized training of cryosurgery a practical reality.}},

Abstract = {{We present exergy and economic analyses of two advanced fossil fuel
   power plants configurations: an integrated gasification combined cycle
   with advanced H-2 and O-2 membrane separation including CO2
   sequestration (Adv. IGCC-CCS) and an integrated gasification fuel cell
   cycle with a catalytic gasifier and a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell
   including CO2 sequestration (Adv. IGFC-CCS). The goal of the exergy
   analysis was to evaluate the power generation and the exergy destruction
   of each of the major components. We estimated the capital, labor, and
   fuel costs of these power plants, and then calculated the internal rate
   of return on investment (IRR) and the levelized cost of electricity
   (LCOE). In the Adv. IGFC-CCS case, we chose a configuration with anode
   gas recycle back to the gasifier, and then varied the SOFC pressure to
   find the optimal pressure under this particular configuration. Using a
   base load generation price of electricity of \$50/MWh, the IRR of the
   Adv. IGFC-CCS configuration was 4 +/- 3\%/yr if the CO2 can be used for
   EOR and 1 +/- 3\%/yr if the CO2 can only be sequestered in a saline
   aquifer. The IRR of the Adv. IGCC-CCS configuration with H-2 and O-2
   membrane separation was 8 +/- 4\%/yr if the CO2 can be used for enhanced
   oil recovery (EOR) and 3 +/- 3\%/yr if the CO2 must be sequestered in a
   saline aquifer. The uncertainty here reflects the uncertainty in capital
   costs, operation \& maintenance (O\&M) costs, and CO2 sequestration
   costs.
   One goal of the economic analysis was to compare the IRR and LCOE of
   these configurations with the IRR and LCOE of other fossil fuel power
   plant configurations. For example, using capital/labor/maintenance cost
   estimates from the literature, we calculated the IRR and LCOE of
   conventional fossil fuel power plant configurations, including scenarios
   with CCS and scenarios with varying costs to emit CO2. We also present
   results on which power plant configuration yields the lowest value of
   LCOE as a function of the price of CO2 emissions and a function of the
   price of natural gas, holding all other variables constant. An Adv.
   IGCC-CCS-EOR configuration yields the lowest value of LCOE when the
   price of natural gas and the price of CO2 emissions are above the line
   between (\$5/GJ, \$10/tCO(2)) and (\$2.5/GJ, \$50/tCO(2)). Published by

Abstract = {{The compositional heterogeneity associated with polymer conjugation
   reactions of biomolecules is analyzed for the particular case of
   nonspecific PEGylation reactions. It is shown that the distribution of
   the number of PEG moieties grafted to biomolecules such as proteins is a
   binomial-type function of two parametersthe reaction efficiency as well
   as the number of binding sites per biomolecule. The nature of this
   distribution implies that uniform compositions are favored for
   increasing number of coupling sites per biomolecule as well as for
   increasing efficiency of the modification process. Therefore, the
   binomial distribution provides a rationale for the pronounced
   heterogeneity that is observed for PEGylated small enzyme systems even
   at high coupling efficiencies. For the particular case of PEGylated
   trypsin it is shown that the heterogeneity results in a broad
   distribution of deactivation times that is captured by a stretched
   exponential decay model. The presented analysis is expected to apply to
   general modification processes of compounds in which partial
   functionalization of a fixed number of reactive sites is achieved by
   means of a nonspecific coupling reaction. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Quasi-Immiscible Spreading of Aqueous Surfactant Solutions on Entangled
   Aqueous Polymer Solution Subphases}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the possibility of enhancing aerosol drug delivery to
   mucus-obstructed lungs, the spreading of a drop of aqueous surfactant
   solution on a physically entangled aqueous poly(acrylamide) solution
   subphase that mimics lung airway surface liquid was investigated. Sodium
   dodecyl sulfate was used as the surfactant. To visualize spreading of
   the drop and mimic the inclusion of a drug substance, fluorescein, a
   hydrophilic and non-surface-active dye, was added to the surfactant
   solution. The spreading progresses through a series of events. Marangoni
   stresses initiate the convective spreading of the drop. Simultaneously,
   surfactant escapes across the drop's contact line within a second of
   deposition and causes a change in subphase surface tension outside the
   drop on the order of 1 mN/m. Convective spreading of the drop ends
   within 2-3 s of drop deposition, when a new interfacial tension balance
   is achieved Surfactant escape depletes the drop of surfactant, and the
   residual drop takes the form of a static lens of nonzero contact angle.
   On longer time scales, the surfactant dissolves into the subphase. The
   lens formed by the water in the deposited drop persists for as long as 3
   min after the convective spreading process ends due to the long
   diffusional time scales associated with the underlying entangled polymer
   solution. The persistence of the lens suggests that the drop phase
   behaves as if it were immiscible with the subphase during this time
   period Whereas surfactant escapes the spreading drop and advances on the
   subphase/vapor interface, hydrophilic dye molecules in the drop do not
   escape but remain with the drop throughout the convective spreading. The
   quasi immiscible nature of the spreading event suggests that the
   chemical properties of the surfactant and subphase are much less
   important than their physical properties, consistent with prior
   qualitative studies of spreading of different types of surfactants on
   entangled polymer subphases: the selection of surfactant for pulmonary
   delivery applications may be limited only by physical and toxicological
   considerations. Further, the escape of surfactant from individual drops
   may provide an additional spreading mechanism in the lung, as
   hydrodynamic and/or surface pressure repulsions may drive individual
   droplets apart after deposition.}},

Abstract = {{High levels of emissions of ozone-depleting substances and. greenhouse
   gases from supermarkets around the world can be attributed to the
   leakage of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and the generation of electric
   power required for retail food refrigeration. Indirect refrigeration
   loops are ideally suited for reductions mandated by regulation standards
   because they reduce leakage and can lead to significantly lower total
   energy consumption. Hence, the design and identification of fluids that
   boost refrigeration performance while meeting safety and environmental
   guidelines is of considerable interest. Using a recently developed
   molecular design methodology (Samudra and Sahinidis, AIChE J., published
   online Apr 25, 2013, 10.1002/aic.14112) as our starting point, in this
   work, we developed a model and search technique for identifying ideal
   secondary refrigerants. Accurate property models that predict
   characteristic refrigerant properties guided the search for molecules.
   We also included environmental and safety metrics {[}biodegradability
   and lethal concentration. (LC50)], along with performance criteria for
   heat transfer efficiency, to analyze the candidate molecules. We
   identified a number of novel molecules as well as known compounds that
   have not been used as secondary refrigerants.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in enabling lead-free
   solder reflow in RF fields and improved mechanical properties that

   FeCo MNP and the use of AC magnetic fields to achieve localized reflow.
   Electron microscopy of the as-reflowed samples show a decrease in the
   volume of Sn dendrite regions as well as smaller and more homogeneously
   dispersed Ag3Sn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) with increasing MNP
   concentrations. Mechanical properties of the composites were measured by
   nanoindentation. In pure solder samples and solder composites with 4 wt.
   \% MNP, hardness values increased from 0.18 GPa to 0.20 GPa and the
   modulus increased from 39.22 GPa to 71.22 GPa. The stress exponent,
   reflecting creep resistance, increased from 12.85 of pure solder to
   16.47 for solder composites with 4 wt. \% MNP. Enhanced mechanical
   properties as compared with the as-prepared solder joints are explained
   in terms of grain boundary and dispersion strengthening resulting from
