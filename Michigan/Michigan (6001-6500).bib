Abstract = {{While the use of SMA-actuated devices continues to grow in many
   industries, current device limitations pose a challenge to successful
   adoption for certain classes of applications. SMA-actuated devices
   typically demonstrate motion with non-constant velocity due to the
   non-linear thermo-mechanically coupled behavior of SMA material
   transformation, and motion sensitivity to external factors such as
   voltage and load. This variation in motion can lead to the perception of
   poor device quality, limiting SMA-actuated devices to applications
   hidden from the sight of the product user, or requiring them to be
   augmented with higher cost controls to improve the motion quality.
   Therefore, a need exists for simple, passive, low-cost device
   technologies that enable the designer to prescribe desired motion
   characteristics with relative insensitivity to fluctuation in operating
   conditions. This paper presents a Damper Controlled Switch (DCS)
   mechanism that delivers constant velocity and relative insensitivity to
   operating conditions when combined with a standard SMA wire actuator.
   The DCS includes a damper that acts against a spring to open a switch
   when the velocity exceeds a tunable threshold. To validate the ability
   of the DCS to provide the desired motion quality, experiments were
   conducted comparing the normal motion of the SMA actuator to the motion
   produced when the same actuator was fitted with a DCS prototype. The
   addition of the DCS produced nearly constant actuator velocity,
   performing significantly better than the SMA actuator alone. The
   tunability of the DCS was demonstrated producing a wide range of
   attainable constant velocities. Finally, a set of experiments explored
   the DCS's sensitivity to voltage and load, indicating a low sensitivity
   to a wide range of operating parameters for which the operating limits
   were identified. The DCS represents a simple, compact technology based
   on passive, low-cost components, providing a very practical solution
   that will enable integration of SMA-actuated devices into a broader
   class of applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents multipoint high-fidelity aerostructural
   optimizations of a long-range wide-body transonic transport aircraft
   configuration. The aerostructural analysis employs Euler computational
   fluid dynamics with a 2-million-cell mesh and a structural
   finite-element model with 300,000 degrees of freedom. The coupled
   adjoint sensitivity method is used to efficiently compute gradients,
   enabling the use of gradient-based optimization with respect to hundreds
   of aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables. The NASA Common
   Research Model is used as the baseline configuration, together with a
   wing box structure that was designed for this study. Two design
   optimization problems are solved: one where takeoff gross weight is
   minimized, and another where fuel burn is minimized. Each optimization
   uses a multipoint formulation with five cruise conditions and two
   maneuver conditions. Each of the optimization problems have 476 design
   variables, including wing planform, airfoil shape, and structural
   thickness variables. Optimized results are obtained within 36 h of wall
   time using 435 processors. The resulting optimal configurations are
   discussed and analyzed for the aerostructural tradeoffs resulting from
   each objective. The takeoff gross weight minimization results in a 4.2\%
   reduction in takeoff gross weight with a 6.6\% fuel burn reduction,
   whereas the fuel-burn optimization resulted in an 11.2\% fuel burn
   reduction with no significant change in the takeoff gross weight.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for uncertainty propagation in hypersonic aeroelastic and
   aerothermoelastic analyses is presented. First, the aeroelastic
   stability of a typical section representative of a control surface on a
   hypersonic vehicle is examined. Variability in the uncoupled natural
   frequencies of the system is modeled using beta probability
   distributions. Uncertainty in the flutter Mach number is computed using
   stochastic collocation. Next, the stability of an aerodynamically heated
   panel representing a component of the skin of a hypersonic vehicle is
   considered. In this case, uncertainty is due to the location of
   transition from laminar to turbulent flow and the heat flux prediction.
   The effect of propagating these uncertainties on vehicle behavior is
   determined. For both cases, uncertainty is treated using stochastic
   collocation, which is a new and effective approach for incorporating
   uncertainty in this class of problems.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries are now used in a wide range of applications, and
   much knowledge has been accumulated in the relevant physical phenomena.
   However, the application of this knowledge in battery design still
   relies on an inefficient manual process, in large part due to
   limitations in existing computational models. To address this, a
   multi-scale model is developed that incorporates microscopic simulation
   data for effective ion diffusivity and electronic conductivity, and
   interfacial electrochemical kinetics, into a macroscopic homogeneous
   model at the cell scale. Microscopic physics-based models are applied to
   3D microstructures, and automated simulations are performed for
   statistically significant averaging of the results. A surrogate model
   couples the length scales by precomputing solutions based on a design of
   experiments. Results for the porosity-tortuosity relationship are
   compared to experimental data in the literature, and global sensitivity
   analysis is performed to quantify the relative impact of ion
   concentration and electric potential distribution on the electrochemical
   kinetics profile. The resulting multi-scale model successfully
   reproduces the microscopic solution while retaining the computational
   efficiency of the macroscopic homogeneous model. These attributes make
   it a suitable candidate for implementation in an automated simulation
   and optimization framework that may lead to a more efficient design
   process for high performance batteries. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Title = {{Crystal Surface and State of Charge Dependencies of Electrolyte
   Decomposition on LiMn2O4 Cathode}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{E3059-E3065}},
Abstract = {{First principles calculations are used to study the initial
   decomposition reactions of ethylene carbonate (EC) on the (111) surface
   of LiMn2O4 (LMO), a candidate for Li ion battery (LIB) cathode.
   Theoretical studies of interfacial reactions are particularly timely due
   to recent experiments on the effect of LMO crystal morphology on battery
   cyclability and interfacial film stability {[}J.-S. Kim, K. Kim, W. Cho,
   W. H. Shin, R. Kanno, and J. W. Choi, Nano Lett., 12, 6358-6365 (2012)].
   We find that EC degradation is a two-step reaction. The first step is
   the rate determining reaction where a proton is abstracted from EC and
   transferred to the surface. The second step involves ring opening of the
   proton abstracted EC which turns out to have a smaller barrier. Both of
   these reactions are sensitive to the Li content, i.e. state of charge,
   of the model electrode. EC degradation via H-abstraction becomes a
   feasible reaction route when the cathode becomes more highly charged.

Abstract = {{The augmented Lagrangian (AL) optimization method has drawn more
   attention recently in imaging applications due to its decomposable
   structure for composite cost functions and empirical fast convergence
   rate under weak conditions. However, for problems, e.g., X-ray computed
   tomography (CT) image reconstruction, where the inner least-squares
   problem is challenging, the AL method can be slow due to its iterative
   inner updates. In this paper, using a linearized AL framework, we
   propose an ordered-subsets (OS) accelerable linearized AL method,
   OS-LALM, for solving penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) X-ray CT
   image reconstruction problems. To further accelerate the proposed
   algorithm, we also propose a deterministic downward continuation
   approach for fast convergence without additional parameter tuning.
   Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly
   accelerates the ``convergence{''} of X-ray CT image reconstruction with
   negligible overhead and exhibits excellent gradient error tolerance when
   using many subsets for OS acceleration.}},

Abstract = {{It is beneficial to study tumor angiogenesis and microenvironments by
   imaging the microvasculature and cells at the same time. Photoacoustic
   microscopy (PAM) is capable of sensitive three-dimensional mapping of
   microvasculature, while fluorescence microscopy may be applied to
   assessment of tissue pathology. In this work, a fiber-optic based PAM
   and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) dual-modality imaging system
   was designed and built, serving as a prototype of a miniaturized
   dual-modality imaging probe for endoscopic applications. As for the
   design, we employed miniature components, including a
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner, a miniature objective
   lens, and a small size optical microring resonator as an acoustic
   detector. The system resolutions were calibrated as 8.8 mu m in the
   lateral directions for both PAM and CFM, and 19 mu m and 53 mu m in the
   axial direction for PAM and CFM, respectively. Images of the animal
   bladders ex vivo were demonstrated to show the ability of the system in
   imaging not only microvasculature but also cellular structure.}},

Abstract = {{For three-dimensional imaging of optical absorbance, the existing
   technology of photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has quite poor axial
   resolution, the tens of microns to hundreds of microns. This is despite
   the fact that PAM has recently achieved lateral resolutions on the order
   of a micron or submicron, comparable to that of optical microscopy. In
   this paper, a pure optical photoacoustic microscopy (POPAM) with optical
   rastering of a focused excitation beam and optically sensing of the
   photoacoustic signal using a microring resonator was developed with the
   super broad bandwidth of the system more than 350MHz. With unprecedented
   broad bandwidth of POPAM, 3.8 mu m axial resolution was achieved without
   deconvolution processing. Sectioning imaging ability along axial
   direction presenting 3D morphologic features was shown based on imaging
   printed phantom. The impact of this approach will be similar to how
   confocal optical microscopy revolutionized the conventional optical
   microscopy by enabling the axial sectioning capability. Tissue imaging
   comparing POPAM and conventional PAM based on needle hydrophone
   demonstrated that though such broad bandwidth compromised the
   sensitivity of POPAM 4.35 times than that of conventional PAM, the noise
   equivalent detectable pressure (NEDP) was estimated as 74Pa, still able
   to get the tissue imaging.}},

Title = {{Monte-Carlo simulations of PAMAM dendrimer-DNA interactions}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{5325-5336}},
Abstract = {{We use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the influence of poly(amido
   amine) (PAMAM) dendrimer size and charge on its interactions with
   double-stranded DNA conformation and interaction strength. To achieve a
   compromise between simulation speed and molecular detail, we combine the
   coarse-grained DNA model of de Pablo et al. which resolves each DNA base
   using three beads - and thereby retains the double-helix structure -
   with a dendrimer model with resolution similar to that of the DNA. The
   resulting predictions of the effects of dendrimer generation, dendrimer
   surface charge density, and salt concentration on dendrimer-DNA
   complexes are in agreement with both experiments and all-atom MD
   simulations. The model predicts that DNA wraps a fully charged G5 or G6
   dendrimer at low salt concentration (10 mM) similarly to a histone
   octamer, and for the G5 dendrimer, DNA super helices with both
   handednesses occur. At salt concentrations above 50 mM, or when a high
   fraction of dendrimer surface charges are neutralized by acetylation,
   DNA adheres but does not compactly wrap the dendrimer, in agreement with
   experimental findings. We are also able to simulate pairs of dendrimers
   binding to the same DNA strand. Thus, our mesoscale simulation not only
   elucidates dendrimer-DNA interactions, but also provides a methodology
   for efficiently simulating chromatin formation and other cationic
   macroion-DNA complexes.}},

Title = {{Use of CdTe quantum dots for high temperature thermal sensing}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{24612-24618}},
Abstract = {{An optical-thermal experimental system, in which CdTe quantum dots (QDs)
   were used as thermal sensors, is developed for micro-electromechanical
   system (MEMS) temperature measurements in the high temperature range
   (>70 degrees C). Laboratory-prepared CdTe QDs with suitably controlled
   synthesis conditions show excellent temperature sensitivity. For orange
   emitting CdTe QDs, calibration from a type A micro-heater yields a
   linear relation between the spectral peak shift and the temperature over
   the temperature range of 27 degrees C to 170 degrees C, the last being
   the highest temperature of the heater achieved in our current
   optical-thermal experimental setup. This linear relation is consistent
   with the predictions for semiconductor quantum systems from the
   principle of thermo-quantum mechanics for the temperature above the
   Debye point. Analysis of the experimental data indicates that the orange
   emitting QDs possess a thermally-induced spectral-shift sensitivity of
   0.34 nm degrees C-1, which is approximately about 2-3 times better than
   reported. The excellent repeatability and accuracy of the calibrated
   orange emitting CdTe QDs as thermal sensors are further demonstrated by
   applying them in monitoring electric thermal characteristics of type B
   MEMS structures. While calibration is for up to 170 degrees C, the
   temperature of up to 212 degrees C for the type B MEMS heater was
   measured with a satisfactory accuracy using the CdTe QDs, further
   demonstrating the stability of the thermal-spectral properties of the
   QDs. The existence of a unique ``burnout{''} spectrum in the temperature
   dependent PL spectra also suggests that optical-thermally sensitive QDs
   can be applied in both monitoring the temperature development and
   diagnosing circuit breakout due to over-heating.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{2410-2417}},
Abstract = {{While high-throughput planar patch-clamp instruments are now established
   to perform whole-cell recordings for drug screening, the conventional
   micropipette-based approach remains the gold standard for performing
   cell-attached single-channel recordings. Generally, planar platforms are
   not well-suited for such studies due to excess noise resulting from low
   seal resistances and the use of substrates with poor dielectric
   properties. Since these platforms tend to use the same pore to position
   a cell by suction and establish a seal, biological debris from the cell
   suspension can contaminate the pore surface prior to seal formation,
   reducing the seal resistance. Here, femtosecond laser ablation was used
   to fabricate dual-pore glass chips optimized for use in cell-attached
   single-channel recordings that circumvent this problem by using
   different pores to position a cell and to establish a seal. This
   dual-pore design also permitted the use of a relatively small patch
   aperture (D similar to 150 to 300 nm) that is better-suited for
   establishing high-resistance seals than the micropores used typically in
   planar patch-clamp setups (D similar to 1 to 2 mu m) without
   compromising the ability of the device to position a cell. Taking
   advantage of the high seal resistances and low capacitive and dielectric
   noise realized using glass substrates, patch-clamp experiments with
   these dual-pore chips consistently achieved high seal resistances (rate
   of gigaseal formation = 61\%, mean seal resistance = 53 G Omega),
   maintained gigaseals for prolonged durations (up to 6 hours), achieved
   RMS noise values as low as 0.46 pA at 5 kHz bandwidth, and enabled
   single-channel recordings in the cell-attached configuration that are
   comparable to those obtained by conventional patch-clamp.}},

   blood using surfacemicromachined microfiltration membranes}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{2565-2575}},
Abstract = {{White blood cells (WBCs) constitute about 0.1\% of the blood cells, yet
   they play a critical role in innate and adaptive immune responses
   against pathogenic infections, allergic conditions, and malignancies and
   thus contain rich information about the immune status of the body. Rapid
   isolation of WBCs directly from whole blood is a prerequisite for any
   integrated immunoassay platform designed for examining WBC phenotypes
   and functions; however, such functionality is still challenging for
   blood-on-a-chip systems, as existing microfluidic cell sorting
   techniques are inadequate for efficiently processing unprocessed whole
   blood on chip with concurrent high throughput and cell purity. Herein we
   report a microfluidic chip for continuous-flow isolation and sorting of
   WBCs from whole blood with high throughput and separation efficiency.
   The microfluidic cell sorting chip leveraged the crossflow filtration
   scheme in conjunction with a surface-micromachined
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfiltration membrane (PMM) with high
   porosity. With a sample throughput of 1 mL h(-1), the microfluidic cell
   sorting chip could recover 27.4 +/- 4.9\% WBCs with a purity of 93.5 +/-
   0.5\%. By virtue of its separation efficiency, ease of sample recovery,
   and high throughput enabled by its continuous-flow operation, the
   microfluidic cell sorting chip holds promise as an upstream component
   for blood sample preparation and analysis in integrated blood-on-a-chip
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical Retained Foreign Objects (RFOs) cause significant morbidity and
   mortality. They are associated with \$1.5 billion annually in
   preventable medical costs. The detection accuracy of radiographs for
   RFOs is a mediocre 59\%. We address the RFO problem with two
   complementary technologies: a three dimensional (3D) Gossypiboma Micro
   Tag (mu Ta) that improves the visibility of RFOs on radiographs, and a
   Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system that detects the mu Tag. The 3D
   geometry of the mu Tag produces a similar 2D depiction on radiographs
   regardless of its orientation in the human body and ensures accurate
   detection by a radiologist and the CAD. We create a database of
   cadaveric radiographs with the mu Tag and other common man-made objects
   positioned randomly. We develop the CAD modules that include
   preprocessing, mu Tag enhancement, labeling, segmentation, feature
   analysis, classification and detection. The CAD can operate in a high
   specificity mode for the surgeon to allow for seamless workflow
   integration and function as a first reader. The CAD can also operate in
   a high sensitivity mode for the radiologist to ensure accurate
   detection. On a data set of 346 cadaveric radiographs, the CAD system
   performed at a high specificity (85.5\% sensitivity, 0.02 FPs/image) for
   the OR and a high sensitivity (96\% sensitivity, 0.73 FPs/image) for the
   radiologists.}},

Title = {{Modeling the Impact of Rescinding Michigan's Primary and Secondary Seat
   Belt Laws on Death and Injury from Passenger Vehicle Crashes}},
Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{701-705}},
Abstract = {{Background: Seat belts are the most effective method of decreasing fatal
   and nonfatal motor vehicle crash injury. Advocacy groups have recently
   been successful in enacting repeals of mandatory motorcycle helmet laws
   in several states. In some states, this has prompted renewed efforts
   aimed at repealing mandatory seat belt laws.
   Purpose: To evaluate and quantify the potential impact of rescinding
   seat belt laws on annual crash-related fatalities, nonfatal injuries,
   and associated economic costs, using Michigan as a model, to inform the
   national debate.
   Methods: Proportional injury rates were calculated utilizing
   police-reported statewide passenger vehicle crash data from 1999 and
   2002, where belt use rates approximate estimates associated with repeal
   of primary and secondary seat belt laws. Proportional rates were applied
   to the most recent year of crash data (2011) to estimate changes in
   statewide fatalities and nonfatal injuries. National cost estimates were
   applied to injury data to calculate associated economic costs.
   Results: Full repeal of the seat belt law is estimated to result in an
   additional 163 fatalities, 13,722 nonfatal injuries, and an associated
   societal cost of \$1.6 billion annually. Repeal of the primary seat belt
   law only is estimated to result in an additional 95 fatalities, 9156
   nonfatal injuries, and an associated societal cost of \$1.0 billion
   annually.
   Conclusions: This analysis suggests that repealing the either the
   primary or full seat belt law would have a substantial and negative
   impact on public health, increasing motor vehicle crash related
   fatality, nonfatal injury, and associated economic costs.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of the Radio Aurora Explorer mission is to study
   plasma instabilities that lead to magnetic field aligned irregularities
   of electron density in the lower polar ionosphere (80-400 km). These
   irregularities are known to disrupt communication and navigation
   signals. The Radio Aurora Explorer mission uses a bistatic radar
   configuration; the spacecraft is the radar receiver and the transmitters
   are several worldwide incoherent scatter radars of which the primary
   radar is located in Poker Flat, Alaska. The satellites are 3 kg,
   university-class CubeSats with a primary payload of a direct-conversion
   radar receiver operating in the frequency range from 426 to 510 MHz. The
   satellite bus has a novel configuration of processing, attitude control,
   and antenna design that met the physical constraints of the CubeSat form
   factor and the one-year schedule constraint imposed by launch dates. Two
   satellites have launched: RAX-1 on 19 November 2010 onboard a
   Minotaur-IV rocket from Kodiak, Alaska, and RAX-2 on 28 October 2011
   onboard a Delta-II rocket from Vandenberg U.S. Air Force Base,
   California. RAX-2 has detected and measured irregularities during
   multiple experiments over Alaska and Canada. Preliminary analysis
   indicates unprecedented characterization of the irregularities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a novel form of a well-known signal processing
   technique, so as to be applicable to the interaction between a heavy
   truck and a supporting bridge structure. Motivated by the problem of
   structural health monitoring of bridges, a new modal coherency function
   is defined. This relates the input action of moving wheel loads to the
   dynamic response of the bridge, including the effects of unevenness of
   the road surface and the vertical dynamics of the truck suspension. The
   analysis here is specifically aimed at future experimental testing - the
   validation of axle load estimators obtained from sensors on the truck.
   It is applicable even when no independent `ground truth' for the dynamic
   loads is available. The approach can be more widely used in the analysis
   of dynamic interactions involving suspended moving loads on deformable
   structures, e.g. for structural vibrations due to high-speed trains.}},

Abstract = {{Component mal-alignment in total knee arthroplasty has been associated
   with increased revision rates and poor clinical outcomes. A significant
   source of variability in traditional, jig-based total knee arthroplasty
   is the performance of the surgeon. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the most sensitive steps in the femoral and tibia arthroplasty
   procedures. A computational model of the total knee arthroplasty
   procedure was created, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed that
   included surgeon variability in each step of the procedure. The
   proportion of well-aligned components from the model agrees with
   clinical literature in most planes. When components must be aligned
   within +/- 3 degrees in all planes, component alignment was most
   sensitive to the accuracy of identifying the lateral epicondyle for the
   femoral component, and to the precision of the transverse plane
   alignment of the extramedullary guide for the tibial component. This
   model can be used as a tool for evaluating different procedural
   approaches or sources of variability to improve the quality of the total
   knee arthroplasty procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell-based therapies have shown promise in enhancing repair of bone
   and cartilage. Marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are typically
   expanded in vitro to increase cell number, but this process is lengthy,
   costly, and there is a risk of contamination and altered cellular
   properties. Potential advantages of using fresh uncultured bone marrow
   mononuclear cells (BMMC) include heterotypic cell and paracrine
   interactions between MSC and other marrow-derived cells including
   hematopoietic, endothelial, and other progenitor cells. In the present
   study, we compared the osteogenic and chondrogenic potential of freshly
   isolated BMMC to that of cultured-expanded MSC, when encapsulated in
   three-dimensional (3D) collagen-chitosan microbeads. The effect of low
   and high oxygen tension on cell function and differentiation into
   orthopedic lineages was also examined. Freshly isolated rat BMMC (25 x
   10(6) cells/mL, containing an estimated 5 x 10(4) MSC/mL) or purified
   and culture-expanded rat bone marrow-derived MSC (2 x 10(5) cells/mL)
   were added to a 65-35 wt\% collagen-chitosan hydrogel mixture and
   fabricated into 3D microbeads by emulsification and thermal gelation.
   Microbeads were cultured in control MSC growth media in either 20\% O-2
   (normoxia) or 5\% O-2 (hypoxia) for an initial 3 days, and then in
   control, osteogenic, or chondrogenic media for an additional 21 days.
   Microbead preparations were evaluated for viability, total DNA content,
   calcium deposition, and osteocalcin and sulfated glycosaminoglycan
   expression, and they were examined histologically. Hypoxia enhanced
   initial progenitor cell survival in fresh BMMC-microbeads, but it did
   not enhance osteogenic potential. Fresh uncultured BMMC-microbeads
   showed a similar degree of osteogenesis as culture-expanded
   MSC-microbeads, even though they initially contained only 1/10th the
   number of MSC. Chondrogenic differentiation was not strongly supported
   in any of the microbead formulations. This study demonstrates the
   microbead-based approach to culturing and delivering cells for tissue
   regeneration, and suggests that fresh BMMC may be an alternative to
   using cultureexpanded MSC for bone tissue engineering.}},

   electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries. TPPi facilitates the
   formation of SEI, resulting in a smaller interfacial impedance and a
   better rate performance. The addition of about 5 wt\% TPPi greatly
   reduces the polarization voltage, stabilizing the cycle performance of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Engineering the internal structure of bulk semiconductors through the
   introduction of nanometer-scale interfaces affords opportunities for
   simultaneous optimization of electronic and thermal transport
   properties, enabling the fabrication of nanocomposite materials with
   superior thermoelectric performance. Several compositions of n-type
   Ti0.4Hf0.6Ni1+zSb0.975Sn0.025 half-Heusler (HH)/full-Heusler (FH)
   composites were synthesized by a high temperature solid state reaction
   of the elements. Polycrystalline powders of the resulting HH(1 -
   z)/FH(z) composites were further processed by mechanical alloying using
   high-energy ball milling. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies
   revealed the presence of small (similar to 20 nm) FH precipitates
   coherently embedded in micron-scale grains of HH/FH composites obtained
   after the solid state reaction, whereas nanometer-scale grains (similar
   to 20 nm) of the HH/FH composites containing very small (<10 nm) FH
   precipitates were observed in mechanically alloyed samples (SS-MA). The
   as-synthesized HH(1 - z)/FH (z) samples (SS) showed similar electrical
   conductivity, thermopower and thermal conductivity at all temperatures
   regardless of the fractions of FH inclusions. This suggests that the FH
   inclusions are electronically inert with regard to the matrix.
   Interestingly, drastic alterations of all three properties were observed
   on mechanically alloyed samples and the magnitude of change in various
   properties increases with the mole fractions of FH inclusions. For
   example, large reductions in the thermal conductivity (8.5 W K-1 m(-1)
   to 4.0 W K-1 m(-1) at 300 K) as well as electrical conductivity (4750 S
   cm(-1) to 1750 S cm(-1) at 300 K) were observed in all SS-MA samples
   compared to SS samples with similar compositions. This behavior is
   attributed to enhanced scattering of phonons and electrons at multiple
   grain boundaries generated by the mechanical alloying process.
   Remarkably, the magnitude of the reduction in the electrical and thermal
   conductivities increases with the mole fraction of FH inclusions in the
   samples suggesting (1) reduction in the carrier density due to trapping
   of low-energy carriers and (2) additional phonon scattering at
   nanometer-scale HH/FH interfaces. This results in large increases in the
   thermopower (-60 mu V K-1 to -92 mV K-1 at 300 K) of SS-MA samples,
   which mitigates the drop in the electrical conductivity leading to large
   improvement of the figures of merit of mechanically alloyed
   Ti0.4Hf0.6Ni1+zSb0.975Sn0.025 samples.}},

   applications. We present novel injectable photocurable biodegradable
   hydrogels based on methacrylated poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(glycerol
   sebacate) copolymers (PEGS-M), which show good hydration properties and
   an easy in situ gelation process by photopolymerization under
   physiological conditions. The swelling ratio, mechanical properties and
   biodegradation behavior of PEGS-M hydrogels were demonstrated to be
   controllable by tuning the degree of methacrylation of the copolymer. We
   further fabricated monodisperse spherical PEGS-M microgels with
   different diameters ranging from 154.2 +/- 2.0 to 403.9 +/- 3.6 mu m via
   a microfluidic chip. Rabbit bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (BMSCs) encapsulated in situ in the PEGS-M hydrogel by photocrosslinking
   maintained their viability for two weeks, demonstrating the good
   biocompatibility of PEGS-M hydrogels for long-term cell cultivation. All
   these data suggest that cell-encapsulated PEGS-M hydrogels and microgels
   have potential application as injectable tissue engineering scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{Culturing cells in three-dimensional (3D) environments has been shown to
   significantly influence cell function, and may provide a more
   physiologically relevant environment within which to study the behavior
   of specific cell types. 3D tissues typically present a topologically
   complex fibrous adhesive environment, which is technically challenging
   to replicate in a controlled manner. Micropatterning technologies have
   provided significant insights into cell-biomaterial interactions, and
   can be used to create fiber-like adhesive structures, but are typically
   limited to flat culture systems; the methods are difficult to apply to
   topologically-complex surfaces. In this work, we utilize crack formation
   in multilayered microfabricated materials under applied strain to
   rapidly generate well-controlled and topologically complex `fiber-like'
   adhesive protein patterns, capable of supporting cell culture and
   controlling cell shape on three-dimensional patterns. We first
   demonstrate that the features of the generated adhesive environments
   such as width, spacing and topology can be controlled, and that these
   factors influence cell morphology. The patterning technique is then
   applied to examine the influence of fiber structure on the nuclear
   morphology and actin cytoskeletal structure of cells cultured in a
   nanofibrous biomaterial matrix.}},

Abstract = {{While the promise of implementing slow light into integrated photonic
   circuitry offers all-optical processing and next-generation
   functionality such as scalable quantum information processing, serious
   problems associated with both the intrinsic and extrinsic physics of
   slow light threaten to compromise real-world implementations. In this
   work, we offer a practical implementation of slow light that is not
   affected by these issues. When slow light is actualized below certain
   length scales, it can used to enhance the functionality of already
   optimized photonic architectures and enable novel capabilities. One such
   important capability is to highly couple and correlate out-of-plane
   phenomena, such as optical trapping or single-photon extraction, with
   in-plane optical processing, such as interferometry and optical
   transmission in a compact area. We first present the theoretical
   arguments for such an implementation and then present two applications
   where local slow light engineering enables important functionality:
   scalable quantum information circuitry and compact single-molecule

   then used to study single-patch Janus particles with different
   interaction strengths and patch sizes with particle area coverage
   greater than similar to 0.63. Our results show an interplay between
   translational and orientational order. We observe a lamellar phase, a
   fluid phase and a rotator close-packed structure. The lamellar phase is
   shown to have a different range of stability than previously observed in
   simulation studies for systems of similar and longer-ranged

Abstract = {{Traditionally, polymer photonic devices are fabricated using clean-room
   processes such as photolithography, e-beam lithography, reactive ion
   etching (RIE) and lift-off methods etc, which leads to long fabrication
   time, low throughput and high cost. We have utilized a novel process for
   fabricating polymer photonic devices using a combination of imprinting
   and ink jet printing methods, which provides high throughput on a
   variety of rigid and flexible substrates with low cost. We discuss the
   manufacturing challenges that need to be overcome in order to realize
   true implementation of roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible polymer
   photonic systems. Several metrology and instrumentation challenges
   involved such as availability of particulate-free high quality
   substrate, development and implementation of high-speed in-line and
   off-line inspection and diagnostic tools with adaptive control for
   patterned and unpatterned material films, development of reliable
   hardware, etc need to be addressed and overcome in order to realize a
   successful manufacturing process. Due to extreme resolution requirements
   compared to print media, the burden of software and hardware tools on
   the throughput also needs to be carefully determined. Moreover, the
   effect of web wander and variations in web speed need to accurately be
   determined in the design of the system hardware and software. In this
   paper, we show the realization of solutions for few challenges, and
   utilizing these solutions for developing a high-rate R2R dual stage
   ink-jet printer that can provide alignment accuracy of < 10 mu m at a
   web speed of 5m/min. The development of a roll-to-roll manufacturing
   system for polymer photonic systems opens limitless possibilities for
   the deployment of high performance components in a variety of
   applications including communication, sensing, medicine, agriculture,
   energy, lighting etc.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the properties and growth kinetics of defect-free,
   photoluminescence (PL) efficient mushroom-like nanowires (MNWs) in the
   form of similar to 30nm thick hexagonal-shaped InGaN-nanodisk on GaN
   nanowires, coexisting with the conventional rod-like InGaN-on-GaN
   nanowires (RNWs) on (111)-silicon-substrate. When characterized using
   confocal microscopy (CFM) with 458nm laser excitation, while measuring
   spontaneous-emission at fixed detection wavelengths, the spatial
   intensity map evolved from having uniform pixelated emission, to having
   only an emission ring, and then a round emission spot. This corresponds
   to the PL emission with increasing indium composition; starting from
   emission mainly from the RNW, and then the 540 nm emission from one MNWs
   ensemble, followed by the 590 nm emission from a different MNW ensemble,
   respectively. These hexagonal-shaped InGaN-nano-disks ensembles were
   obtained during molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) growth. On the other hand,
   the regular rod-like InGaN-on-GaN nanowires (RNWs) were emitting at a
   shorter peak wavelength of 490 nm. While the formation of InGaN rod-like
   nanowire is well-understood, the formation of the hexagonal-shaped
   InGaN-nanodisk-on-GaN-nanowire requires further investigation. It was
   postulated to arise from the highly sensitive growth kinetics during
   plasma-assisted MBE of InGaN at low temperature, i.e. when the substrate
   temperature was reduced from 800 degrees C (GaN growth) to <600 degrees
   C (InGaN growth), during which sparsely populated metal-droplet
   formation prevails and further accumulated more indium ad-atoms due to a
   higher cohesive bond between metallic molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Occupant behavior has a substantial impact on the total energy
   consumption in buildings. To reduce consumption much work has been done
   investigating behavioral energy-use interventions (e.g.,feedback). Being
   able to accurately identify effective interventions for specific
   buildings or communities of buildings based on local conditions has
   significant implications for reducing energy consumption and demand in
   buildings. Therefore, recently researchers have begun developing
   predictive models of these behavioral interventions. However, limited
   consideration has been given to the importance that modeling assumptions
   (regarding social network type and structure) have in determining impact
   on intervention outcome. In this paper, an integrated model that
   combines established social-psychological principles of social influence
   and cultural norm diffusion with building social network profiles is
   developed and tested to examine the effect of social network type and
   structure on interventions. The writers apply agent-based modeling to
   simulate the interactions of heterogeneous building occupants in their
   respective social networks to examine the importance of social network
   type and structure for two interventions, as follows: (1)installing a
   peer energy-use feedback system, and (2)installing a feedback system and
   inserting an intervening agent into the building. The results indicate
   that network type and structure can have a significant effect on the
   time required for occupant energy-use intervention outcomes to reach a
   state of equilibrium. Thus, when modeling and selecting behavioral
   interventions, expected interventions outcomes should not be assumed
   based solely on generalized results from other studies, but
   consideration must be given to specific social network properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a conceptual framework that couples energy modeling with
   occupancy characteristics and energy use data is developed and tested to
   achieve two main objectives: (1)couple distinct and spatially
   distributed simulation models and synchronize their data exchange, and
   (2)illustrate the coupled model behavior through a hypothetical case
   study example of a building. This conceptual framework is developed
   using a distributed computing environment based on the principles
   defined in the high-level architecture (HLA). Thus, individual
   simulation models and control interfaces developed for their own
   purpose, called federates, are composed and coupled together in an
   HLA-compliant federation that allows federates to continuously
   communicate with one another and exchange relevant information at each
   time step to achieve the global objective of reducing the building's
   energy use. A case study example of a typical commercial building
   illustrates how the model coordinates data synchronization and transfer
   between federates, which run simultaneously in a distributed fashion.
   This example tests the effect of energy intervention scenarios, namely,
   feedback frequency to building occupants on the building's energy use,
   and it illustrates the potential application of the framework to study
   energy interventions in buildings.}},

Title = {{Framework to Evaluate Energy-Saving Potential from Occupancy
   Interventions in Typical Commercial Buildings in the United States}},

Abstract = {{Occupancy-focused interventions to reduce building energy use have been
   shown to be effective but often result in unsustained energy reductions.
   In addition, these interventions have rarely been applied to commercial
   buildings. Research on residential buildings has linked the success of
   these interventions to the buildings' social structures. However, the
   results cannot be directly applied to commercial buildings given their
   complex social structures formed by independent entities
   (i.e.,companies) with different organizational structures and cultures
   within a building. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework is
   developed to (1)provide a more realistic representation of social
   subnetworks in commercial buildings, (2)model interactions between
   occupants and the resulting peer pressure to change their energy-use
   characteristics based on the relative agreement interaction model, and
   (3)evaluate the efficiency of occupancy interventions for different
   subnetwork characteristics on a typical medium-sized office building in
   the United States. Statistical analyses are performed and
   recommendations made on how to improve energy conservation from
   occupancy interventions by as much as 24.7\%. The contributions of this
   research to the fields of computing and energy conservation are
   significant and can be used to shape future occupancy interventions for
   more effective and sustained energy reductions in commercial buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic devices offer novel techniques to address biological and
   biomedical issues. Standard microfluidic fabrication uses
   photolithography to pattern channels on silicon wafers with high
   resolution. Even the relatively straightforward SU8 and soft lithography
   in microfluidics require investing and training in photolithography,
   which is also time consuming due to complicated thick resist procedures,
   including sensitive substrate pretreatment, coating, soft bake, expose,
   post-exposure bake, and developing steps. However, for applications
   where low resolution (> 200 mu m) and high turn-around (> 4 designs/day)
   prototyping are met with little or no lithography infrastructure,
   robotic cutters {[}1] offer flexible options for making glass and PDMS
   microfluidics. We describe the use of robotics cutters for designing
   microfluidic geometries, and compliment it with safe glass etching, with
   depths down to 60 mu m. Soft lithography patterning of 200 mu m thick
   PDMS membrane was also explored. Without high equipment investment and
   lengthy student training, both glass and PDMS microfluidics can be
   achieved in small facilities using this technique.}},

Title = {{Vibration Suppression of a Large Beam Structure Using Tuned Mass Damper
   and Eddy Current Damping}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{For a few decades, various methods to suppress the vibrations of
   structures have been proposed and exploited. These include passive
   methods using constrained layer damping (CLD) and active methods using
   smart materials. However, applying these methods to large structures may
   not be practical because of weight, material, and actuator constraints.
   The objective of the present study is to propose and exploit an
   effective method to suppress the vibration of a large and heavy beam
   structure with a minimum increase in mass or volume of material.
   Traditional tuned mass dampers (TMD) are very effective for attenuating
   structural vibrations; however, they often add substantial mass. Eddy
   current damping is relatively simple and has excellent performance but
   is force limited. The proposed method is to apply relatively
   light-weight TMD to attenuate the vibration of a large beam structure
   and increase its performance by applying eddy current damping to a TMD.
   The results show that the present method is simple but effective in
   suppressing the vibration of a large beam structure without a
   substantial weight increase.}},

Abstract = {{The thermoelectric behavior of n-type Sb-doped half-Heusler
   (HH)-full-Heusler (FH) nanocomposites with general composition
   Ti0.1Zr0.9Ni1+xSn0.975Sb0.025 (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.1) was investigated
   in the temperature range from 300 to 775 K. Samples used for structural
   characterization and transport measurements were obtained through the
   solid-state reaction of high purity elements at 950 degrees C and
   densification of the resulting polycrystalline powders using a uniaxial
   hot press. X-ray diffraction study of the powder samples suggested the
   formation of single-phase HH alloys regardless of the Ni concentration
   (x value). However, high resolution transmission electron microscopy
   investigation revealed the presence of spherical nanoprecipitates with a
   broad size distribution coherently embedded in the HH matrix. The size
   range and dispersion of the precipitates depend on the concentration of
   Ni in the starting mixture. Well dispersed nanoprecipitates with size
   ranging from 5 nm to 50 nm are observed in the nanocomposite with x =
   0.04, while severe agglomeration of large precipitates (>50 nm) is
   observed in samples with x = 0.1. Hall effect measurements of various
   samples indicate that the carrier concentration within the Sb-doped HH
   matrix remains nearly constant (similar to 7 x 10(20) cm(-3)) for
   samples with x = 0.02 and x = 0.04, whereas a significant increase of
   the carrier concentration to similar to 9 x 10(20) cm(-3) is observed
   for the sample with x = 0.1. Interestingly, only a marginal change in
   thermopower value is observed for various samples despite the large
   difference in the carrier density. In addition, the carrier mobility
   remains constant up to x = 0.04 suggesting that the small
   nanoprecipitates in these samples do not disrupt electronic transport
   within the matrix. Remarkably, a large reduction in the total thermal
   conductivity is observed for all nanocomposites, indicating the
   effectiveness of the embedded nanoprecipitates in scattering phonons
   while enabling efficient electron transfer across the matrix/inclusion
   interfaces.}},

Title = {{Microfluidic device (ExoChip) for on-chip isolation, quantification and
   characterization of circulating exosomes}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1891-1900}},
Abstract = {{Membrane bound vesicles, including microvesicles and exosomes, are
   secreted by both normal and cancerous cells into the extracellular space
   and in blood circulation. These circulating extracellular vesicles
   (cirEVs) and exosomes in particular are recognized as a potential source
   of disease biomarkers. However, to exploit the use of circulatory
   exosomes as a biomarker, a rapid, high-throughput and reproducible
   method is required for their isolation and molecular analysis. We have
   developed a simple, low cost microfluidic-based platform to isolate
   cirEVs enriched in exosomes directly from blood serum allowing
   simultaneous capture and quantification of exosomes in a single device.
   To capture specific exosomes, we employed ``ExoChip{''}, a microfluidic
   device fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and functionalized with
   antibodies against CD63, an antigen commonly overexpressed in exosomes.
   Subsequent staining with a fluorescent carbocyanine dye (DiO) that
   specifically labels the exosomes, we quantitated exosomes using a
   standard plate-reader. Ten independent ExoChip experiments performed
   using serum obtained from five pancreatic cancer patients and five
   healthy individuals revealed a statistically significant increase (2.34
   +/- 0.31 fold, p < 0.001) in exosomes captured in cancer patients when
   compared to healthy individuals. Exosomal origins of ExoChip immobilized
   vesicles were further confirmed using immuno-electron-microscopy and
   Western blotting. In addition, we demonstrate the ability of ExoChip to
   recover exosomes with intact RNA enabling profiling of
   exosomal-microRNAs through openarray analysis, which has potential
   applications in biomarker discovery. Based on our findings, ExoChip is a
   well suited platform to be used as an exosome-based diagnostic and
   research tool for molecular screening of human cancers.}},

Title = {{Self-assembled 3D biocompatible and bioactive layer at the
   macro-interface via graphene-based supermolecules}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3563-3575}},
Abstract = {{Research on the interface self-assembly of functional layers is fuelled
   by diverse biomedical needs, like drug encapsulation and release, stem
   cell proliferation and differentiation, cell and tissue cultures, as
   well as artificial organs. In this study, a novel and biocompatible 3D
   composite layer is fabricated on a membrane substrate by the
   layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly of graphene-based 2D supermolecules.
   The graphene-based 2D supermolecules are prepared by grafting
   poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS, polyanion) and poly(acrylamide) (PAM,
   polycation) onto graphene oxide (GO) through free radical
   polymerization. Then, the prepared graphene-based supermolecules are
   taken to construct a 3D porous thin film layer through a LBL process.
   Polyethersulfone (PES) membrane is chosen as the model substrate. The
   chemical composition, surface morphology, water contact angle, surface
   zeta-potential, blood compatibility and the cell compatibility are
   systematically investigated. The results indicate that the 2D
   graphene-based supermolecules are successfully assembled into a 3D
   porous thin film layer structure on the membrane surface. The assembled
   layer shows increased hydrophilicity, suppressed platelet adhesion, and
   a limited hemolysis ratio and complement activation compared to the
   pristine substrate. The cell morphology observation and cytotoxicity
   assays demonstrate that the 3D graphene layer shows superior performance
   both in endothelial and hepatocyte cells proliferation and morphology
   differentiation. In addition, the excellent anticoagulant bioactivities
   indicate that the 2D graphene-based supermolecules have
   heparin-mimicking biological activity. In general, the protocol of
   interface thin film layer self-assembly confers the modified substrates
   with integrated blood compatibility, cell proliferation and biological
   activity; which may forward the fabrication of multi-functional
   biomedical devices by using the 2D graphene-based supermolecules.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{3541-3552}},
Abstract = {{The lock-and-key colloidal particles of Sacanna et al. are novel
   ``dynamic{''} building blocks consisting of a central spherical
   colloidal particle (key) attached to a finite number of dimpled
   colloidal particles (locks) via depletion interactions strong enough to
   bind the particles together but weak enough that the locks are free to
   rotate around the key. This rotation imbues a mechanical
   reconfigurability to these colloidal ``molecules{''}. Here we use
   molecular simulation to predict that these lock-and-key building blocks
   can self-assemble into a wide array of complex crystalline structures
   that are tunable via a set of reconfigurability dimensions: the number
   of locks per building block, bond length, size ratio, confinement, and
   lock mobility. We demonstrate that, with reconfigurability, ordered
   structures - such as random triangle square tilings - assemble, despite
   being kinetically inaccessible with non-reconfigurable but similar
   building blocks.}},

   Compared to previously reported models, the direct fit model improved

Abstract = {{Current damping identification methodologies typically require
   measurements of complex eigenvalues, complex eigen-vectors, and the
   applied force. Also, these methods can be sensitive to measurement

   frequency response of a system to identify modal damping in regions of
   (low and) high modal density. This method does not require knowledge of
   the absolute forcing, rather only the relative forcing is needed.
   Results are presented for a mistuned blisk, and the proposed method is

   irreversibility described by using the compression and expansion
   efficiencies, variable specific heats, and losses due to heat transfer
   and friction is investigated by using finite-time thermodynamics.
   Artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for predicting the thermal
   efficiency and power output values versus the minimum and the maximum
   temperatures of the cycle and also the compression ratio. Results show
   that the first-law efficiency and the output power reach their maximum
   at a critical compression ratio for specific fixed parameters. The
   first-law efficiency increases as the heat leakage decreases; however
   the heat leakage has no direct effect on the output power. The results
   also show that irreversibilities have depressing effects on the
   performance of the cycle. Finally, a comparison between the results of
   the thermodynamic analysis and the ANN prediction shows a maximum
   difference of 0.181\% and 0.194\% in estimating the thermal efficiency
   and the output power. The obtained results in this paper can be useful
   for evaluating and improving the performance of practical Diesel
   engines.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Microspheres and in situ formed hydrogels are widely used in drug
   delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and convenient
   administration. However, both of them often show burst-release behavior.
   To overcome this disadvantage, a new composite system combining the
   advantages of microspheres and injectable hydrogels was prepared via
   mixing drug-loaded alginate microspheres with poly(D,
   L-lactide-co-glycolide- b-ethylene glycol-b-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)
   (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) hydrogels without using any surfactant or organic
   solvent. Alginate microspheres with tunable size were prepared by an
   electrospinning method. The structure and surface morphology of
   microspheres were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and the rheological properties of the PLGA-PEG-PLGA
   hydrogels were evaluated using a rheometer. 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) and
   theophylline (TP) were chosen as model drugs, and were encapsulated in
   the composite hydrogels. The drug release results demonstrate that this
   combined system could apparently solve the burst-release problem of both
   hydrogels and microspheres and achieve a sustained release through the
   double barriers by greatly reducing the diffusion of water-soluble
   drugs. These results indicate that the double-barrier composite systems
   have great potential application in sustained release systems.}},

   CXCL12 isoforms in breast cancer chemotaxis}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{564-576}},
Abstract = {{Chemokines critically regulate chemotaxis in normal and pathologic
   states, but there is limited understanding of how multicellular
   interactions generate gradients needed for cell migration. Previous
   studies of chemotaxis of CXCR4+ cells toward chemokine CXCL12 suggest
   the requirement of cells expressing scavenger receptor CXCR7 in a
   source-sink system. We leveraged an established microfluidic device to
   discover that chemotaxis of CXCR4 cells toward distinct isoforms of
   CXCL12 required CXCR7 scavenging only under conditions with higher than
   optimal levels of CXCL12. Chemotaxis toward CXCL12-beta and -gamma
   isoforms, which have greater binding to extracellular molecules and have
   been largely overlooked, was less dependent on CXCR7 than the more
   commonly studied CXCL12-alpha. Chemotaxis of CXCR4+ cells toward even
   low levels of CXCL12-gamma and CXCL12-beta still occurred during
   treatment with a FDA-approved inhibitor of CXCR4. We also detected
   CXCL12-gamma only in breast cancers from patients with advanced disease.
   Physiological gradient formation within the device facilitated
   interrogation of key differences in chemotaxis among CXCL12 isoforms and
   suggests CXCL12-gamma as a biomarker for metastatic cancer.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{2598-2605}},
Abstract = {{Materials that solidify in response to an initiation stimulus are
   currently utilized in several biomedical and surgical applications;
   however, their clinical adoption would be more widespread with improved
   physical properties and biocompatibility. One chemistry that is
   particularly promising is based on the thiol-ene addition reaction, a
   radical-mediated step-growth polymerization that is resistant to oxygen
   inhibition and thus is an excellent candidate for materials that
   polymerize upon exposure to aerobic conditions. Here, thiol-ene-based
   hydrogels are polymerized by exposing aqueous solutions of
   multi-functional thiol and allyl ether PEG monomers, in combination with
   enzymatic radical initiating systems, to air. An initiating system based
   on glucose oxidase, glucose, and Fe2+ is initially investigated where,
   in the presence of glucose, the glucose oxidase reduces oxygen to
   hydrogen peroxide which is then further reduced by Fe2+ to yield
   hydroxyl radicals capable of initiating thiol-ene polymerization. While
   this system is shown to effectively initiate polymerization after
   exposure to oxygen, the polymerization rate does not monotonically
   increase with raised Fe2+ concentration owing to inhibitory reactions
   that retard polymerization at higher Fe2+ concentrations. Conversely,
   replacing the Fe2+ with horseradish peroxidase affords an initiating
   system is that is not subject to the iron-mediated inhibitory reactions
   and enables increased polymerization rates to be attained.}},

Abstract = {{Gradient sequence copolymers of 3-hexylthiophene (90 mol\%) and
   3-(6-bromohexyl) thiophene (10 mol\%) were synthesized by catalyst
   transfer polycondensation. Post-polymerization conversion of the
   side-chain bromides into azides and subsequent Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne
   cycloaddition installed C60-functional groups. Comparing blends of
   poly(3- hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
   (PCBM) with and without the gradient copolymer additive revealed that,
   when the gradient copolymer was present, micron-scale phase separation
   was not observed even after prolonged thermal annealing times. In
   addition, the PCBM was still able to quench the P3HT emission after
   thermal annealing, indicating that the donor-acceptor interfacial area
   is maintained. Together, these data suggest that the gradient copolymers
   are an effective compatibilizer for P3HT/PCBM physical blends. This
   stabilized film morphology led to stable power conversion efficiencies
   (PCE) of the corresponding bulk heterojunction solar cells even upon
   extended thermal annealing. Nevertheless, the short circuit current and
   fill factor were reduced when the gradient copolymer was present,
   leading to a lower PCE. Overall, these gradient copolymer additives
   represent a promising tool for inhibiting micron-scale phase separation
   and producing robust polymer/fullerene-based solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles formed in gas phase environments, such as combustion, have
   an important impact on society both as engineering components and
   hazardous pollutants. A new software package, the Stochastic
   Nanoparticle Simulator (SNAPS) was developed, applying a stochastic
   chemical kinetics methodology, to computationally investigate the growth
   of nanoparticle precursors through trajectories of chemical reactions.
   SNAPS was applied to characterize the growth of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), important precursors of carbonaceous nanoparticles
   and soot, in a premixed laminar benzene flame, using a concurrently
   developed PAH growth chemical reaction mechanism, as well as an existing
   benzene oxidation mechanism. Simulations of PAH ensembles successfully
   predicted existing experimentally measured data and provided novel
   insight into chemical composition and reaction pathways. The most
   commonly observed PAH isomers in simulations showed the importance of
   5-membered rings, which contrasts with traditionally assumed
   compositions involving primarily pericondensed 6-membered rings. In
   addition, the chemical growth of PAHs involved complex sequences of
   highly reversible reactions, rather than relatively direct routes of
   additions and ring closures. Furthermore, the most common reactions
   involved 5-membered rings, suggesting their importance to PAH growth.
   The framework developed in this work will facilitate future
   investigation of particle inception and soot formation and will benefit
   engineering of novel combustion technologies to mitigate harmful
   emissions.}},

Abstract = {{During operation of the excimer pumped alkali laser, XPAL, large
   densities of alkali excited states are produced. Through superelastic
   electron collisional relaxation of these states, any pre-existing
   electrons will be heated, leading to additional ionization. The end
   result is plasma formation. A first principles global model has been
   developed for the Ar/Cs XPAL system to investigate the possible
   formation of plasma during high repetition rate, high power pumping; and
   the consequences on laser performance. Four- and five-level pumping
   schemes were used to enable assessment of XPAL operating on the
   Cs(6(2)P(3/2)) -> Cs(6(2)S(1/2)) (852 nm) and Cs(6(2)P(1/2)) ->
   Cs(62S1/2) (894 nm) transitions. The model was parameterized as a
   function of pump power, excitation frequency, cell temperature (Cs vapor
   pressure) and collision mixing agent (N-2) mole fraction. We found that
   at sufficiently high operating temperature, pump power and repetition
   rate, plasma formation in excess of 10(14)-10(16) cm(-3) occurs, which
   potentially reduces laser output power by electron collisional mixing of
   the upper and lower laser levels.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:
   Following an ankle injury, many patients have functional ankle
   instability (FAI) with an increased predisposition to reinjury. The
   purpose of this study was to assess the effects of FAI on ankle
   kinematics and muscle activity during a lateral hop movement.
   Design:
   Cross-sectional and observational study; all data collection for each
   subject was performed on 1 day.
   Setting:
   Clinical biomechanics laboratory.
   Patients:
   Two groups were studied: (1) Control group-no ankle injury (n = 12), and
   (2) FAI group (n = 12).
   Interventions:
   The lateral hop movement consisted of multiple lateral and medial
   1-legged hops over an obstacle (width, 72.5 cm; depth, 25.5 cm; height,
   14.3 cm) onto adjacent force platforms. Each subject was instructed to
   perform as many lateral hops as possible during the 6-second trial.
   Means, SDs, 95\% confidence intervals of the differences, and P-values
   were calculated.
   Main Outcome Measures:
   Ankle kinematics and muscle activity throughout the lateral hop
   movement.
   Results:
   Significant differences existed between groups for mean (SD)
   dorsiflexion ankle positions-FAI 82.4 degrees (6.4) versus normal 75.2
   degrees (10.1) and tibialis anterior normalized muscle activity-FAI 0.27
   (0.21) versus normal 0.16 (0.13) at ground contact.
   Conclusions:
   The FAI group revealed greater tibialis anterior muscle activity and
   dorsiflexion ankle position at contact moving in the lateral direction.
   These differences between groups may have been related to an inherent
   predisposition to ankle injuries, a preexisting difference in task
   performance, a consequence of injuries, or a compensatory adaptation to
   previous injuries.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a methodology for joint feature learning and clustering of
   multichannel extracellular electrophysiological data, across multiple
   recording periods for action potential detection and classification
   (sorting). Our methodology improves over the previous state of the art
   principally in four ways. First, via sharing information across
   channels, we can better distinguish between single-unit spikes and
   artifacts. Second, our proposed ``focused mixture model{''} (FMM) deals
   with units appearing, disappearing, or reappearing over multiple
   recording days, an important consideration for any chronic experiment.
   Third, by jointly learning features and clusters, we improve performance
   over previous attempts that proceeded via a two-stage learning process.
   Fourth, by directly modeling spike rate, we improve the detection of
   sparsely firing neurons. Moreover, our Bayesian methodology seamlessly
   handles missing data. We present the state-of-the-art performance
   without requiring manually tuning hyperparameters, considering both a
   public dataset with partial ground truth and a new experimental dataset.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of our study was to develop a thermoelectrical
   model with both solid and liquid phases to calculate tissue temperature
   during bipolar coagulation of a posterior spinal artery on the spinal
   cord. Control of thermal spread caused by coagulation is a concern in
   spinal surgery. This model utilizes a nonisothermal flow to account for
   the heat transfer due to the movement of cerebrospinal fluid that is
   induced by electrical field and temperature gradient. The model is
   validated by in situ temperature measurements on a porcine spinal cord
   model. The maximum error for tissue temperature of this model is 12.6\%,
   and the overall average error is 4.2\%. The lesional region (>50 degrees
   C) is identified to be as wide as 5 mm, and thermal dose cumulative
   equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C (CEM43) is also calculated with this
   model. The incorporation of nonisothermal flow has been shown to be
   crucial in order to accurately predict thermal dose in tissue. The
   developed model can be further used to establish a guideline for the use
   of bipolar coagulation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Robotics technology is approaching a state where highly capable
   autonomous platforms can directly interact with human companions. This
   paper explores the ability of a human and manipulator to efficiently
   complete independent tasks in a shared physical workspace without
   explicit communication of their planned actions. With focus on
   quantifying the impact of robot presence on human task performance and
   workload, a series of human-subject experiments were conducted in which
   a seated human was asked to perform cognitive and mobility tasks in this
   shared workspace. The manipulator could unintentionally interrupt these
   activities, blocking the field of view or physical path to a worksite
   while completing its own tasks. To avert impending conflict, the robot
   received and reacted to ideal sensor data identifying the human's tasks
   upon initiation. Tests over a progressively complex set of tasks for the
   human-manipulator team were conducted. Results indicate minimal impact
   on a human companion's productivity when a manipulator is introduced to
   the workspace, provided it responds quickly to avoid blocking
   constraints. Future work involves maturation of the robot's perception
   and prediction capabilities followed by additional shared workspace
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Future small unmanned aircraft systems will require careful codesign
   over both physical and cyber elements to maximize total system
   efficiency. Mission objectives and success of the system as a whole are
   becoming increasingly dependent on appropriate allocation of
   computational resources balanced against demands of the physical
   actuation systems. In this paper, a cooptimization scheme is described
   that considers tradeoffs between costs associated with the physical
   actuation effort required for control and the computational effort
   required to acquire and process incoming information. A small unmanned
   aircraft system surveillance mission, the visual inspection of a
   pipeline, is proposed to investigate specifics of cyber-physical cost
   terms and their tradeoffs. A multidisciplinary cost function minimizes
   energy and maximizes mission efficiency and effectiveness. Pareto fronts
   are examined over combinations of competing cyber and physical
   objectives, and they demonstrate that excluding either cyber or physical
   cost terms results in reduced performance for the holistic system over
   the course of the mission.}},

Abstract = {{The North American construction industry has seen a decline in
   productivity for decades due to underlying problems such as lack of team
   collaboration, less initial design input, and higher building systems
   complexity. These problems are most visible in labor-intensive trades,
   such as mechanical contractors. Within the last decade, building
   information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a potential solution to these
   problems. This paper highlights the state of BIM practice in the
   mechanical construction industry. Through an extensive survey and
   interview process, this research resulted in three key outcomes. The
   first is that 58\% of mechanical contractors have less than three years
   of BIM experience and consider themselves as beginners in the use of
   BIM. Second, BIM implementation cost for these contractors is 1\% to 2\%
   of their total project cost estimate. Third, more than 70\% of
   mechanical contractors agree that BIM reduces field conflicts and
   improves coordination. These factors can assist mechanical contractors
   allocate proper resources for BIM implementation in their projects to
   reduce problems.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures such as nanowires and nanotubes
   have been widely explored for anodes with high specific capacity in
   Li-ion batteries, which effectively release the mechanical stress to
   avoid structure pulverization. However, 1-D nanostructures typically
   have a high surface area, which leads to a large irreversible capacity
   in the first cycle due to a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation.
   Two dimensional (2-D) nanowalls can address the same challenges as 1-D
   nanostructures, with a much lower surface area. For the first time, we
   demonstrated a 2-D nanowall structure with silicon for Li-ion batteries.
   Excellent performance for the first Coulombic efficiency (CE) has been
   achieved. Such a 2-D nanowall structure can also be applied in other
   devices with improved performance where nanostructures are needed but a
   high surface area is problematic.}},

Abstract = {{Testing of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket VX-200
   engine was performed over a wide throttle range in a 150m3 vacuum
   chamber with sufficient pumping to permit exhaust plume measurements at
   argon background pressures less than 1x10-3Pa (1x10-5torr) during
   firings, ensuring charge-exchange mean free paths longer than the vacuum
   chamber. Measurements of plasma flux, radio frequency power, propellant
   flow rate, and ion kinetic energy were used to determine the ionization
   cost of argon and krypton in the helicon discharge. Experimental data on
   ionization cost, ion fraction, exhaust plume expansion angle, thruster
   efficiency, and thrust are presented that characterize the VX-200 engine
   performance over a throttling range from 15 to 200kW radio frequency
   power. A semiempirical model of the thruster efficiency as a function of
   specific impulse indicates an ion cyclotron heating efficiency of 85 +/-
   7\%. Operation at a total radio frequency coupled power level of 200kW
   yields a thruster efficiency of 72 +/- 6\% at a specific impulse of 4900
   +/- 300s with argon propellant. A high thrust-to-power operating mode
   was characterized over a wide parameter space with a maximum
   thrust-to-power ratio of 51 +/- 5mN/kW at a specific impulse of 1660 +/-
   100s for a ratio of ion cyclotron heating radio frequency power to
   helicon radio frequency power of 0.7:1.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},

Abstract = {{In nanoparticulate phase-separating electrodes, phase separation inside
   the particles can be hindered during their charge/discharge cycles even
   when a thermodynamic driving force for phase separation exists. In such
   cases, particles may (de)lithiate discretely in a process referred to as
   mosaic instability. This instability could be the key to elucidating the
   complex charge/discharge dynamics in nanoparticulate phase-separating
   electrodes. In this paper, the dynamics of the mosaic instability is
   studied using Smoothed Boundary Method simulations at the particle
   level, where the concentration and electrostatic potential fields are
   spatially resolved around individual particles. Two sets of
   configurations consisting of spherical particles with an identical
   radius are employed to study the instability in detail. The effect of an
   activity-dependent exchange current density on the mosaic instability,
   which leads to asymmetric charge/discharge, is also studied. While we
   show that our model reproduces the results of a porous-electrode model
   for the simple setup studied here, it is a powerful framework with the
   capability to predict the detailed dynamics in three-dimensional complex
   electrodes and provides further insights into the complex dynamics that
   result from the coupling of electrochemistry, thermodynamics, and
   transport kinetics. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{7251-7262}},
Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the influence of methyl
   chain branching on transmembrane potential induced formation of water
   channels in lipid bilayers and ion transport. We compared the response
   of a bilayer lipid that has multiple methyl branches
   diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) with its straight-chain
   counterpart dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) to a transmembrane
   potential created by an imbalance in ionic charges across the membrane.
   We found that, compared to the straight-chain DPPC lipid bilayer
   membranes, branched DPhPC lipid membranes require a higher critical
   transmembrane potential to break down, followed by water channel
   formation, and transport of anions and cations through the pore. We
   demonstrated that the bulkiness of the added methyl branches leads to
   ``barrel-stave{''} pores in DPhPC membranes which require a higher
   transmembrane potential to produce than the toroidal pores produced in
   the straight chain DPPC lipid bilayers. Our results provided a deeper
   understanding of the water channel formation and ion transport through
   lipid bilayer membrane and might help explain the increased resistance
   to charge-induced poration in organisms with membranes abundant in
   branched lipids.}},

   sorting is a fundamental problem in multiobjective optimization and is
   equivalent to finding the canonical antichain partition and to problems
   involving the longest chain among Euclidean points. As an application of
   this result, we show that nondominated sorting is asymptotically stable
   under bounded random perturbations in X-1, ... , X-n. We give a
   numerical scheme for computing the viscosity solution of this
   Hamilton-Jacobi equation and present some numerical simulations for

Abstract = {{Functional degradable biomimetic scaffolds have great potential
   applications in tissue regeneration. Nanofibrous electroactive
   biodegradable scaffolds from chitosan-grafted-aniline tetramer (CS-AT)
   were fabricated by an electrospinning method. The CS-AT was synthesized
   by amidation reaction between the carboxyl group of aniline tetramer and
   the amine group of chitosan. The structure of CS-AT copolymer was
   characterized by H-1 NMR, FT-IR, TGA and XRD. UV-vis and cyclic
   voltammetry tests were used to demonstrate the electroactivity of CS-AT.
   The electrospun nanofibers were created from CS-AT solution. The
   morphology of the CS-AT nanofibers was observed by employing SEM and the
   results illustrated that the diameter of the nanofibers of deposited CS
   and CS-AT samples was controlled by both polymer concentration and the
   AT content. The biocompatibility of the materials was evaluated by cell
   adhesion and proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts and dog chondrocyte cells,
   and the results demonstrated that the CS-AT materials had good
   biocompatibility and greatly enhanced the cell adhesion and
   proliferation of C2C12 cells.}},

Abstract = {{The p-n junction diodes are formed by electrostatic doping using two
   gate electrodes positioned beneath individual, suspended single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs). These devices exhibit nearly ideal diode
   behavior within a small bias voltage range near 0 V. At higher bias
   (>vertical bar 0.2 V vertical bar), nonideal diode behavior is observed
   arising from Schottky contacts formed between the nanotube and its metal
   contact electrodes and the presence of electron tunneling between the N-
   and P-doped regions. We introduce a back-to-back diode model to explain
   the observed current versus voltage (I-V) characteristics. The reverse
   saturation current, parallel resistance, and open-circuit voltage
   dependence on gate voltage provide quantitative evidence for the
   theoretically predicted doping-induced bandgap shrinkage in CNTs. The
   minority carrier lifetimes are also estimated from this model.}},

Pages = {{2880-2890}},
Abstract = {{Electroactive injectable degradable hydrogels have great potential as
   bioactive scaffolds for tissue regeneration. We present the development
   of a series of in situ forming biodegradable electroactive hydrogels
   which were synthesized by in situ crosslinking of
   gelatin-graft-polyaniline (GP) by genipin at body temperature. The
   chemical structure and electroactivity of the GP co-polymers was
   confirmed. The formation of in situ hydrogels was demonstrated by the
   test tube inversion method and rheology measurement. Gelation time,
   swelling ratio and degradation rate of the hydrogels were controlled by
   the polyaniline content and genipin content. The conductivity of the
   hydrogels in the swollen state increased with increasing the polyaniline
   content in the materials. Interestingly, the hydrogels exhibited a
   linear release profile of in situ encapsulated diclofenac sodium. The
   non-cytotoxicity of the hydrogels was confirmed via cell adhesion and
   proliferation by using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and rat C2C12
   myoblast cells. These in situ formed degradable electroactive hydrogels
   represent a new class of biomaterials and as biomimetic scaffolds they
   have great potential for sophisticated tissue engineering, such as bone,

Abstract = {{We tested the null hypotheses that neither age, gender nor muscle
   pre-cocontraction state affect the latencies of changes in upper
   extremity kinematics or elbow muscle activity following an impulsive
   force to the hand. Thirty-eight healthy young and older adult volunteers
   lay prone on an apparatus with shoulders flexed 75 degrees and arms
   slightly flexed. The non-dominant hand was subjected to three trials of
   impulsive loading with arm muscles precontracted to 25, 50, or 75\% of
   maximum pre-cocontraction levels. Limb kinematic data and upper
   extremity electromyographic (EMG) activity were acquired. The results
   showed that pre-cocontraction muscle level (p < 0.001) and gender (p <
   0.05 for wrist and shoulder) affected joint displacement onset times and
   age affected EMG onset times (p < 0.05). The peak applied force (F-1)
   occurred a mean (+/- SD) 27 (+/- 2) ms after impact. The latencies for
   the wrist, elbow, and shoulder displacements were 21 +/- 3, 29 +/- 5,
   and 34 +/- 7 ms, respectively. Because the latencies for elbow flexion
   and lateral triceps EMG were 23 +/- 5 and 84 +/- 8 ms, respectively,
   muscle pre-activation rather than stretch reflexes prevent arm buckling
   under impulsive end loads.}},

Abstract = {{We present a microfluidic device designed for maintenance and culture of
   non-adherent mammalian cells, which enables both recirculation and
   refreshing of medium, as well as easy harvesting of cells from the
   device. We demonstrate fabrication of a novel microfluidic device
   utilizing Braille perfusion for peristaltic fluid flow to enable
   switching between recirculation and refresh flow modes. Utilizing fluid
   flow simulations and the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60,
   non-adherent cells, we demonstrate the utility of this RECIR-REFRESH
   device. With computer simulations, we profiled fluid flow and
   concentration gradients of autocrine factors and found that the geometry
   of the cell culture well plays a key role in cell entrapping and
   retaining autocrine and soluble factors. We subjected HL-60 cells, in
   the device, to a treatment regimen of 1.25\% dimethylsulfoxide, every
   other day, to provoke differentiation and measured subsequent expression
   of CD11b on day 2 and day 4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
   on day 4. Our findings display perfusion sensitive CD11b expression, but
   not TNF-alpha build-up, by day 4 of culture, with a 1:1 ratio of
   recirculation to refresh flow yielding the greatest increase in CD11b
   levels. RECIR-REFRESH facilitates programmable levels of cell
   differentiation in a HL-60 non-adherent cell population and can be
   expanded to other types of non-adherent cells such as hematopoietic stem
   cells. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   shape-dependent endothelial mechanotransduction}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{300-311}},
Abstract = {{Uniaxial stretch is an important biophysical regulator of cell
   morphology (or shape) and functions of vascular endothelial cells (ECs).
   However, it is unclear whether and how cell shape can independently
   regulate EC mechanotransductive properties under uniaxial stretch.
   Herein, utilizing a novel uniaxial cell-stretching device integrated
   with micropost force sensors, we reported the first experimental
   evidence showing cell shape-dependent EC mechanotransduction via
   cytoskeleton (CSK) contractile forces in response to uniaxial stretch.
   Combining experiments and theoretical modeling from first principles, we
   showed that it was the global architecture of the F-actin CSK that
   instructed the cell shape-dependent EC mechanotransductive process.
   Furthermore, a cell shape-dependent nature was relayed in EC
   mechanotransduction via dynamic focal adhesion (FA) assembly. Our
   results suggested a novel mechanotransductive process in ECs wherein the
   global architecture of the F-actin CSK, governed by cell shape, controls
   mechanotransduction via CSK contractile forces and force-dependent FA
   assembly under uniaxial stretch.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Cellular analysis plays important roles in various biological
   applications, such as cell biology, drug development, and disease
   diagnosis. Conventional cellular analysis usually measures the average
   response from a whole cell group. However, bulk measurements may cause
   misleading interpretations due to cell heterogeneity. Another problem is
   that current cellular analysis may not be able to differentiate various
   subsets of cell populations, each exhibiting a different behavior than
   the others. Single-cell analysis techniques are developed to analyze
   cellular properties, conditions, or functional responses in a large cell
   population at the individual cell level. Integrating optics with
   microfluidic platforms provides a well-controlled microenvironment to
   precisely control single cell conditions and perform non-invasive
   high-throughput analysis. This paper reviews recent developments in
   optofluidic technologies for various optics-based single-cell analyses,
   which involve single cell manipulation, treatment, and property
   detection. Finally, we provide our views on the future development of
   integrated optics with microfluidics for single-cell analysis and
   discuss potential challenges and opportunities of this emerging research
   field in biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{The linear stability of a plane Poiseuille flow of an electrically
   conducting viscoelastic fluid in the presence of a transverse magnetic
   field is investigated numerically. The fourth-order modified
   Orr-Sommerfeld equation governing the stability analysis is solved by a
   spectral method with expansions in Lagrange polynomials, based on
   collocation points of Gauss-Lobatto. The combined effects of a magnetic
   field and fluid's elasticity on the stability picture of the plane
   Poiseuille flow are investigated in two regards. Firstly, the critical
   values of a Reynolds number and a wavenumber, indicating the onset of
   instabilities, are computed for several values of a magnetic Hartman
   number, M, and at different values of an elasticity number, K. Secondly,
   the structure of the eigenspectrum of the second-order and second-grade
   models in the Poiseuille flow is studied. In accordance to previous
   studies, the magnetic field is predicted to have a stabilizing effect on
   the Poiseuille flow of viscoelastic fluids. Hence, for second-order (SO)
   fluids for which the elasticity number K is negative, the critical
   Reynolds number Re, increases with increasing the Hartman number M, for
   various values of the elasticity number K. However, for second-grade
   (SG) fluids (K> 0), the critical Reynolds number Re, increases with
   increasing the Hartman number only for certain values of the elasticity
   number K, while decreases for the others.}},

   nano-BaTiO3 with average particle sizes (APSs) of 50 nm were mixed with
   {[}glycidylSiMe(2)OSiO(1.5)](8) (OG, Q cage epoxy) and
   diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM) at loadings of 30, 40 and 50 vol\% (69, 77
   and 83 wt\%) to form nano-nanocomposites. We demonstrate processing
   flexible films at 10-13 mu m thicknesses on a variety of substrates but
   especially 40 mu m thick aluminum foil. The octafunctional glycidyl
   silica cage epoxy resin combines very high flexibility needed for
   rolling with the potential to impart good-to-excellent breakdown
   voltages and hence higher energy densities. Nanopowders and cast films
   with and without nano-BaTiO3 were characterized by FTIR, TGA, SEM, XRD
   etc. The dielectric constants of the cast films were also characterized
   providing dielectric constants (loss tangents) of 18 (0.05), 21 (0.06)
   and 16 (0.11) for 30, 40 and 50 vol\% films, respectively at 100 KHz.
   Only 30 and 40 vol\% films were cast on Al foil for processing to wound
   capacitors as 50 vol\% films exhibited excessive porosity resulting from
   agglomeration induced during curing/coating of the resin. Rolled
   capacitors were fabricated by simply stacking two strips of
   nanocomposite cast Al foil and rolling them around a metal rod used as a
   mandrel. The found energy storage of the capacitors ranged from 80-90
   nanofarads (33-37 nF cm(-2)) whereas that of equivalent biaxially
   oriented polypropylene (BOPP) capacitors at the same thicknesses would
   exhibit only 9-12 nanofarads (4-5 nF cm(-2)) at similar voltages.
   Current work provides the first example of a rolled BaTiO3/epoxy
   nanocomposite capacitor with excellent potential for replacing
   commercially available counterparts. Furthermore, the potential to
   achieve much higher energy densities through further optimization
   suggests the possibility of reducing the dimensions of any given
   capacitor.}},

Title = {{Effect of defocusing on picosecond laser-coupling into gold cones}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Here, we show that defocusing of the laser in the interaction of a
   picosecond duration, 1.053 mu m wavelength, high energy pulse with a
   cone-wire target does not significantly affect the laser energy coupling
   efficiency, but does result in a drop in the fast electron effective
   temperature. This may be beneficial for fast ignition, since not only
   were more electrons with lower energies seen in the experiment but also
   the lower prepulse intensity will reduce the amount of preplasma present
   on arrival of the main pulse, reducing the distance the hot electrons
   have to travel. We used the Vulcan Petawatt Laser at the Rutherford
   Appleton Laboratory and gold cone targets with approximately 1 mm long,
   40 mu m diameter copper wires attached to their tip. Diagnostics
   included a quartz crystal imager, a pair of highly oriented pyrolytic
   graphite crystal spectrometers and a calibrated CCD operating in the
   single photon counting regime, all of which looked at the copper K-alpha
   emission from the wire. A short pulse optical probe, delayed 400 ps
   relative to the main pulse was employed to diagnose the extent of plasma
   expansion around the wire. A ray-tracing code modeled the change in
   intensity on the interior surface of the cone with laser defocusing-.
   Using a model for the wire copper K-alpha emission coupled to a hybrid
   Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code, we ran a series of simulations, holding the
   total energy in electrons constant whilst varying the electron
   temperature, which support the experimental conclusions. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{Stable hierarchical model predictive control using an inner loop

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-99}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel hierarchical model predictive control (MPC)
   strategy that guarantees overall system stability. This method differs
   significantly from previous approaches to guaranteeing overall
   stability, which have relied upon a multi-rate framework where the inner
   loop (low level) is updated at a faster rate than the outer loop (high
   level), and the inner loop must reach a steady state within each outer
   loop time step. In contrast, the method proposed in this paper is aimed
   at stabilizing the origin of an error system characterized by the
   difference between the inner loop state and the state specified by a
   full-order reference model. This makes the method applicable to systems
   with reduced levels of time scale separation. This paper proposes a
   framework for guaranteeing stability that leverages the use of the
   reference model, in conjunction with A-contractive constraint sets for
   both the inner and outer loops. The effectiveness of the proposed
   reference model-based strategy is shown through simulation on an
   existing stirred-tank reactor problem, where we demonstrate that the MPC
   optimization problem remains feasible and that the system remains stable
   and continues to perform well when time scale separation between the
   inner and outer loops is reduced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The study demonstrates use of a novel intervention for severe
   tracheobronchomalacia (TBM).
   OBJECTIVE To test a novel, 3-dimensionally (3D) printed, bioresorbable
   airway splint for efficacy in extending survival in a porcine model of
   severe, life-threatening TBM.
   DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, prospective animal trial was used
   to evaluate an external airway splint as treatment of severe,
   life-threatening TBM in a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary
   collaboration between a biomedical engineering department and an
   academic animal surgery center. Six 2-month-old Yorkshire pigs underwent
   tracheal cartilage division and inner tracheal lumen dissociation and
   were randomly assigned to splint treatment (n = 3) or control groups (n
   = 3). Two additional pigs had the splint placed over their normal
   trachea.
   INTERVENTIONS A 3D-printed, bioresorbable airway splint was assessed in
   a porcine animal model of life-threatening TBM. The open-cylindrical,
   bellow-shaped, porous polycaprolactone splint was placed externally and
   designed to suspend the underlying collapsed airway. Two additional
   animals were splinted without model creation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The observer-based Westley Clinical Croup
   Scale was used to assess the clinical condition of animals
   postoperatively. Animal survival time was noted.
   RESULTS Complete or nearly complete tracheal lumen collapse was observed
   in each animal, with resolution of symptoms in all of the experimental
   animals after splint placement. Using our severe TBM animal model,
   survival was significantly longer in the experimental group receiving
   the airway splint after model creation than in the control group (P =
   .0495).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A multidisciplinary effort producing a
   computer-aided designed, computer-aided manufactured bioresorbable
   tracheobronchial splint was tested in a porcine model of severe TBM and
   was found to extend survival time. Mortality in the splinted group was
   ascribed to the TBM model based on the lack of respiratory distress in
   splinted pigs, long-term survival in animals implanted with the splint
   without TBM, and necropsy findings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Enamelin-null (ENAM(-/-)) mice have no enamel. When
   characterizing ENAM(-/-) mice, alveolar bone height reduction was
   observed, and it was hypothesized that enamel defects combined with diet
   are associated with the periodontal changes of ENAM(-/-) mice. The aim
   of the present study is to compare the dimension of interradicular bone
   of ENAM(-/-) (knock-out {[}KO]) with wild-type (WT) mice, maintained on
   hard (HC) or soft (SC) chow.
   Methods: A total of 100 animals divided into four groups were studied at
   3, 8, and 24 weeks of age: 1) KO/HC; 2) KO/SC; 3) WT/HC; and 4) WT/SC.
   Microcomputed tomography was performed, and the following measurements
   were made between mandibular first (M1) and second (M2) molars: relative
   alveolar bone height (RBH), crestal bone width (CBW), bone volume (BV),
   bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD). The position
   of M1 and M2 in relation to the inferior border of the mandible was also
   determined at 24 weeks. All variables were analyzed by one-way analysis
   of variance and Dunnett test for pairwise comparisons. Morphologic
   analyses were conducted on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections.
   Results: Radiographically, the enamel layer was absent in ENAM(-/-)
   mice. Interproximal open contacts were observed exclusively in ENAM(-/-)
   mice, and the prevalence decreased over time, suggesting that a shifting
   of tooth position had occurred. Additionally, in the two ENAM(-/-)
   groups, RBH was significantly lower at 8 and 24 weeks (P < 0.02); CBW,
   BV, and BMC were significantly less (P < 0.05) at 24 weeks. No
   differences in BMD were found among the four groups. The molars migrated
   to a more coronal position in ENAM(-/-) mice and mice on HC. Histologic
   findings were consistent with radiographic observations. After eruption,
   the junctional epithelium was less organized in ENAM(-/-) mice.
   Conclusion: The interdental bone density was not affected in the absence
   of enamelin, but its volume was, which is likely a consequence of
   alternations in tooth position.}},

   improvement despite decades of research. ( Here m and n are the number
   of edges and vertices.) In this article, we demonstrate that this ``m
   root n barrier{''} can be bypassed by approximation. For any is an
   element of > 0, we give an algorithm that computes a ( 1 - is an element
   of)-approximate maximum weight matching in O(m is an element of(-1) log
   is an element of(-1)) time, that is, optimal linear time for any fixed
   is an element of. Our algorithm is dramatically simpler than the best
   exact maximum weight matching algorithms on general graphs and should be
   appealing in all applications that can tolerate a negligible relative
   error.}},

Title = {{Lie Group Solution for Free Convective Flow of a Nanofluid Past a
   Chemically Reacting Horizontal Plate in a Porous Media}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) is employed to investigate
   the steady laminar incompressible free convective flow of a nanofluid
   past a chemically reacting upward facing horizontal plate in a porous
   medium taking into account heat generation/absorption and the thermal
   slip boundary condition. Using similarity transformations developed by
   Lie group analysis, the continuity, momentum, energy, and nanoparticle
   volume fraction equations are transformed into a set of coupled
   similarity equations. The OHAM solutions are obtained and verified by
   numerical results using a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg fourth-fifth order
   method. The effect of the emerging flow controlling parameters on the
   dimensionless velocity, temperature, and nanoparticle volume fraction
   have been presented graphically and discussed. Good agreement is found
   between analytical and numerical results of the present paper with
   published results. This close agreement supports our analysis and the
   accuracy of the numerical computations. This paper also includes a
   representative set of numerical results for reduced Nusselt and Sherwood
   numbers in a table for various values of the parameters. It is concluded
   that the reduced Nusselt number increases with the Lewis number and
   reaction parameter whist it decreases with the order of the chemical
   reaction, thermal slip, and generation parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Finite-element-based solidification modeling was used to investigate the
   thermal characteristics of the Bridgman and liquid metal cooling (LMC)
   directional solidification (DS) processes. Physically representative
   boundary conditions were implemented within a finite-element model to
   test its applicability to a broad range of processing conditions. The
   dominant heat-transfer step for each case was identified. Relationships
   between the thermal gradient and the solid-liquid interface position
   relative to the transition region of the furnace were developed. The
   solidification rate, the local velocity of the solid-liquid interface,
   and the cooling rate as a function of withdrawal rate were analyzed. The
   curvature of the solid-liquid interface varies with the processing
   conditions and influences the local thermal condition and, therefore,
   the morphological development of dendritic structure during
   solidification. An extensive sensitivity analysis of process conditions
   was conducted for both the Bridgman and LMC techniques. The relative
   importance of process parameters on the resulting thermal conditions
   during solidification was identified. A protocol for determination of
   preferred process conditions was defined. The maximum axial thermal
   gradient at the surface of the casting occurs when the solid-liquid
   interface is just above the baffle for both the Bridgman and LMC DS
   processes, independent of casting geometry or mold-heater temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The integrative Vaccine Investigation and Online Information Network
   (VIOLIN) vaccine research database and analysis system
   (http://www.violinet.org) curates, stores, analyses and integrates
   various vaccine-associated research data. Since its first publication in
   NAR in 2008, significant updates have been made. Starting from 211
   vaccines annotated at the end of 2007, VIOLIN now includes over 3240
   vaccines for 192 infectious diseases and eight noninfectious diseases
   (e. g. cancers and allergies). Under the umbrella of VIOLIN, >10
   relatively independent programs are developed. For example, Protegen
   stores over 800 protective antigens experimentally proven valid for
   vaccine development. VirmugenDB annotated over 200 `virmugens', a term
   coined by us to represent those virulence factor genes that can be
   mutated to generate successful live attenuated vaccines. Specific
   patterns were identified from the genes collected in Protegen and
   VirmugenDB. VIOLIN also includes Vaxign, the first web-based vaccine
   candidate prediction program based on reverse vaccinology. VIOLIN
   collects and analyzes different vaccine components including vaccine
   adjuvants (Vaxjo) and DNA vaccine plasmids (DNAVaxDB). VIOLIN includes
   licensed human vaccines (Huvax) and veterinary vaccines (Vevax). The
   Vaccine Ontology is applied to standardize and integrate various data in
   VIOLIN. VIOLIN also hosts the Ontology of Vaccine Adverse Events (OVAE)
   that logically represents adverse events associated with licensed human
   vaccines.}},

Title = {{Monte Carlo simulation of nitrogen dissociation based on state-resolved
   cross sections}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{State-resolved analyses of N + N-2 are performed using the direct
   simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In describing the elastic
   collisions by a state-resolved method, a state-specific total cross
   section is proposed. The state-resolved method is constructed from the
   state-specific total cross section and the rovibrational state-to-state
   transition cross sections for bound-bound and bound-free transitions
   taken from a NASA database. This approach makes it possible to analyze
   the rotational-to-translational, vibrational-to-translational, and
   rotational-to-vibrational energy transfers and the chemical reactions
   without relying on macroscopic properties and phenomenological models.
   In nonequilibrium heat bath calculations, the results of present
   state-resolved DSMC calculations are validated with those of the master
   equation calculations and the existing shock-tube experimental data for
   bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In various equilibrium and
   nonequilibrium heat bath conditions and 2D cylindrical flows, the DSMC
   calculations by the state-resolved method are compared with those
   obtained with previous phenomenological DSMC models. In these previous
   DSMC models, the variable soft sphere, phenomenological
   Larsen-Borgnakke, quantum kinetic, and total collision energy models are
   considered. From these studies, it is concluded that the state-resolved
   method can accurately describe the rotational-to-translational,
   vibrational-to-translational, and rotational-to-vibrational transfers
   and quasi-steady state of rotational and vibrational energies in
   nonequilibrium chemical reactions by state-to-state kinetics. (C) 2014

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel technique to measure time-resolved laser-induced
   fluorescence signals in plasma sources that have a relatively constant
   Fourier spectrum of oscillations in steady-state operation, but are not
   periodically pulsed, e. g., Hall thrusters. The technique uses laser
   modulation of the order of MHz and recovers signal via a combination of
   band-pass filtering, phase-sensitive detection, and averaging over
   estimated transfer functions calculated for many different cycles of the
   oscillation. Periodic discharge current oscillations were imposed on a
   hollow cathode. Measurements were validated by comparison with
   independent measurements from a lock-in amplifier and by comparing the
   results of the transfer function average to an independent analysis
   technique triggering averaging over many oscillation cycles in the time
   domain. The performance of the new technique is analyzed and compared to
   prior techniques, and it is shown that this new technique has a niche in
   measurements where the analog photomultiplier signal has a nonwhite
   noise spectral density and cycles of oscillation are not sufficiently
   repeatable to allow for reliable triggering or a meaningful average
   waveform in the time domain. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{While fracture is generally considered to be undesirable in various

   successfully implemented to generate structures at micro/nano length

   biologically-relevant problems, such as in the analysis of biomolecules

   molecular environment. This mini review provides an overview of current
   fracture-guided fabrication techniques and their biological
   applications. We first survey the mechanical principles of
   fracture-based approaches. Then we describe biological applications at

Abstract = {{Liquid removal from nano-scale features on semiconductor wafers is
   studied from the perspectives of thermodynamics and transport. The
   thermodynamic model considers various cylindrically symmetrical states
   of liquid in a feature and calculates their free energies. A phase
   diagram is developed to show what configurations of liquid in a
   cylindrical feature are most stable given the aspect ratio of the
   feature, the volume fraction occupied by liquid, and the interior
   contact angle. Energies needed to remove liquid from a feature are
   computed in terms of these parameters, as well as the contact angle on
   the wafer surface exterior to the feature. The transport model is used
   to estimate drying times by accounting for liquid evaporation kinetics
   and vapor-phase transport. Drying is controlled by the evaporation rate
   of the liquid. Periods required for drying depend strongly on the
   evaporation coefficient, as well as ambient temperature and ambient
   solvent vapor pressure. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Pages = {{65-80}},

Abstract = {{We consider a periodic-review inventory system with regular and
   expedited supply modes. The expedited supply is faster than the regular
   supply but incurs a higher cost. Demand for the product in each period
   is random and sensitive to its selling price. The firm determines its
   order quantity from each supply in each period as well as its selling
   price to maximize the expected total discounted profit over a finite or
   an infinite planning horizon. We show that, in each period if it is
   optimal to order from both supplies, the optimal inventory policy is
   determined by two state-independent thresholds, one for each supply
   mode, and a list price is set for the product; if only the regular
   supply is used, the optimal policy is a state-dependent base-stock
   policy, that is, the optimal base-stock level depends on the starting
   inventory level, and the optimal selling price is a markdown price that
   decreases with the starting inventory level. We further study the
   operational impact of such supply diversification and show that it
   increases the firm's expected profit, reduces the optimal safety-stock
   levels, and lowers the optimal selling price. Thus that diversification
   is beneficial to both the firm and its customers. Building upon these
   results, we conduct a numerical study to assess and compare the
   respective benefit of dynamic pricing and supply diversification.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse processes that include energy conversion, wettability,
   lubrication, adhesion, and surface-directed phase separation in mixtures
   fundamentally depend on the structure and dynamics of materials'
   surfaces and interfaces. We report an unusual phenomenon wherein the
   surface viscosity of polymer nanocomposites of polystyrene (PS),
   polyvinyl methyl ether (PVME), and PS-coated gold nanoparticles
   (PS/PVME/PS-Au) is over an order of magnitude smaller than that of the
   neat miscible PS/PVME blend. Our X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
   studies of the surface dynamics also reveal that the polymer chains
   manifest dynamics associated with two separate average compositional
   environments: a PVME-rich region, significantly in excess of its bulk
   concentration, and a separate PS-rich environment, where the dynamics
   are approximately 2 orders of magnitude slower. The unusually rapid
   surface dynamics in the PS/PVME/PS-Au nanocomposite are due largely to
   the excess PVME chains and the polymer/brush-coated nanoparticle
   interactions at the free surface.}},

Title = {{Entropically Patchy Particles: Engineering Valence through Shape Entropy}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{931-940}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Patchy particles are a popular paradigm for the design and synthesis of
   nanoparticles and colloids for self-assembly. In ``traditional{''}
   patchy particles, anisotropic interactions arising from patterned
   coatings, functionalized molecules, DNA, and other enthalpic means
   create the possibility for directional binding of particles into
   higher-ordered structures. Although the anisotropic geometry of
   nonspherical particles contributes to the interaction patchiness through
   van der Waals, electrostatic, and other interactions, how particle shape
   contributes entropically to self-assembly is only now beginning to be
   understood. The directional nature of entropic forces has recently been
   elucidated. A recently proposed theoretical framework that defines and
   quantifies directional entropic forces demonstrates the anisotropic that
   is, patchy nature of these emergent, attractive forces. Here we
   introduce the notion of entropically patchy particles as the entropic
   counterpart to enthalpically patchy particles. Using three example
   ``families{''} of shapes, we show how to modify entropic patchiness by
   introducing geometric features to the particles via shape operations so
   as to target specific crystal structures assembled here with Monte Carlo
   simulations. We quantify the emergent entropic valence via a potential
   of mean force and torque. We show that these forces are on the order of
   a few k(B)T at intermediate densities below the onset of
   crystallization. We generalize these shape operations to shape
   anisotropy dimensions, in analogy with the anisotropy dimensions
   introduced for enthalpically patchy particles. Our findings demonstrate
   that entropic patchiness and emergent valence provide a way of
   engineering directional bonding into nanoparticle systems, whether in
   the presence or absence of additional, non-entropic forces.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the channel sensing problem arising in opportunistic
   scheduling over fading channels, cognitive radio networks, and resource
   constrained jamming. The same problem arises in many other areas of
   science and technology as it is an instance of restless bandit problems.
   The communication system consists of N channels. Each channel is modeled
   as a multi-state Markov chain. At each time instant a user selects one
   channel to sense and uses it to transmit information. A reward depending
   on the state of the selected channel is obtained for each transmission.
   The objective is to design a channel sensing policy that maximizes the
   expected total reward collected over a finite or infinite horizon. This
   problem can be viewed as an instance of restless bandit problems, for
   which the form of optimal policies is unknown in general. We discover
   sets of conditions sufficient to guarantee the optimality of a myopic
   sensing policy; we show that under one particular set of conditions the
   myopic policy coincides with the Gittins index rule.}},

Abstract = {{We hydrothermally treated monocultures of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
   putida, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at isothermal
   (350 degrees C for 60 min) and fast (rapid heating for 1 min)
   liquefaction conditions. Fast hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of P.
   putida and S. cerevisiae produced the highest biocrude yields of 47 +/-
   13 and 48 +/- 9 wt \%, respectively. Biocrudes generated via fast HTL
   were always richer in 0 and N and had a higher yield of hexane-insoluble
   products. Isothermal HTL of all microorganisms always produced an
   aqueous phase richer in NH3 than the aqueous phase from fast HTL. Up to
   62 +/- 9\% of the chemical energy in the biomass could be recovered in
   the biocrude product fraction. These results demonstrate the feasibility
   of applying HTL to produce high yields of biocrude from bacteria and
   yeast that are high in protein {[}>80 wt \%, dry and ash-free basis
   (daf)] and low in lipids (<3 wt \%, daf). Such microorganisms could
   serve as a renewable feedstock for biofuels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a broadband fully micromachined transition from
   rectangular waveguide to cavity-backed CPW line for submillimeter-wave
   (sub-MMW) and terahertz applications. A cavity-backed CPW line (CBCBW)
   is a planar transmission line that is designed and optimized for minimum
   loss while providing 50-Omega characteristic impedance. This line is
   shown to provide less than 0.12 dB/mm loss over the entire J-band
   (220-325 GHz). The transition from CBCPW to waveguide is realized in
   three steps to achieve a broadband response with a topology amenable to
   silicon micromachining. The first step is a tapered transition from the
   CBCPW line to a 50-Omega reduced-height waveguide. The next two steps
   utilize a novel in-plane impedance tapering technique to transition from
   the reduced-height waveguide to the on-wafer regular height waveguide.
   The full transition has less than 0.9 dB of insertion loss and more than
   13 dB of return loss over the entire J-band (39\% bandwidth). Silicon
   micromachining technology is used to fabricate prototypes of
   back-to-back CBCPW line-to-waveguide transitions. A novel
   waveguide-probe measurement setup is introduced and utilized to evaluate
   the performance of the transitions and the CBCPW lines}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel nonlinear signal processing technology, which is
   denoted as the polarity-invariant square law (PISL) algorithm, is
   proposed to compensate nonlinear distortions caused by monobit
   digitization and to mitigate the performance degradation of impulse
   radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) receivers employing monobit
   analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). An analytical framework based on
   characteristic functions has been developed to evaluate bit error rates
   of monobit transmitted-reference (TR) receivers and performance
   improvement offered by the PISL algorithm. Both theoretical analysis and
   simulations show that by employing the PISL algorithm, the monobit
   weighted TR (MWTR) receivers can achieve a bit-error-rate performance
   that is more than 10 dB over the direct-reference algorithm and is less
   than 1.5 dB away from the performance bound of the MWTR receivers in
   intravehicle UWB channels. Furthermore, the MWTR receiver employing the
   PISL algorithm is insensitive to a correlation interval; this feature
   not only reduces complexity of the receiver design but also ensures
   performance robustness over various multipath channels. Therefore, the
   PISL algorithm can be considered an enabling technology for the monobit
   IR-UWB receivers that demand high performance, lower power consumption,
   and low complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Mineralized nanofibrous scaffolds have been proposed as promising
   scaffolds for bone regeneration due to their ability to mimic both
   nanoscale architecture and chemical composition of natural bone
   extracellular matrix. In this study, a novel electrodeposition method
   was compared with an extensively explored simulated body fluid (SBF)
   incubation method in terms of the deposition rate, chemical composition
   and morphology of calcium phosphate formed on electrospun fibrous thin
   matrices with a fiber diameter in the range similar to 200-1400 nm
   prepared using 6, 8, 10 and 12 wt.\% poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA)
   solutions in a mixture of dichloromethane and acetone (2:1 in volume).
   The effects of the surface modification using the two mineralization
   techniques on osteoblastic cell (MC3T3-E1) proliferation and
   differentiation were also examined. It was found that electrodeposition
   was two to three orders of magnitude faster than the SBF method in
   mineralizing the fibrous matrices, reducing the mineralization time from
   similar to 2 weeks to 1 h to achieve the same amounts of mineralization.
   The mineralization rate also varied with the fiber diameter but in
   opposite directions between the two mineralization methods. As a general
   trend, the increase of fiber diameter resulted in a faster
   mineralization rate for the electrodeposition method but a slower
   mineralization rate for the SBF incubation method. Using the
   electrodeposition method, one can control the chemical composition and
   morphology of the calcium phosphate by varying the electric deposition
   potential and electrolyte temperature to tune the mixture of dicalcium
   phosphate dihydrate and hydroxyapatite (HAp). Using the SBF method, one
   can only obtain a low crystallinity HAp. The mineralized electrospun
   PLLA fibrous matrices from either method similarly facilitate the
   proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1
   cells as compared to neat PLLA matrices. Therefore, the
   electrodeposition method can be utilized as a fast and versatile
   technique to fabricate mineralized nanofibrous scaffolds for bone tissue
   engineering. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Through the recursive least square algorithm based identification
   method, the parameter of the lumped parameter battery model can be
   updated at each sampling interval with the real-time measurement of
   battery current and voltage, which is called the data-driven method.
   Note that the battery model has been improved with a simple

   potential to overcome the estimation error against battery degradation
   and varied operating environments. (3) The approach has been verified by

   or iodine at 22 degrees C to a dose of 10(16) cm(-2), such that the
   implanted species resided wholly within the PyC layer. The samples were
   then coated with 50 nm of SiC via plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) to retain
   the implanted species during post-deposition annealing treatments. The
   design allows for high spatial resolution tracking of the implanted
   specie using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Annealing at 1100
   degrees C for 10 h resulted in retention of 100\% of implanted cesium,
   strontium, europium and iodine, and 70\% of silver. This diffusion
   couple design provides the opportunity to determine diffusion
   coefficients of FPs in PyC and SiC and the role of the PyC/SiC interface
   in FP transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, scanning-transmission electron microscope tomography and

   transmission electron microscopy were used to obtain analytical
   information about the region used for electron tomography
   reconstruction. The results obtained with these techniques provided
   accurate information regarding the Y-rich nanoparticle dispersion and
   chemistry and their association with the Cr-rich precipitates present in
   the alloy. Reconstructions show that Y-rich nanoparticles are frequently
   found to be embedded within the larger Cr-rich carbides and oxides,

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-20}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, two nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) strategies
   are applied to solve a low thrust interplanetary rendezvous problem.
   Each employs a unique, nonclassical parameterization of the control to
   adapt the nonlinear MPC approach to interplanetary orbital dynamics with
   low control authority. The approach is demonstrated numerically for a
   minimum-fuel Earth-to-Mars rendezvous maneuver, cast as a simplified
   coplanar circular orbit heliocentric transfer problem. The
   interplanetary transfer is accomplished by repeated solution of an
   optimal control problem over (i) a receding horizon with fixed number of
   control subintervals and (ii) a receding horizon with shrinking number
   of control subintervals, with a doubling strategy to maintain
   controllability. In both cases, the end time is left unconstrained. The
   performances of the nonlinear MPC strategies in terms of computation
   time, fuel consumption, and transfer time are compared for a constant
   thrust nuclear-electric propulsion system. For this example, the ability
   to withstand unmodeled effects and control allocation errors is
   verified. The second strategy, with shrinking number of control
   subintervals, is also shown to easily handle the more complicated
   bounded thrust nuclear-electric case, as well as a
   state-control-constrained solar-electric case. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Journal = {{ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-39}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel algorithm that enables the semi-automatic
   reconstruction of human-made structures (e.g., buildings) into piecewise
   planar 3D models from a single image. This allows the models to be
   readily used in virtual or augmented reality visual simulations or for
   data acquisition in 3D geographic information systems. Contrary to
   traditional labor-intensive but accurate single view reconstruction
   (SVR) solutions based purely on geometric constraints, and contrary to
   recent fully automatic albeit low-accuracy SVR algorithms based on
   statistical inference, the presented method achieves a compromise
   between speed and accuracy, leading to less user input and acceptable
   visual effects. The user input required in the presented approach is
   primarily a line drawing that represents an outline of the building to
   be reconstructed. Using this input, the developed method takes advantage
   of a newly proposed vanishing point (VP) detection algorithm that can
   simultaneously estimate multiple VPs in an image. With those VPs, the
   normal direction of planes-which are projected onto the image plane as
   polygons in the line drawing-can be automatically calculated. Following
   this step, a linear system similar to the traditional SVR solutions can
   be used to achieve 3D reconstruction. Experiments that demonstrate the
   efficacy and visual outcome of the developed method are also described,
   highlighting the method's potential use for rapid geometric model
   building of surrounding structures in visual simulation of engineering
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this communication, the application of sub-millimeter-wave imaging
   radars for collision avoidance and navigation of autonomous platforms in
   indoor environments is investigated. The polarimetric backscattering
   phenomenology of walls and doorways are studied to aid the design and
   system specifications of such radar systems. Polarimetric backscatter
   measurements of different wall covers, such as dry-wall, concrete
   blocks, wood, etc., as a function of incidence angle are carried out
   using a network analyzer operating at J-band. Also an instrumentation
   radar operating at 215 GHz is setup to collect backscatter data from
   corridors in an indoor setting. At each radar position, radar range
   profiles for both vertical and horizontal polarizations as a function of
   angle are used to form polar images for obstacle detection. It is shown
   that horizontally polarized incident wave can generate higher
   backscatter level and less reflection from smooth walls at steep angles
   of incidence and thus is the preferred polarization for this
   application. The polar images at each location are then co-registered in
   a global coordinate matrix to form a complete map of the interior
   layout. Feature extraction and image processing methods are then applied
   to remove multipath and enhance the radar map of building interiors.}},

Abstract = {{The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer operates in the
   L-band protected spectrum (1400-1427 MHz) that is known to be vulnerable
   to radio-frequency interference (RFI). Although transmissions are
   forbidden at these frequencies by international regulations,
   ground-based, airborne, and spaceborne radiometric observations show
   substantial evidence of out-of-band emissions from neighboring
   transmitters and possibly illegally operating emitters. The spectral
   environment that SMAP faces includes not only occasional large levels of
   RFI but also significant amounts of low-level RFI equivalent to a
   brightness temperature of 0.1-10 K at the radiometer output. This
   low-level interference would be enough to jeopardize the success of a
   mission without an aggressive mitigation solution, including special
   flight hardware and ground software with capabilities of RFI detection
   and removal. SMAP takes a multidomain approach to RFI mitigation by
   utilizing an innovative onboard digital detector back end with digital
   signal processing algorithms to characterize the time, frequency,
   polarization, and statistical properties of the received signals. Almost
   1000 times more measurements than what is conventionally necessary are
   collected to enable the ground processing algorithm to detect and remove
   harmful interference. Multiple RFI detectors are run on the ground, and
   their outputs are combined for maximum likelihood of detection to remove
   the RFI within a footprint. The capabilities of the hardware and
   software systems are successfully demonstrated using test data collected
   with a SMAP radiometer engineering test unit.}},

Title = {{Step length after discrete perturbation predicts accidental falls and

Abstract = {{Aims: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy increases fall risk due to
   inability to cope with perturbations. We aimed to 1) identify the
   frontal plane lower limb sensorimotor functions which are necessary for
   robustness to a discrete, underfoot perturbation during gait; and 2)
   determine whether changes in the post-perturbed step parameters could
   distinguish between fallers and non fallers.
   Methods: Forty-two subjects (16 healthy old and 26 with diabetic PN)
   participated. Frontal plane lower limb sensorimotor functions were
   determined using established laboratory-based techniques. The subjects'
   most extreme alterations in step width or step length in response to a
   perturbation were measured. In addition, falls and fall-related injuries
   were prospectively recorded.
   Results: Ankle proprioceptive threshold (APrT; p = .025) and hip
   abduction rate of torque generation (RTG; p = .041) independently
   predicted extreme step length after medial perturbation, with precise
   APrT and greater hip RTG allowing maintenance of step length. Injured
   subjects demonstrated greater extreme step length changes after medial
   perturbation than non-injured subjects (percent change = 18.5 +/- 9.2
   vs. 11.3 +/- 4.57; p = .01).
   Conclusions: The ability to rapidly generate frontal plane hip strength
   and/or precisely perceive motion at the ankle is needed to maintain a
   normal step length after perturbation, a parameter which distinguishes
   between subjects sustaining a fall-related injury and those who did not.

Title = {{Nodal energy weighted transformation: A mistuning projection and its

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, several researchers have developed reduced-order models
   (ROMs) to efficiently and accurately calculate the forced response of
   blisks with known small mistuning. Small mistuning consists of the small
   blade-to-blade structural differences which destroy the inherent cyclic
   symmetry of the structure. This paper presents a nodal energy weighted
   transformation (NEWT) which can be used to construct ROMs of mistuned
   blisks and dual flow path systems, such as FLADE (TM) turbines. The NEWT
   approach can be interpreted as a hybrid of two existing techniques:
   component mode mistuning (CMM) and the subset of nominal modes (SNM).
   Similar to the previous methods, NEWT assumes that the mistuned modes of
   the system are a linear combination of tuned modes. However, NEWT
   differs from its predecessors in the blisk substructuring and in the
   mistuning projection. Numerical results obtained using full order
   models, CMM, and NEWT are presented and compared over multiple frequency
   ranges for a finite element model of a blisk and that of a FLADE (TM)
   turbine. These results show that ROMs based on NEWT have several
   attractive features: (a) the accuracy of the ROMs is comparable to ROMs
   based on CMM, and can be improved by increasing the size of the
   projection mode subset; (b) no necessary modifications are needed to
   analyze FLADE (TM) turbines; and (c) the response of all modes can be
   predicted well even if they are not blade dominated. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Random telegraph noise and resistance switching analysis of oxide based
   resistive memory}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{400-404}},
Abstract = {{Resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices (e.g. ``memristors{''})
   are widely believed to be a promising candidate for future memory and
   logic applications. Although excellent performance has been reported,
   the nature of resistance switching is still under extensive debate. In
   this study, we perform systematic investigation of the resistance
   switching mechanism in a TaOx based RRAM through detailed noise
   analysis, and show that the resistance switching from high-resistance to
   low-resistance is accompanied by a semiconductor-to-metal transition
   mediated by the accumulation of oxygen-vacancies in the conduction path.
   Specifically, pronounced random-telegraph noise (RTN) with values up to
   25\% was observed in the device high-resistance state (HRS) but not in
   the low-resistance state (LRS). Through time-domain and temperature
   dependent analysis, we show that the RTN effect shares the same origin
   as the resistive switching effects, and both can be traced to the (re)
   distribution of oxygen vacancies (V(O)s). From noise and transport
   analysis we further obtained the density of states and average distance
   of the V(O)s at different resistance states, and developed a unified
   model to explain the conduction in both the HRS and the LRS and account
   for the resistance switching effects in these devices. Significantly, it
   was found that even though the conduction channel area is larger in the
   HRS, during resistive switching a localized region gains significantly
   higher V-O and dominates the conduction process. These findings reveal
   the complex dynamics involved during resistive switching and will help
   guide continued optimization in the design and operation of this
   important emerging device class.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we synthesized self-regenerative chitosan (SRCS) by
   combining the photo-catalyst TiO2 and cross-linking chitosan (CS). The
   novel SRCS hybrids were then used as adsorbents to remove methyl orange
   (MO) and they demonstrated excellent adsorption capacity (similar to
   799.2 mg g(-1)) and significant photocatalytic self-regenerative
   properties. The pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO) and
   Weber-Morris kinetics models were applied to fit the experimental data
   obtained from batch experiments. The PSO kinetic model was more
   appropriate for describing the adsorption of MO onto the SRCS.
   Interestingly, the SRCS adsorbent was successfully regenerated by UV
   photocatalysis after adsorption. More importantly, the adsorption
   effectiveness of the SRCS remained constant through eight regeneration
   cycles. This study provides a green method of removing organic
   pollutants that combines adsorption enrichment with photocatalytic
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the hydrothermal cracking of palmitic add by HZSM-5 zeolite
   in a batch reactor. The major liquid products were aromatic hydrocarbons
   (e.g., xylenes, toluene) and alkanes (e.g., 2-methyl-pentane, heptane).
   The major gaseous products were CO and CO2, but appreciable yields of
   propane and butane were also obtained. The effects of batch holding
   time, temperature, hydrogen pressure, and water density on product
   yields were elucidated. Total yields of gas and liquid products
   exceeding 90 wt \% are available at reaction conditions of 400 degrees
   C, 180 min, and either with no added H-2 and a water density of 0.1 g/mL
   or less or with added H-2 and a water density. of 0.15 g/mL. The
   activation energy for palmitic acid disappearance is 31 +/- 1 kJ/mol.
   The zeolite catalyst undergoes some modest structural changes under the
   hydrothermal reaction conditions employed, but the catalyst can be
   regenerated by controlled oxidation to remove coke and calcination to
   restore the structure. These results demonstrate the technical
   feasibility of using HZSM-5 under hydrothermal conditions to produce
   valuable chemicals from renewable fatty acid feedstocks.}},

   qualitatively and quantitatively. Quantified differences between
   adenocarcinoma and normal tissues in vivo were consistent with previous

Title = {{Acoustic Bubble Removal to Enhance SWL Efficacy at High Shock Rate: An
   In Vitro Study}},

Abstract = {{Rate-dependent efficacy has been extensively documented in shock wave
   lithotripsy (SWL) stone comminution, with shock waves (SWs) delivered at
   a low rate producing more efficient fragmentation in comparison to those
   delivered at high rates. Cavitation is postulated to be the primary
   source underlying this rate phenomenon. Residual bubble nuclei that
   persist along the axis of SW propagation can drastically attenuate the
   waveform's negative phase, decreasing the energy which is ultimately
   delivered to the stone and compromising comminution. The effect is more
   pronounced at high rates, as residual nuclei have less time to passively
   dissolve between successive shocks. In this study, we investigate a
   means of actively removing such nuclei from the field using a
   low-amplitude acoustic pulse designed to stimulate their aggregation and
   subsequent coalescence. To test the efficacy of this bubble removal
   scheme, model kidney stones were treated in vitro using a research
   electrohydraulic lithotripter. SWL was applied at rates of 120, 60, or
   30SW/min with or without the incorporation of bubble removal pulses.
   Optical images displaying the extent of cavitation in the vicinity of
   the stone were also collected for each treatment. Results show that
   bubble removal pulses drastically enhance the efficacy of stone
   comminution at the higher rates tested (120 and 60SW/min), while optical
   images show a corresponding reduction in bubble excitation along the SW
   axis when bubble removal pulses are incorporated. At the lower rate of
   30SW/min, no difference in stone comminution or bubble excitation was
   detected with the addition of bubble removal pulses, suggesting that
   remnant nuclei had sufficient time for more complete dissolution. These
   results corroborate previous work regarding the role of cavitation in
   rate-dependent SWL efficacy, and suggest that the effect can be
   mitigated via appropriate control of the cavitation environment
   surrounding the stone.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple constitutive model based on Kuhn segment alignment
   that predicts the observed monotonic extension thinning in steady state
   viscosity eta(E) even at extension rates above the inverse Rouse time
   ((epsilon) over dot > tau(-1)(R)) for entangled polystyrene melts
   {[}Bach et al., Macromolecules 36, 5174-5179 (2003)], while preserving
   the extension thickening typically seen in entangled solutions for
   (epsilon) over dot > tau(-1)(R) {[}Bhattacharjee et al., Macromolecules
   35, 10131-10148 (2002)]. We tested two mechanisms by which Kuhn segment
   alignment can affect terminal relaxation time tau(d) and rheology within
   a modified Doi-Edwards-Marrucci-Grizzuti (DEMG) model, which is a
   simplified tube model. The first mechanism is an increase in the tube
   diameter, as is inferred from ideas of Doi and Edwards {[}The Theory of
   Polymer Dynamics (Clarendon, Oxford, 1986)] and Sussman and Schweizer
   {[}Macromolecules 45, 3270-3284 (2012a)], while the second mechanism is
   a decrease in segmental friction, as described in recent work of Yaoita
   et al. {[}Macromolecules 45, 2773-2782 (2012)]. We find that the DEMG
   model, modified to allow tube diameter enlargement and reduction of
   entanglements, when done self-consistently, fails to predict extension
   thinning for entangled melts. The DEMG model modified by the second
   mechanism, to allow Kuhn segment alignment effects on local friction,
   correctly predicts extension thinning for entangled melts, while
   retaining thickening in entangled solutions with high solvent volume
   fractions. (C) 2014 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{Sources of error in the measurement of aortic diameter in computed

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This study was conducted to determine the differences in the
   diameter of the thoracic aorta when measured from electrocardiographic
   (ECG)-gated and nongated computed tomography (CT) angiography. Another
   aim was to define the difference in the aortic diameter when it is
   measured at peak systole and end diastole in ECG-gated scans.
   Methods: The gated and nongated CT angiograms of 27 patients (mean age,
   58 +/- 16 standard deviation {[}SD] years) obtained on a 256-slice
   multidetector CT scanner were used. The transverse and anteroposterior
   diameters and the lumen areas were measured at 1, 4, and 8 cm below the
   origin of the left subclavian artery.
   Results: There was a significant difference in the aortic measurements
   of diameter between gated and nongated scans found in samples taken at
   1, 4, and 8 cm distal to the left subclavian artery (P <.0001). We found
   a considerable difference between the systolic and diastolic diameters
   (P <.0001). The maximum change in diameter between systole and diastole
   was 2.9 +/- 0.9 (SD) mm (14.5\%, P <.0001) at 1 cm, 5.4 mm (22.6\%;
   median, 1.7 mm; P <.0001) at 4 cm, and 4.4 mm (16.9\%; median, 1.3 mm; P
   <.0001) at 8 cm. There was a significant difference between the
   transverse and anteroposterior diameters in systole and diastole at all
   locations (P <.0001): The maximum change in diameter between transverse
   and anteroposterior diameters in systole was 5.4 +/- 1.1 (SD) mm
   (15.7\%, P <.0001) at 1 cm, 5.8 mm (19\%; median, 1.4 mm; P <.0001) at 4
   cm, and 5 mm (15\%; median, 1.02 mm; P <.0001) at 8 cm. There was also a
   substantial difference between measuring the transverse diameter
   directly and deriving it from the lumen area (P <.0001).
   Conclusions: Our results showed an important difference between systolic
   and diastolic diameters measurements in ECGgated scans. The standard
   protocol for measuring aortic diameters in gated scans of the thoracic
   aorta uses images at end diastole because the lack of wall motion at
   this time provides better resolution. This is likely to result in
   undersizing that, in some instances, may threaten stability and the
   proper seal of the stent graft. The dimensions of the aorta in a gated
   CT should be measured at peak systole rather than the conventional end
   diastole used today. Most medical centers use nongated CT or gated CT
   scans in end diastole to calculate sizes of endografts. In view of our
   findings, the latter method could result in potential complications. (J

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a pharmacokinetic modelfree framework to analyze the
   dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data for
   assessment of response of brain metastases to radiation therapy.
   Methods: Twenty patients with 45 analyzable brain metastases had MRI
   scans prior to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and at the end of
   the 2-week therapy. The volumetric DCE images covering the whole brain
   were acquired on a 3T scanner with approximately 5 s temporal resolution
   and a total scan time of about 3 min. DCE curves from all voxels of the
   45 brain metastases were normalized and then temporally aligned. A DCE
   matrix that is constructed from the aligned DCE curves of all voxels of
   the 45 lesions obtained prior to WBRT is processed by principal
   component analysis to generate the principal components (PCs). Then, the
   projection coefficient maps prior to and at the end of WBRT are created
   for each lesion. Next, a pattern recognition technique, based upon
   fuzzy-c-means clustering, is used to delineate the tumor subvolumes
   relating to the value of the significant projection coefficients. The
   relationship between changes in different tumor subvolumes and treatment
   response was evaluated to differentiate responsive from stable and
   progressive tumors. Performance of the PC-defined tumor subvolume was
   also evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in
   prediction of nonresponsive lesions and compared with
   physiological-defined tumor subvolumes.
   Results: The projection coefficient maps of the first three PCs contain
   almost all response-related information in DCE curves of brain
   metastases. The first projection coefficient, related to the area under
   DCE curves, is the major component to determine response while the third
   one has a complimentary role. In ROC analysis, the area under curve of
   0.88 +/- 0.05 and 0.86 +/- 0.06 were achieved for the PC-defined and
   physiological-defined tumor subvolume in response assessment.
   Conclusions: The PC-defined subvolume of a brain metastasis could
   predict tumor response to therapy similar to the physiological-defined
   one, while the former is determined more rapidly for clinical
   decision-making support. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Diffusion MRI, although having the potential to be a biomarker for early
   assessment of tumor response to therapy, could be confounded by edema
   and necrosis in or near the brain tumors. This study aimed to develop
   and investigate the ability of the diffusion abnormality index (DAI) to
   be a new imaging biomarker for early assessment of brain metastasis
   response to radiation therapy (RT).
   Patients with either radiosensitive or radioresistant brain metastases
   that were treated by whole brain RT alone or combined with bortezomib as
   a radiation sensitizer had diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI pre-RT and 2
   weeks (2W) after starting RT. A patient-specific diffusion abnormality
   probability function (DAProF) was created to account for abnormal low
   and high apparent diffusion coefficients differently, reflecting
   respective high cellularity and edema/necrosis. The DAI of a lesion was
   then calculated by the integral of DAProF-weighted tumor apparent
   diffusion coefficient histogram. The changes in DAI from pre-RT to 2W
   were evaluated for differentiating the responsive, stable, and
   progressive tumors and compared with the changes in gross tumor volume
   and conventional diffusion metrics during the same time interval.
   In lesions treated with whole brain RT, the DAI performed the best among
   all metrics in predicting the posttreatment response of brain metastases
   to RT. In lesions treated with whole brain RT bortezomib, although DAI
   was the best predictor, the performance of all metrics worsened compared
   with the first group.
   The ability of DAI for early assessment of brain metastasis response to
   RT depends upon treatment regimes.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Finite element based formulations for flexible multibody systems are
   becoming increasingly popular and as the complexity of the
   configurations to be treated increases, so does the computational cost.
   It seems natural to investigate the applicability of parallel processing
   to this type of problems; domain decomposition techniques have been used
   extensively for this purpose. In this approach, the computational domain
   is divided into non-overlapping sub-domains, and the continuity of the
   displacement field across sub-domain boundaries is enforced via the
   Lagrange multiplier technique. In the finite element literature, this
   approach is presented as a mathematical algorithm that enables parallel
   processing. In this paper, the divided system is viewed as a flexible
   multibody system, and the sub-domains are connected by kinematic
   constraints. Consequently, all the techniques applicable to the
   enforcement of constraints in multibody systems become applicable to the
   present problem. In particular, it is shown that a combination of the
   localized Lagrange multiplier technique with the augmented Lagrange
   formulation leads to interesting solution strategies. The proposed
   algorithm is compared with the well-known FETI approach with regards to
   convergence and efficiency characteristics. The present algorithm is
   relatively simple and leads to improved convergence and efficiency
   characteristics. Finally, implementation on a parallel computer was
   conducted for the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Superparamagnetic gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as an easily recoverable
   catalyst for the chemical recycling of PET}},

Abstract = {{There have been numerous studies to develop catalysts for the chemical
   recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) via glycolysis. However,
   in the field of PET glycolysis, only a few have attempted to recover and
   reuse the catalysts. This research utilized easily recoverable
   superparamagnetic gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as a reusable catalyst for
   PET glycolysis. gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were produced by calcining
   Fe3O4 nanoparticles prepared by the co-precipitation method. The
   produced gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles had an average size of 10.5 +/- 1.4
   nm, and a very high surface area reaching 147 m(2) g(-1). Its
   superparamagnetic property was also confirmed. Glycolysis reactions were
   carried out, and the gamma-Fe2O3 catalysts were recovered after the
   reactions by simple magnetic decantation. The use of magnetic iron oxide
   allowed the easy recovery of the catalyst from the glycolysis products.
   At 300 degrees C and a 0.05 catalyst/PET weight ratio, the maximum
   bis(2-hydroxyethlyl) terephthalate (BHET) monomer yield reached more
   than 90\% in 60 min. At 255 degrees C and a 0.10 catalyst/PET weight
   ratio, the BHET yield reached more than 80\% in 80 min. The catalyst was
   reused 10 times, giving almost the same BHET yield each time.}},

Abstract = {{We report a low-power object-adaptive CMOS imager, which suppresses
   spatial temporal bandwidth. The object-adaptive imager has embedded a
   feature extraction algorithm for identifying objects of interest. The
   sensor wakes up triggered by motion sensing and extracts features from
   the captured image for the detection of object-of-interest (OOI).
   Full-image capturing operation and image signal transmission are
   performed only when the interested objects are found, which
   significantly reduces power consumption at the sensor node. This
   motion-triggered OOI imaging significantly saves a spatial bandwidth
   more than 96.5\% from the feature output and saves a temporal bandwidth
   from the motion-triggered wakeup and object adaptive imaging. The sensor
   consumes low power by employing a reconfigurable differential-pixel
   architecture with reduced power supply voltage and by implementing the
   feature extraction algorithm with mixed-signal circuitry in a small
   area. The chip operates at 0.22 mu W/frame in motion-sensing mode and at
   3.4 mu W/frame for feature extraction, respectively. The object
   detection from on-chip feature extraction circuits has demonstrated a
   94.5\% detection rate for human from a set of 200 sample images.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{494-508}},
Abstract = {{This work explores the potential of nano-encapsulated phase change
   materials (PCMs) in applications related to microelectronics cooling.
   PCMs (wax or meso-erythritol) were encapsulated in carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) by a method of self-sustained diffusion at room temperature and
   pressure. These nano-encapsulated wax nanoparticles alone allowed heat
   removal over a relatively wide range of temperatures (different waxes
   have melting temperatures in the range 40-80 degrees C). On the other
   hand, nano-encapsulated meso-erythritol nanoparticles allowed heat
   removal in the range 118-120 degrees C. The combination of these two
   PCMs (wax and meso-erythritol) could extend the temperature range to
   40-120 degrees C, when both types of nanoparticles (wax and
   meso-erythritol intercalated) would be suspended in the same carrier
   fluid (an oil). The nanoparticles possess a short response time of the
   order of 10(-7) s. Such nano-encapsulation can also prevent the PCM from
   sticking to the wall. In this work, experiments with wax-intercalated
   CNTs, stable aqueous suspensions of CNTs with concentrations up to 3
   wt\% with and without nano-encapsulated wax were prepared using a
   surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (NaDDBS). These suspensions
   were pumped through two channels of 603 mu m or 1803 mu m in diameter
   subjected to a constant heat flux at the wall. It was found that the
   presence of the surfactant in CNT suspensions results in a pseudo-slip
   at the channel wall which enhances the flow rate at a fixed pressure
   drop. When aqueous solutions of the surfactant were employed (with no
   CNTs added), the enhanced convection alone was responsible for a similar
   to 2 degrees C reduction in temperature in comparison with pure water
   flows. When CNTs with nano-encapsulated wax were added, an additional
   similar to 1.90 degrees C reduction in temperature due to the PCM fusion
   was observed when using 3 wt\% CNT suspensions. In addition, suspensions
   of meso-erythritol-intercalated CNTs in alpha-olefin oil were used as
   coolants in flows through the 1803 mu m-diameter microchannel. These
   suspensions (1.5 wt\% CNT) revealed a temperature reduction due to the
   PCM fusion of up to 3.2 degrees C, and a fusion temperature in the range
   118-120 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Aging-associated exacerbation in fatty degeneration and infiltration

Abstract = {{Background: Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common
   musculoskeletal complaints and a substantial source of morbidity in
   elderly patients. Chronic cuff tears are associated with muscle atrophy
   and an infiltration of fat to the area, a condition known as ``fatty
   degeneration.{''} To improve the treatment of cuff tears in elderly
   patients, a greater understanding of the changes in the contractile
   properties of muscle fibers and the molecular regulation of fatty
   degeneration is essential.
   Methods: Using a full-thickness, massive supraspinatus and infraspinatus
   tear model in elderly rats, we measured fiber contractility and
   determined changes in fiber type distribution that develop 30 days after
   tear. We also measured the expression of messenger RNA and micro-RNA
   transcripts involved in muscle atrophy, lipid accumulation, and matrix
   synthesis. We hypothesized that a decrease in specific force of muscle
   fibers, an accumulation of type IIb fibers, and an upregulation in
   atrophic, fibrogenic, and inflammatory gene expression would occur in
   torn cuff muscles.
   Results: Thirty days after the tear, we observed a reduction in muscle
   fiber force and an induction of RNA molecules that regulate atrophy,
   fibrosis, lipid accumulation, inflammation, and macrophage recruitment.
   A marked accumulation of advanced glycation end products and a
   significant accretion of macrophages in areas of fat accumulation were
   observed.
   Conclusions: The extent of degenerative changes in old rats was greater
   than that observed in adults. In addition, we identified that the
   ectopic fat accumulation that occurs in chronic cuff tears does not
   occur by activation of canonical intramyocellular lipid storage and
   synthesis pathways. Level of evidence: Basic Science Study, Molecular

Abstract = {{Cell therapies utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could overcome
   limitations of traditional treatments for reconstructing craniofacial
   tissues. This large-scale study explored a standardized methodology for
   the isolation and clinical-scale expansion of alveolar bone
   marrow-derived MSCs (aBMSCs). We harvested 103 alveolar bone marrow
   samples from 45 patients using 1 of 3 standardized methodologies.
   Following aBMSC isolation, cells were characterized through cell-surface
   marker expression and lineage-specific differentiation. Long-term
   cultures (> 50 population doublings {[}PDs]) were evaluated for
   transformational changes through senescence, gene expression, and
   karyotyping. Finally, aBMSC bone-forming potential was determined in
   vivo. More than 0.5 cc of bone marrow was needed to predictably isolate
   aBMSCs, and, regardless of methodology for harvest, cell-surface marker
   expression of CD73, CD90, CD105, and Stro-1 was similar for aBMSCs,
   being 89.8\%, 98.8\%, 93.8\%, and 3.2\%, respectively; all cells were
   negative for CD11b, CD19, and CD45. aBMSCs exhibited multipotency, and
   karyotypes were normal up to 30 PDs, with significant cell senescence
   beginning following 35 PDs. Additionally, aBMSCs induced ectopic bone
   formation following subcutaneous transplantation into mice. These
   findings demonstrate a predictable approach for the isolation and safe
   clinical-scale expansion of aBMSCs, and thus, their clinical use could
   be considered for craniofacial regenerative therapies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the control system design and tracking performance
   for a large range single-axis nanopositioning system that is based on a
   moving magnet actuator and a flexure bearing. While the physical system
   is designed to be free of friction and backlash, the nonlinearities in
   the electromagnetic actuator as well as the harmonic distortion in the
   drive amplifier degrade the tracking performance for dynamic commands.
   It is shown that linear feedback and feedforward proves to be inadequate
   to overcome these nonlinearities. This is due to the low open-loop
   bandwidth of the physical system, which limits the achievable
   closed-loop bandwidth given actuator saturation concerns. For periodic
   commands, like those used in scanning applications, the component of the
   tracking error due to the system nonlinearities exhibits a deterministic
   pattern and repeats every period. Therefore, a phase lead type iterative
   learning controller (ILC) is designed and implemented in conjunction
   with linear feedback and feedforward to reduce this periodic tracking
   error by more than two orders of magnitude. Experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of ILC in achieving 10 nm RMS tracking
   error over 8 mm motion range in response to a 2 Hz band-limited
   triangular command. This corresponds to a dynamic range of more than 105
   for speeds up to 32 mm/s, one of the highest reported in the literature
   so far, for a cost-effective desktop-sized single-axis motion system.

Abstract = {{Over the past several decades there have been a handful of speech
   therapy software programs made available to people with speech problems,
   specifically for stuttering related speech issues. The goal of this
   paper is to introduce the ability to offer these patients a speech
   therapy program accessible from an ordinary web browser and thereby
   gaining the many benefits of using an open web platform. With the open
   web platform, a rich internet application can be developed with real
   time audio processing and media capture via the Web Audio API and Media
   Capture and Streams API. By combining these powerful APIs with an online
   database, patients can have a fully managed speech therapy application
   that can be accessed from the comfort of their homes. This new type of
   speech therapy application will allow the doctor to monitor the
   patient's advancements outside of the clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a Diagnostic Signal Backup/replacement strategy to
   determine the current driving gear of a vehicle in the case that the
   ordinarily responsible message is lost or corrupted. The strategy is
   implemented in software. The source data for the evaluations was
   empirical measured data from a vehicle under normal operating
   conditions. This paper explores the use of a Fuzzy Logic Inference
   System (FIS) to improve or replace an existing software algorithm for
   gear determination. The Fuzzy software system is developed using MATLAB
   Fuzzy Tool Box and simulated in the MATLAB Simulink environment. A Fuzzy
   Logic Mamdani computational model is employed to process dynamic
   sensor/ECU input. The result of the FIS defuzzified output is an integer
   number representative of the gear in which the vehicle under test is
   estimated to be under any given instantaneous vehicle operating
   conditions. The process for development of the FIS is outlined and the
   results are compared between the Fuzzy and Non-Fuzzy determinations.}},

   Three weather parameters; wind speed, wind directions and temperature

   optical sensor, potentiometer and a temperature sensor) so that the cost
   of this design is reduced. A small scale neural network was planted into
   the microcontroller for the post-processing. Taking the three measured
   data as inputs, the system gave out the dressing index as an output. All

   state and control constraints in second order closed-loop systems
   operated remotely over communication networks. The reference governor
   minimally modifies the reference command to the closed-loop system if
   this command has a potential to induce constraint violation. Our
   approach to reference governor design exploits a recently developed fast
   constraint violation prediction algorithm for second order linear
   systems, which is extended, in this paper, to handle a time varying
   network delay. We also discuss approaches to quantization error
   handling. A numerical example is reported to illustrate the proposed

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) is an approximate computing technique that
   represents data by probabilistic bit-streams called stochastic numbers
   (SNs). Arithmetic operations can be implemented at very low cost by
   means of SC. To achieve acceptable accuracy, interacting SNs must
   usually be statistically independent or uncorrelated. Correlation is
   poorly understood, however, and is a key problem in SC because of its
   impact on accuracy and the high cost of correlation-reducing logic. In
   this paper we analyze and quantify the role of correlation in stochastic
   circuit design. We use an algebraic framework based on probabilistic
   transfer matrices (PTMs) to analyze correlation-induced errors. We
   compare two systematic correlation-reducing methods, regeneration and
   isolation. Regeneration introduces new (pseudo) random sources to
   re-randomize SNs, while isolation uses delays (D flip-flops) to derive
   multiple independent SNs from a single random source. We present bounds
   on accuracy loss due to isolator insertion and compare its hardware cost
   to that of regeneration. We conclude that the isolation method can offer
   significant cost advantages in reducing correlation errors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel direction in leaky-wave phenomenon research:
   the generation of non-diffractive Bessel beams by leaky-wave modes. A
   radial waveguide loaded by a capacitive impedance sheet is used to
   support an azimuthally invariant leaky-wave mode whose normal
   electric-field component is a truncated, zeroth-order Bessel function.
   In particular, the generation of propagating Bessel beams using the
   lowest and higher-order leaky-wave modes supported by the radial
   waveguide is considered. Design relations are provided in both cases,
   based on an accurate vector field approach and on the dispersion
   analysis of the proposed structure. Measurement results validate the
   design approach for the lowest order leaky-wave radial waveguide.
   Numerical results are presented for the higher-order case.
   Non-diffractive Bessel-beams may find application in sensing and
   wireless power transfer at microwaves and millimeter waves.}},

   demonstrated its advantages for the design of varactors and more
   recently, switchable and tunable bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators and

   titanate (BST) based resonators and filters have been well studied.
   However, their tuning and switching speed has not been well
   characterized yet. In this work, measurement results on the switching

Abstract = {{Resilient plant monitoring systems (RPMS) are sensor networks that
   degrade gracefully under cyber-physical attacks. In the previous work,
   we have developed an adaptive four-layer RPMS architecture and evaluated
   its performance under various attack scenarios. While the steady state
   performance of this system has been shown to be satisfactory, the
   transients have not: adaptation time grows exponentially as a function
   of the number of states in the network. The current paper is intended to
   provide a method for combating this curse of dimensionality. The
   approach is based on the idea of overlapping plant decomposition and
   subsequent fusion of knowledge derived in the overlapping subnetworks.
   In this paper such a monitoring system is developed (five-layer
   architecture), analyzed, and shown to have desirable steady state and,
   to a certain extent, transient characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In a system of interdependent users, all entities are affected by the
   security decisions of one another. These users benefit from the improved
   health of the system when their neighbors invest in security measures;
   an effect known as positive externality. The externality of these
   decisions make security a public good, the optimal provision of which in
   a system of self-interested users requires regulation/incentives through
   an external mechanism. In this paper we first show that due to the
   non-excludable nature of security, no mechanism can achieve social
   optimality and ensure voluntary participation, while maintaining a
   balanced budget, for all instances of a security game. We then compare
   two incentive mechanisms in this context for improving security
   investment among users, namely the Pivotal mechanism and the Externality
   mechanism. We show that even though both mechanisms incentivize socially
   optimal investments, they differ in terms of budget requirements and
   participation. The Pivotal mechanism guarantees users' participation;
   however, although (weakly) budget balanced in many game environments, it
   runs a budget deficit in security games. The Externality mechanism on
   the other hand is a budget balanced mechanism, but fails to incentivize
   voluntary participation. We further study the effects of the information
   available to the mechanism designer on the budget deficit of the Pivotal
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the growth of team-based design projects in first-year
   engineering courses, more research is needed into student attitudes
   toward teamwork and the characteristics of team experiences that lead to
   improvements in student attitudes toward working in teams. This study is
   an exploratory investigation of student attitudes toward teamwork at
   three time points during a first-year project-based, team-based design
   course: before students have begun working in teams, after they have
   completed an initial small-scale design project in a 4- or 5-person
   team, and after they have completed a larger-scale design project with a
   different, similarly-sized team. The general classroom approach on
   teaching teamwork is discussed with details on the variety of teaching
   methods used to engage students in learning and practicing good teaming
   skills. The quantitative and qualitative results from the survey are
   discussed, and conclusions drawn as regards students' perceived fun,
   frustration, and learning to understand what factors influence students'
   perceptions of these three aspects of teamwork.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering and science professors have been provided strong evidence
   that Research-Based Instructional Strategies (RBIS), such as active
   learning, are effective in increasing student learning, yet the rate of
   adoption of such strategies has been slow. While concerns about time
   management and lack of support from administration commonly discourage
   the adoption of RBIS, students' potentially negative reaction to a new
   teaching method is another important barrier. Research has shown that
   students can perceive a new teaching method, like group discussions, as
   being unhelpful while assessment evidence indicates that the method
   results in learning gains. Expectation Violation theory predicts that if
   a class differs from a students' expectations (i.e., typically a
   lecture), the student will resist the instructional strategy and thereby
   limit its effectiveness. We propose that a proper understanding of what
   an incoming engineering student anticipates from a college classroom
   will help a professor transition to using a RBIS more smoothly. In this
   pilot study, focus groups were conducted with undergraduate engineering
   students to discuss their experiences and expectations for transitioning
   to college engineering classes.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the learning outcomes of engineering service
   learning projects carried out in an international setting, we performed
   an exploratory study to assess the learning outcomes of a student-led
   project involving the design and construction of a pedestrian bridge in
   a village in rural Bolivia. The students kept reflective journals during
   their four-week stay in Bolivia. We have analyzed the journals from a
   phenomenological framework. The data suggests that the design experience
   stretched the students' abilities to communicate effectively across
   cultural and linguistic barriers and also strengthened the students'
   abilities to work effectively as a team. There were multiple issues that
   arose in the field that required deviations from the original bridge
   design, forcing the students to make important engineering decisions in
   the field. The hands-on nature of the project gave students a newfound
   appreciation for scale as well as practical experience using surveying
   equipment, mixing and pouring concrete, working with power tools, and
   using safety harnesses. Additionally, students reported a fresh
   appreciation for civil infrastructure and a meaningful understanding of
   the ways in which civil engineering can be used to benefit society at a
   global scale. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the qualitative
   data and offers implications for others wishing to adapt our work.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on a case study in which we followed the design
   processes of eight student design teams enrolled in a semester-long
   upper-level design course involving a new ideation tool, ``Design
   Heuristics.{''} We observed how students formulated concepts and
   implemented ideas using the Design Heuristics tool in their ongoing
   projects. Our analysis revealed that all teams carried their
   heuristic-inspired concepts to their latter stage designs, with seven
   teams carrying their heuristic-inspired concepts to their final designs
   and prototypes. As all eight teams studied were working on different
   design problems, our findings demonstrate the utility and practicality
   of Design Heuristics across various design contexts. In addition, we
   found patterns in the design teams' general approaches to the design
   process, including synthesis, transformation, and abstraction. Seven of
   the eight teams showed some evidence of concept synthesis in their
   design processes, but often struggled in synthesizing multiple concepts
   together. Additionally, all teams seemed to directly transfer their
   ideas, concepts, or prototypes from one phase of the design process to
   another without abstraction (the use of a heuristic in an unanticipated
   way as a prompt to think of something new), while only three teams
   showed evidence of abstract transformation to develop their ideas across
   design process phases (such as from an early design phase to a later
   one). Our findings provide pedagogical recommendations for using the
   Design Heuristics tool in design classes and suggest opportunities for
   further research related to concept generation, development, and
   synthesis throughout the design process.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the characteristics of teachers and factors that
   may contribute to student success, faculty members from Bangladesh and
   the USA were compared to determine if there were similarities or
   differences in their perceptions of teaching styles and their final
   outcomes. Participating faculty from the USA and Bangladesh performed a
   self-assessment of their teaching styles using The Grasha-Riechmann
   teaching style survey. The current investigation explored a number of
   research questions such as whether teaching style depends on age,
   gender, number of years teaching, academic rank or highest degree
   earned. Statistical analysis, using independent samples t tests,
   Kruskall Wallace tests, and chi-squared, were conducted to answer the
   research questions. The second area of investigation involved looking
   for differences between a developing country and a developed country
   with regard to the characteristics mentioned above.
   In addition to analysis of the above research questions, interactions
   between variables were considered, to determine any effect on each
   other. No significant difference was found in teaching styles based on
   age or gender; however, some interactions were observed based on level
   of education attained by the teacher, as well as number of years
   teaching. Notwithstanding, the results of this study showed no
   significant differences in teaching styles based on the age, gender,
   degree earned, number of years teaching, or academic rank.}},

Abstract = {{Students in chemical engineering courses often bemoan the lack of
   information regarding actual chemical engineering equipment in our
   curricula. To address this critical need in our curricula our laboratory
   has devoted twenty years to the development of an online visual
   encyclopedia of chemical engineering equipment, aimed at chemical
   engineering undergraduate students. This encyclopedia provides students
   with a basic understanding of what chemical engineering equipment looks
   like and how it works. In our paper we describe the encyclopedia and
   present ways to incorporate the encyclopedia into core Chemical
   Engineering courses.
   Many pedagogical tools to enrich chemical engineering courses are
   available, but faculty with limited time often don't fine the time to
   implement these tools into these courses. In this paper we provide
   suggestions to enrich existing assignments and course activities, which
   will lower the barrier to action. This will allow faculty to easily
   expose students to real chemical engineering equipment through the use
   of the Encyclopedia, enriching their educational experience and better
   preparing them to become chemical engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Ideation is the process of generating ideas for solving design problems,
   and it is a critical part of the overall design process. In order to
   encourage designers to ideate across a broader spectrum of ideas, we
   developed the Design Problem Framework (DPF) to assist in the
   development and framing of design problem statements. Part of the basis
   for the DPF was research on cognitive styles, which suggests that there
   is a range of preferences for approaching problem solving, and that
   these preferences influence how different individuals naturally approach
   ideation. We used Kirton's Adaption-Innovation theory as a basis for
   understanding the range of cognitive styles. The other part of the basis
   for the DPF was research on problem framing, which suggests that the
   structure of design problem statements influences an individual's
   approach and the outcomes produced. Using the DPF as a foundation, we
   propose that design problems that encourage adaptive ideation behaviors
   include more specified constraints, along with criteria for solutions
   that build on already existing solutions to the same or similar
   problems. In contrast, design problems that encourage innovative
   ideation behaviors include criteria for solutions that are radically
   different from existing solutions and are not bound by specific
   constraints. In this paper, we present a set of five design problems
   constructed using the DPF, with three different versions of each problem
   statement: (1) a neutrally framed version; (2) an adaptively framed
   version; and (3) an innovatively framed version. Three examples of
   student-generated solutions are also discussed to illustrate the
   resulting outcomes. We propose this framework as a guide for the
   development of design problem statements for use in education, research,
   and the workplace.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the finding that students made small increases in
   interdisciplinary learning through completion of a graduate elective
   course on bacterial biofilms that was designed and offered according to
   an interdisciplinary approach. The course enrolled students from
   multiple disciplines and was co-taught by two instructors with different
   disciplinary perspectives. As assessed through three surveys at
   different time points in the course, students increased their
   self-perceived ability to recognize disciplinary perspectives and
   teamwork skills; however, students made little to no changes in their
   interdisciplinary skills and reflective behavior over the course of the
   semester. The course contained students from chemical engineering, civil
   and environmental engineering, and microbiology and immunology. Through
   coding responses to homework assignments, we identified an increase in
   the use of engineering terminology in microbiology and immunology
   students as well as an increase in the use of microbiology terminology
   in engineering students. During the fourth week of the course only 27\%
   of students used terminology in responses to a homework problem that
   predominantly related to both engineering and microbiology or a
   discipline other than their own, while in the fourteenth week of the
   course 64\% of students utilized either interdisciplinary terminology or
   terminology from a discipline outside of their own to propose extensions
   of course projects. Overall, we have shown that a graduate course
   designed to improve interdisciplinary learning is capable of making
   small increases in the interdisciplinary learning of students.}},

Abstract = {{During emulation and post-silicon validation of networks-on-chip (NoCs),
   lack of observability of internal operations hinders the detection and
   debugging of functional bugs. Verifying the correctness of the
   control-flow portion of the NoC requires tests that exercise its
   functionality, while abstracting the data content of traffic. We propose
   a methodology where network packets are repurposed for the storage of
   debug information collected during execution. Debug data pertaining to
   each packet is collected at routers along its path and stored by
   replacing the packet's original data content. Our solution is coupled
   with a detection scheme consisting of small checkers that monitor
   execution and flag bugs. Upon bug detection, we analyze the debug
   information to reconstruct network traffic. We also provide relevant
   statistics for debugging, such as packet interactions and packet
   latencies, per router. In our experiments, this approach allows us to
   reconstruct over 80\% of the packets' routes. Moreover, the obtained
   statistics facilitate debugging erroneous network behavior and
   identifying performance bottlenecks.}},

Abstract = {{A scheduling algorithm based on weighted users' correlation and fairness
   (WUCFS) is proposed for MU-MIMO downlink broadcast channels (BC), to
   address the problem that traditional fairness scheduling algorithms
   cannot handle, i.e., they cannot accurately compute the achievable rate
   for each user in their iterative user selection process, thus creating
   an undesirable tradeoff between user fairness and system sum-rate. The
   proposed WUCFS is used to activate mobile subscribers by evaluating the
   correlation between the candidate and the selected users as well as
   those who may be scheduled for data transmission. Weighted
   inverse-correlation maximization is then employed to determine which
   users to be scheduled for data transmission. By estimating potential
   co-channel interference (CCI) a priori, our algorithm can accurately
   estimate the actual transmission rate of each mobile user, and fairly
   activate a set of users with small mutual interference. Compared to
   existing schemes, the proposed algorithm is shown to improve fairness
   among users while ensuring high system sum-rate.}},

   transparent interconnecting layer, a dual element (tandem) cell achieves
   a power conversion efficiency of 10.0 +/- 0.5\%. We further improve the
   cell performance by adding an additional (3rd) sub-cell that absorbs at
   the second order optical interference maximum within the stack. The
   triple-junction cell significantly improves the quantum efficiency at
   shorter wavelengths, achieving a power conversion efficiency of 11.1 +/-
   0.5\%, which to our knowledge, is the highest reported for a
   multi-junction OPV cell in the scientific literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the stability analysis of integer linear programs
   with respect to perturbations in stochastic data, namely Markov chains.
   These perturbations affect the initial distribution, the transition
   matrix, or the stationary distribution of Markov chains. Stability
   analysis is concerned with obtaining the set of all perturbations for
   which a solution to the integer optimization problem remains optimal. In
   particular, we derive expressions for stability regions for
   perturbations in the initial distribution, the transition matrix and the
   stationary distribution. The constraints that preserve the stochasticity
   of the problem data are affine. The intersection of the stability region
   for arbitrary perturbations with these affine constraints yields the
   desired stability regions. Finally, stability regions for perturbations
   of elements of the transition matrix, given that the problem is linear
   in the stationary distribution of that transition matrix, are obtained
   using a small perturbation analysis. The results are applied to sensor
   placement problems, where a phenomenon modeled as a Markov chain needs
   to be detected, and numerical examples are given.}},

Abstract = {{The flight envelope of an aircraft consists of the constant trim states
   that the aircraft can attain, given in terms of airspeed, turn rate, and
   flight path angle. Flight trajectories typically consist of a sequence
   of trim commands with intermediate transitions. While the flight
   envelope of an aircraft is determined beforehand, it may change under
   off-nominal conditions due to damage or actuator failure. The goal of
   this paper is to investigate the ability of an adaptive control law to
   reach new trim states in the case where the flight envelope is totally
   unknown. Within simulation, this approach provides an alternative
   technique for mapping the flight envelope. For an aircraft in flight,
   this approach can be used to reach new trim states under envelope
   uncertainty, as may occur during off-nominal flight conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A plethora of driver convenience and safety automation systems are being
   introduced into production vehicles, such as electronic stability
   control, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and obstacle avoidance.
   Assuring the seamless and safe integration of each new automation
   function with existing control functions is a major challenge for
   vehicle manufacturers. This challenge is compounded by having different
   suppliers providing software modules for different control
   functionalities. In this paper, we report on our preliminary steps to
   address this problem through a fresh perspective combining formal
   methods, control theory, and correct-by-construction software synthesis.
   In particular, we begin the process of synthesizing the control software
   module for adaptive cruise control from formal specifications given in
   Linear Temporal Logic. In the longer run, we will endow each interacting
   software module with an assume-guarantee specification stating under
   which environment assumptions the module is guaranteed to meet its
   specifications. These assume-guarantee specifications will then be used
   to formally prove correctness of the cyber-physical system obtained when
   the integrated modules interact with the physical dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudo-linear models of nonlinear systems use either a state-dependent
   coefficient or the Jacobian of the vector field to facilitate the use of
   Riccati techniques. In this paper we use the state-dependent Riccati
   equation (SDRE) and the forward propagating Riccati equation (FPRE) with
   pseudo-linear models to construct nonlinear observer-based compensators
   for output-feedback control of nonlinear discrete-time systems. While
   attractive due to their simplicity and potentially wide applicability,
   these techniques remain largely heuristic. The goal of this paper is
   thus to present numerical experiments to assess the performance of these
   ``faux{''} Riccati techniques on representative nonlinear systems. The
   goal is to compare the performance of SDRE and FPRE when used with
   either a state-dependent coefficient or the Jacobian of the vector

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach to exponentially stabilize
   periodic orbits in nonlinear systems with impulse effects, a special
   class of hybrid systems. Stabilization is achieved with a time invariant
   continuous-time controller. The presented method assumes a parametrized
   family of continuous-time controllers has been designed so that (1) a
   periodic orbit is induced, and (2) the orbit itself is invariant under
   the choice of parameters in the controllers. By investigating the
   properties of the Poincare return map, a sensitivity analysis is
   presented that translates the stabilization problem into a set of
   Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). A BMI optimization problem is set
   up to select the parameters of the continuous-time controller to achieve
   exponential stability. We illustrate the power of the approach by
   finding new stabilizing solutions for periodic orbits of an
   underactuated 3D bipedal robot.}},

   as well as the arrivals of customers sent from the other station. At the
   beginning, each controller has a probability mass function (PMF) on the
   number of customers in the other station. These PMFs are common
   knowledge between the two controllers. A decentralized routing policy
   that minimizes an infinite horizon average cost per unit time is

Abstract = {{This paper considers dynamic coverage control for nonholonomic agents
   along with collision avoidance guarantees. The novelties of the approach
   rely on the consideration of anisotropic sensing, which is realized via
   conic sensing footprints and sensing (coverage) functions for each
   agent, and on a novel form of avoidance functions. The considered
   sensing functions encode field-of-view and range constraints, and also
   the degradation of effective sensing close to the boundaries of the
   sensing footprint. Thus the proposed approach is suitable for
   surveillance applications where each agent is assigned with the task to
   gather enough information, such as video streaming in an obstacle
   environment. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper applies a recently developed, on-line, search-based
   optimization technique called Selective Evolutionary Generation Systems
   (SEGS) to manage battery state-of-charge and battery and generator
   delivered power in a Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle (SHEV). This energy
   and power management problem was recently tackled with a model
   predictive control approach that focused on improving overall powertrain
   operation efficiency rather than optimizing fuel consumption. However,
   the resultant constrained quadratic program is not easily solvable
   on-line in standard automotive microcontrollers, requiring explicit
   solutions obtained by off-line multiparametric programming solvers for
   implementation. In this paper, with the same motivation of maintaining
   SHEV operation in the high efficiency region, we apply the SEGS
   algorithm to SHEV control. The SEGS algorithm is not model-based but
   attains globally optimal behavior on-line using a probabilistic fitness
   distribution over a search space. It is also optimally search efficient
   and tunably responsive in dynamic environments despite taking only local
   and computationally-inexpensive decisions. Simulation results that
   illustrate this SEGS application are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Human operators can manipulate an integrator plant and manually track a
   single sine wave very well with almost unity amplitude ratio and zero
   phase lag as long as the frequency of the sine wave is not too high.
   However, the pattern of responses across single sine signals of
   different frequencies does not resemble the pattern of response across
   random appearing sum-of-sines signals for moderate to high frequencies.
   There is a significantly larger phase lag in tracking a sum-of-sines
   than tracking a single sine wave for moderate to high frequencies. This
   phenomenon suggests that humans utilize different control strategies for
   predictable tasks than for unpredictable tasks. In this paper we
   designed experiments and methodologies to identify non-parametric
   feedback and feedforward controllers in human operators for manual
   tracking with an explicit display of the sinusoidal reference signals
   and a disturbance input. Our results show that the feedback controller
   resembles McRuer's ``crossover model{''}, and the feedforward controller
   attempts to invert the system dynamics that the human operator is
   manipulating if the reference signal is predictable.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, linear quadratic tracking (LQT) is used to optimize the
   control gains for connected cruise control (CCC). We consider a vehicle
   string where the CCC vehicle at the tail receives position and velocity
   signals through wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication from
   other vehicles ahead (that are not equipped with CCC). An optimal
   feedback law is obtained by minimizing a cost function defined by
   headway and velocity errors and the acceleration of the CCC vehicle on
   an infinite horizon. We show that the feedback gains can be obtained
   recursively as signals from vehicles farther ahead become available, and
   that the gains decay exponentially with the number of cars between the
   source of the signal and the CCC vehicle. The effects of the cost
   function on the head-totail string stability are investigated and the
   robustness against variations in human parameters is tested. The
   analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.}},

   machines and infinite buffers. Specifically, analytical formulas for LT
   as a function of machine parameters are derived, and qualitative and
   quantitative properties of LT are investigated. Using these formulas,
   the so-called lead time control problem is solved, whereby the raw
   material release rate is selected so that LT takes the desired value,
   while the throughput is maximized. Both open-and closed-loop solutions

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of synthesizing switching protocols that
   regulate the modes of a switched system in order to guarantee that the
   trajectories of the system satisfy certain high-level specifications. In
   particular, we develop a computational framework for incremental
   synthesis of switching protocols. Augmented finite transition systems
   are used as abstract representations of continuous dynamics. Inspired by
   counter-example guided abstraction refinement procedures for hybrid
   system verification, we start with a coarse abstraction and gradually
   refine it according to preorder relations on augmented finite transition
   systems. At each iteration, the proposed procedure can produce either a
   switching protocol that ensures the satisfaction of the specification, a
   certificate for nonexistence of such a protocol, or a refinement
   suggestion together with a partial solution to be used in the next
   iteration. Although the procedure is not guaranteed to terminate in
   general, we illustrate its practical applicability with two simple
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a control methodology that unifies control barrier
   functions and control Lyapunov functions through quadratic programs. The
   result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both
   safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We
   begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with
   a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunovlike conditions; the
   existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies
   forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a
   notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality
   constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply
   forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can
   naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the
   context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous
   achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to
   conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs).
   These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise
   control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is
   balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and
   force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.}},

Abstract = {{We present a reference governor/command governor design for use in
   systems with slowly time-varying references or for enforcing slowly
   time-varying constraints. Ordinary governor designs are based on
   constraint-admissible invariant sets, but we base our design on
   contractive sets, which are used to ensure that the
   constraint-admissible set decays quickly enough to guarantee reference
   tracking or constraint enforcement for references or constraints that
   vary slowly. The results presented in the paper provide bounds on the
   rate of change of the reference or of the constraints, which are based
   on the rate of contraction. Two numerical examples are considered
   illustrating the capabilities of the new design. The first example is a
   linearized F-16 model that tracks a slowly-varying reference and the
   second example is a mass-spring-damper system that enforces a
   slowly-varying constraint.}},

   rich wireless communication capabilities has made them attractive to
   digital viruses and malicious contents. The user mobility and novel
   proximity-based communication technologies on one hand facilitate the
   information sharing and dissemination among people, on the other hand
   they increase the possibility of spreading malware. Understanding the
   propagation characteristics of malware could aid in planning protection
   strategies, but the most of the current models discuss it from the view
   of whole network. In this paper, we establish the model from the
   perspective of individuals by using Markov chain. Our model investigates
   the incubation period and remaining life time of a mobile smartphone
   when it is infected by malware. The numerical results provide
   comprehensive and intuitive explanations which are more realistic in

Abstract = {{Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have become increasingly widespread in recent
   years due to the extensive integration of many components in modern
   multicore processors and SoC designs. One of the fundamental tradeoffs
   in NoC design is the radix of its constituent routers. While high-radix
   routers enable a richly connected and low diameter network, low-radix
   routers allow for a small silicon area. Since the NoC consumes a
   significant portion of the on-chip resources, naively deploying an
   expensive high-radix network is not a practical option.
   In this work, we present a novel solution to provide high-radix like
   performance at a cost similar to that of a low-radix network. Our
   solution leverages the irregularity in runtime communication patterns to
   provide short low-latency paths between frequently communicating nodes,
   while infrequently communicating pairs rely on longer paths. To this
   end, it leverages a flexible topology reconfiguration infrastructure
   with abundantly available links between routers (in accordance to a
   high-radix topology) that are decoupled from scarcely available router
   ports (similar to a low-radix topology). Network links are bound to
   router ports at runtime to form connected and deadlock-free topologies.
   Binding selections are based on the traffic patterns observed, which are
   synthesized through a distributed statistics-collection framework. Our
   experiments on a 64-node CMP, running multiprogrammed workloads, show
   that we can reduce average network latency by 19\% over an area-and
   power-comparable mesh NoC. The latency improvements for non-uniform
   synthetic traffic are above 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{In the Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan (UM),
   we have spent the past five years building social context into several
   courses in the traditional computer science (CS) curriculum.
   Specifically, freshman-and senior-level, project-based classes have been
   designed to both teach significant and appropriate academic content,
   while also building software games and apps for children with cognitive
   and/or physical disabilities within the university's associated
   hospital. Children with disabilities provide the context for these
   courses, while the content remains representative of a traditional
   curriculum.
   The cadence of the course(s) is typically: propose, pitch, form groups,
   design, build, test, and improve. Each student submits a written
   proposal for the project. A group of experts read all of the proposals,
   and choose the `best' for pitching to the other students in the course.
   Groups are formed, using student preferences, based upon the pitches.
   The newly formed groups follow an engineering process that includes
   gathering requirements and designing the software system. Student groups
   partition the work, and implement three iterations (alpha, beta, final)
   of their designs. Groups are re-formed, and the newly formed groups test
   code from each other's groups. Finally, original development groups have
   the ability to make final improvements to their code. Student groups are
   offered the opportunity to continue work on promising projects through
   subsequent independent studies or internships. If the software project
   is `minimally viable', the groups are encouraged to continue development
   and work with the university's Center for Entrepreneurship or Office of
   Technology Transfer toward eventual commercialization.
   During the past academic year (2013-2014), one of the senior-level
   courses had the singular focus of developing software apps and games for
   a 13 year old girl with athetoid cerebral palsy. Her family was actively
   involved in the course, filtering project ideas and offering suggestions
   for improvement. Some of the most promising apps are currently installed
   in the family's house for methodical review and eventual improvement.
   This paper will discuss the general process that is used in this style
   of course, the specific approach that was used during the 2013-2014
   academic year, and offer general suggestions for implementation in
   disciplines other than computer science.}},

Abstract = {{At the tipping of a paradigm shift in the way energy is produced,
   transmitted and delivered, the research efforts have not been paralleled
   by the curricular development. With rapid pace of changes in the field
   of Smart Grid (SG), the traditional research and educational efforts
   have been a major domain for electrical engineers. As a mode of
   discovery and education, interdisciplinarity facilitates broadened
   perspectives, ability to synthesize, analyze, integrate, and apply
   knowledge, and out-of-the-box thinking. The major contributions of this
   paper are discussion of requirements of the educational efforts in SG
   with special emphasis on multidisciplinarity, survey of the related
   work, which is the first in the literature to the best of our knowledge,
   and a discussion of the content for such an effort. A mixed team of
   power engineers and computer scientists are developing a layered
   curriculum starting from the introductory material from a variety of SG
   topics. A distinguishing advantage is the availability of many software
   tools and the state-of-the-art testbed as a result of years of research.}},

Abstract = {{The energy sector worldwide has embarked on a transformational process
   to modernize the over-a-century-old power grid under an umbrella term of
   the Smart Grid. This vast infrastructural upgrade and operational change
   involves integration of a variety of advanced digital computing,
   communications and industrial control technologies. This brings new
   capabilities, but also necessitates a re-education of the aging
   workforce and training of the emerging workforce. While training does
   exist, the training approach and the accessibility of that training is
   often at odds with the needs of the utilities.
   To support this education and training need, in this paper we introduce
   the beginning of a modular, hands-on and open Smart Grid cybersecurity
   educational training platform and supporting materials together with an
   assessment of a preliminary version leveraged at the Trustworthy Cyber
   Infrastructure for the Power Grid (TCIPG) Summer School held in 2013.
   We base pedagogical pillars onto: (1) Active Learning that promotes
   analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of the content from Bloom's
   taxonomy, (2) The theory of project-based learning, (3) Piaget's
   learn-by-doing posture, and (4) Constructivist perspective of education.
   The main goal of this effort is to develop a complete, phased, and
   modular learning platform to provide the essential base knowledge and
   hands-on training exercises for understanding and demonstrating
   competency in Smart Grid cybersecurity.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of online completion of ill-conditioned low-rank
   matrices. While many matrix completion algorithms have been proposed
   recently, they often struggle with ill-conditioned matrices and take a
   long time to converge. In this paper, we present a new algorithm called
   Polar Incremental Matrix Completion (PIMC) to address this problem. Our
   method is based on the GROUSE algorithm, and we show how a polar
   decomposition can be used to maintain an estimate of the singular value
   matrix to better deal with ill-conditioned problems. The method is also
   online, allowing it to be applied to streaming data. We evaluate our
   algorithm on both synthetic data and a real ``structure from motion{''}
   dataset from the computer vision community, and show that PIMC
   outperforms similar methods.}},

Abstract = {{Intercellular heterogeneity serves as both a confounding factor in
   studying individual clones and an information source in characterizing
   any heterogeneous tissues, such as blood, tumor systems. Due to
   inevitable sequencing errors and other technical artifacts such as PCR
   errors, systematic efforts to characterize intercellular genomic
   heterogeneity must effectively distinguish genuine clonal sequences from
   fake derivatives. We developed a novel approach (SIGH) for identifying
   significant genuine clonal sequences directly from mixed sequencing
   reads that can improve genomic analyses in many biological contexts.
   This method offers several attractive features: (1) it automatically
   estimates the error rate from raw sequence reads and identifies genuine
   clonal sequences; (2) it is robust to the large variety of error rate
   due to the varying experimental conditions; (3) it is supported by a
   well-grounded statistical framework that exploits probabilistic
   characteristics of sequencing errors; (4) its unbiased strategy allows
   detecting rare clone(s) despite that clone's relative abundance; and (5)
   it estimates constituent proportions in each sample. Extensive realistic
   simulation studies show that our method can reliably estimate the error
   rates and faithfully distinguish the genuine clones from fake
   derivatives, paving the way for follow-up analysis that is otherwise
   impeded by the often dominant fake clones.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of the application areas of the Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSNs) and the technological advances in sensor electronics,
   target tracking has become one of the most important functions in WSNs.
   The overwhelming majority of moving target tracking studies in WSNs has
   assumed either one-dimensional space (lineland), or two-dimensional
   domain (flatland). However, many existing, such as environmental
   monitoring of rugged terrain, structural health monitoring of buildings,
   underground and underwater WSN applications, and emerging applications,
   such as search-and-rescue via Micro Aerial Vehicles, reconnaissance by
   insect-sized flying robots, need target tracking in three-dimensional
   space. In this study, we assume a Wireless Aerial Sensor Network (WASN)
   with conventional low-power and low-complexity features and devise a low
   spatial and temporal complexity moving target tracking mechanism in 3D
   based on g-h filter that considers measurement errors. Our prefatory
   simulations show promising preliminary results for our approach in terms
   of very low inaccuracy rates between the true location of the target and
   the forecasts at the sink node as well as negligible estimate errors in
   terms of Euclidean distance.}},

Abstract = {{In a data center with TCP/IP communications, it is generally believed
   that packet-based load balancing is not suitable because the associated
   packet out-of-order problem will significantly lower the network
   utilization. In this paper, we first show that if packet-based load
   balancing is performed properly in a fat-tree based data center, the
   packet out-of-order problem is not as severe as most researchers
   believed. This is due to the fact that multiple (minimal) paths between
   any given pair of servers in a fat-tree are of the same hop count. If
   packets are evenly routed onto different paths, they will experience
   similar delay performance. As a result, the packet out-of-order arrivals
   at the receiver are usually within a small sequence number range.
   Notably, the fast retransmit (FR) algorithm in TCP will be triggered for
   resending the ``lost{''} packet if three duplicate ACKs are received
   (i.e. FR threshold is three). To provide leeway for out-of-order packet
   arrivals due to packet-based load balancing, we propose to judiciously
   increase the FR threshold. Simulation results show that FR threshold
   values between 6 and 9 can effectively suppress unnecessary fast
   retransmits and at the same time, the impact to real packet losses is
   minimal. Compared to a flow-based load balancing scheme, we found that
   our packet-based load balancing with modified TCP consistently provides
   higher goodput and noticeably smaller delay.}},

   However, they can be slowin applications that involve shift-variant

   localization of the wavelet basis and the shift-variant behavior of the

   indicate that the proposed method is faster than state-of-the-art

   methods are tuned carefully. Unlike variable splitting methods, the

   map can be significantly different due to changing weather, lighting
   conditions and dynamical objects present in the environment. Various
   3D/2D features are extracted from the textured point clouds (scans) and
   each scan is represented as a collection of these features. For two
   scans acquired from the same location, the high value of MI between the
   features present in the scans indicates that the scans are captured from
   the same location. We use a non-parametric entropy estimator to estimate
   the true MI from the sparse marginal and joint histograms of the
   features extracted from the scans. Experimental results using seasonal
   datasets collected over several years are used to validate the
   robustness of the proposed algorithm.}},

   long-term SLAM, we use the recent Generic Linear Constraints (GLC)
   framework to sparsify our factor-graph. This paper analyzes how our
   single-session SLAM techniques can be used in the GLC framework, and
   describes a particle filter reacquisition algorithm so that an
   underwater session can be automatically re-localized to a previously
   built SLAM graph. We provide real-world experimental results involving

Abstract = {{Robust SLAM methods can allow robots to recover correct maps even in the
   presence of incorrect loop closures. While these approaches improve
   robustness to outliers, they are susceptible to getting caught in local
   minima, a problem which is exacerbated by poor initial estimates.
   In this paper, we describe a stochastic gradient descent optimization
   approach that exhibits greater robustness to poor initial estimates. Our
   approach can either be used as a standalone optimization system or in
   conjunction with existing methods such as Gauss-Newton solvers. Using a
   combination of synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that
   our proposed approach is able to recover correct pose graphs
   significantly more frequently than other methods when large
   initialization errors are present.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a system for crowdsourcing saliency interest points
   for robotically gathered 3D maps rendered on smartphones and tablets. An
   app was created that is capable of interactively rendering 3D
   reconstructions gathered with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. Through
   hundreds of thousands of logged user interactions with the models we
   attempt to data-mine salient interest points. To this end we propose two
   models for calculating saliency from human interaction with the data.
   The first uses the view frustum of the camera to track the amount of
   time points are on screen. The second treats the camera's path as a time
   series and uses a Hidden Markov model to learn the classification of
   salient and non-salient points. To provide a comparison to existing
   techniques, several traditional visual saliency approaches are applied
   to orthographic views of the models' photo-texturing. The results of all
   approaches are validated with human attention ground truth gathered
   using a remote gaze-tracking system that recorded the locations of the
   person's attention while exploring the models.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time plane extraction in 3D point clouds is crucial to many
   robotics applications. We present a novel algorithm for reliably
   detecting multiple planes in real time in organized point clouds
   obtained from devices such as Kinect sensors. By uniformly dividing such
   a point cloud into non overlapping groups of points in the image space,
   we first construct a graph whose node and edge represent a group of
   points and their neighborhood respectively. We then perform an
   agglomerative hierarchical clustering on this graph to systematically
   merge nodes belonging to the same plane until the plane fitting mean
   squared error exceeds a threshold. Finally we refine the extracted
   planes using pixel -wise region growing. Our experiments demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithm can reliably detect all major planes in the
   scene at a frame rate of more than 35Hz for 640 x 480 point clouds,
   which to the best of our knowledge is much faster than state-of-the-art
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The technology of wireless charging, also referred to as wireless power
   transfer (WPT) or inductive power transfer (IPT), has been successfully
   applied at the low power level, such as applications in the medical
   field or in small devices such as smart phones Along with the fast
   growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEVs), wireless charging is becoming a new way of charging
   batteries. In this paper, the design of a WPT system for electrical bus
   fast wireless charging stations will be presented. The system is
   composed by a two stage switching power supply, i.e. a multiphase
   soft-switching buck converter controlling the output power and a
   high-frequency resonant full-bridge converter connected to a
   series-series compensation topology. The input DC voltage is around 700
   V and the maximum output power is 22 kW. An analytical description of
   the system is reported, as well as simulations and experimental results
   based on a TMS320F28335 DSP are presented to confirm the effectiveness
   of the proposed system.}},

   cognitive radio network forensics. It faces great challenges mainly due
   to the unknown secondary user behavior, wide spectrum, and packet
   capturing uncertainty. There is a lack of fundamental understanding of
   the data capturing problem in theory. In this paper, for the first time,
   we formulate the dynamic sniffer channel assignment problem without the
   knowledge of users' behavior patterns as a non-stochastic multi-armed
   bandit (MAB) problem. Moreover, we consider a more practical scenario
   with the consideration of packet capturing uncertainty and switching
   cost. We then propose an efficient solution to solve the problem and
   analyze the regret of our policy. Finally, a simulation study validates
   the convergence of our method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the impact of pulse jamming on Alamouti
   space-time block codes (STBC). We find the worst case duty cycle of a
   pulse jammer that maximizes the bit-error-rate (BER). We show that, like
   the single antenna case, with pulse jamming the BER is an inverse linear
   function of the signal-to-jammer power ratio (SJR). In addition, we
   study the transmit antenna correlation effects on the STBC system
   performance in terms of BER and find the corresponding optimal jamming
   strategy. We find that as the correlation increases, the BER maximizing
   duty cycle of a pulse jammer increases. As an anti-jamming technique
   that mitigates the jamming effects, we concatenate convolutional codes
   with the STBC system. The numerical result shows that convolutional
   codes improves the BER of the system by as much as 30 dB at 10(-5) BER
   at the expense of lowering the data rate.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-particle imager with sensitivity to both neutrons and photons has
   been developed for the detection of special nuclear material. This
   system has the capability to provide spectral information on detected
   sources that is useful for safeguard applications. In nuclear facilities
   with high photon background rates, neutron detection can aid in
   identification and verification capabilities. The dual-particle imager
   creates a reconstructed neutron spectrum by correlating neutron counts
   in pairs of liquid scintillators. The reconstructed spectrum, a
   combination of energy deposited and time-of-flight, contains resolution
   effects that blur the true, emitted source-spectrum. To reduce the
   impact of resolution effects, the reconstructed spectrum can be unfolded
   to create an estimated source spectrum. A statistical technique,
   maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization, has been shown to produce
   an unfolded result for Cf-252 and Am-Be. This technique requires a
   system response-matrix that contains reconstructed spectra for single
   neutron energies. Since measuring mono-energetic neutrons is difficult,
   the system-response-matrix is simulated. Monte Carlo modeling with
   MCNPX-PoliMi has been show to produce an accurate system response. This
   work expands on previous neutron unfolding results by showing results
   for mixed oxide fuel and plutonium metal measured with the dual-particle
   imager. These results also demonstrate the ability of the dual particle
   imager to discrimination between spontaneous fission neutrons and
   (alpha,n) reaction neutrons.}},

Abstract = {{The separation of neutron and gamma-ray events in organic-liquid
   scintillators is of significant importance for nonproliferation
   applications. Typically pulse shape discrimination (PSD) technique is
   used to differentiate neutron distribution from gamma-ray distribution.
   However, one of the challenges remains whether the scintillator's PSD is
   affected with respect to the particle interaction position. This can be
   studied by mapping the detector's PSD performance by discriminating
   neutron front gamma-rays as a function of the particle interaction
   position within its active volume. This is useful for developing
   procedures for improved data analysis and simulations. This paper
   presents the PSD response of an organic-scintillator with respect to the
   position of neutron and gamma-ray interactions. A Cf-252 source was used
   to collect neutron and gamma-ray pulses in 25 x 25 x 8.2 cm(3) BC-501A
   liquid scintillator. The detector's spatial PSD responses are analyzed
   with Pb and polyethylene collimators having 6-mm aperture.
   Figure-of-merits are then computed from their respective PSDs to
   quantify the detector's PSD response with respect to the particle
   interaction position. Based on the findings, the spatial PSD response
   for all positions are within 5\% to the PSD response at the detector's
   center position.}},

Abstract = {{Thallium bromide (TIBr) is being investigated for use as room
   temperature semiconductor gamma-ray spectrometers because of its wide
   band gap (2.68 eV) and high stopping power. When cooled to -20 degrees
   C, performance of better than 1\% FWHM at 662 keV has been observed on
   5x5x5 mm(3) pixelated TIBr detectors. Currently, each of nine anode
   pixels (in a 3 x 3 array) is read out individually through separate
   preamplifiers, limiting the number of pixels that can practically' be
   used. VAD\_UM digital application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is
   currently used to read out signals from an array of 11x11 pixel anodes
   on each 31) CdZnTe detector. this work applies the same digital ASIC to
   TIBr by designing and building a compact system capable of reading out a
   larger detector (12mm x 12mm x 5mm as opposed to the current 5mm x 5mm x
   5mm) while keeping the detector cooled for stable operation. We present
   an initial characterization of the system, including operating
   performance and power consumption used to keep the detector at various
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The dual-particle imaging system being developed at the University of
   Michigan was used at the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy for
   measurements on samples of special nuclear material. A 1,150-g
   mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel sample was measured with various shielding
   configurations to determine how the presence of lead and/or polyethylene
   shielding degrades the system's ability to localize a source by
   simultaneous neutron and photon imaging. Three two-hour measurements
   were taken with the source shielded by an: a) 8-mm lead sheath and
   5.1-cm lead bricks, b) 8-mm lead sheath and 6.5-cm polyethylene bricks,
   and c) 8-mm lead sheath, 5.1-cm lead bricks, and 6.5-cm polyethylene
   bricks. The 8-mm lead sheath was used in all cases to reduce the
   measured photon count rate. A ``bare{''} measurement was also made by
   using only the 8-mm lead sheath, but the unexpected presence of
   additional sources has rendered the measurement unsuitable for
   comparison. The resulting images show that the dual-particle imaging
   system is able to accurately localize the MOX canister in the presence
   of intervening material.}},

Abstract = {{A stilbene crystal was coupled to a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) to
   assess the performance of the detector's pulse shape discrimination
   (PSD) between fast neutrons and gamma rays. Pulses were digitized from a
   measurement of Cf-252 and digital charge comparison was used to perform
   PSD. The stilbene crystal was then coupled to a photomultiplier tube
   (PMT) and the measurement was repeated. The PSD performance when using
   the SiPM was compared to that of the system using the PMT. Both systems
   demonstrate efficient ability to discriminate between neutrons and gamma
   rays. While PMTs have long been the standard technology for light
   readout, SiPMs show similar capabilities while being less expensive,
   significantly more compact in size, significantly less sensitive to
   magnetic fields, and having lower power requirements. Potential
   drawbacks of SiPMs include elevated levels of noise and nonlinearity at

Abstract = {{Nonlinearity in the output signals for the energy deposited by gamma-ray
   interactions can seriously degrade the energy resolution of a pixellated
   detector when the signals from more than one pixel are summed to get the
   total deposited energy. Such nonlinearity can be calibrated on a
   pixel-by-pixel basis by using multiple gamma-ray check sources of
   various known energy photopeaks for gamma-ray energy below 1.5 MeV.
   However such method becomes less practical above 1.5 MeV since only a
   few commercially available check sources provide a few prominent
   photopeaks between 1.5 MeV and 3.0 MeV and it takes a long time to get
   statistically enough counts in these high-energy peaks for each pixel.
   The nonlinearity in the response of a detector system consists of two
   parts - one from the nonlinearity of the readout electronics (pre-amp,
   shaping-amp, peak-hold, etc), the other from the nonlinearity of the
   detector (charge generation, charge transportation and charge
   collection). This paper will characterize the nonlinearity of 3-D
   position-sensitive CdZnTe detectors by using on-chip test pulse
   injection to separate the nonlinearity of the readout electronics and
   the detector. The nonlinearity of the detector can be much better
   modeled after deducting the nonlinearity of the electronics.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the first resonant infrared (IR) detectors with
   integrated nanostructured subwavelength plasmonic gratings designed to
   selectively absorb long wavelength infrared (LWIR) radiation. The
   resonant detectors are the smallest in size demonstrated so far. The
   absorbers are optimized for a spectral wavelength of 10.15 mu m and
   experimentally demonstrate an absorbance of 46\% with a Full Width at
   Half Maximum (FWHM) of 1.7 mu m. The absorbed thermal energy causes a
   fast (sub-millisecond) proportional change in the frequency of the
   resonator. The combination of resonant IR detectors with integrated
   plasmonic absorbers enables spectrally selective IR detectors. Each
   detector in the array can be optimized for different wavelengths, thus
   enabling a multi-spectral array for IR spectroscopy and multispectral
   thermal imaging.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automatic text document categorization system,
   HPHR. HPHR contains high precision, high recall and noise-filtered text
   categorization models. The text categorization models are generated
   through a suite of machine learning algorithms, a fast clustering
   algorithm that efficiently and effectively group documents into
   subcategories, and a text category generation algorithm that
   automatically generates text subcategories that represent high
   precision, high recall and noise-filtered text categorization models
   from a given set of training documents. The HPHR system was evaluated on
   documents drawn from two different applications, vehicle fault
   diagnostic documents, which are in a form of unstructured and verbatim
   text descriptions, and Reuters corpus. The performance of the proposed
   system, HPHR, on both document collections showed superiority over the
   systems commonly used in text document categorization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of vehicle suspension control from the
   perspective of a Vehicle-to-Cloud-to-Vehicle (V2C2V) distributed
   implementation. A simplified variant of the problem is examined based on
   the linear quarter-car model of semi-active suspension dynamics. Road
   disturbance is modeled as a combination of a known road profile, an
   unmeasured stochastic road profile and potholes. Suspension response
   when the vehicle hits the pothole is modeled as an impulsive change in
   wheel velocity with magnitude linked to physical characteristics of the
   pothole and of the vehicle. The problem of selecting the optimal damping
   mode from a finite set of damping modes is considered, based on road
   profile data. The information flow and V2C2V implementation are defined
   based on partitioning the computations and data between the vehicle and
   the cloud. A simulation example is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a novel framework for the economic operation of
   plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) parking decks integrated with on-site
   renewable energy generation (e.g., roof-top photovoltaic panel).
   Although the PEV parking decks may enable greater adoption of renewable
   energy sources by scheduling charging loads to coincide with periods of
   strong sun, the inherent intermittency and variability of renewable
   energy resources may complicate the economic operation of PEV parking
   decks. The proposed framework provides the parking deck operators with a
   stochastic analytical tool to make an optimal decision on hourly
   electricity sale prices and the parking fee over the next 24 hours. The
   stochastic approach includes the consideration of the forecasting errors
   of variable solar power output and the customers' charging demand. The
   case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic
   approach under a variety of charging schemes, price schedules and
   operational conditions, and also verify the feasibility and accuracy of
   this novel framework.}},

Abstract = {{Digital image is an effective communication media due to its immediacy
   and the easy-to-understand its content. The rapid development of image
   processing techniques has made it extremely easy to alter the content of
   images or to create new images. So photographs, which appear in
   magazines, social media, political attacks, can no longer be trusted.
   Over the past ten years, the field of digital image forensics has
   emerged to help restore some trust to digital images. This paper
   proposes a novel and effective technique to expose image forgery using
   inconsistent reflection vanishing point. More specifically, we give the
   definition of error distance, propose sin(2)()-based function to
   normalize error distance, and employ maximum normalized error distance
   to detect image forgery for the first time. Effectiveness and accuracy
   of the proposed technique is evaluated using a data set consisting of
   200 authentic and forged images. Experimental results indicate that the
   proposed method can detect image forgery with very high success rate and
   it is extremely robust to compression, filtering, and other image
   processing operations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust real time feature based algorithm for
   localization and recognition of multiple color and font style license
   plates. The algorithm uses digitized license plate images for robust
   detection and recognition. The resolution of the captured image is
   adjusted and the brightness and contrast are set to appropriate levels.
   An optimal threshold is applied to detect white regions of the enhanced
   image. The algorithm uses segmentation and component labeling to create
   candidate regions intelligently. For localization of the license plate,
   features of each region are extracted and analyzed by rectangularity
   percentage of the automobile's license plate. The use of color filter
   renders the algorithm more robust on license plate localization.
   Moreover, we use HSV color space to find the specific color regions.
   After localization of license plate in small sized image, the proposed
   algorithm uses rapid intelligent method for localization of license
   plate form the original image. The localized license plate image is
   cropped and processed by the recognition algorithm. Each character's
   region is identified by using segmentation algorithm based on the
   profile which includes character dilation and resizing for subsequent
   operations. In this paper, correlation optical character recognition and
   multi-layer perception neural networks techniques are used for
   recognizing the characters. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
   acceptable even in low-quality or bad light images.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the problem of how to detect and extract a
   particular ty4pe of propagation structure that arises in phishing
   activities. One of the most interesting phenomena induced by phishing is
   fast-flux, whereby a single malicious domain is mapped to a constantly
   changing IP address in order to evade capture and shut-down. This leads
   to malicious activities observed to be propagating through different
   networks, even though they originate from the same phishing campaign. To
   be able to detect and extract such a propagation is of significant
   importance as it can help us understand and analyze phishing activities.
   To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-layered propagation model,
   where layers correspond to different delay stages in the propagation and
   each is given by an adjacency matrix called the propagation matrix which
   models pairwise propagation relationships. A regression problem is then
   formulated to estimate this set of matrices so that the model prediction
   best fits the data; a Gibbs sampling based randomized algorithm is
   developed to efficiently find solutions with guaranteed performance. We
   evaluate our method using both simulation and Internet measurement data.}},

Abstract = {{Galloping motion has long been differentiated from other flow-induced
   motions like VIV and flutter based on the asymmetry of the flow present
   causing instability. Galloping instabilities can occur for circular
   cylinders due to proximity to a boundary or asymmetric cross-sections
   from strakes or other flow interference. The response of a bluff body
   due to galloping instabilities is still an active area of research. For
   VIV, such parameters as variable added mass term {[}1] and a damping
   parameter c{*} {[}2] have been introduced. This paper demonstrates that
   these parameters have the potential of being applied to galloping to
   model it as a distinct resonance phenomenon from other flow-induced
   motions.
   Additionally, it is demonstrate that the amplitudes of motion, variable
   added-mass, and lift are very sensitive to the added damping
   coefficient, but the initiation of galloping remains largely dependent
   on the natural frequency of the cylinder with little sensitivity to the
   damping.}},

Abstract = {{For many decades now, the idea of Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV) being
   modeled as a lock-in phenomenon of a mass-spring-dashpot system with an
   ideal added mass term has prevailed. In 2000, it was suggested by
   Vikestad et al. {[}1] that VIV may be modeled as a resonance phenomenon
   with variable natural frequency due to a variable added-mass term. In
   this paper, the variable added-mass approach is used for analysis of VIV
   at various added damping values. Additionally, Vandiver's damping
   coefficient c{*} is used {[}2] to correlate damping to lift. The
   findings are that:
   1. The oscillation frequency is in unity with the mean of the natural
   frequency with variable added mass for each period of oscillation during
   VIV lock-in no matter the damping value.
   2. The time-averaged variable added mass coefficient is shown to vary
   with an increasing damping coefficient, where below a reduced velocity
   of approximately seven, increased damping indicates increased added
   mass. After a reduced velocity of approximately seven, however,
   increased damping results in decreased added mass.
   3. Vandiver's damping coefficient c{*} plotted against the
   nondimensional amplitude follows very closely to c{*} A/D = max lift
   coefficient = square root of 0.79 {[}3]. A handful of cases did exceed
   square root of 0.79 but only marginally.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a path planning framework for underwater
   exploration and rugosity estimation using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
   (AUVs). Rugosity, a measure of variation in the height of a surface, is
   commonly used to characterize seafloor habitat. The goal of this work is
   to optimize the survey of an unknown area in order to efficiently
   estimate its rugosity. To this end, we propose a novel rugosity
   approximation on 3D voxel grids and a novel framework for using that
   approximation to adaptively plan AUV paths. The proposed method employs
   a heterogeneous set of sensors -multibeam sonar and stereo cameras
   -whose varied resolution and range make them complimentary for this
   task. For broad-scale exploration, sonar is used to produce a coarse
   sense of the area's structure. Fine-scale exploration is completed using
   the stereo cameras to refine the high-resolution estimate of rugosity.
   Results display the simulation of two scenarios on real structural data
   gathered with an AUV and diver held sensor. The first scenario explores
   the situation where no broad-scale information is available and the
   robot must explore the terrain optically. The second simulates the
   two-pass case and demonstrates our method's ability to achieve high
   accuracy rugosity estimation faster than other survey planning
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Increased market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will
   enable a shift in the transportation sector towards more sustainable
   energy options. However, PEV battery charging represents a significant
   additional burden on power systems, especially at the distribution level
   where the radial structure of the network may accentuate the effects of
   load variations. Furthermore, uncoordinated PEV charging could cause
   transformers to regularly operate beyond their thermal limits,
   increasing their likelihood of failure. Coordinated charging, based on
   distributed control methods, has been proposed as a means of mitigating
   voltage fluctuations and transformer overloads. Recent research can be
   divided into two categories: studies into the effects of static PEV
   loads on distribution networks, and development of control algorithms
   that vary PEV charging to accomplish specific goals. This paper combines
   these two ideas by analyzing distribution network load flow dynamics in
   response to a large population of coordinated PEVs. An IEEE 34-node
   distribution test feeder is simulated in conjunction with a fleet of
   PEVs under Additive-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) control. The
   resulting scheme ensures that all loads are satisfied, while controlling
   PEV demand to meet secondary considerations such as voltage regulation
   and transformer capacity limits. However, detrimental oscillations may
   develop under certain conditions. The paper investigates the cause of
   these unwanted variations.}},

Abstract = {{Solution algorithms for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem are well
   established for traditional electricity networks. However, there is an
   increasing need for integrating renewable sources and energy storage

   characteristics that require modification of standard OPF algorithms. In
   particular, energy storage devices introduce temporal coupling over the
   optimization horizon. Also, the modeling of non-unity storage efficiency
   requires complementarity conditions. This paper explores two algorithms
   that extend OPF methods to incorporate energy storage devices and wind
   generation. The first method is based on the well-known AC-LP OPF
   method, while the second is a quadratic program with DC power flow
   constraints. The algorithms are demonstrated using several test cases
   that consider a modified RTS-96 system. The performance of the two

Abstract = {{When energy storage units (ESUs) within the distribution grid, e.g.
   batteries, provide local services such as PV integration support, peak
   shaving, and infrastructure upgrade deferral, they are inactive or only
   partially used most of time. Moreover, they are often not profitable
   because of their high investment costs. Their unused capacities could be
   used to provide power system services, such as frequency control,
   allowing them to generate additional revenues. However, individual units
   might not be available to provide system services over the entire
   contract duration, since they must also provide their local services.
   This paper shows how an aggregation of distributed ESUs can
   simultaneously provide local services individually and system services
   in aggregate. Using a model predictive control approach, a central
   scheduler dynamically allocates parts of the energy and power capacities
   of each ESU to either the local or grid service with the objective of
   maximizing the profit of the aggregation. A key contribution of this
   paper is the development of an algorithm that handles both resource
   aggregation and optimal provision of multiple services. We find that
   multitasking can almost double an ESU's profits as compared with a
   single-service approach, and that the benefits from aggregation depend
   on the grid service market structure and how often the local service is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs)
   can provide power system services. However, a key challenge is to
   achieve coordinated control of large populations of resources using
   existing communication and control infrastructure or with minimal
   addition of new infrastructure. In this paper, we assume that we only
   have access to realistic measurements, i.e. data from residential smart
   meters every 15 minutes and noisy real-time measurements of the
   aggregate power consumption of TCLs from distribution substations. Our
   contribution is to develop a moving horizon state estimator (MHSE) to
   estimate the states of individual stochastic TCLs from these
   measurements. This is in contrast to previous work that focused on
   estimating the states of aggregate system models. The proposed MHSE is
   benchmarked against a simpler model-based prediction. We also propose a
   scalable closed-loop control structure that uses the MHSE method to
   provide frequency control with TCL populations. We demonstrate our
   results via a number of case studies with different TCL aggregations,
   process and measurement noise characteristics, and controller forcing
   levels. Our simulations show that the MHSE generally provides accurate
   state estimates and improves the controller performance.}},

Abstract = {{A novel nanoatenna is designed for enhancing an IR energy harvesting
   device and realization of a focal plane array polarimetric IR detector.
   Instead of using a bulk semiconductor material for photovoltaic
   detection, the semiconductor p-n junction is scaled down and loaded at
   the antenna's terminal where the antenna field enhancement can be
   utilized. For infrared (IR) devices, a low-band gap material, Indium
   Gallium Arsenide Antimonide (InGaAsSb) is used and its electrical
   properties are analyzed in order to optimize it as the antenna load. For
   maximum power transfer between the antenna and the load, the impedance
   matching is established by optimizing the antenna geometrical and
   material parameters as well as utilizing a reactive shunt transmission
   line stub. In numerical simulations, the Drude model for metal is
   incorporated in the FEM code to account for plasmonic effects. Also to
   match the antenna to high load impedance, the antenna is operated at its
   anti-resonance mode. It is shown that the antenna loaded with InGaAsSb
   can present a field enhancement as high as 23.5 in a near-IR band. The
   performance of the IR harvesting device in terms of absorption
   efficiency is enhanced by 50\%. Also the detectivity of the uncooled-IR
   detecting device made by such antenna and load is improved by a factor
   equal to the field enhancement factor (similar to 23).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the concept, design and fabrication of beam-scanning
   array antenna operating at Y-band (230-245 GHz) for light-weight

   radiating sub-arrays, generating a very narrow beam of less than 3
   degrees in azimuth and about 10 degrees in elevation with +/- 25 degrees
   azimuth steering capability. Slot-coupled cavity-backed patch arrays are
   used as the radiating elements of the main antenna in order to confine
   the beam of the antenna in the elevation plane. Silicon micromaching
   technology is used to microfabricate the prototype of the antenna. To
   characterize the micromachined antenna, a waveguide-probe near-field
   measurement setup is utilized. In the approach an open-ended waveguide
   probe is used along with on-wafer waveguide transitions to effectively
   feed the antenna. Measurement results are in excellent agreement with
   the full-wave simulation results of the antenna.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a survey with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (see Wade et al.,
   these proceedings), we have been monitoring the radial velocities of 15
   hot subdwarf systems with main sequence companions, with the goal of
   measuring their binary orbital periods. Three of our targets are known
   to be resolved visual pairs with separations ranging from 0.2 `' to 2
   `'. Velocity measurements of these systems reveal orbital periods that
   are incompatible with their angular separations on the sky; thus, they
   are likely multiple-component star systems with inner sdB binaries. Two
   of these inner binaries have long periods (P similar to 930 d), while
   the other has a short period (P < 10 d). Interestingly, one of the long
   period binaries shows a significant eccentricity of e = 0.54,
   challenging the conventional Roche Lobe overflow formation channel for
   hot subdwarfs. Here we discuss the nature of these systems and present
   up-to-date measurements of their orbital parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Binary population synthesis models are generally successful at
   reproducing the observed periods of hot subdwarf binaries with M dwarf
   or white dwarf companions; the story for sdB+F/G/K binaries, however, is
   still being written. Relatively few observational constraints have been
   published for these composite-spectra systems. We have been monitoring
   the radial velocities (RVs) of 15 hot subdwarf binaries with late F - K
   dwarf companions since 2005 using the Medium and High Resolution
   Spectrographs on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Here we present RV
   measurements and orbital parameter estimates for selected systems in our
   sample. We also present an up-to-date period histogram for all known hot
   subdwarf binaries, including both short and long-period systems. Our
   initial results suggest that those with late F - K main sequence
   companions have orbital periods on the order of 1.5 to 3 years. Several
   of the long-period binaries show strong evidence for non-circular
   orbits, challenging the conventional Roche Lobe overflow formation
   channel for hot subdwarfs.}},

Abstract = {{Solid particle erosion is a micromechanical process that is influenced
   by flow geometry, material of the impacting surface, impact angle,
   particle size and shape, particle velocity, flow condition and fluid
   properties. Among the various factors, particle size and velocity have
   been considered to be the most important parameters that cause erosion.
   Particle size and velocity are influenced by surrounding flow velocities
   and carrying fluid properties. Higher erosion rates have been observed
   in gas-solid flow in geometries where the flow direction changes
   rapidly, such as elbows, tees, valves, etc., due to local turbulence and
   unsteady flow behaviors. S-bend geometry is widely used in different
   fluid handling applications such as automotive, oil and gas, arteries
   and blood vessels. This paper presents the results of a Computational
   Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation of diluted gas-solid and liquid-solid
   flows through an S-Bend and the dynamic behavior of entrained solid
   particles in the flow. CFD analyses were performed at five different
   particle sizes ranging between 50 and 300 microns. Maximum erosive wear
   was observed at smaller particle sizes and compared to the larger sizes.
   The location of maximum erosion was at different locations in the first
   bend as compared to the second bend.}},

Abstract = {{The significant drawbacks and lack of success associated with current
   methods to treat critically sized nerve defects have led to increased
   interest in neural tissue engineering. Conducting polymers show great
   promise due to their electrical properties, and in the case of
   polypyrrole (PPY), its cell compatibility as well. Thus, the goal of
   this study is to synthesize a conducting composite nerve conduit with
   PPY and poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PDLLA), assess its ability to support
   the differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells in vitro,
   and determine its ability to promote nerve regeneration in vivo.
   Different amounts of PPY (5\%, 10\%, and 15\%) are used to synthesize
   the conduits resulting in different conductivities (5.65, 10.40, and
   15.56 ms/cm, respectively). When PC12 cells are seeded on these conduits
   and stimulated with 100 mV for 2 h, there is a marked increase in both
   the percentage of neurite-bearing cells and the median neurite length as
   the content of PPY increased. More importantly, when the PPY/PDLLA nerve
   conduit was used to repair a rat sciatic nerve defect it performed
   similarly to the gold standard autologous graft. These promising results
   illustrate the potential that this PPY/PDLLA conducting composite
   conduit has for neural tissue engineering. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{To deliver the energy efficiency and raw compute throughput necessary to
   realize exascale systems, projected designs call for massive numbers of
   (simple) cores per processor. An unfortunate consequence of such designs
   is that the memory bandwidth per core will be significantly reduced,
   which can significantly degrade the performance of many memory-intensive
   HPC workloads. To identify the code regions that are most impacted and
   to guide them in developing mitigating solutions, system designers and
   application developers alike would benefit immensely from a systematic
   framework that allowed them to identify the types of computations that
   are sensitive to reduced memory bandwidth and to precisely identify
   those regions in their code that exhibit sensitivity. This paper
   introduces a framework for identifying the properties in computations
   that are associated with memory bandwidth sensitivity, extracting those
   same properties from HPC applications, and for associating bandwidth
   sensitivity to specific structures in the application source code. We
   apply our framework to a number of large scale HPC applications,
   observing that the bandwidth sensitivity model shows an absolute mean
   error that averages less than 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Deploying large numbers of small, low-power cores has been gaining
   traction recently as a system design strategy in high performance
   computing (HPC). The ARM platform that dominates the embedded and mobile
   computing segments is now being considered as an alternative to high-end
   x86 processors that largely dominate HPC because peak performance per
   watt may be substantially improved using off-the-shelf commodity
   processors.
   In this work we methodically characterize the performance and energy of
   HPC computations drawn from a number of problem domains on current ARM
   and x86 processors. Unsurprisingly, we find that the performance, energy
   and energy-delay product of applications running on these platforms
   varies significantly across problem types and inputs. Using static
   program analysis we further show that this variation can be explained
   largely in terms of the capabilities of two processor subsystems: single
   instruction multiple data (SIMD)/floating point and the cache/memory
   hierarchy; and that static analysis of this kind is sufficient to
   predict which platform is best for a particular application/input pair.
   In the context of these findings, we evaluate how some of the key
   architectural changes being made for upcoming 64-bit ARM platforms may
   impact HPC application performance.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout pregnancy, women experience physical, physiological, and
   hormonal alterations that are often accompanied by decreased postural
   control. According to one study, nearly 27\% of pregnant women fell
   while pregnant. This study had two objectives: (1) to characterize the
   postural responses of pregnant fallers, nonfallers, and controls to
   surface perturbations, and (2) to develop a mathematical model to gain
   insights into the postural control strategies of each group. This
   retrospective analysis used experimental data obtained from 15 women
   with a fall history during pregnancy, 14 women without a fall history
   during pregnancy, and 40 nonpregnant controls. Small, medium, and large
   translational support surface perturbations in the anterior and
   posterior directions were performed during the pregnant participants'
   second and third trimesters. A two-segmented mathematical model of
   bipedal stance was developed and parameterized, and optimization tools
   were used to identify ankle and hip stiffness, viscosity, and the
   feedback time delay by searching for the best fits to experimental COP
   data. The peak differences between the center of pressure and center of
   gravity (COP-COG) values were significantly smaller for the pregnant
   fallers compared with the pregnant nonfallers and controls (p < 0.01).
   Perturbation magnitude was a significant factor (p < 0.01), but
   perturbation direction was not (p = 0.24). Model fits were obtained with
   a mean goodness of fit value of R-2 = 0.92. Theoretical results
   indicated that pregnant nonfallers had higher ankle stiffness compared
   with the pregnant fallers and the controls, which suggests that ankle
   stiffness itself may be the dominant reason for the different dynamic
   response characteristics (e.g., peak COP-COG) observed. We conclude that
   increasing ankle stiffness could be an important strategy to prevent
   falling by pregnant women. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two mitigation methods for torsional resonance are tested on a 750 kw
   wind turbine using the NREL software FAST in the MATLAB/Simulink
   environment. One mitigation method is an active vibration absorber and
   the other method uses rotor angular acceleration measurements to provide
   virtual inertia for resonance detuning. The wind turbine representation
   uses a five mass gearbox model, a PMSG model, and aerodynamic simulation
   of the tower shadow effect. The two mitigation methods are tested by
   subjecting them to a frequency scan of wind to demonstrate the resonant
   condition and its mitigation using the methods. The vibration absorber
   shows better performance with shaft oscillation reduction than that of
   the virtual inertia.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Abstract = {{In an aircraft electric power system, one or more supervisory control
   units actuate a set of electromechanical switches to dynamically
   distribute power from generators to loads, while satisfying safety,
   reliability, and real-time performance requirements. To reduce expensive
   redesign steps, this control problem is generally addressed by minor
   incremental changes on top of consolidated solutions. A more systematic
   approach is hindered by a lack of rigorous design methodologies that
   allow estimating the impact of earlier design decisions on the final
   implementation. To achieve an optimal implementation that satisfies a
   set of requirements, we propose a platform-based methodology for
   electric power system design, which enables independent implementation
   of system topology (i.e., interconnection among elements) and control
   protocol by using a compositional approach. In our flow, design space
   exploration is carried out as a sequence of refinement steps from the
   initial specification toward a final implementation by mapping higher
   level behavioral and performance models into a set of either existing or
   virtual library components at the lower level of abstraction.
   Specifications are first expressed using the formalisms of linear
   temporal logic, signal temporal logic, and arithmetic constraints on
   Boolean variables. To reason about different requirements, we use
   specialized analysis and synthesis frameworks and formulate assume
   guarantee contracts at the articulation points in the design flow. We
   show the effectiveness of our approach on a proof-of-concept electric
   power system design.}},

   manipulation of passband signals from COTS devices, 2) fast FPGA-based

Abstract = {{A minimum-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem is considered. By
   employing a time scaling transformation and cost regularization, it is
   shown that this problem becomes amenable to the application of
   parametric Integrated Perturbation Analysis Sequential Quadratic
   Programming (IPA-SQP). The IPA-SQP framework exploits neighboring
   extremal optimal control and sequential quadratic programming based
   updates to efficiently and rapidly compute approximations to solutions
   in receding horizon optimal control. An interesting feature of the
   minimum-time MPC problem is that, after reformulation, the optimization
   needs to be performed simultaneously with respect to the control
   sequence and a constant parameter (terminal time) over the prediction
   horizon. Two examples are considered. The first example is for a double
   integrator with a control constraint. The second example is based on a
   twodimensional model of a hypersonic vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the synthesis of supervisors for partially-observed
   discrete-event systems from a new angle, based on the construction of a
   new structure called the All Inclusive Controller (or AIC). We consider
   control problems for safety specifications, where the legal language is
   a prefix-closed sublanguage of the system language. We define the AIC as
   a bipartite transition system that embeds all safe supervisors and thus
   all controllable and observable sublanguages of the legal language. The
   structure of the AIC is that of a bipartite graph, reminiscent of a game
   between the supervisor and the system, with (i) control states, where
   all safe control decisions are enumerated, and (ii) system states, where
   all feasible observable system events are executed. The states of the
   AIC are information states, i.e., subsets of system states. We present
   an algorithm for the construction of the AIC. This algorithm exploits
   the pre-computation of the so-called extended specification, which makes
   the safety of a control state a function of the current information
   state alone, thereby allowing for on-the-fly construction of the AIC, if
   so desired. We discuss the properties of the AIC. We also describe how
   the AIC can be used for synthesis of supervisors that possess a desired
   maximality property.}},

Abstract = {{The results from a user study on teleoperated steering tasks are used to
   create a driver model under different latency conditions. The 31-subject
   user study explored the effects of latency on teleoperated steering
   tasks using a simulated mobile robot receiving input commands from a
   teleoperator via a computer gamepad. Using fundamental concepts from
   automotive steering models, and examining the users' input commands to
   the simulated robot under different latency conditions, a model of a
   human teleoperator for steering tasks was developed, tuned and
   validated. The model is a PD controller with feedback based on the
   projected lateral displacement of the robot. The tuning of the model
   gains for different latency scenarios reflects the real-world control
   strategies that users must employ when adapting to system latency.
   Simulation results show that the control gains can be interpolated to
   predict teleoperator performance under latency scenarios that were not
   tested with users. An analysis of the closed-loop stability of the
   system confirms our empirical observation that the ratio of the
   controller gains K-d/K-p increases as the latency increases.}},

   are similar to passive systems but their dynamic constraints are more
   relaxed, in the sense that they only need to conserve energy in the
   stationary average sense, rather than at every time instant. In this
   paper, we examine the design of optimal LQG controllers for passive
   networks controlled with regenerative actuation. We show that this
   problem may be posed as a multi-objective LMI problem. We also
   characterize how close a regeneratively-constrained optimal LQG feedback
   law is to a passive transfer function. The concepts are demonstrated on
   a simple example related to vibration suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Direct load control can be achieved by varying the hysteresis band of
   switchable loads, thereby changing their on/off durations. Such
   hysteresis-based control methods may, however, display complex dynamics
   that must be thoroughly understood in order to design safe control
   mechanisms. This paper explores the dynamical behavior of a group of
   hysteresis-based PEV chargers. Of interest is the change in the total
   power demand of the group as the hysteresis band limits are varied. A
   detailed state-space model is used to capture the dynamics of the load
   aggregation. This model suggests that for certain control inputs, e.g.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a theory for optimizing the power generated from
   stationary stochastic vibratory disturbances, using a resonant energy
   harvester. Although the theory is general, the target application of the
   paper concerns ocean wave energy harvesting. The control technique
   involves the use of a causal discrete-time feedback algorithm to
   dynamically optimize the power extracted from the waves. The theory
   assumes that the input impedance of the converter is known precisely,
   but that a priori models are unavailable for the characterization of the
   stochastic behavior of the waves, as well as their hydrodynamic
   excitation of the system. For these assumptions, we develop an adaptive
   control technique, which iteratively re-optimizes the feedback law for
   the controller based on recursive subspace identification of the
   stochastic disturbance dynamics. The technique is demonstrated on a
   simulation example pertaining to a cylindrical surface-floating wave
   energy converter in heave.}},

Abstract = {{Fused magnesium furnaces (FMF) are widely used in China to extract fused
   magnesia through a smelting process that has to be well controlled to
   assure high product output and low power consumption. With manual
   control, which is still widely used in practice, it is difficult to
   adjust the setpoints for control loop involved, thereby leading to
   compromised product output and increased power consumption. In this
   paper, an operational feedback control method is proposed to control the
   technical indices within their desired range. This is realized by
   on-line adjusting the setpoints of control loops for optimal operation
   of the FMF in response to changes in operating points. The techniques
   used consist of case based-reasoning (CBR), rule based-reasoning (RBR),
   neural network (NN), iterative learning control (ILC), in addition to
   classic PI and PID control. The proposed method and the developed
   control system have been applied to a real FMF. Industrial applications
   show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed operational
   feedback control method and its promises in other industrial processes
   with similar features.}},

Abstract = {{Graduate level courses commonly include a class project. Typically,
   these projects involve a report that is corrected by the instructor and
   may include an oral presentation in the classroom. Recent research
   studies on education and learning indicate that students learn better
   when their class projects are reviewed by a broader audience rather than
   merely the instructor of the course. A web-based platform that allows
   instructors and students to host student class projects online was
   developed and is presented. The platform was used in the Winter 2013
   semester to support a web-based class project as part of a graduate
   level course on Geoenvironmental Engineering at the University of
   Michigan. Students selected a topic on geoenvironmental remediation and
   submitted their report online using the web-based platform. The student
   reports were made available to professionals for review. Practitioners
   as well as experts on geoenvironmental remediation were notified about
   this initiative and were invited to submit online questions, and
   comments or request clarifications from the students. Students were
   required to respond to the technical review comments and make the
   necessary improvements and clarifications to their final report. On the
   basis of the comments by visitors and the instructor, students finalized
   their report and prepared a video that was also made available online.
   The student reports remain online as technical reference to
   geoenvironmental engineering professionals. Professionals welcomed the
   opportunity to become involved in student learning; each class project
   was visited by 400-1000 practitioners within the two-week review period.
   The impact of this student-learning experiment was also assessed.
   Students' self-assessment survey results indicated that students were
   more motivated to submit a quality project, were excited to receive
   feedback from practitioners and felt that their work made a greater
   impact to the Profession compared to submitting a ``conventional{''}
   class project report to the instructor only.}},

Title = {{The Two-Dimensional Elasticity Solution for the Buckling of a Thick
   Orthotropic Ring Under External Pressure Loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the 2D elasticity solution for the buckling
   of a thick orthotropic ring under external hydrostatic pressure loading.
   The bifurcation buckling problem is first formulated using two methods,
   distinguished by the manner in which the external work done by the
   pressure loading during the buckling transition is treated. In doing so,
   the correct buckling equations and associated traction boundary
   conditions are derived. The resulting sets of equations and associated
   boundary conditions are then cast in a weak form, amenable to a
   numerical solution using the finite element method. The necessity of
   using the correct pairs of energetically conjugate stress and strain
   measures for the buckling problem is pointed out. Errors in using the
   incorrect traction boundary condition and terms that influence the
   buckling load and that have been omitted in popular commercial codes are
   pointed out and their significance in influencing the buckling load is
   identified. Results from the present two-dimensional analysis to predict
   the critical pressure are compared with previous theoretical results.
   The formulation and results presented here can be used as the correct
   benchmark solution to establish the accuracy in computing the buckling
   load of thick orthotropic composite structures, of contemporary
   interest, due to the increased use of thick-walled composite shell type
   structures in diverse engineering applications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{255-268}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thin-film fracture can be used as a nano-fabrication technique, but
   generally, it is a stochastic process that results in nonuniform
   patterns. Crack spacings depend on the interaction between intrinsic
   flaw populations and the fracture mechanics of crack channeling.
   Geometrical features can be used to trigger cracks at specific locations
   to generate controlled crack patterns. However, while this basic idea is
   intuitive, it is not so obvious how to realize the concept in practice,
   nor what the limitations are. The control of crack arrays depends on the
   nature of the intrinsic flaw population. If there is a relatively large
   density of long flaws, as commonly assumed in fracture mechanics
   analyses, reliable crack patterns can be obtained fairly robustly using
   relatively blunt geometrical features to initiate cracks, provided the
   applied strain is carefully matched to the properties of the system and
   the desired crack spacing. This process is analyzed both for cracks
   confined to the thickness of a film and for cracks growing into a
   substrate. The latter analysis is complicated by the fact that increases
   in strain can either drive cracks deeper into the substrate or generate
   new cracks at shallower depths. If the intrinsic flaws are all very
   short, the geometrical features need to be very sharp to achieve the
   desired patterns. While careful control of the applied strain is not
   required, the strain needs to be relatively large compared to that which
   would be required to propagate a large flaw across the film. This
   results in an approach that is not robust against the introduction of
   accidental damage or a few large flaws.}},

Abstract = {{In location-based social Q\&A, the questions related to a local
   community (e.g. local services and places) are typically answered by
   local residents (i.e. who have the local knowledge). In this work, we
   wanted to deepen our understanding of the localness of knowledge sharing
   through investigating the topical and typological patterns related to
   the geographic characteristics, geographic locality of user activities,
   and motivations of local knowledge sharing. To this end, we analyzed a
   12-month period Q\&A dataset from Naver KiN ``Here{''} and a
   supplementary survey dataset from 285 mobile users. Our results revealed
   several unique characteristics of location-based social Q\&A. When
   compared with conventional social Q\&A sites, Naver KiN ``Here{''} had
   very different topical/typological patterns. Naver KiN ``Here{''}
   exhibited a strong spatial locality where the answerers mostly had 13
   spatial clusters of contributions, the topical distributions varied
   widely across different districts, and a typical cluster spanned a few
   neighboring districts. In addition, we uncovered unique motivators, e.g.
   ownership of local knowledge and sense of local community. The findings
   reported in the paper have significant implications for the design of
   Q\&A systems, especially location-based social Q\&A systems.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time safety aware navigation of an intelligent vehicle is one of
   the major challenges in intelligent vehicle systems. Many studies have
   been focused on the obstacle avoidance to prevent an intelligent vehicle
   from approaching obstacles ``too close{''} or ``too far{''}, but
   difficult to obtain an optimal trajectory. In this paper, a novel
   biologically inspired neural network methodology with safety
   consideration to real-time collision-free navigation of an intelligent
   vehicle with safety consideration in a non-stationary environment is
   proposed. The real-time vehicle trajectory is planned through the
   varying neural activity landscape, which represents the dynamic
   environment, in conjunction of a safety aware navigation algorithm. The
   proposed model for intelligent vehicle trajectory planning with safety
   consideration is capable of planning a real-time ``comfortable{''}
   trajectory by overcoming the either ``too close{''} or ``too far{''}
   shortcoming. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology that performs
   safer collision-free navigation of an intelligent vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Speed profile prediction on ramps is a challenging problem because speed
   changes on ramps involve complicated lane maneuvering and frequent
   acceleration or deceleration depending on geometry of the ramp and
   traffic volumes. Ramps can be categorized into three groups based on
   their interconnection of freeway: freeway entering ramps, freeway exit
   ramps, and inter freeway ramps. However, different geographical shapes
   of ramps within the same category cause different speed profile
   distributions. To predict speed profile on any ramp types, we proposed
   an Intelligent Trip Modeling on Ramp (ITMR) System that consists of a
   ramp classification method based on the decision tree and speed profile
   prediction neural networks. The proposed ITMR takes inputs from
   geographical data on the route and also the personal driving pattern
   extracted from the knowledge base built with the individual historical
   driving data. Experimental results show that the proposed system learned
   dynamic ramp speed changes very well to provide accurate prediction
   results on multiple freeway entering ramps, exit ramps and inter freeway
   ramps.}},

   compressibility and stiffness of the wheel are measured. The stiffness
   of the wheel is nonlinear depending on the wheel surface speed and
   compression depth. Polishing tests at two levels of wheel surface speed
   and compression depth are conducted. Surface roughness and polishing
   forces are studied. Results demonstrated that polishing of Ti-6A1-4V is
   difficult, which has twice larger surface roughness than that of
   Co-Cr-Mo. The nonwoven wheel operating at lower surface speed and
   smaller compression depth is beneficial to generate a better surface
   roughness for Ti-6A1-4V and Co-Cr-Mo.}},

Abstract = {{Several hybrid-electric vehicle architectures have been commercialized
   to serve different categories of vehicles and driving conditions. Such
   architectures can be optimally controlled by switching among driving
   modes, namely, the power distribution schemes in their planetary gear
   (PG) transmissions, in order to operate the vehicle in the most
   efficient regions of engine and motor maps. This paper proposes a
   systematic way to identify the optimal architecture for a given vehicle
   drive cycle, rather than parametrically optimizing one or more
   pre-selected architectures. An automatic generator of feasible driving
   modes for a given number of PGs is developed. For a powertrain
   consisting of one engine, two motors and two PGs, this generator results
   in 1116 modes. A heuristic search is then proposed to find a
   near-optimal pair of modes for a given driving cycle and vehicle
   specification. In a study this process identifies a dual-mode
   architecture with an 8\% improvement in fuel economy compared to a
   commercially available architecture over a standard drive cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and unit-cost optimization of a water-heated
   humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system were presented
   in previous work of the authors. The system controlled the saline water
   flow rate to prevent salts from precipitating at higher water
   temperatures. It was then realized that this scheme had a negative
   impact on condensation performance when the controlled flow rate was not
   sufficiently high. This work builds on the previous system by
   disconnecting the condenser from the saline water cycle and by
   introducing a solar air heater to further augment the humidification
   performance. In addition, improved models for the condenser and the
   humidifier were used to obtain more accurate productivity estimations.
   The Heuristic Gradient Projection (HGP) optimization procedure was also
   refactored to result in reduced number of function evaluations to reach
   the global optimum compared to Genetic Algorithms (GA's). A case study
   which assumes a desalination plant on the Red Sea near the city of
   Hurghada is presented. The unit-cost of produced fresh water for the new
   optimum system is \$0.5/m3 compared to \$5.9/m(3) for the HDH system
   from previous work and less than the reported minimum cost of reverse

Abstract = {{Optimum selection of cutting conditions in high-speed and
   ultra-precision machining processes often poses a challenging task due
   to several reasons; such as the need for costly experimental setup and
   the limitation on the number of experiments that can be performed before
   tool degradation starts becoming a source of noise in the readings.
   Moreover, oftentimes there are several objectives to consider, some of
   which may be conflicting, while others may be somewhat correlated.
   Pareto-optimality analysis is needed for conflicting objectives; however
   the existence of several objectives (high dimension Pareto space) makes
   the generation and interpretation of Pareto solutions difficult. The
   approach adopted in this paper is a modified multi-objective efficient
   global optimization (m-EGO). In m-EGO, sample data points from
   experiments are used to construct Kriging meta-models, which act as
   predictors for the performance objectives. Evolutionary multi-objective
   optimization is then conducted to spread a population of new candidate
   experiments towards the zones of search space that are predicted by the
   Kriging models to have favorable performance, as well as zones that are
   under explored. New experiments are then used to update the Kriging
   models, and the process is repeated until termination criteria are met.
   Handling a large number of objectives is improved via a special
   selection operator based on principle component analysis (PCA) within
   the evolutionary optimization. PCA is used to automatically detect
   correlations among objectives and perform the selection within a reduced
   space in order to achieve a better distribution of experimental sample
   points on the Pareto frontier. Case studies show favorable results in
   ultra precision diamond turning of Aluminum alloy as well as highspeed
   drilling of woven composites.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by continued interest within the design community to model
   design preferences, this paper investigates the question of predicting
   preferences with particular application to consumer purchase behavior:
   How can we obtain high prediction accuracy in a consumer preference
   model using market purchase data? To this end, we employ sparse coding
   and sparse restricted Boltzmann machines, recent methods from machine
   learning, to transform the original market data into a sparse and
   high-dimensional representation. We show that these `feature learning'
   techniques, which are independent from the preference model itself
   (e.g., logit model), can complement existing efforts towards
   high-accuracy preference prediction. Using actual passenger car market
   data, we achieve significant improvement in prediction accuracy on a
   binary preference task by properly transforming the original consumer
   variables and passenger car variables to a sparse and high-dimensional
   representation.}},

Abstract = {{Level-set methods are domain classification techniques that are gaining
   popularity in the recent years for structural topology optimization.
   Level sets classify a domain into two or more categories (such as
   material and void) by examining the value of a scalar level-set function
   (LSF) defined in the entire design domain. In most level-set
   formulations, a large number of design variables, or degrees of freedom
   is used to define the LSF, which implicitly defines the structure. The
   large number of design variables makes non-gradient optimization
   techniques all but ineffective. Kriging-interpolated level sets (KLS) on
   the other hand are formulated with an objective to enable non gradient
   optimization by defining the design variables as the LSF values at few
   select locations (knot points) and using a Kriging model to interpolate
   the LSF in the rest of the design domain. A downside of concern when
   adopting KLS, is that using too few knot points may limit the capability
   to represent complex shapes, while using too many knot points may cause
   difficulty for non-gradient optimization. This paper presents a study of
   the effect of number and layout of the knot points in KLS on the
   capability to represent complex topologies in single and multi-component
   structures. Image matching error metrics are employed to assess the
   degree of mismatch between target topologies and those best-attainable
   via KLS. Results are presented in a catalogue-style in order to
   facilitate appropriate selection of knot-points by designers wishing to
   apply KLS for topology optimization.}},

Abstract = {{A major barrier in consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is
   `range anxiety,' the concern that the vehicle will run out of power at
   an inopportune time. Range anxiety is caused by the current relatively
   low electric-only operational range and sparse public charging station
   infrastructure. Range anxiety may be significantly mitigated if EV
   manufacturers and charging station operators work in partnership using a
   cooperative business model to balance EV performance and charging
   station coverage. This model is in contrast to a sequential decision
   making model where manufacturers bring new EVs to the market first and
   charging station operators decide on charging station deployment given
   EV specifications and market demand. This paper proposes an integrated
   decision making framework to assess profitability of a cooperative
   business models based on a multi-disciplinary optimization model that
   combines marketing, engineering, and operations. This model is
   demonstrated in a case study involving battery electric vehicle design
   and direct-current fast charging station location network in the State
   of Michigan. The expected benefits can motive both government and
   private enterprise actions.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse osmosis (RO) is one of the main commercial technologies for
   desalination of water with salinity content too high for human
   consumption in order to produce fresh water. RO may hold promise for
   remote areas with scarce fresh water resources, however, RO energy
   requirements being in the form of electric power have few options in
   such areas. Fortunately, scarce rainfall is often associated with
   abundant sunshine, which makes solar photovoltaic (PV) power an
   attractive option. Equipping a photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis
   (PVRO) desalination plant with baftery storage has an advantage of
   steadier and longer hours of operation, thereby making better use of the
   investments in RO system components, but the additional cost from
   including batteries may end up increasing the overall cost of fresh
   water. It is therefore of paramount importance to consider the overall
   cost-effectiveness of the PVRO system when designing the desalination
   plant. Recent work by the authors has generalized the steady operation
   model of RO systems to hourly adjusted, power-dispatch via a
   proportional-derivative (PD) controller that depends on the state of
   charge (SOC) of the battery, yet the operating conditions; namely
   pressure and flow for a given power dispatch were only empirically
   selected. This paper considers a multi-level optimization model for
   PV-RO systems with battery storage by considering a{''}sub-loop{''}
   optimization of the feed pressure and flow given power dispatch for a
   fixed RO system configuration, as well as a ``top-level{''} optimization
   where the system configuration itself is adjusted by the design
   variables. Effect of the sub-loop optimization is assessed by comparing
   the obtained cost of fresh water with the previous empirically adjusted
   system for locations and weather conditions near the city of Hurgada on
   the Red Sea.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores opportunities for reductions in lifecycle greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions through adoption of electric drive vehicles (EDV),
   including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. EDVs
   have generally lower GHG emission rates during operation than
   similar-class conventional vehicles (CV). However, a key observation is
   that GHG reductions per mile are much larger during city driving
   conditions than on the highway. An examination of the estimated GHG
   emissions is conducted for city and highway driving conditions for
   several CV and EDV models based on testing results from the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), then compared with key findings
   from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NI-ITS 2009). Through an
   empirical analysis of actual driving patterns in the U.S., this study
   highlights potential missed opportunities to reduce transportation GHG
   emissions through the allocation of incentives and/or regulations. Key
   findings include the significant potential to reduce GHG emissions of
   taxis and delivery vehicles, as well as driving pattern-based incentives

   presents an adaptive questionnaire generation strategy that uses active

   identify efficiently designs with high probability to be optimal. The
   strategy is based on viewing optimal design as a group identification
   problem. A running example demonstrates that a good estimation of
   consumer preference is not always necessary for finding the optimal

   for the specific purpose of design optimization. Extending the proposed
   method beyond a homogeneous preference model and noiseless user

Abstract = {{A hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain architecture consists of single or
   multiple driving modes, i.e., connection arrangements among engine,

   While most architecture development work to date has focused primarily
   on passenger cars, interest has been growing in exploring architectures
   for special-purpose vehicles such as vans or trucks for civilian and
   military applications, whose weights or payloads can vary significantly
   during operations. Previous findings show that the optimal architecture
   can be sensitive to vehicle weight. In this paper we investigate
   architecture design under a distribution of vehicle weights, using a
   simulation-based design optimization strategy with nested supervisory
   optimal control and accounting for powertrain complexity. Results show
   that an architecture under a single load has significant differences and
   lower fuel efficiency than an architecture designed to work under a
   variety of loading scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{With continued demands on high-quality and low-cost products, designers
   are increasingly required to explore the use of new materials and
   manufacturing processes. The design for manufacturability rules for
   unconventional materials and processes will be of great value to improve
   component manufacturability. Instead of going through years of
   trial-and-error practice to gain some ``rule of thumb{''} design
   guidelines, this paper proposed a knowledge-based computational method
   for manufacturability constraint modeling (MCM) through process
   simulation, design of experiment, and data mining. With the input of
   geometric attributes for local critical features of a component, the
   pre-trained manufacturability constraint model will output the
   manufacturability prediction and the confidence of the prediction. The
   2D visualization of the manufacturability prediction facilitates the
   interpretation by the human designers, and provides her with concurrent
   and intuitive manufacturability feedback and directed re-design
   suggestions. The preliminary result on mild steel stamping process
   demonstrated the feasibility of the method.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design, analysis, and validation of a tunable-volume
   handheld pipette that enables precise drawing and dispensing of ml and
   mu l liquid volumes. The design builds upon the standard mechanism of a
   handheld micropipette by incorporating an elastic diaphragm that
   de-amplifies the volume displacement of the internal piston via
   compression of an entrapped air volume. The degree of de-amplification
   is determined by the stiffness of the elastic diaphragm and the amount
   of entrapped air. An analytical model of the diaphragm mechanism is
   derived, which guides how to achieve linear de amplification over an
   extended range where leading-order nonlinear contributions are
   significant. In particular, nonlinearities inherent in the mechanical
   behavior of the diaphragm and entrapped air volume may exactly cancel
   one another by careful design of the pipette's parameter constants. This
   linearity is a key attribute for enabling the pipette's tunable
   volumetric range, as this allows diaphragms with different stiffnesses
   to be selectively used with a conventional linear stepping piston
   mechanism. Design considerations regarding the range, accuracy, and
   precision of the proposed pipette are detailed based on the model.
   Additionally, we have constructed a handheld prototype that uses a
   planar latex sheet as the diaphragm. Our pipetting experiments validate
   the derived model and exhibit linearity between the piston stroke and
   drawn liquid volume. We propose that this design enables a single
   handheld mechanical pipette to achieve drawing and dispensing of liquids
   over a 1 mu l-10ml range (i.e., the range of the entire micropipette
   suite), with volumetric resolution and precision comparable to
   commercially available counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of a
   magnetically coupled piezoelectric energy harvesters under low frequency
   excitation, where the angle of external magnetic field is adjustable.
   The nonlinear dynamic equation with the identified nonlinear magnetic
   force is derived to describe the electromechanical interaction of
   variable inclination angle harvesters. The effect of excitation
   amplitude and frequency on dynamic behavior is proposed by using the
   phase trajectory and bifurcation diagram. The numerical analysis shows
   that a rotatable magnetically coupling energy harvesting system exhibits
   rich nonlinear characteristics with the change of external magnet
   inclination angle. The nonlinear route to and from large amplitude high
   energy motion can be clearly observed. It is demonstrated numerically
   and experimentally that lumped parameters equations with an identified
   polynomials for magnetic force could adequately describe the
   characteristics of nonlinear energy harvester. The rotating magnetically
   coupled energy harvester possesses the usable frequency bandwidth over a
   wide range of low frequency excitation by adjusting the angular

   fluid induced passive damping has not been well investigated in

Abstract = {{The accurate and reliable identification of damage in modern engineered
   structures is essential for timely corrective measures. Vibration-based
   damage prediction has been studied extensively by virtue of its global
   damage detection ability and simplicity in practical implementation.
   However, due to noise and damping effects, the accuracy of this method
   is inhibited when direct peak detection (DPD) is utilized to determine
   resonant frequency shifts. This research investigates an alternative
   method to detect frequency shifts caused by structural damage based on
   the utilization of strongly nonlinear bifurcation phenomena in bistable
   electrical circuits coupled with piezoelectric transducers integrated
   with the structure. It is shown that frequency shift predictions by the
   proposed approach are significantly less susceptible to error than DPD
   when realistic noise and damping levels distort the shifting resonance
   peaks. As implemented alongside adaptive piezoelectric circuitry with
   tunable inductance, the new method yields damage location and severity
   identification that is significantly more robust and accurate than
   results obtained following the DPD approach.}},

Abstract = {{Hearing relies on a series of coupled electrical, acoustical (fluidic)
   and mechanical interactions inside the cochlea that enable sound
   processing. The stability of the cochlea is studied using a nonlinear,
   micromechanical model of the organ of Corti (OoC) coupled to the
   electrical potentials in the cochlear ducts. The OoC is part of the
   mammalian cochlea that contains auditory sensory cells that both
   identify fluid-born vibrations in the cochlea and amplify the
   cycle-by-cycle motions of the cochlear structures. This process occurs
   through local resonance of the OoC system. In the mammalian cochlea, an
   active process accounts for the ear's exquisite sensitivity and its
   remarkable responsiveness for a range of frequencies and intensities.
   Numerical and analytical techniques are utilized to examine the
   stability of this system. It is observed that the cochlear active
   process, controls the stability. We show that instability in this model
   is generated through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, a
   reduced order model of the system is approximated and it is shown that
   the tectorial membrane (TM) transverse mode effect on the dynamics is
   significant while the radial mode can be simplified from the equations.
   We compare the cross sectional model with the comprehensive
   3-dimensional model of the cochlea. It is indicated that the global
   model qualitatively inherits some characteristics of the local model,
   but the longitudinal coupling along the cochlea enhances stability
   (i.e., shifts the Hopf bifurcation point).}},

   to appropriately vary material flow into the die during the stamping
   cycle, based on feedback on part quality. The actuation mechanisms in
   turn employ closed-loop control to achieve the desired material flow.
   Thus, process control forms an outer loop while control of the actuators
   form an inner loop. The inner-loop control is referred to as machine
   control and in this chapter, the non-linear dynamics of hydraulic
   actuators for variable binder-force control are analyzed and machine
   control approaches for these actuators are described. Real-time digital

Abstract = {{In sheet metal forming processes the blank holder force controls the
   material flow into the die cavity, which is critical to producing a good

   include process modeling as well as process controller and reference

   the design and implementation of a suitable process controller and an
   optimal reference punch force trajectory is presented. The approach
   includes the modeling for controller design of the sheet metal forming
   process, design of the process controller, and determination of the
   optimal punch force trajectory. Experimental results from U-channel
   forming on a laboratory forming simulator show that a suitable process
   controller can be designed through simulation and an optimal reference

Abstract = {{The binder force in sheet metal forming controls the material flow into

   crucial for producing a high-quality stamped part. Process control can

   appropriate process model structure for the purpose of controller design
   for the sheet metal forming process is presented and parameter
   estimation for this model is accomplished using system identification
   methods. This paper is based upon original experiments performed with a
   new variable blank holder force (or variable binder force) system that
   includes 12 hydraulic actuators to control the binder force.
   Experimental results from a complex-geometry part show that the MIMO

Abstract = {{This chapter compares the design, implementation and performance of
   direct and indirect adaptive control (AC) to improve part quality in the
   stamping process in the presence of disturbances. First, previous work
   on the design and performance of a direct AC approach (i.e., model
   reference adaptive control or MRAC) is summarized. The direct AC filter
   uses nominal process parameters, and so requires some knowledge of the
   process. Consequently, an indirect AC approach, which estimates process
   parameters on-line, was also considered. However, due to the simple
   proportional plus integral (PI) control structure selected, the
   computation of the controller gains from the estimated parameters
   requires an optimization procedure, which is not amenable to real-time
   implementation. Thus, the indirect AC is implemented using a look-up
   table, with controller gains that are pre-computed off-line via
   optimization. The indirect AC with the look-up table is compared to the
   direct AC via simulations and experiments in terms of tracking
   performance as well as part quality, in the presence of plant
   variations. The indirect AC, with a sufficiently high level of
   discretization in the look-up table, performs well in simulations.
   However, due to extensive memory requirements, a smaller look-up table
   is used in the experiments, where it is outperformed by the direct AC.}},

Abstract = {{This book has introduced process control for sheet metal stamping,
   including theory and experiments. Real-time, in-process adjustment of
   blank holder forces enables one to achieve the desired flow of the blank
   material into the die without tearing and wrinkling even in the presence
   of process disturbances, such as changes in lubrication and/or material
   properties (e.g., material formability, sheet thickness). Such a process
   control system for stamping can be achieved using a reconfigurable array
   of hydraulic actuators to provide variable binder force capability
   together with punch force sensors to provide in-process feedback.
   Multi-input multi-output process controllers (fixed gain or adaptive)
   can be used to ensure consistent operation, even in hard to form
   materials, despite process disturbances. Such a system can be
   retrofitted for use with existing mechanical presses and can also be
   implemented in modern hydraulic presses. Benefits include elimination of
   tearing, wrinkling and springback with reduced die try-out times, as
   well as consistent part quality in production even in the presence of
   disturbances. The potential economic benefits of such systems can be
   enormous. The controller designs presented herein have been shown to be
   effective in experimental tests on production automotive stamped parts.
   However, in this chapter we also discuss some potential limitations and
   future areas of research and development that will further enhance this
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{We report ab initio calculations at the LDA+U level to examine the

   propensity to reconstruct depends on the orientation of terminations.
   The stability of the reconstructed termination relates to the nominal
   charge of a given surface. O atoms on surfaces interact repulsively with
   each other. We discuss the thermodynamic stabilities of all terminations
   using the Grand potential. A stability diagram demonstrates that the
   ground termination is LaO-(001) p(1 x 1) surface in most cases, while it
   transforms to the LaO3-(111) p(1 x 1) surface in O-rich/La-poor
   condition. The results provide potential candidates for future studies

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For the first time, carbon nanotube (CNT) forests are fully
   characterized as transversely isotropic continuum material. Each of the
   five independent elastic constants is experimentally obtained using a
   combination of nanoindenter-based uniaxial compression and shear
   testing, in situ SEM compression, and digital image correlation (DIC) of
   vertically and laterally oriented CNT microstructure columns. Material
   properties are highly anisotropic, with an axial modulus (165-275 MPa)
   that is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the transverse
   modulus (2.5-2.7 MPa) and the out of plane shear modulus (0.8-1.6 MPa).
   The Poisson's ratios along three mutually orthogonal axes, measured
   directly by simultaneous in situ DIC evaluation of axial and transverse
   strain, are found to be similarly anisotropic (nu(12) = 0.35, nu(23) =
   0.1, nu(21) = 0.005). A Timoshenko beam model is then developed to
   accurately predict the critical buckling stress of the vertically
   oriented columns using a subset of these anisotropic properties and
   considering inelastic column buckling. These results show that the
   critical bucking stress of CNT microstructures vary predictably with
   geometry and that continuum models with appropriate material constants
   may be applied to analyze CNT microstructures and evaluate their
   stability for many applications. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the release of dioxins and PCBs during kiln-firing of ball

Abstract = {{Ball clay is known to be naturally contaminated with high levels of
   polychlorinated di-benzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs). This study evaluated the
   potential for PCDD, polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) and
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) release during the kiln firing of ball
   clay in an art studio. Toxic equivalence (TEQ) were calculated using
   World Health Organization (WHO) 2005 toxic equivalence factors (TEF) and
   congener concentrations. Ten bags of commercial ball clay were found to
   have an average TEQ of 1370 nanograms/kilogram (ng kg(-1)) dry weight
   (dw), almost exclusively due to PCDDs (99.98\% of TEQ). After firing,
   none of the 29 dioxin-like analytes was measured above the limits of
   detection (LOD) in the clay samples. Air samples were taken during
   firings using both low-flow and high-flow air samplers. Few low-flow air
   samples contained measurable levels of dioxin congeners above the LOD.
   The mean TEQ in the high volume air samples ranged from 0.07 pg m(-3) to
   0.21 pg m(-3) when firing ball clay, and was 0.11 pg m(-3) when no clay
   was fired. These concentrations are within the range measured in typical
   residences and well-controlled industrial settings. The congener
   profiles in the high-flow air samples differed from the unfired clay;
   the air samples had a considerable contribution to the TEQ from PCDFs
   and PCBs. Given that the TEQs of all air samples were very low and the
   profiles differed from the unfired clay, it is likely that the PCDDs in
   dry ball clay were destroyed during kiln firing. These results suggest
   that inhalation of volatilized dioxins during kiln firing of dry ball
   clay is an unlikely source of exposure for vocational and art
   ceramicists. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{High-speed fuel, flow, and flame imaging are combined with spark
   discharge measurements to investigate the causes of rare misfires and
   partial burns in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection (SG-SIDI)
   engine over a range of nitrogen dilution levels (0-26\% by volume).
   Planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of biacetyl is combined with
   planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) to provide quantitative
   measurements of equivalence ratio and flow velocity within the tumble
   plane of an optical engine. Mie scattering images used for PIV are also
   used to identify the enflamed region to resolve the flame development.
   Engine parameters were selected to mimic low-load idle operating
   conditions with stratified fuel injection, which provided stable engine
   performance with the occurrence of rare misfire and partial burn cycles.
   Nitrogen dilution was introduced into the intake air, thereby displacing
   the oxygen, which destabilized combustion and increased the occurrence
   of poor burning cycles. Spark measurements revealed that all cycles
   exhibited sufficient spark energy and duration for successful ignition.
   High-speed PLIF, Ply, and Mie scattering images were utilized to analyze
   the spatial and temporal evolution of the fuel distribution and flow
   velocity on flame kernel development to better understand the nature of
   poor burning cycles at each dilution level. The images revealed that all
   cycles exhibited a flammable mixture near the spark plug at spark timing
   and a flame kernel was present for all cycles, but the flame failed to
   develop for misfire and partial burn cycles. Improper flame development
   was caused by slow flame propagation which prevented the flame from
   consuming the bulk of the fuel mixture within the piston bowl, which was
   a crucial step to achieve further combustion. The mechanisms identified
   in this work that caused slower flame development are: (1) lean
   mixtures, (2) external dilution, and (3) convection velocities that
   impede transport of the flame into the fuel mixture. (C) 2013 The

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Of interest here is the influence of loading rate on the stability of
   structures where inertia is taken into account, with particular
   attention to the comparison between static and dynamic buckling. This
   work shows the importance of studying stability via perturbations of the
   initial conditions, since a finite velocity governs the propagation of
   disturbances. The method of modal analysis that determines the fastest
   growing wavelength, currently used in the literature to analyze dynamic
   stability problems, is meaningful only for cases where the velocity of
   the perfect structure is significantly lower than the associated wave
   propagation speeds.
   As a model structure to illustrate this point we select an elastic ring
   subjected to external hydrostatic pressure which is applied at different
   rates epsilon (appropriately non-dimensionalized with respect to elastic
   axial wave speed). The ring's stability is studied by following the
   evolution of a localized small perturbation. It is shown that for small
   values of the applied loading rate, the structure fails through a global
   mode, while for large values of the applied loading rate the structure
   fails by a localized mode of deformation. An analytically obtained
   localization time t(1) is found to be a very good estimate of the onset
   of instability time at high loading rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A Kriging-Interpolated Level-Set Approach for Structural Topology
   Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Level-set approaches are a family of domain classification techniques
   that rely on defining a scalar level-set function (LSF), then carrying
   out the classification based on the value of the function relative to
   one or more thresholds. Most continuum topology optimization
   formulations are at heart, a classification problem of the design domain
   into structural materials and void. As such, level-set approaches are
   gaining acceptance and popularity in structural topology optimization.
   In conventional level set approaches, finding an optimum LSF involves
   solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi system of partial differential equations
   with a large number of degrees of freedom, which in turn, cannot be
   accomplished without gradients information of the objective being
   optimized. A new approach is proposed in this paper where design
   variables are defined as the values of the LSF at knot points, then a
   Kriging model is used sto interpolate the LSF values within the rest of
   the domain so that classification into material or void can be
   performed. Perceived advantages of the Kriging-interpolated level-set
   (KLS) approach include alleviating the need for gradients of objectives
   and constraints, while maintaining a reasonable number of design
   variables that is independent from the mesh size. A hybrid genetic
   algorithm (GA) is then used for solving the optimization problem(s). An
   example problem of a short cantilever is studied under various settings
   of the KLS parameters in order to infer the best practice
   recommendations for tuning the approach. Capabilities of the approach
   are then further demonstrated by exploring its performance on several
   test problems.}},

Title = {{Control of soft machines using actuators operated by a Braille display}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{189-199}},
Abstract = {{One strategy for actuating soft machines (e.g., tentacles, grippers, and
   simple walkers) uses pneumatic inflation of networks of small channels
   in an elastomeric material. Although the management of a few pneumatic
   inputs and valves to control pressurized gas is straightforward, the
   fabrication and operation of manifolds containing many (>50) independent
   valves is an unsolved problem. Complex pneumatic manifolds-often built
   for a single purpose-are not easily reconfigured to accommodate the
   specific inputs (i.e., multiplexing of many fluids, ranges of pressures,
   and changes in flow rates) required by pneumatic systems. This paper
   describes a pneumatic manifold comprising a computer-controlled Braille
   display and a micropneumatic device. The Braille display provides a
   compact array of 64 piezoelectric actuators that actively close and open
   elastomeric valves of a micropneumatic device to route pressurized gas
   within the manifold. The positioning and geometries of the valves and
   channels in the micropneumatic device dictate the functionality of the
   pneumatic manifold, and the use of multi-layer soft lithography permits
   the fabrication of networks in a wide range of configurations with many
   possible functions. Simply exchanging micropneumatic devices of
   different designs enables rapid reconfiguration of the pneumatic
   manifold. As a proof of principle, a pneumatic manifold controlled a
   soft machine containing 32 independent actuators to move a ball above a
   flat surface.}},

Title = {{High-speed imaging of transient diesel spray behavior during high
   pressure injection of a multi-hole fuel injector}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{299-309}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Reliable prediction of spray penetration and spray break-up is required
   to achieve increases in fuel efficiency and reduction of emissions in
   diesel engines. Of particular interest is the early transient-flow
   regime. In the current work, diesel fuel spray development was studied
   using high-speed imaging of a high-pressure diesel common-rail fuel
   injector mounted in a spherical constant volume combustion chamber. The
   fuel injector nozzle had four holes aligned on a radial plane with
   diameters of 90, 110, 130, and 150 mu m. Fuel was injected into a room
   temperature T = 298 K (+/- 1.5\%), nitrogen environment at chamber
   densities of 17.5, 24.2, and 32.7 kg/m(3) (+/- 3\%) and for fuel-rail
   pressures of 1000, 1500, and 2000 bar (+/- 1.5\%). High-speed images of
   the backlit fuel injection were captured at 100,000 frames per second.
   Image processing algorithms were used to determine fuel spray
   penetration distance and maximum penetration rate as a function of time.
   The early time history of the spray penetration was not sensitive to
   orifice size, orifice location or chamber density at the conditions
   studied. However, fuel injection pressure significantly affected the
   spray-tip penetration and time to spray break-up. The experimental
   results for maximum penetration rate and transition time were compared
   with various quasi-one-dimensional fuel-spray models. The experimental
   data indicated a power law relationship for the spray-tip penetration at
   early times in the spray development, which is consistent with recent
   recommendations. However, the experimental results for time to spray
   break up departed from the model predictions at most of the conditions
   studied, with the model significantly under-predicting the time for
   spray transition. Furthermore, the spray penetration data showed
   significant fluctuations in the spray geometry at early times. A fuel
   spray-tip tracking algorithm was developed and the results showed the
   maximum penetration distance did not occur along the spray center-line
   during the transient period of injection and the results quantified the
   angular location of the maximum penetration distance. These data provide
   valuable new insights into transient fuel spray behavior and will guide
   the development of the next generation of spray theory and models. (C)

Title = {{Model predictive control-based power dispatch for distribution system
   considering plug-in electric vehicle uncertainty}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{29-35}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As an important component of Smart Grid, advanced plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs) are drawing much more attention because of their high
   energy efficiency, low carbon and noise pollution, and low operational
   cost. Unlike other controllable loads, PEVs can be connected with the
   distribution system anytime and anywhere according to the customers'
   preference. The uncertain parameters (e.g., charging time, initial
   battery state-of-charge, start/end time) associated with PEV charging
   make it difficult to predict the charging load. Therefore, the inherent
   uncertainty and variability of the PEV charging load have complicated
   the operations of distribution systems. To address these challenges,
   this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based power
   dispatch approach. The proposed objective functions minimize the
   operational cost while accommodating the PEV charging uncertainty. Case
   studies are performed on a modified IEEE 37-bus test feeder. The
   numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy
   of the proposed MPC-based power dispatch scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a powertrain control strategy for a series hybrid
   electric vehicle (SHEV) based on the integrated design of an active
   charging scenario and fixed-boundary-layer sliding mode controllers
   (FBLSMCs). An optimized charging curve for the battery is predetermined
   rather than subject to engine output and vehicle power demand, which is
   a total inverse of normal SHEV powertrain control process. This is aimed
   to remove surge and high-frequency charge current, keep the battery
   staying in a high state-of-charge (SOC) region and avoid
   persistently-high charge power, which are positive factors to battery
   lifetime extension. Then two robust chattering-free FBLSMCs are designed
   to locate the engine operation in the optimal efficiency area. One is in
   charge of engine speed control, and the other is for engine/generator
   torque control. Consequently, not only fuel economy is improved but also
   battery life expectancy could be extended. Finally, simulation and
   experimental results confirm the validity and application feasibility of
   the proposed strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviors of lithium iron phosphate battery cells are
   investigated by conducting in-plane and out-of-plane compression tests
   of representative volume element (RVE) specimens of dry cells. The test
   results of cell RVE specimens under in-plane constrained compression
   indicate that the load carrying behavior of the cell RVE specimens is
   characterized by the buckling, the kink and shear band formation, and
   the final densification of the cell components. The SEM images of the
   active materials on electrodes and the test results of the cell RVE
   specimens under out-of-plane compression suggest that the porosity in
   the components and the macroscopic gaps between the components is up to
   40\%. The test results suggest that the lithium-ion battery cells can be
   modeled as anisotropic foams or cellular materials. The elastic buckling
   analyses for a beam with lateral constraints indicate that the higher
   order buckling modes and the critical buckling stresses in general agree
   with those observed in experiments. The elastic buckling analyses also
   justify the length selection of the cell RVE specimens. Finally, an
   idealized kinematic model is presented to explain the physical
   mechanisms of the kink and shear band formation in the cell RVE
   specimens under in-plane constrained compression. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence demonstrated that endothelial cells initiate signaling
   events that enhance tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and
   tumor recurrence. Under this new paradigm for cellular crosstalk within
   the tumor microenvironment, the origin of endothelial cells and tumor
   cells may have a direct impact on the pathobiology of cancer. The
   purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of endothelial
   cell species (i.e. murine or human) on xenograft tumor growth and
   response to therapy. Tumor xenografts vascularized either with human or
   with murine microvascular endothelial cells were engineered,
   side-by-side, subcutaneously in the dorsum of immunodefficient mice.
   When tumors reached 200 mm(3), mice were treated for 30 days with either
   4 mg/kg cisplatin (i.p.) every 5 days or with 40 mg/kg sunitinib (p.o.)
   daily. Xenograft human tumors vascularized with human endothelial cells
   grow faster than xenograft tumors vascularized with mouse endothelial
   cells (P<0.05). Notably, human tumors vascularized with human
   endothelial cells exhibited nuclear translocation of p65 (indicative of
   high NF-kB activity), and were more resistant to treatment with
   cisplatin or sunitinib than the contralateral tumors vascularized with
   murine endothelial cells (P<0.05). Collectively, these studies suggest
   that the species of endothelial cells has a direct impact on xenograft
   tumor growth and response to treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug
   cisplatin or with the anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib.}},

Abstract = {{Flux-explicit transport laws based on Newman's concentrated-solution
   theory are developed for application to phases with domains of

   thermodynamic consistency within the non-neutral concentrated-solution
   theory, driving forces for diffusion are based on the chemical
   potentials of neutral combinations of species, and an excess current
   density is used as a driving force for migration. Procedures are
   developed for identifying the solution conductivity and Hittorf
   transference numbers in non-neutral electrolytes comprising three or
   more species. Flux laws for non-neutral binary electrolytic solutions
   involving the thermodynamic diffusion coefficient, cation transference
   number, and ionic conductivity are presented. When local
   electroneutrality is assumed, the new transport equations reduce to the
   familiar flux laws for binary electrolytes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{172}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{An important poorly understood phenomenon in controlled-release depots
   involves the strong interaction between common cationic peptides and low
   M-w free acid end-group poly(lactic-co-glycolic acids) (PLGAs) used to
   achieve continuous peptide release kinetics. The kinetics of peptide
   sorption to PLGA was examined by incubating peptide solutions of 0.2-4
   mM octreotide or leuprolide acetate salts in a 0.1 M HEPES buffer, pH
   7.4, with polymer particles or films at 4-37 degrees C for 24 h. The
   extent of absorption/loading of peptides in PLGA particles/films was
   assayed by two-phase extraction and amino acid analysis. Confocal Raman
   microspectroscopy, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and laser scanning
   confocal imaging, and microtome sectioning techniques were used to
   examine peptide penetration into the polymer phase. The release of
   sorbed peptide from leuprolide-PLGA particles was evaluated both in
   vitro (PBST + 0.02\% sodium azide, 37 degrees C) and in vivo (male
   Sprague-Dawley rats). We found that when the PLGA-COOH chains are
   sufficiently mobilized, therapeutic peptides not only bind at the
   surface, a common belief to date, but also can be internalized and
   distributed throughout the polymer phase at physiological temperature
   forming a salt with low-molecular weight PLGA-COOH. Importantly,
   absorption of leuprolide into low MW PLGA-COOH particles yielded similar
   to 17 wt.\% leuprolide loading in the polymer (i.e., similar to 70\% of
   PLGA-COOH acids occupied), and the absorbed peptide was released from

Title = {{Biophysical significance of the inner mitochondrial membrane structure
   on the electrochemical potential of mitochondria}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},

Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{The available literature supports the hypothesis that the morphology of
   the inner mitochondrial membrane is regulated by different energy
   states, that the three-dimensional morphology of cristae is dynamic, and
   that both are related to biochemical function. Examination of the
   correlation between the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) structure and
   mitochondrial energetic function is critical to an understanding of the
   links between mesoscale morphology and function in progressive
   mitochondrial dysfunction such as aging, neurodegeneration, and disease.
   To investigate this relationship, we develop a model to examine the
   effects of three-dimensional IMM morphology on the electrochemical
   potential of mitochondria. The two-dimensional axisymmetric finite
   element method is used to simulate mitochondrial electric potential and
   proton concentration distribution. This simulation model demonstrates
   that the proton motive force (Delta p) produced on the membranes of
   cristae can be higher than that on the inner boundary membrane. The
   model also shows that high proton concentration in cristae can be
   induced by the morphology-dependent electric potential gradient along
   the outer side of the IMM. Furthermore, simulation results show that a
   high Delta p is induced by the large surface-to-volume ratio of an
   individual crista, whereas a high capacity for ATP synthesis can
   primarily be achieved by increasing the surface area of an individual
   crista. The mathematical model presented here provides compelling
   support for the idea that morphology at the mesoscale is a significant
   driver of mitochondrial function.}},

Abstract = {{The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays a
   critical role in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. TAP
   translocates cellular peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane
   in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. We used FRET spectroscopy in
   permeabilized cells to delineate different conformational states of TAP
   in a native subcellular membrane environment. For these studies, we
   tagged the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein
   and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, respectively, C-terminally to
   their nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and measured FRET efficiencies
   under different conditions. Our data indicate that both ATP and ADP
   enhance the FRET efficiencies but that neither induces a maximally
   closed NBD conformation. Additionally, peptide binding induces a large
   and significant increase in NBD proximity with a concentration
   dependence that is reflective of individual peptide affinities for TAP,
   revealing the underlying mechanism of peptide-stimulated ATPase activity
   of TAP. Maximal NBD closure is induced by the combination of peptide and
   non-hydrolysable ATP analogs. Thus, TAP1-TAP2 NBD dimers are not fully
   stabilized by nucleotides alone, and substrate binding plays a key role
   in inducing the transition state conformations of the NBD. Taken
   together, these findings show that at least three steps are involved in
   the transport of peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane for
   antigen presentation, corresponding to three dynamically and
   structurally distinct conformational states of TAP. Our studies
   elucidate structural changes in the TAP NBD in response to nucleotides
   and substrate, providing new insights into the mechanism of ATP-binding
   cassette transporter function.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a methodology for constructing anharmonic vibrational
   Hamiltonians that are parametrized from first-principles
   electronic-structure calculations and can be used to study
   high-temperature properties of crystalline materials. Our method
   provides an accurate description of the Born-Oppenheimer potential
   energy surface of a crystal that can be systematically refined and is
   invariant to space-group symmetries of the ideal reference crystal and
   finite rigid-body rotations and translations. These features make it
   ideally suited for Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations to
   predict finite-temperature thermodynamic properties, structural phase
   transitions, and thermal conductivity. We use this method to construct
   an anharmonic Hamiltonian for ZrH2, which exhibits a high-temperature
   cubic phase that undergoes a symmetry-breaking second-order transition
   to one of three equivalent tetragonal phases upon cooling. Although
   density functional theory predicts a zero-Kelvin dynamical instability
   of cubic ZrH2, we find via Monte Carlo simulation that the cubic phase
   can be anharmonically stabilized at high temperature and predict a
   cubic-to-tetragonal transition temperature that is in good agreement
   with extrapolation from experiments. We also calculate
   finite-temperature free energies for the cubic and tetragonal phases,
   finding that they are consistent with the phenomenological Landau theory
   of second-order phase transitions.}},

Title = {{Filtering data from the collaborative initial glaucoma treatment study
   for improved identification of glaucoma progression}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is a prevalent, degenerate ocular
   disease which can lead to blindness without proper clinical management.
   The tests used to assess disease progression are susceptible to process
   and measurement noise. The aim of this study was to develop a
   methodology which accounts for the inherent noise in the data and
   improve significant disease progression identification.
   Methods: Longitudinal observations from the Collaborative Initial
   Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) were used to parameterize and validate
   a Kalman filter model and logistic regression function. The Kalman
   filter estimates the true value of biomarkers associated with OAG and
   forecasts future values of these variables. We develop two logistic
   regression models via generalized estimating equations (GEE) for
   calculating the probability of experiencing significant OAG progression:
   one model based on the raw measurements from CIGTS and another model
   based on the Kalman filter estimates of the CIGTS data. Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curves and associated area under the ROC
   curve (AUC) estimates are calculated using cross-fold validation.
   Results: The logistic regression model developed using Kalman filter
   estimates as data input achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than
   the model developed using raw measurements. The mean AUC for the Kalman
   filter-based model is 0.961 while the mean AUC for the raw measurements
   model is 0.889. Hence, using the probability function generated via
   Kalman filter estimates and GEE for logistic regression, we are able to
   more accurately classify patients and instances as experiencing
   significant OAG progression.
   Conclusion: A Kalman filter approach for estimating the true value of
   OAG biomarkers resulted in data input which improved the accuracy of a
   logistic regression classification model compared to a model using raw
   measurements as input. This methodology accounts for process and
   measurement noise to enable improved discrimination between progression
   and nonprogression in chronic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{We present a kinetic model predicting anion incorporation in InAsSb.
   Included are the effects of As desorption, Sb segregation, and Sb
   displacement by As, any of which may be limited by the In flux if it is

   of growth conditions for the InAsSb system using activation energies for
   desorption and Sb segregation found in literature. The activation energy
   for Sb displacement found in this work is 1.3 eV. This model is general

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Empirical study of repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharges (RPNDs) on
   time scales relevant to their formation is notably difficult. Here, we
   present measurements of the metastable dynamics in a helium RPND with a
   time resolution of 5 ns at 1.0, 4.0 and 8.0 Torr. A detailed global
   model is developed in which the applied electric field is chosen to
   match the measured metastable densities. This approach results in
   predictions of the local electric fields and the evolution of the
   electron densities and temperatures. The estimated electric fields in
   the bulk of plasma range from 150-350 Td, and the peak electron
   temperatures range from 11-75 eV. The large temperatures necessary for
   the simulations to match the observed metastable densities may indicate
   a distribution function far from equilibrium. Experimental and
   simulation results indicate a delay between the applied field and the
   peak excitation and ionization rates, likely a consequence of the finite
   rate coefficients. Finally, evidence is provided to suggest that that
   optimization of electron production is mutually exclusive with that of
   the metastables.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{590}},
Pages = {{106-110}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{In organic materials, triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) can be
   dominated by triplet diffusion or triplet-to-triplet energy transfer.
   Here, we discuss the diffusion and transfer dominated mechanisms in the
   context of photoluminescence (PL) transient measurements from thin films
   of archetype phosphorescent organic light emitters based on Ir and Pt
   complexes. We find that TTA in these emitters is controlled by diffusion
   due to a Dexter-type exchange interaction, suggesting triplet radiative
   decay and TTA are independent processes. Minimizing the PL and
   absorption spectral overlap in phosphorescent emitters can lead to a
   significantly decreased TTA rate, and thus suppressed efficiency
   roll-off in phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes at high
   brightness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Engineered Ion Channels as Emerging Tools for Chemical Biology}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2998-3008}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Over the last 25 years, researchers have developed exogenously
   expressed, genetically engineered, semi-synthetic, and entirely
   synthetic ion channels. These structures have sufficient fidelity to
   serve as unique tools that can reveal information about living
   organisms. One of the most exciting success stories is optogenetics: the
   use of light-gated channels to trigger action potentials in specific
   neurons combined with studies of the response from networks of cells or
   entire live animals.
   Despite this breakthrough, the use of molecularly engineered ion
   channels for studies of biological systems is still in its infancy.
   Historically, researchers studied ion channels in the context of their
   0.2 Voltage (V) lima (a) own function in single cells or in
   multicellular signaling and regulation. Only recently have researchers
   considered ion channels and poreforming peptides as responsive tools to
   report on the chemical and physical changes produced by other
   biochemical processes and reactions. This emerging class of molecular
   probes has a number of useful characteristics. For instance, these
   structures can greatly amplify the signal of chemical changes: the
   binding of one molecule to a ligand-gated ion channel can result in flux
   of millions of ions across a cell membrane. In addition, gating occurs
   on sub-microsecond time scales, resulting in fast response times.
   Moreover, the signal is complementary to existing techniques because the
   output is ionic current rather than fluorescence or radioactivity. And
   finally, ion channels are also localized at the membrane of cells where
   essential processes such as signaling and regulation take place.
   This Account highlights examples, mostly from our own work, of uses of
   ion channels and pore-forming peptides such as gramiddin in chemical
   biology. We discuss various strategies for preparing synthetically
   tailored ion channels that range from de novo designed synthetic
   molecules to genetically engineered or simply exogenously expressed or
   reconstituted wild-type channels. Next we consider aspects of
   experimental design by comparing various membrane environments or
   systems that make it possible to quantify the response of ion channels
   to biochemical processes of interest. We present applications of ion
   channels to answer questions in chemical biology, and propose potential
   future developments and applications of these single molecule probes.
   Finally we discuss the hurdles that impede the routine use of ion
   channel probes in biochemistry and cell biology laboratories and
   developments and strategies that could overcome these problems.
   Optogenetics has facilitated breakthroughs in neurosdence, and these
   results give a dramatic idea of what may lie ahead for designed ion
   channels as a functional class of molecular probes. If researchers can
   improve molecular engineering to increase ion channel versatility and
   can overcome the barriers to collaborating across disciplines, we
   conclude that these structures could have tremendous potential as novel
   tools for chemical biology studies.}},

Abstract = {{Cold spraying was used to fabricate Ag/SnO2 coatings on copper substrate
   with high energy ball milled Ag/SnO2 composite powders. The cold sprayed
   coatings were annealed under vacuum at a temperature of 600 degrees C
   and 850 degrees C for 2 h. Vickers microhardness and arc erosion tests
   were conducted to determine the mechanical properties and arc erosion
   properties of the coatings. The effect of annealing temperature on the
   microstructure, microhardness and arc erosion of the coatings was
   investigated. It was found that cold sprayed Ag/SnO2 coatings exhibited
   denser microstructure and better coating-substrate interface after
   annealing at 850 degrees C. The hardness of Ag/SnO2 coatings was
   evidently influenced by annealing temperature. The arc erosion test
   results indicated that the arc erosion properties of cold sprayed
   Ag/SnO2 coatings can be improved significantly by annealing; the
   coatings annealed at 850 degrees C showed the best arc erosion
   properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{295-308}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{An accurate SoC (state of charge) and SoP (state of power capability)
   joint estimator is the most significant techniques for electric
   vehicles. This paper makes two contributions to the existing literature.
   (1) A data-driven parameter identification method has been proposed for
   accurately capturing the real-time characteristic of the battery through
   the recursive least square algorithm, where the parameter of the battery
   model is updated with the real-time measurements of battery current and
   voltage at each sampling interval. (2) An adaptive extended Kalman
   filter algorithm based multi-state joint estimator has been developed in
   accordance with the relationship of the battery SoC and its power
   capability. Note that the SoC and SoP can be predicted accurately
   against the degradation and various operating environments of the
   battery through the data-driven parameter identification method. The
   robustness of the proposed data-driven joint estimator has been verified
   by different degradation states of lithium-ion polymer battery cells.
   The result indicates that the estimation errors of voltage and SoC are
   less than 1\% even if given a large erroneous initial state of joint
   estimator, which makes the SoP estimate more accurate and reliable for
   the electric vehicles application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, free vibration analysis of cracked composite beam
   subjected to coupled bending-torsion loading is presented. The composite
   beam is assumed to have an open edge crack of length a. A first order
   shear deformation theory is applied to count for the effect of shear
   deformations on natural frequencies as well as the effect of coupling in
   torsion and bending modes of vibration. Governing equations and boundary
   conditions are derived using Hamilton principle. Local flexibility
   matrix is used to obtain the additional boundary conditions of the beam
   in cracked area. After obtaining the governing equations and boundary
   conditions, generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method is applied
   to solve the obtained eigenvalue problem. Finally, some numerical
   results of beams with various boundary conditions and different fiber
   orientations are given to show the efficiency of the method. In
   addition, to study the effect of shear deformations, numerical results
   of the current model are compared with previously given results in which
   shear deformations were neglected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Monitoring attentional state with fNIRS}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{The ability to distinguish between high and low levels of task
   engagement in the real world is important for detecting and preventing
   performance decrements during safety-critical operational tasks. We
   therefore investigated whether functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy
   (fNIRS), a portable brain neuroimaging technique, can be used to
   distinguish between high and low levels of task engagement during the
   performance of a selective attention task. A group of participants
   performed the multi-source interference task (MSIT) while we recorded
   brain activity with fNIRS from two brain regions. One was a key region
   of the ``task-positive{''} network, which is associated with relatively
   high levels of task engagement. The second was a key region of the
   ``task-negative{''} network, which is associated with relatively low
   levels of task engagement (e.g., resting and not performing a task).
   Using activity in these regions as inputs to a multivariate pattern
   classifier, we were able to predict above chance levels whether
   participants were engaged in performing the MSIT or resting. We were
   also able to replicate prior findings from functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) indicating that activity in task-positive and
   task-negative regions is negatively correlated during task performance.
   Finally, data from a companion fMRI study verified our assumptions about
   the sources of brain activity in the fNIRS experiment and established an
   upper bound on classification accuracy in our task. Together, our
   findings suggest that fNIRS could prove quite useful for monitoring
   cognitive state in real-world settings.}},

Title = {{Transmural Ultrasound Imaging of Thermal Lesion and Action Potential
   Changes in Perfused Canine Cardiac Wedge Preparations by High Intensity
   Focused Ultrasound Ablation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Intra-procedural imaging is important for guiding cardiac arrhythmia
   ablation. It is difficult to obtain intra-procedural correlation of
   thermal lesion formation with action potential (AP) changes in the
   transmural plane during ablation. This study tested parametric
   ultrasound imaging for transmural imaging of lesion and AP changes in
   high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation using coronary
   perfused canine ventricular wedge preparations (n = 13). The
   preparations were paced from epi/endocardial surfaces and subjected to
   HIFU application (3.5 MHz, 11 Hz pulse-repetition-frequency, 70\% duty
   cycle, duration 4 s, 3500 W/cm(2)), during which simultaneous optical
   mapping (1 kframes/s) using di-4-ANEPPS and ultrasound imaging (30 MHz)
   of the same transmural surface of the wedge were performed.
   Spatiotemporally correlated AP measurements and ultrasound imaging
   allowed quantification of the reduction of AP amplitude (APA),
   shortening of AP duration at 50\% repolarization, AP triangulation,
   decrease of optical AP rise, and change of conduction velocity along
   tissue depth direction within and surrounding HIFU lesions. The
   threshold of irreversible change in APA correlating to lesions was
   determined to be 43 +/- 1\% with a receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.96 +/- 0.01 (n = 13). Ultrasound
   imaging parameters such as integrated backscatter, Rayleigh (alpha) and
   log-normal (sigma) parameters, cumulative extrema of sigma were tested,
   with the cumulative extrema of sigma performing the best in detecting
   lesion (ROC AUC 0.89 +/- 0.01, n = 13) and change of APA (ROC AUC 0.79
   +/- 0.03, n = 13). In conclusion, characteristic tissue and AP changes
   in HIFU ablation were identified and spatiotemporally correlated using
   optical mapping and ultrasound imaging. Parametric ultrasound imaging
   using cumulative extrema of sigma can detect HIFU lesion and APA
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Tinnitus and cochlear damage have been associated with changes in
   somatosensory-auditory integration and plasticity in the dorsal cochlear
   nucleus (DCN). Recently, we demonstrated in vivo that DCN bimodal
   plasticity is stimulus timing-dependent, with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian
   timing rules that reflect in vitro spike timing-dependent plasticity. In
   this in vivo study, we assessed the stimulus timing dependence of
   bimodal plasticity in a tinnitus model. Guinea pigs were exposed to a
   narrowband noise that produced a temporary elevation of auditory
   brainstem response thresholds. A total of 60\% of the guinea pigs
   developed tinnitus as indicated by gap-induced prepulse inhibition of
   the acoustic startle. After noise exposure and tinnitus induction,
   stimulus timing-dependent plasticity was measured by comparing responses
   to sound before and after paired somatosensory and auditory stimulation
   presented with varying intervals and orders. In comparison with Sham and
   noise-exposed animals that did not develop tinnitus, timing rules in
   verified tinnitus animals were more likely to be anti-Hebbian and
   broader for those bimodal intervals in which the neural activity showed
   enhancement. Furthermore, units from exposed animals with tinnitus were
   more weakly suppressed than either Sham animals or exposed animals
   without tinnitus. The broadened timing rules in the enhancement phase in
   animals with tinnitus, and in the suppressive phase in exposed animals
   without tinnitus was in contrast to narrow, Hebbian-like timing rules in
   Sham animals. These findings implicate alterations in DCN bimodal spike
   timing-dependent plasticity as underlying mechanisms in tinnitus,
   opening the way for a therapeutic target.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) are typically constructed with
   helical or tetrahedral geometries. Simple pairs of NPs are not expected
   to display chirality due to basic symmetry considerations made under the
   assumption of their spherical geometry. In this study we demonstrate
   that assemblies consisting of two metallic NPs do possess chirality and
   strongly rotate polarization of light. Their chiroplasmonic properties
   are attributed to the prolate geometry of individual colloidal
   particles. When bridged by biomolecules, the NP pairs acquire
   scissor-like geometry, with the long axes of NPs forming an angle of
   similar to 9 degrees. This small dihedral angle results in chirality of
   the NP pair, while the consistency of its sign due to the specific
   conformation of the bridging biomacromolecules breaks the enantiomeric
   equivalence of the NP pairs. Strong polarization rotation in these
   nanoassemblies makes possible their utilization in biological analysis.
   Heterodimers of gold and silver NPs were made using antibody-antigen
   bridges. Taking advantage of their chiroplasmonic properties, we
   investigated their bioanalitical potential for detection of an
   environmental toxin, microcystin-LR, and a cancer biomarker,
   prostate-specific antigen. The order-of-magnitude improvements in limits
   of detection compared to all other analytical techniques are attributed
   to plasmonic enhancement of intrinsic chirality of biological compounds,
   strong optical coupling of photons with NP assemblies with twisted
   geometries, and signal amplification due to the bisignate nature of
   circular dichroism bands.}},

Abstract = {{Heart regeneration through in vivo cardiac reprogramming has been
   demonstrated as a possible regenerative strategy. While it has been
   reported that cardiac reprogramming in vivo is more efficient than in
   vitro, the influence of the extracellular microenvironment on cardiac
   reprogramming remains incompletely understood. This understanding is
   necessary to improve the efficiency of cardiac reprogramming in order to
   implement this strategy successfully. Here we have identified matrix
   identity and cell-generated tractional forces as key determinants of the
   dedifferentiation and differentiation stages during reprogramming. Cell
   proliferation, matrix mechanics, and matrix microstructure are also
   important, but play lesser roles. Our results suggest that the
   extracellular microenvironment can be optimized to enhance cardiac

   dilute concentrations of asphaltenes are presented and discussed. As
   asphaltenes are diluted, it was found that the cluster size decreases
   and follows a fractal scaling law. This observation reveals that
   asphaltene clusters persist to dilute concentrations and maintain
   fractal characteristics, regardless of concentration. For the first
   time, the fraction of asphaltenes that exist in nanoaggregates compared
   to those molecularly dispersed was estimated from the scattering
   intensity. Significant dissociation was detected at concentrations
   similar to the previously reported critical nanoaggregate concentration
   (CNAC); however, the dissociation was observed to occur gradually as the
   asphaltene concentration was lowered. Complete dissociation was not
   detected, and aggregates persisted down to asphaltene concentrations as
   low as 15 mg/L (0.00125 vol. \%). A simplified thermodynamic aggregation
   model was applied to the measurements, and the free energy change of
   association per asphaltene asphaltene interaction was calculated to be
   approximately 31 kJ/mol. Finally, novel solvent-corrected WAXS results
   of asphaltene in a liquid environment are presented and reveal three
   distinct separation distances, in contrast to the two separation
   distances observed in diffraction studies of solid phase asphaltenes.
   Significant differences in the WAXS peak positions and shapes between
   aromatic and nonaromatic solvents suggests that there may be large
   differences between the solvation shell or conformation of the
   asphaltene alkyl shell depending on the surrounding liquid environment.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) segmental dynamics of
   bulk miscible blends of polystyrene (PS) and PVME reveals that while at
   high temperatures, T, there is evidence of a single a-relaxation
   process, at lower T, two separate dominant relaxation processes,
   associated with the change in structure of the blend with decreasing T,
   emerge. One relaxation process decreases with a much stronger dependence
   on T and ``freezes{''} at a temperature comparable to the glass
   transition temperature, T-g, of the blend measured using differential
   scanning calorimetry. The other exhibits a weaker T dependence and
   persists at much lower T, becoming Arrhenius (the so-called
   alpha'-process) at sufficiently low T. In thin PVME/PS films confined
   between aluminum substrates, a new relaxation process, ales, associated
   with PVME chains that preferentially segregate to the substrates,
   emerges. These observations are considered in light of the influence of
   spatial compositional heterogeneities on blend dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports solution-processed, high-efficiency polymer
   light-emitting diodes fabricated by a new type of roll-to-roll coating
   method under ambient air conditions. A noble roll-to-roll cohesive
   coating system utilizes only natural gravity and the surface tension of
   the solution to flow out from the capillary to the surface of the
   substrate. Because this mechanism uses a minimally cohesive solution,
   the roll-to-roll cohesive coating can effectively realize an ultra-thin
   film thickness for the electron injection layer. In addition, the
   roll-to-roll cohesive coating enables the fabrication of a thicker
   polymer anode film more than 250 nm at one time by modification of the
   surface energy and without wasting the solution. It is observed that the
   standard sheet resistance deviation of the polymer anode is only 2.32
   Omega/square over 50 000 bending cycles. The standard sheet resistance
   deviation of the polymer anode in the different bending angles (0 to 180
   degrees) is 0.313 Omega/square, but the case of the ITO-PET is 104.93
   Omega/square. The average surface roughness of the polymer anode
   measured by atomic force microscopy is only 1.06 nm. Because the surface
   of the polymer anode has a better quality, the leakage current of the
   polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) using the polymer anode is much
   lower than that using the ITO-PET substrate. The luminous power
   efficiency of the two devices is 4.13 lm/W for the polymer anode and
   3.21 lm/W for the ITO-PET. Consequently, the PLEDs made by using the
   polymer anode exhibited 28\% enhanced performance because the polymer
   anode represents not only a higher transparency than the ITO-PET in the
   wavelength of 560 nm but also greatly reduced roughness. The optimized
   the maximum current efficiency and power efficiency of the device show
   around 6.1 cd/A and 5.1 lm/W, respectively, which is comparable to the
   case of using the ITO-glass.}},

Title = {{Design optimization of bowtie nanoantenna for high-efficiency
   thermophotovoltaics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{A novel matching technique and the field enhancement at the terminals of
   a bowtie nanoantenna are utilized to develop compact, highly efficient,
   and flexible thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells. The bowtie antenna is
   designed for maximum power transfer to a near infrared band (1 mu m to
   2.2 mu m) of a TPV cell using Indium Gallium Arsenide Antimonide
   (InGaAsSb). A nano-meter size block of InGaAsSb with a low bandgap
   energy of 0.52 eV is mounted at the terminals of the antenna. Such a
   load presents a frequency dependent impedance with a high resistance and
   capacitance at the desired frequency (180THz). For maximum power
   transfer, a high impedance bowtie antenna operating at the
   anti-resonance mode in conjunction with an inductive stub is realized.
   The plasmonic behavior of the metal that tends to reduce the antenna
   size is partially compensated by the extra length needed to achieve the
   anti-resonance condition. At the desired band, the proposed nanoantenna
   loaded with InGaAsSb block shows an electric field intensity at the
   antenna terminals, which is approximately 23.5 times higher than the
   incident electric field intensity. This feature allows for development
   of efficient TPV cell and sensitive IR detectors. The infinite array of
   the bowtie antennas backed by a metallic reflector located at a
   quarter-wave behind the array is shown to absorb similar to 95\% of the
   incident power, which is more than 50\% higher than the bulk InGaAsSb
   TPV cell. A novel configuration of the bowtie nanoantenna array is also
   presented that allows for collection of DC currents through an almost
   arbitrary parallel or series configuration of TPV cells without
   adversely affecting the IR performance of the individual antennas. In
   this scheme, elements can be arranged to be polarization dependent or
   independent. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Nitride light-emitting diodes are a promising solution for efficient
   solid-state lighting, but their performance at high power is affected by
   the efficiency-droop problem. Previous experimental and theoretical work
   has identified Auger recombination, a three-particle nonradiative
   carrier recombination mechanism, as the likely cause of the droop. In
   this work, we use first-principles calculations to elucidate the
   dependence of the radiative and Auger recombination rates on
   temperature, carrier density and quantum-well confinement. Our
   calculated data for the temperature dependence of the recombination
   coefficients are in good agreement with experiment and provide further
   validation on the role of Auger recombination in the efficiency
   reduction. Polarization fields and phase-space filling negatively impact
   device efficiency because they increase the operating carrier density at
   a given current density and increase the fraction of carriers lost to
   Auger recombination.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{416}},
Pages = {{228-237}},

Abstract = {{The long-term goal of this research program is to develop and validate
   bioenergetic models for juvenile salmonid production oriented toward
   practical hatchery applications. As an initial step toward attainment of
   this goal, the efficacy of the model was evaluated by comparing model
   simulations with published data for the growth of a wild strain of coho
   salmon and a domestic strain selected for its rapid growth
   characteristics. Model simulations were consistent with the observed
   growth for each strain when the consumption rate model coefficient was
   adjusted to account for differences in the stomach size. In an
   independent study, the growth and proximate composition of juvenile
   Chinook salmon were measured in response to high and low lipid diets
   supplied at two different feeding rates. Model simulations were closely
   comparable to these data when the model coefficients for consumption and
   apparent respiration rate were adjusted to account for ration and body
   lipid content. These insights and the successful simulation of measured
   growth data for eight different combinations of ration, food
   composition, and coho strain are useful and necessary steps needed to
   support the development of credible production-scale management models
   for juvenile salmonid fish production and waste by-product generation
   from aquaculture and mariculture activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a novel microfluidic islet array based on a
   hydrodynamic trapping principle. The lab-on-a-chip studies with
   live-cell multiparametric imaging allow understanding of physiological
   and pathophysiological changes of microencapsulated islets under hypoxic
   conditions. Using this microfluidic array and imaging analysis
   techniques, we demonstrate that hypoxia impairs the function of
   microencapsulated islets at the single islet level, showing a
   heterogeneous pattern reflected in intracellular calcium signaling,
   mitochondrial energetic, and redox activity. Our approach demonstrates
   an improvement over conventional hypoxia chambers that is able to
   rapidly equilibrate to true hypoxia levels through the integration of
   dynamic oxygenation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
   array-based cellular analysis and opens up new modality to conduct
   informative analysis and cell-based screening for microencapsulated

Abstract = {{Pulsed ultrasonic cavitation is a promising modality for non-contact
   targeted therapy, enabling mechanical ablation of the tissue. We
   demonstrate a spatio-temporal superposition approach of two ultrasound
   pulses (high and low frequencies) producing a tight cavitation zone of
   100 mu m in water, which is an-order-of-magnitudes smaller than those
   obtained by the existing high-amplitude transducers. Particularly,
   laser-generated focused ultrasound (LGFU) was employed for the
   high-frequency operation (15 MHz). As demonstrated, LGFU plays a primary
   role to define the cavitation zone. The generation rate of cavitation
   bubbles could be dramatically increased up to 4.1\% (cf. 0.06\% without
   the superposition) with moderated threshold requirement. (C) 2013 AIP

Title = {{Synergistic Interactions between Alzheimer's A beta 40 and A beta 42 on
   the Surface of Primary Neurons Revealed by Single Molecule Microscopy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Two amyloid-beta peptides (A beta 40 and A beta 42) feature prominently
   in the extracellular brain deposits associated with Alzheimer's disease.
   While A beta 40 is the prevalent form in the cerebrospinal fluid, the
   fraction of A beta 42 increases in the amyloid deposits over the course
   of disease development. The low in vivo concentration (pM-nM) and
   metastable nature of A beta oligomers have made identification of their
   size, composition, cellular binding sites and mechanism of action
   challenging and elusive. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that
   synergistic effects between A beta 40 and A beta 42 alter both the
   formation and stability of various peptide oligomers as well as their
   cytotoxicity. These studies often utilized A beta oligomers that were
   prepared in solution and at mu M peptide concentrations. The current
   work was performed using physiological A beta concentrations and
   single-molecule microscopy to follow peptide binding and association on
   primary cultured neurons. When the cells were exposed to a 1: 1 mixture
   of nM A beta 40:A beta 42, significantly larger membrane-bound oligomers
   developed compared to those formed from either peptide alone.
   Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments at the single
   molecule level reveal that these larger oligomers contained both A beta
   40 and A beta 42, but that the growth of these oligomers was
   predominantly by addition of A beta 42. Both pure peptides form very few
   oligomers larger than dimers, but either membrane bound A beta 40/42
   complex, or A beta 40, bind A beta 42 to form increasingly larger
   oligomers. These findings may explain how A beta 42-dominant oligomers,
   suspected of being more cytotoxic, develop on the neuronal membrane
   under physiological conditions.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{300+}},

Abstract = {{Targeted DNA enrichment through hybridization capture (EHC) is rapidly
   replacing PCR as the method of choice for enrichment prior to genomic
   resequencing. This is especially true in the case of ancient DNA (aDNA)
   from long-dead organisms, where targets tend to be highly fragmented and
   outnumbered by contaminant DNA. However, the behavior of EHC using aDNA
   has been quite variable, making success difficult to predict and
   preventing efficient sample equilibration during multiplexed sequencing
   runs. Here, we evaluate whether quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurements of
   aDNA samples correlate with on-target read counts before and after EHC.
   Our data indicate that not only do simple target qPCRs correlate
   strongly with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data but that certain
   sample characteristics, such as overall target abundance as well as
   experimental parameters (e.g., bait concentration and secondary
   structure propensity), consistently influenced enrichment of our diverse
   set of aDNA samples. Taken together, our results should help guide
   experimental design, screening strategies, and multiplexed sample
   equilibration, increasing yield and reducing the expected and actual
   cost of aDNA EHC high-throughput sequencing projects in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical and experimental investigations of supersonic jet interactions
   with a flat surface at various atmospheric pressures are presented in
   this paper. These studies were done in assessing the landing hazards of
   both the NASA Mars Science Laboratory and the Phoenix Mars spacecraft.
   Temporal and spatial ground pressure measurements in conjunction with
   numerical solutions at altitudes of similar to 35 nozzle exit diameters
   and jet expansion ratios e between 0.02 and 100 are used. This study
   shows that, for typical landing spacecraft engine parameters, thruster
   plumes exhausting into Martian environments create the largest surface
   pressure loads and can occur at high spacecraft altitudes in contrast to
   the jet interactions, which occur in terrestrial and lunar atmospheres.
   These differences are dependent on the stability and dynamics of the
   plate shock, the length of the supersonic core, and plume decay due to
   shear layer instability, all of which are functions of the jet expansion
   ratio. Theoretical, experimental, and analytical results show that
   subscale supersonic cold gas jets adequately simulate the flowfield and
   loads due to rocket plume impingement, provided important scaling
   parameters are in agreement. These studies indicate the critical
   importance of testing and modeling plume-surface interactions for
   descent and ascent of spacecraft and launch vehicles.}},

   statistical analyses of the data gathered across the experimental
   studies. Comparisons were made on observations of pilots with comparable
   experience under similar headup or headdown display conditions. In
   general, this research demonstrated the clutter measures to be highly
   sensitive to aviation display and domain conditions. The findings also
   indicated that human information processing considerations in aviation
   display design coupled with attention to the visual characteristics of
   display features may provide an effective basis for mitigating potential

Abstract = {{Correlation analyses were carried out for the dynamics of leaf water
   potential in two broad-leaf deciduous tree species in a sandy site under
   a range of air vapor pressure deficits and a relatively dry range of
   soil conditions. During nights when the soil is dry, the diffuse-porous,
   isohydric and shallow-rooted Acer rubrum does not recharge its xylem and
   leaf water storage to the same capacity that is observed during nights
   when the soil is moist. The ring-porous, deep-rooted Quercus rubra
   displays a more anisohydric behavior and appears to be capable of
   recharging to capacity at night-time even when soil moisture at the top
   1 m is near wilting point, probably by accessing deeper soil layers than
   A. rubrum. Compared to A. rubrum, Q. rubra displays only a minimal level
   of down-regulation of stomatal conductance, which leads to a reduction
   of leaf water potential during times when vapor pressure deficit is high
   and soil moisture is limiting. We determine that the two species,
   despite typically being categorized by ecosystem models under the same
   plant functional type-mid-successional, temperate broadleaf-display
   different hydraulic strategies. These differences may lead to large
   differences between the species in water relations, transpiration and
   productivity under different precipitation and humidity regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids can deploy traditional and/or renewable power sources to
   support remote sites. Utilizing renewable power sources requires more
   complicated control strategies to achieve acceptable power quality and
   maintain grid stability. In this research, we assume that the grid
   stability problem is already solved. As a next step, we focus on how the
   power can be dispatched from multiple power sources for improved grid
   efficiency. Isolated microgrids frequently require reconfigurations
   because of the grid expansion or component failures. Therefore, the
   control strategies ideally should be implemented in a plug-and-play
   fashion. Moreover, these strategies ideally require no pre-knowledge of
   the grid structure, and as little communication with neighboring power
   sources as possible. The control objective is to minimize a cost
   function that can be adjusted to reflect the desire to minimize energy
   cost and/or losses. An algorithm is designed to satisfy a derived
   necessary condition of function optimality. Such conditions are obtained
   by formulating Lagrange functions. An equivalent grid model approximates
   the grid structure which was later confirmed to represent the grid
   behavior adequately. For decentralized operations, we execute the
   distributed control sequentially using a simple token communication
   protocol. The performance of the combined system identification-Lagrange
   function minimization algorithm is demonstrated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Studies investigating dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance
   imaging-determined relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps as a

   predict survival of patients with glioma treated with chemoradiation.
   rCBV maps were acquired in patients with high-grade gliomas at 0, 1, and
   3 weeks into chemoradiation therapy. Various analytical techniques were
   applied to the same cohort of serial rCBV data for early assessment of
   survival. Three different methodologies were investigated: 1) percentage
   change of whole tumor statistics (i.e., mean, median, and percentiles),
   2) physiological segmentation (low rCBV, medium rCBV, or high rCBV), and
   3) a voxel-based approach, parametric response mapping (PRM). All
   analyses were performed using the same tumor contours, which were
   determined using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid attenuated
   inversion recovery images. The predictive potential of each response
   metric was assessed at 1-year and overall survival. PRM was the only
   analytical approach found to generate a response metric significantly
   predictive of patient 1-year survival. Time of acquisition and contour
   volume were not found to alter the sensitivity of the PRM approach for
   predicting overall survival. We have demonstrated the importance of the
   analytical approach in early response assessment using serial rCBV maps.
   The PRM analysis shows promise as a unified early and robust imaging
   biomarker of treatment response in patients diagnosed with high-grade
   gliomas.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a Bayesian parametric model for the purpose of
   estimating the extreme load on a wind turbine. The extreme load is the
   highest stress level imposed on a turbine structure that the turbine
   would experience during its service lifetime. A wind turbine should be
   designed to resist such a high load to avoid catastrophic structural
   failures. To assess the extreme load, turbine structural responses are
   evaluated by conducting field measurement campaigns or performing
   aeroelastic simulation studies. In general, data obtained in either case
   are not sufficient to represent various loading responses under all
   possible weather conditions. An appropriate extrapolation is necessary
   to characterize the structural loads in a turbine's service life. This
   study devises a Bayesian spline method for this extrapolation purpose,
   using load data collected in a period much shorter than a turbine's
   service life. The spline method is applied to three sets of turbine's
   load response data to estimate the corresponding extreme loads at the
   roots of the turbine blades. Compared to the current industry practice,
   the spline method appears to provide better extreme load assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops various chance-constrained models for optimizing the
   probabilistic network design problem (PNDP), where we differentiate the
   quality of service (QoS) and measure the related network performance
   under uncertain demand. The upper level problem of PNDP designs
   continuous/discrete link capacities shared by multi-commodity flows, and
   the lower level problem differentiates the corresponding QoS for demand
   satisfaction, to prioritize customers and/or commodities. We consider
   PNDP variants that have either fixed flows (formulated at the upper
   level) or recourse flows (at the lower level) according to different
   applications. We transform each probabilistic model into a mixed-integer
   program, and derive polynomial-time algorithms for special cases with
   single-row chance constraints. The paper formulates benchmark stochastic
   programming models by either enforcing to meet all demand or penalizing
   unmet demand via a linear penalty function. We compare different models
   and approaches by testing randomly generated network instances and an
   instance built on the Sioux-Falls network. Numerical results demonstrate
   the computational efficacy of the solution approaches and derive
   managerial insights. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Materials possessing both high stiffness and high damping would be
   beneficial in many structural applications. Composites that combine a
   stiff material, which usually has low damping, with a soft and lossy
   material have been proposed to engender both high dynamic modulus and
   high loss factor. In this article, we investigate the effective dynamic
   moduli and loss factors of Reuss and Voigt composites in response to a
   uniaxial harmonic load. The constituent materials are characterized by
   multiaxial viscoelastic models in the frequency domain. Using the
   viscoelastic correspondence principle, we derive formulae for Reuss and
   Voigt composites of infinite dimensions taking into account Poisson
   effects. We show that the effective loss factor of a Reuss composite is
   sensitive to the values of the Poisson's ratio and bulk loss factors of
   the constituent materials. Finally we simulate, using finite element
   analysis, the response of cylindrical Reuss composite rods of finite
   radius to an axial load. We demonstrate that the effective dynamic
   properties of these rods is highly sensitive to the ratio of the radius
   to the layer thickness of the composite.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of satellite images derived from multiple
   sensors creates opportunities for broader spatial and temporal coverage
   but also methodological challenges. We present a geostatistical inverse
   modeling (GIM) approach for merging coarse-resolution images with
   variable resolutions and for super-resolution (i.e., predictions at the
   sub-pixel level) mapping of continuous spatial processes. GIM can
   explicitly account for the differences in spatial supports of multiple
   datasets. The restricted maximum likelihood method was used for
   parameter estimations associated with the change-of-support problem. We
   used GIM to produce both spatial predictions of a target image and
   prediction uncertainties, while preserving the values of original
   measurements. GIM is totally data driven, and covariance parameters for
   a target resolution can be directly derived from measurements. We also
   developed a moving-window GIM approach to accommodate spatial
   nonstationarity and reduce computational burden associated with large
   image data. First we demonstrated GIM and moving-window GIM on synthetic
   images. Aggregated synthetic images with variable resolutions were
   merged to produce a single resolution image. The results show that the
   two approaches can produce accurate spatial predictions and generate
   prediction uncertainties. Second, we applied moving-window GIM for
   merging aerosol optical depth (ADD) data with variable resolutions,
   which were derived from two satellite sensors. The modeling results show
   that moving-window GIM can be applied for merging complementary AOD data
   from two sensors and for super-resolution mapping of global AOD
   distributions. Therefore, we can conclude that GIM is a practical
   solution for merging complementary coarse-resolution images and for
   super-resolution mapping of continuous spatial processes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We report a facile and large-scale fabrication of three-dimensional (3D)
   ZnO/CuO heterojunction branched nanowires (b-NWs) and their application
   as photocathodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar hydrogen
   production in a neutral medium. Using simple, cost-effective thermal
   oxidation and hydrothermal growth methods, ZnO/CuO b-NWs are grown on
   copper film or mesh substrates with various ZnO and CuO NWs sizes and
   densities. The ZnO/CuO b-NWs are characterized in detail using
   high-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopies
   exhibiting single-crystalline defect-free b-NWs with smooth and clean
   surfaces. The correlation between electrode currents and different NWs
   sizes and densities are studied in which b-NWs with longer and denser
   CuO NW cores show higher photocathodic current due to enhanced reaction
   surface area. The ZnO/CuO b-NW photoelectrodes exhibit broadband
   photoresponse from UV to near IR region, and higher photocathodic
   current than the ZnO-coated CuO (core/shell) NWs due to improved surface
   area and enhanced gas evolution. Significant improvement in the
   photocathodic current is observed when ZnO/CuO b-NWs are grown on copper
   mesh compared to copper film. The achieved results offer very useful
   guidelines in designing b-NWs mesh photoelectrodes for high-efficiency,
   low-cost, and flexible PEC cells using cheap, earth-abundant materials
   for clean solar hydrogen generation at large scales.}},

   cement mixtures subject to constant uniaxial restraint}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{635-642}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the early-age strain-stress development of mixtures
   containing slag cement was measured on uniaxially restrained specimens
   using a specially designed testing frame starting right after casting.
   It was found that thermal deformation dominates early-age stress
   development in low w/cm and low slag cement paste systems. While for
   concrete, autogenous shrinkage is the major contributing factor for
   tensile stress development. The early-age stress development of
   uniaxially restrained cementitious mixture specimens is profoundly
   influenced by the overt early-age relaxation effect, such that the
   compressive stress is significantly reduced and tensile stress develops
   before shrinkage begins. A linear shrinkage and tensile stress
   relationship is found to exist in mixtures subject to such constant
   restraint, regardless of w/cm and slag cement contents. Slag cement has
   the benefit of delaying tensile stress development and cracking time
   because of the reduced early-age thermal effect as compared to the
   ordinary Portland cement mixture. The cracking of the slag cement
   mixture is mainly due to the greater long-term autogenous shrinkage. The
   cracking time is found closely related to the shrinkage rate rather than
   the shrinkage magnitude, a unique relationship can be used to describe
   such phenomenon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wax deposition in subsea pipelines is a problem of enormous economic
   consequences. The carbon number distribution (CND) is an important
   characteristic of the deposit because it significantly affects the yield
   stress of wax deposit, which is important in the design of the
   remediation technique of pigging. In this study, the recent theories for
   wax thermodynamic modeling are coupled with heat and mass transport
   modeling to identify the critical factors that determine the carbon
   number distribution of wax deposits. It is found that the deposit carbon
   number distribution is closely related to the diffusion of different
   n-alkane components and their respective concentration driving forces.
   The impact of molecular diffusion of the multiple components on the
   evolution of deposit carbon number distribution is quantified by
   evaluating of the mass driving force for each n-paraffin component. In
   addition, the effects of operating conditions on the deposit carbon
   number distribution are investigated by modeling and are validated by
   series of flow-loop experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We observe that in a multichannel wireless system, an opportunistic
   channel/ spectrum access scheme that solely focuses on channel quality
   sensing measured by received SNR may induce users to use channels that,
   while providing better signals, are more congested. Ultimately the
   notion of channel quality should include both the signal quality and the
   level of congestion, and a good multichannel access scheme should take
   both into account in deciding which channel to use and when. Motivated
   by this, we focus on the congestion aspect and examine what type of
   dynamic channel switching schemes may result in the best system
   throughput performance. Specifically, we derive the stability region of
   a multiuser multichannel WLAN system and determine the throughput
   optimal channel switching scheme within a certain class of schemes. We
   also empirically examine the impact of considering congestion in
   addition to signal quality in making channel selection decisions.}},

Abstract = {{We report a low-cost solution fabrication of three-dimensional (3D)
   ZnO/Si broom-like nanowire (NW, nanobroom) heterostructures, consisting
   of Si NW backbones and ZnO NW stalls, and their application as
   photoelectrochemical anodes for solar water splitting and energy
   conversion. The nanobroom morphology and atomic structure are
   characterized using the scanning, transmission, and scanning
   transmission electron microscopies. Both Si NW backbones and ZnO NW
   stalls are defect-free, single-crystalline, and their surfaces are
   smooth. The optical absorption and photocurrents from nanobroom array
   electrodes with different Si and ZnO NW dimensions are studied. The
   longer Si NW backbones and smaller ZnO NW stalls lead to better light
   absorption and larger photoanodic current. The ZnO/Si nanobrooms show
   much higher photoanodic current than the bare Si NWs due to the
   effective Si/ZnO junction and increased surface area. The nanobroom
   electrode stability is also investigated and using a thin TiO2 coating
   layer protecting the NWs against dissolution, long-term stability is
   obtained without any change in shape and morphology of nanobrooms.
   Finally, the effect of catalyst to improve the oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER) at the electrode surface is studied resulting in large enhancement
   in photoanodic current and significant reduction in anodic turn-on
   potential. This study reveals the promise of the use of simply
   fabricated and low-cost 3D heterostructured NW photoelectrodes for clean
   solar energy harvesting and conversion.}},

Abstract = {{The high fertilizer demand for biodiesel production from microalgae is a
   significant challenge facing the commercialization of this promising
   technology. We investigated a processing strategy called hydrothermal
   carbonization (HTC) to convert wet algal biomass into a lipid-rich
   hydrochar and aqueous phase (AP) co-product. By reacting biomass at 200
   degrees C for 15 min, about 50\% of the algae biomass became a solid
   hydrochar and roughly 40-70\% of the C, N, and P in the reactant
   material dissolved into the AP. For the first time, an AP co-product of
   this nature was analyzed by HPLC, GC-MS and FT-ICR-MS to identify and
   characterize the dissolved organic matter. Using a unique marine
   bi-culture suspected to contain a green algae (Nannochloris) and a
   cyanobacteria (Synechocystis), we demonstrated that this AP co-product
   can support biomass growth better than a medium containing only
   inorganic nutrients. To manage unwanted contamination and optimize AP
   utilization, we employed a two-stage growth process and fed-batch
   additions of the AP co-product. The effect of media recycling and
   nutrient supplementation, as well as a production model for a
   large-scale facility, are discussed. Our work suggests that HTC can play
   a critical role in making algal biorefineries more sustainable by
   obviating biomass drying for fuel processing and recycling nutrients.

Abstract = {{A high-brightness GaN-based vertical light-emitting diode (VLED) was
   demonstrated by introducing a large-area low-cost direct printing
   process. A hexagonally close-packed micrometer convex array was
   fabricated on the n-GaN top layer of the VLED by direct printing using a
   hydrogen silsesquioxane solution and subsequent inductively coupled
   plasma etching. To confirm that the enhancement of light extraction by
   this structure, a conventional wet-chemical-etched structure was also
   fabricated on the n-GaN top layer of the VLED, yielding randomly
   oriented pyramid structures on the layer. Both VLEDs showed much
   stronger electroluminescence emission than an unpatterned VLED. However,
   the micrometer convex array improved the light extraction significantly
   more than the random pyramid structure owing to its greater ability to
   enlarge the light escape cone, attributed to its 50 degrees-tapered
   profile and large extraction area. After chip packaging with silicone
   encapsulation, the light output power of the micropatterned VLED was
   11.4\% and 106\% greater than those of the wet-etched and unpatterned
   VLEDs, respectively, under a 350-mA drive current.}},

Abstract = {{Standby power frequently dominates the power budget of battery-operated
   ultralow power sensor nodes. Reducing standby power is therefore a key
   challenge for further power reduction. Applying known circuit techniques
   for standby power reduction is challenging since standby power of
   state-of-the-art sensor node systems is now on the order of nanowatts or
   less. Hence, the overhead of any leakage reduction technique quickly
   overshadows any gains. This brief proposes an efficient implementation
   method for super cutoff CMOS that exploits the unique conditions of
   power gating to enable a highly efficient charge pump design. The
   proposed techniques are applied to logic blocks and memory devices. For
   a very low initial standby power value of tens of picowatts, standby
   power reduction of up to 19.3x and 29\% is achieved for logic blocks and
   memory, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive multi-element probabilistic collocation (ME-PC) method for
   quantifying uncertainties in electromagnetic compatibility and
   interference phenomena involving electrically large, multi-scale, and
   complex platforms is presented. The method permits the efficient and
   accurate statistical characterization of observables (i.e., quantities
   of interest such as coupled voltages) that potentially vary rapidly
   and/or are discontinuous in the random variables (i.e., parameters that
   characterize uncertainty in a system's geometry, configuration, or
   excitation). Themethod achieves its efficiency and accuracy by
   recursively and adaptively dividing the domain of the random variables
   into subdomains using as a guide the decay rate of relative error in a
   polynomial chaos expansion of the observables. While constructing local
   polynomial expansions on each subdomain, a fast integral-equation-based
   deterministic field-cable-circuit simulator is used to compute the
   observable values at the collocation/integration points determined by
   the adaptive ME-PC scheme. The adaptive ME-PC scheme requires far fewer
   (computationally costly) deterministic simulations than traditional
   polynomial chaos collocation and Monte Carlo methods for computing
   averages, standard deviations, and probability density functions of
   rapidly varying observables. The efficiency and accuracy of the method
   are demonstrated via its applications to the statistical
   characterization of voltages in shielded/unshielded microwave amplifiers
   and magnetic fields induced on car tire pressure sensors.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize laser-generated focused ultrasound (LGFU) to create targeted
   mechanical disturbance on a few cells. The LGFU is transmitted through
   an optoacoustic lens that converts laser pulses into focused ultrasound.
   The tight focusing (<100 mu m) and high peak pressure of the LGFU
   produces cavitational disturbances at a localized spot with
   micro-jetting and secondary shock-waves arising from micro-bubble
   collapse. We demonstrate that LGFU can be used as a non-contact,
   non-ionizing, high-precision tool to selectively detach a single cell
   from its culture substrate. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of
   biomolecule delivery in a small population of cells targeted by LGFU at
   pressure amplitudes below and above the cavitation threshold. We
   experimentally confirm that cavitational disruption is required for
   delivery of propidium iodide, a membrane-impermeable nucleic
   acid-binding dye, into cells. ((c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Title = {{Rounding Frequency and Hospital Length of Stay for Children With
   Respiratory Illnesses: A Simulation Study}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDPatient discharge from the hospital is linked to physician-led
   rounds, whereas discharge from the emergency department (ED) is more
   fluid. The relationship between rounding and length of stay (LOS) has
   not been quantitatively described.
   OBJECTIVESTo describe the arrival and discharge patterns in the ED and
   inpatient settings for children with respiratory illnesses and to
   explore how the timing and frequency of rounding could impact LOS.
   DESIGN/SETTINGRetrospective administrative data analyses of visits for
   respiratory illnesses to a tertiary care pediatric ED from May 2007 to
   April 2010.
   METHODSED visits for common respiratory conditions were selected based
   on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
   Modification codes, excluding complex comorbid conditions, severe
   illness, and intensive care unit admission. Discharge time was plotted
   against arrival time for the ED and inpatient unit. LOS was calculated.
   A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to explore the influence of
   additional rounds on inpatient LOS.
   RESULTSOf the 5503 included visits, 1285 (23.4\%) resulted in inpatient
   care. Discharges from the ED typically occurred 2 to 5 hours after
   arrival, whereas most inpatient discharges occurred between 11 am and 6
   pm regardless of admission time. Simulating 1 additional rounding
   session decreased predicted inpatient LOS by approximately 5 hours.
   CONCLUSIONSIn contrast to ED discharges that occurred around the clock,
   inpatient discharges for children with respiratory illnesses were
   concentrated during afternoon hours. Increasing rounding frequency may
   improve hospital efficiency but could result in unintended consequences
   such as fewer opportunities for patient education. Journal of Hospital

Abstract = {{In order to realize the manufacturing resource sharing and optimal
   allocation, many advanced manufacturing modes and technologies have been
   proposed and researched, but few works have been emphasized on resource
   service and capability transaction and scheduling management. With these
   conditions, in this article, the concept of cloud manufacturing mode is
   first briefly introduced, and a general cloud manufacturing resource
   service scheduling model is established. Then, the comprehensive utility
   models, which consider energy consumption, cost, and risk for the three
   sides (i.e. provider, consumer, and operator), are established in the
   resource service scheduling process in cloud manufacturing system. Four
   kinds of resource service scheduling modes, which are provider centered,
   consumer centered, operator centered, and system centered, are studied.
   These modes are based on the utility models that are investigated, as
   well as the system-centered cooperative scheduling method that is
   designed with risk-sharing strategy. The experimental results show that
   the system-centered scheduling method has the highest potential for
   realizing the aim of cloud manufacturing, and the system-centered
   cooperative scheduling method is rational to obtain the higher maximal
   utilities of the whole system and the three key users at the same time.
   It promotes the higher efficiency and utility, a higher rate of sharing,
   green and on-demand use of decentralized manufacturing resources and
   capability services in cloud manufacturing systems.}},

Abstract = {{NO oxidation rates over La1-xSrxCoO3 (x = 0-0.3) perovskite catalysts
   are reported as a function of Sr doping in the absence and presence of
   NO2 in the feed. Sr substitution is found to increase the rate of
   oxidation and to diminish the inhibitory influence of NO2. Temperature
   programmed desorption and isotopic exchange (TPIE) experiments were used
   to identify surface species and oxygen exchange processes expected to
   correlate with NO oxidation activity. Oxygen exchange in the LaCoO3
   perovskites occurred primarily through a heteroexchange process that was
   enhanced by doping with Sr. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   were used to further investigate the oxygen exchange processes on (100)
   facets of undoped and doped LaCoO3. Vacancy formation is predicted to be
   more facile on CoO2-terminated than LaO-terminated surfaces. The Sr
   dopant segregates to the LaO-terminated surface and diminishes oxygen
   bonding consistent with the TPIE results. The results suggest a model in
   which multiple oxygen species contribute to low- and high-temperature
   oxygen exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse RF passive devices and microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS)
   can be monolithically integrated on a high-resistivity silicon (HR-Si)
   substrate. However, parasitic surface conduction (PSC) at the interface
   of HR-Si and a silicon dioxide passivation layer reduces the effective
   substrate resistivity, which in turn results in deterioration of the
   device quality factor and non-linearity. Trap-rich HR-Si has been
   proposed as a low substrate loss alternative, eliminating the problems
   associated with PSC. However, the full potential of trap-rich HR-Si as a
   common platform for implementing MEMS passives is not fully explored. In
   this letter, we evaluate the effectiveness of the trap-rich layer by
   comparing the frequency response of a number of RF passive devices
   fabricated on standard and trap-rich HR-Si substrates. In addition, we
   suggest an electromagnetic (EM) simulation setup that can be used to
   efficiently and accurately simulate the device performance.}},

Abstract = {{In 2013 the Laurentian Great Lakes are at historically low levels; but
   they will undoubtedly rise again as they always have in an ongoing
   pattern of seasonal, annual and decadal fluctuations. Those
   fluctuations, coupled with other physical dynamics unique to the Great
   Lakes system, will continue to shift shorelines lake-ward and land-ward
   dramatically over time, perhaps more so because of increased storminess
   from climate change. These shifting shores implicate legal doctrines
   that attempt to balance public interests and private property rights at
   the shore, and they complicate the Great Lakes states' efforts to
   effectively and fairly manage their Great Lakes shorelands. One
   challenge comes from using an elevation-based standard to mark ordinary
   high water, a method that is difficult conceptually to administer and
   that yields multiple marks over time. We describe briefly Great Lakes
   shoreline dynamics and the application of state Public Trust Doctrines
   to those shorelines, and we discuss in detail recent litigation in
   Michigan regarding use of an elevation-based standard to mark ordinary
   high water, illustrating the inherent problems with that standard. We
   conclude that the elevation-based standard should be abandoned, or if
   not abandoned applied in a manner to adequately safeguard public trust
   shorelands. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{We report the results of a new 60 ks Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced
   CCD Imaging Spectrometer S-array (ACIS-S) observation of the reddened,
   radio-selected, highly polarized `FeLoBAL' quasar FIRST J1556+3517. We
   investigated a number of models of varied sophistication to fit the
   531-photon spectrum. These models ranged from simple power laws to power
   laws absorbed by hydrogen gas in differing ionization states and degrees
   of partial covering. Preferred fits indicate that the intrinsic X-ray
   flux is consistent with that expected for quasars of similarly high
   luminosity, i.e. an intrinsic, dereddened and unabsorbed optical to
   X-ray spectral index of -1.7. We cannot tightly constrain the intrinsic
   X-ray power-law slope, but find indications that it is flat (photon
   index Gamma = 1.7 or flatter at a > 99 per cent confidence for a neutral
   hydrogen absorber model). Absorption is present, with a column density a
   few times 10(23) cm(-2), with both partially ionized models and
   partially covering neutral hydrogen models providing good fits. We
   present several lines of argument that suggest the fraction of X-ray
   emissions associated with the radio jet is not large. We combine our
   Chandra data with observations from the literature to construct the
   spectral energy distribution of FIRST J1556+3517 from radio to X-ray
   energies. We make corrections for Doppler beaming for the pole-on radio
   jet, optical dust reddening and X-ray absorption, in order to recover a
   probable intrinsic spectrum. The quasar FIRST J1556+3517 seems to be an
   intrinsically normal radio-quiet quasar with a reddened optical/UV
   spectrum, a Doppler-boosted but intrinsically weak radio jet and an
   X-ray absorber not dissimilar from that of other broad absorption line
   quasars.}},

Abstract = {{Research utilizing visual event-related brain potentials (ERPs) has
   demonstrated that reduced P300 amplitude and prolonged latency may
   qualify as a biological marker (biomarker) for schizophrenia (SZ). We
   examined P300 characteristics in response inhibition among three
   putatively distinct psychopathology groups including schizophrenia (SZ),
   bipolar I disorder (BD) and schizoaffective disorder (SA) in comparison
   with healthy controls (CT) to determine their electrophysiological
   distinctiveness. In two separate studies, deficits in response
   inhibition indexed by the P300 component were investigated using a
   lateralized Go/NoGo task. We hypothesized that deficits in response
   inhibition would be present and distinctive among the groups. In both
   studies, SZ showed response inhibition deficits as measured by P300 when
   stimuli were presented to the right visual field. In Study 2, delayed
   cognitive stimulus evaluation was observed in BD as indexed by prolonged
   P300 latency for NoGo trials. Six selected NoGo P300 variables out of
   thirty six NoGo P300 variables (18 amplitude, 18 latency) correctly
   classified SZ (79\%), SA (64\%) in Study 1 and seven variables selected
   in Study 2 classified CT (80\%), and SZ (61\%), BD (67\%) and CT (68\%)
   with the accuracy higher than chance level (33\%). The findings suggest
   that distinct P300 features in response inhibition may be biomarkers
   with the capacity to distinguish BD and SZ, although SA was not dearly
   distinguishable from SZ and CT. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The temporal evolution of the lattice parameters and lattice misfit of
   an advanced polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy have been studied in
   situ during an ageing heat treatment using synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction. During ageing, the gamma and gamma' lattice parameters were
   both observed to decrease, a trend that cannot be attributed to a loss
   of coherency alone. Phase-extracted gamma' replicated this behaviour.
   Atom probe tomography was used to measure the compositional changes
   between the start and end of the ageing heat treatment. Using these
   data, a thermodynamic assessment was made using the software ThermoCalc
   of the structural change across the interface between gamma and gamma'.
   Subsequently, the unconstrained lattice parameters were estimated and
   were shown to be in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction
   measurements. Thus, the observed anomalous lattice misfit behaviour was
   concluded to be dominated by elemental exchange between the gamma and
   gamma' phases during ageing. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The problem of placing embeds into existing reinforced concrete
   structures without damaging reinforcement bars is an industry-wide
   challenge for the construction industry. This paper presents research
   that investigated real-time monitoring approaches for hazardous
   engineering processes. A conceptual solution for processing and
   incorporating point cloud data obtained from 3D imaging technologies(1)
   into the drilling process in was developed. The 3D imaging technologies
   were used to map the locations of rebar within a section of a railway
   bridge deck. Once the point clouds were processed, zones which are safe
   for drilling were automatically detected and saved as a Building
   Information Model (BIM). The BIM was used to provide real-time feedback
   to the drill operator about whether it is safe to continue drilling
   based on the position and orientation of the drill. The results showed
   the feasibility of real-time feedback for improving the safety,
   productivity, and quality of engineering processes by helping avoid the
   time and cost of rework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) with

   selecting destinations of a simulated vehicle in a virtual scene. To
   improve the usability of the selection system, we analyze the effects of
   the number of electroencephalogram (EEG) rounds on system performance.
   Experimental results from eight participants show that the BCI-based
   model of destination selection can be built with EEG data from eight
   channels, and participants can use this BCI to select a desired
   destination with an accuracy value of 93.6\% +/- 1.6\% (mean value with
   standard error) in about 12 s of selection time. This paper lays a
   foundation for developing vehicles that use a BCI to select a desired
   destination from a list of predefined destinations and then use an
   autonomous navigation system to reach the desired destination.}},

Abstract = {{Two separate transmitarrays that operate at 77 GHz are designed and
   fabricated. The first transmitarray acts as a quarter-wave plate that
   transforms a linearly polarized incident wave into a circularly
   polarized transmitted wave. The second transmitarray acts as both a
   quarter-wave plate and a beam refracting surface to provide polarization
   and wavefront control. When the second transmittarray is illuminated
   with a normally incident, linearly polarized beam, the transmitted field
   is efficiently refracted to 45 degrees, and the polarization is
   converted to circular. The half-power bandwidth was measured to be 17\%,
   and the axial ratio of the transmitted field remained below 2.5 dB over
   the entire bandwidth. Both designs have a subwavelength thickness of 0.4
   mm (lambda(o)/9.7). The developed structures are fabricated with
   low-cost printed-circuit-board processes on flexible substrates. The
   transmitarrays are realized by cascading three patterned metallic
   surfaces (sheet admittances) to achieve complete phase control, while
   maintaining high transmission. Polarization conversion is accomplished
   with anisotropic sheets that independently control the field polarized
   along the two orthogonal axes. The structures are analyzed with both
   circuit-and fields-based approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new and simple microfabrication process for
   creating various 3-D microstructures with high-aspect ratios
   (height/radius > 1). The key feature of this process is the use of a
   blow torch, which provides very intense localized heat for a short
   amount of time (<10 s). The flame temperature can be up to 2500 degrees
   C for a propane-oxygen torch, above the melting temperatures of many
   high-Q materials. We demonstrate the fabrication of hemispherical and
   half-toroid (birdbath) shells from 100-mu m-thick fused silica
   substrates. The structures have an rms surface roughness of 5.3
   angstrom, which is crucial for achieving both high mechanical and
   optical Q. We create microbirdbath resonators by batch-level releasing
   the birdbath shells. We verify the resonance mode shapes of the
   degenerate n = 2 wineglass modes using laser vibrometry and measure the
   frequency and Q of these modes using laser vibrometry and a capacitive
   measurement method. We demonstrate one of the best mechanical Q and
   smallest frequency split between the n = 2 wineglass modes among
   existing micromechanical resonators. The birdbath resonator is promising
   for emerging applications such as the microrate-integrating gyroscope.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a new batch-mode fabrication process that combines
   glass and silicon into a single wafer. The technique requires only a
   single mask to lithographically define recesses in silicon using deep
   reactive ion etching. The patterned silicon wafer is anodically bonded
   to a glass wafer, and a high-temperature step reflows the glass into
   this silicon mold. The reflowed wafer stack is then planarized and
   thinned. Through-glass vias can be realized in this manner while
   additional process-flow modifications enable features such as molded
   cavities in the glass. A capacitive pressure sensor and a hermetically
   sealed resonator are described to illustrate applications of the
   process. Finally, a three dimensional packaging technique for
   implantable biomedical microsystems is shown by vertically stacking
   glass-in-silicon wafers.}},

Title = {{High gamma power in ECoG reflects cortical electrical stimulation
   effects on unit activity in layers V/VI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) has been used
   extensively in experimental neuroscience to modulate neuronal or
   behavioral activity, which has led this technique to be considered in
   neurorehabilitation. Because the cortex and the surrounding anatomy have
   irregular geometries as well as inhomogeneous and anisotropic electrical
   properties, the mechanism by which CES has therapeutic effects is poorly
   understood. Therapeutic effects of CES can be improved by optimizing the
   stimulation parameters based on the effects of various stimulation
   parameters on target brain regions. Approach. In this study we have
   compared the effects of CES pulse polarity, frequency, and amplitude on
   unit activity recorded from rat primary motor cortex with the effects on
   the corresponding local field potentials (LFP), and electrocorticograms
   (ECoG). CES was applied at the surface of the cortex and the unit
   activity and LFPs were recorded using a penetrating electrode array,
   which was implanted below the stimulation site. ECoGs were recorded from
   the vicinity of the stimulation site. Main results. Time-frequency
   analysis of LFPs following CES showed correlation of gamma frequencies
   with unit activity response in all layers. More importantly, high gamma
   power of ECoG signals only correlated with the unit activity in lower
   layers (V-VI) following CES. Time-frequency correlations, which were
   found between LFPs, ECoGs and unit activity, were frequency-and
   amplitude-dependent. Significance. The signature of the neural activity
   observed in LFP and ECoG signals provides a better understanding of the
   effects of stimulation on network activity, representative of large
   numbers of neurons responding to stimulation. These results demonstrate
   that the neurorehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications of CES
   targeting layered cortex can be further improved by using field
   potential recordings as surrogates to unit activity aimed at optimizing
   stimulation efficacy. Likewise, the signatures of unit activity observed
   as changes in high gamma power in ECoGs suggest that future cortical
   stimulation studies could rely on less invasive feedback schemes that
   incorporate surface stimulation with ECoG reporting of stimulation
   efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{An overview of past and recent developments on the subject of seismic
   earth pressures on yielding, gravity-type walls, retaining cohesionless
   backfill, is first presented, focusing on available data on the issue of
   phase difference that develops between the peak values of wall inertia
   and seismic earth thrust increment. The results of a FEM parametric
   study are next presented regarding the dependence on the resulting
   dynamic earth thrust reduction - acting on the time of peak wall inertia
   - on backfill rigidity, wall height, and shaking characteristics. The
   reliability of the numerical analyses was verified by modeling
   centrifuge tests reported by Nakamura {[}24] and successfully comparing
   measured vs. computed behavior. The results of the parametric analyses
   indicate that the seismic active earth thrust, acting on the wall at the
   time of maximum wall inertia, is significantly reduced (compared to its
   peak value) with increasing shaking intensity of backfill, increasing
   wall displacements, increasing wall height, and decreasing backfill
   rigidity. No systematic dependence on the ratio of input motion
   frequency to the natural frequency of the backfill (f/f(1)) was
   observed. The above findings: (I) verify earlier experimental and
   numerical results, (2) explain the reported lack of damage to retaining
   walls under strong ground shaking, and (3) indicate the need for
   revising the pertinent provisions of current seismic codes. Graphs
   summarizing the results of the numerical analyses are presented which
   may be used as a guide for selecting the magnitude of seismic active
   earth thrust that needs to be taken into account in the design of the
   examined type of earth retaining walls. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Microtubules (MTs) are intrinsic components of the cytoskeleton, and
   their mechanical properties are key for many of their functions in the
   cell. Here we present a coarse-grained model of a MT where we can
   explicitly control the mechanical properties and thus can explore the
   relative contributions of geometry and anisotropy. We begin with the
   isotropic mechanics case and then investigate various forms of
   anisotropic mechanics where we systematically vary the axial,
   circumferential and shear moduli. We find that the axial Young's modulus
   is always the dominant factor in determining the persistence length, but
   the shear modulus is also a strong contributing factor for MTs less than
   a few microns in length. In the case of anisotropic mechanics, we find
   that MTs of different lengths have consistent mechanical properties, but
   the persistence length only depends on the MT segment length that is
   considered and not the overall length of the MT. Further, for MTs more
   than a few microns in length, anisotropic effects are only apparent in
   the higher-order fluctuations and thus would be difficult to detect in
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize optical tweezers to examine displacements produced by small

   dynein, we find that axonemal dynein is not processive, and the duration
   of individual force-generating interactions with a microtubule are
   longer than predicted from the velocity of movements generated by large
   ensembles of motors. These findings suggest that tension is required for
   rapid release of dynein following a power stroke and may explain how
   axonemal dynein is adapted to work in arrays within an axoneme, where
   cyclical bending patterns require motors to function over a range of
   sliding velocities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fully-integrated IR-UWB radio, designed to operate
   within the limits of mm-scale micro-battery for cubic-mm sensor nodes.
   It includes an RF front-end, battery current limiter, baseband modem
   with I2C interface, and temperature-compensated relaxation oscillator
   for frequency generation without a crystal. The peak current draw from a
   modern mm-scale battery must be < 100 mu A, below a radio's active power
   consumption. Thus, duty-cycling the radio only at the packet level is
   not an option, and so this IR-UWB radio includes an integrated modem
   which duty-cycles the RF front-end at the bit-level. A current limiter
   protects the battery from over-current conditions, and the radio
   operates from on-chip storage capacitance that is recharged between
   bits. The radio operates at 30 kb/s with a center frequency of 9.8 GHz.
   It consumes 291 mu W average power in transmit mode while broadcasting
   0.1 dBm pulses, and 306 mu W in receive mode with a sensitivity of -77
   dBm. The area of the radio is 2.73 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that polar codes, with their original kernel, achieve the
   symmetric capacity of discrete memoryless channels with arbitrary input
   alphabet sizes. It is shown that in general, channel polarization
   happens in several, rather than only two levels so that the synthesized
   channels are either useless, perfect or ``partially perfect.{''} Any
   subset of the channel input alphabet which is closed under addition
   induces a coset partition of the alphabet through its shifts. For any
   such partition of the input alphabet, there exists a corresponding
   partially perfect channel whose outputs uniquely determine the coset to
   which the channel input belongs. By a slight modification of the
   encoding and decoding rules, it is shown that perfect transmission of
   certain information symbols over partially perfect channels is possible.
   Our result is general regarding both the cardinality and the algebraic
   structure of the channel input alphabet; i.e., we show that for any
   channel input alphabet size and any Abelian group structure on the
   alphabet, polar codes are optimal. Due to the modifications, we make to
   the encoding rule of polar codes, the constructed codes fall into a
   larger class of structured codes called nested group codes.}},

Abstract = {{In modern production systems, it is critical to perform maintenance,
   calibration, installation, and upgrade tasks during planned downtime.
   Otherwise, the systems become unreliable and new product introductions
   are delayed. For reasons of safety, testing, and access, task
   performance often requires the vicinity of impacted equipment to be left
   in a specific end state when production halts. Therefore, planning the
   shutdown of a production system to balance production goals against
   enabling non-production tasks yields a challenging optimization problem.
   This article proposes a mathematical formulation of this problem and a
   dynamic programming approach that efficiently finds optimal shutdown
   policies for deterministic serial production lines. An event-triggered
   re-optimization procedure that is based on the proposed deterministic
   dynamic programming approach is also introduced for handling
   uncertainties in the production line for the stochastic case. It is
   demonstrated numerically that in these cases with random breakdowns and
   repairs, the re-optimization procedure is efficient and even obtains
   results that are optimal or nearly optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic welding is a solid-state bond created using ultrasonic
   energy. It has been used in the semiconductor industry for several
   decades, and more recently, in the automotive industry such as for
   lithium-ion battery welding. Although there existed numerical
   simulations for ultrasonic welding, the models were limited to two-layer
   and like materials stackups. In this study, finite element theories are
   introduced and simulation procedure is established for multiple sheets
   and dissimilar metal ultrasonic welding. The procedures require both
   ABAQUS/Standard and ABAQUS/Explicit to simulate the coupled
   mechanical-thermal phenomena over the entire weld duration with moderate
   computational cost. The procedure is verified and used to simulate
   selected specific cases involving multiple sheets and dissimilar
   materials, i.e., copper and aluminum. The simulation procedure
   demonstrates its capability to predict welding energy, distortion, and
   temperature distribution of the workpieces. Case studies of ultrasonic
   welding simulations for multiple layers of lithium-ion battery tabs are
   presented. The prediction leads to several innovative ultrasonic welding
   process designs for improved welding quality.}},

Abstract = {{Different components of a structure can have different damping
   characteristics, and that affects the dynamic response of the overall
   system. Herein, we assume that damping has a simple form only at a
   component level. That leads to a complex damping model at a system
   level. A new method is introduced which identifies the component damping
   of a structure. This method is applied to mistuned blisks in regions of
   low and high modal density. The method incorporates reduced-order
   models, and remains accurate in the presence of measurement noise.
   Results are shown for a mistuned blisk with varying levels of
   measurement noise. The accuracy of damping identification is observed
   through a forced response prediction and amplification factor study.
   Also, a discussion on the effects of damping and stiffness mistuning on
   the maximum response is presented. Some differences between component
   and modal damping are highlighted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Based on cross fourth-order cumulants, a total least square ESPRIT
   approach to jointly estimating harmonic parameters in hybrid colored
   noises is presented, which is applied to investigate the harmonic
   retrieval of regenerative machining chatter responses. Taking into
   consideration the multiple-regenerative effect, the delayed machining
   dynamics under the excitation of stochastic noises is modeled, and a
   recursive algorithm of the solution to the delayed machining dynamics is
   proposed. The harmonic parameter estimation of regenerative chatter
   responses is detailed, which include the harmonic frequencies, cross
   powers, and phase shifts between successive cuts. The results
   demonstrate that the presented harmonic parameter estimation approach
   can eliminate the hybrid colored noises, retrieve the harmonic
   parameters with excellent estimation performance, and extract the
   evolution features of regenerative machining chatter. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Distance-preserving rigidity penalty on deformable image registration of
   multiple skeletal components in the neck}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aims at developing and testing a novel rigidity
   penalty suitable for the deformable registration of tightly located
   skeletal components in the head and neck from planning computed
   tomography (CT) and daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans of patients
   undergoing radiotherapy.
   Methods: The proposed rigidity penalty is designed to preserve
   intervoxel distances within each bony structure. This penalty was tested
   in the intensity-based B-spline deformable registration of five cervical
   vertebral bodies (C1-C5). The displacement vector fields (DVFs) from the
   registrations were compared to the DVFs generated by using rigid body
   motions of the cervical vertebrae, measured by the surface registration
   of vertebrae delineated on CT and CBCT images. Twenty five pairs of
   planning CT (reference) and treatment CBCTs (target) from five patients
   were aligned without and with the penalty. An existing penalty based on
   the orthonormality of the deformation gradient tensor was also tested
   and the effects of the penalties compared.
   Results: The mean magnitude of the maximum registration error with the
   proposed distance-preserving penalty was (0.86, 1.12, 1.33) mm compared
   to (2.11, 2.49, 2.46) without penalty and (1.53, 1.64, 1.64) with the
   existing orthonormality-based penalty. The improvement in the accuracy
   of the deformable image registration was also verified by comparing the
   Procrustes distance between the DVFs. With the proposed penalty, the
   average distance was 0.11 (sigma 0.03 mm) which is smaller than 0.53
   (0.1 mm) without penalty and 0.28 (0.04 mm) with the
   orthonormality-based penalty.
   Conclusions: The accuracy of aligning multiple bony elements was
   improved by using the proposed distance-preserving rigidity penalty. The
   voxel-based statistical analysis of the registration error shows that
   the proposed penalty improved the integrity of the DVFs within the
   vertebral bodies. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nature eloquently utilizes hierarchical structures to form the world
   around us. Applying the hierarchical architecture paradigm to smart
   materials can provide a basis for a new genre of actuators which produce
   complex actuation motions. One promising example of cellular
   architecture-active knits-provides complex three-dimensional distributed
   actuation motions with expanded operational performance through a
   hierarchically organized structure. The hierarchical structure arranges
   a single fiber of active material, such as shape memory alloys (SMAs),
   into a cellular network of interlacing adjacent loops according to a
   knitting grid. This paper defines a four-level hierarchical
   classification of knit structures: the basic knit loop, knit patterns,
   grid patterns, and restructured grids. Each level of the hierarchy
   provides increased architectural complexity, resulting in expanded
   kinematic actuation motions of active knits. The range of kinematic
   actuation motions are displayed through experimental examples of
   different SMA active knits. The results from this paper illustrate and
   classify the ways in which each level of the hierarchical knit
   architecture leverages the performance of the base smart material to
   generate unique actuation motions, providing necessary insight to best
   exploit this new actuation paradigm.}},

Title = {{Bistable energy harvesting enhancement with an auxiliary linear
   oscillator}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent work has indicated that linear vibrational energy harvesters with
   an appended degree-of-freedom (DOF) may be advantageous for introducing
   new dynamic forms to extend the operational bandwidth. Given the
   additional interest in bistable harvester designs, which exhibit a
   propitious snap through effect from one stable state to the other, it is
   a logical extension to explore the influence of an added DOF to a
   bistable system. However, bistable snap through is not a resonant
   phenomenon, which tempers the presumption that the dynamics induced by
   an additional DOF on bistable designs would inherently be beneficial as
   for linear systems. This paper presents two analytical formulations to
   assess the fundamental and superharmonic steady-state dynamics of an
   excited bistable energy harvester to which is attached an auxiliary
   linear oscillator. From an energy harvesting perspective, the model
   predicts that the additional linear DOF uniformly amplifies the bistable
   harvester response magnitude and generated power for excitation
   frequencies less than the attachment's resonance while improved power
   density spans a bandwidth below this frequency. Analyses predict
   bandwidths having co-existent responses composed of a unique proportion
   of fundamental and superharmonic dynamics. Experiments validate key
   analytical predictions and observe the ability for the coupled system to
   develop an advantageous multi-harmonic interwell response when the
   initial conditions are insufficient for continuous high-energy orbit at
   the excitation frequency. Overall, the addition of an auxiliary linear
   oscillator to a bistable harvester is found to be an effective means of
   enhancing the energy harvesting performance and robustness.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a reliable method for producing accurate
   displacement time histories for wave propagation in laminated plates
   using the global matrix method. The existence of inward and outward
   propagating waves in the general solution is highlighted while examining
   the axisymmetric case of a circular actuator on an aluminum plate.
   Problems with previous attempts to isolate the outward wave for
   anisotropic laminates are shown. The updated method develops a
   correction signal that can be added to the original time history
   solution to cancel the inward wave and leave only the outward
   propagating wave. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the new
   method for circular and square actuators bonded to the surface of
   isotropic laminates, and these results are compared with exact
   solutions. Results for circular actuators on cross-ply laminates are
   also presented and compared with experimental results, showing the
   ability of the new method to successfully capture the displacement time
   histories for composite laminates.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of hydrogels have been explored as 3D culture platforms
   and for applications in tissue engineering. Hydrogels formed from
   natural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins readily support the
   formation of vasculature in vitro, but only a handful of hydrogels
   composed of synthetic materials have shown anything comparable. This
   relative lack of synthetic material options has hindered efforts to
   better understand how ECM cues direct vascularization. We developed a
   biosynthetic hydrogel consisting of polyethylene glycol diacrylamide
   conjugated to macromolecular type-I collagen. Through their
   acrylamide-based crosslinks, these materials allow for independent
   control of physical properties and bulk ligand concentration. These
   hydrogels exhibited hydrolytic stability, but the collagen component
   retained its susceptibility to enzymatic remodeling. Photoencapsulation
   of endothelial cells and fibroblasts within this hydrogel material and
   their subsequent co-culture led to the formation of capillary
   vessel-like networks with well-defined hollow lumens. Capillary
   formation was prevented by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
   activity, recapitulating the MMP-dependence of vascularization observed
   in natural hydrogels. These findings validate the utility of this
   material platform to decipher how the ECM regulates capillary
   morphogenesis and to support the formation of vascularized tissue
   constructs for potential applications in regenerative medicine. (C) 2013

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{9623-9631}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work describes the use of aqueous two-phase systems to print
   cell-containing contractile collagen microdroplets. The fully aqueous
   conditions enable convenient formation of sub-microliter `microgels'
   that are much smaller than otherwise possible to fabricate while
   maintaining high cell viability. The produced microgels contract over
   several days, mimicking the behavior of macroscale contraction assays,
   which have been valued as an important biological readout for over three
   decades. Use of microgels not only reduces reagent consumption and
   increases throughput of the assay, but also improves transport of
   molecules into and out of the collagen matrix, thereby enabling
   efficient and more precise studies of timed stimulation profiles.
   Utility of the technology is demonstrated by analyzing the effects of
   TGF-beta 1 on gel contraction, and we demonstrate that brief `burst'
   stimulation profiles in microgels prompt contraction of the matrix, a

Abstract = {{Dynamic biochemical signal control is important in in vitro cell
   studies. This work analyzes the transportation of dynamic biochemical
   signals in steady and mixing flow in a shallow, Y-shaped microfluidic
   channel. The characteristics of transportation of different signals are
   investigated, and the combined effect of transverse diffusion and
   longitudinal dispersion is studied. A method is presented to control the
   widths of two steady flows in the mixing channel from two inlets. The
   transfer function and the cutoff frequency of the mixing channel as a
   transmission system are presented by analytically solving the governing
   equations for the time-dependent Taylor-Aris dispersion and molecular
   diffusion. The amplitude and phase spectra show that the mixing Y-shaped
   microfluidic channel acts as a low-pass filter due to the longitudinal
   dispersion. With transverse molecular diffusion, the magnitudes of the
   output dynamic signal are reduced compared to those without transverse
   molecular diffusion. The inverse problem of signal transportation for
   signal control is also solved and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow fiber artificial lungs are increasingly being used for long-term
   applications. However, clot formation limits their use to 1-2 weeks.
   This study investigated the effect of nitric oxide generating (NOgen)
   hollow fibers on artificial lung thrombogenicity. Silicone hollow fibers
   were fabricated to incorporate 50 nm copper particles as a catalyst for
   NO generation from the blood. Fibers with and without (control) these
   particles were incorporated into artificial lungs with a 0.1 m(2)
   surface area and inserted in circuits coated tip-to-tip with the NOgen
   material. Circuits (N = 5/each) were attached to rabbits in a pumpless,
   arterio-venous configuration and run for 4 h at an activated clotting
   time of 350-400 s. Three control circuits clotted completely, while none
   of the NOgen circuits failed. Accordingly, blood flows were
   significantly higher in the NOgen group (95.9 +/- 11.7, p < 0.01)
   compared to the controls (35.2 +/- 19.7; mL/min), and resistance was
   significantly higher in the control group after 4 h (15.38 +/- 9.65, p <
   0.001) than in NOgen (0.09 +/- 0.03; mmHg/mL/min). On the other hand,
   platelet counts and plasma fibrinogen concentration expressed as percent
   of baseline in control group (63.7 +/- 5.7\%, 77.2 +/- 5.6\%; p < 0.05)
   were greater than those in the NOgen group (60.4 +/- 5.1\%, 63.2 +/-
   3.7\%). Plasma copper levels in the NOgen group were 2.8 times baseline
   at 4 h (132.8 +/- 4.5 g/dL) and unchanged in the controls. This study
   demonstrates that NO generating gas exchange fibers could be a
   potentially effective way to control coagulation inside artificial
   lungs. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 101A:

Abstract = {{Histotripsy has shown promise in non-invasive cardiac therapy for
   neonatal and fetal applications. However, for cardiac applications in
   general, and especially in the adult heart, cardiac and respiratory
   motion may affect treatment accuracy and efficacy. In this article, we
   describe a histotripsy-mediated cardiac therapy system integrated with a
   fast motion tracking algorithm and treatment monitoring using ultrasound
   imaging. Motion tracking is performed by diamond search block matching
   in real-time ultrasound images using a reference image of the moving
   target, refined by Kalman filtering. As proof of feasibility, this
   algorithm was configured to track 2-D target motion and then
   electronically adjust the focus of a 1-MHz annular therapy array to
   correct for axial motion. This integrated motion tracking system is
   capable of sub-millimeter accuracy for displacements of 0-15 mm and
   velocities of 0-80 mm/s, with a maximum error less than 3 mm. Tissue
   phantom tests indicated that treatment efficiency and lesion size using
   motion tracking over displacements of 0-15 mm and velocities of 0-42
   mm/s are comparable to those achieved when treating stationary targets.
   In vivo validation was conducted in an open-chest canine model, where
   the system provided 24 min of motion-corrected histotripsy therapy in
   the live beating heart, generating a targeted lesion on the atrial
   septum. Based on this proof of feasibility and the natural extension of
   these techniques to three dimensions, we anticipate a full motion
   correction system would be feasible and beneficial for non-invasive
   cardiac therapy. (E-mail: zhenx@umich.edu) (C) 2013 World Federation for

Abstract = {{Carbon-coated LiFePO4 (C-LiFePO4) nanocomposites particles have been
   scale-up synthesized by a direct and economic solid-state reaction
   process. A variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, HRTEM,
   and HAADF), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are applied to
   investigate particles morphologies and phase structures on the nanometer
   scale. Single crystal and an olivine structure of the rough spherical
   LiFePO4 are confirmed by XRD pattern, HRTEM images and SAED patterns.
   The details of the coating including carbon content, thickness, and
   structure are particularly studied by energy filtered EF-TEM imaging,
   electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The size distribution is
   estimated at 50-200 nm from XRD analysis and TEM images. An average
   4.2\% carbon content is measured and a homogenous 3 nm carbon thick
   layer on the particles surfaces is clearly revealed by HRTEM and EF-TEM
   imaging. An amorphous carbon structure was further confirmed by both
   EELS and XPS valence analysis. The characteristics of these
   nanostructures and the amorphous carbon-coating has been demonstrated to
   improve the electronic conductivity and cell performance by reducing the
   path of both electron transfer and lithium ions diffusion while the
   C-LiFePO4 cathode is used in the battery cell. Electrochemical
   performance has been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and
   galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, and AC impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). The C-LiFePO4 particles exhibited improved electric conductivity,
   good rate capability, capacity retention, and cycling performance and
   superior discharge capacity with delivery of almost 99\% of its
   theoretical discharge capacity of 168 mAh/g at a C/10 rate with a high
   coulomb efficiency. The CV profiles show that lithium ions and electrons
   are quite active during two-phase kinetic reaction, which could be
   attributed to the smaller particles and carbon-coating layer that
   facilitated extraction and insertion of lithium ions and electrons
   transfers, thereby is beneficial to the kinetic behavior and improving
   electrochemical performance during charge-discharge processes. This
   investigation showed that the low cost and direct solid-state
   manufacturing process can produce the active LiFePO4 cathode for the

Abstract = {{Therapeutic stimulation of angiogenesis to re-establish blood flow in
   ischemic tissues offers great promise as a treatment for patients
   suffering from cardiovascular disease or trauma. Since angiogenesis is a
   complex, multi-step process, different signals may need to be delivered
   at appropriate times in order to promote a robust and mature
   vasculature. The effects of temporally regulated presentation of
   pro-angiogenic and pro-maturation factors were investigated in vitro and
   in vivo in this study. Pro-angiogenic factors vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) cooperatively promoted
   endothelial sprouting and pericyte detachment in a three-dimensional in
   vitro EC-pericyte co-culture model. Pro-maturation factors
   platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF) and angiopoietin 1 (Ang1)
   inhibited the early stages of VEGF- and Ang2-mediated angiogenesis if
   present simultaneously with VEGF and Ang2, but promoted these behaviors
   if added subsequently to the pro-angiogenesis factors. VEGF and Ang2
   were also found to additively enhance microvessel density in a
   subcutaneous model of blood vessel formation, while simultaneously
   administered PDGF/Ang1 inhibited microvessel formation. However, a
   temporally controlled scaffold that released PDGF and Ang1 at a delay
   relative to VEGF/Ang2 promoted both vessel maturation and vascular
   remodeling without inhibiting sprouting angiogenesis. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of temporal control over signaling in
   promoting vascular growth, vessel maturation and vascular remodeling.
   Delivering multiple growth factors in combination and sequence could aid
   in creating tissue engineered constructs and therapies aimed at
   promoting healing after acute wounds and in chronic conditions such as
   diabetic ulcers and peripheral artery disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Although there have been many ignition studies of n-heptane-a primary
   reference fuel-few studies have provided detailed insights into the
   low-temperature chemistry of n-heptane through direct measurements of
   intermediate species formed during ignition. Such measurements provide
   understanding of reaction pathways that form toxic air pollutants and
   greenhouse gas emissions while also providing key metrics essential to
   the development of chemical kinetic mechanisms. This paper presents new
   ignition and speciation data taken at high pressure (9 atm), low
   temperatures (660-710 K), and a dilution of inert gases-to-molecular
   oxygen of 5.64 (mole basis). The detailed time-histories of 17 species,
   including large alkenes, aldehydes, carbon monoxide, and n-heptane were
   quantified using gas chromatography. A detailed chemical kinetic
   mechanism developed previously for oxidation of n-heptane reproduced
   experimentally observed ignition delay times reasonably well, but
   predicted levels of some important intermediate chemical species that
   were significantly different from measured values. Results from recent
   theoretical studies of low temperature hydrocarbon oxidation reaction
   rates were used to upgrade the chemical kinetic mechanism for n-heptane,
   leading to much better agreement between experimental and computed
   intermediate species concentrations. The implications of these results
   to many other hydrocarbon fuel oxidation mechanisms in the literature
   are discussed. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A three-stream flamelet/progress variable model is applied to the Sydney
   piloted premixed jet burner (PPJB). Using experimental data, a prior
   model evaluation is performed to assess critical modeling assumptions
   regarding the applicability of this formulation to partially-premixed
   combustion, the statistical representation of the scalar mixing, and the
   joint PDF-closure. A Dirichlet distribution, as generalization of the
   beta distribution, is introduced to represent the interaction between
   the two mixture fractions that are associated with the fuel, pilot, and
   coflow streams. Comparisons with experimental data are performed to
   demonstrate the accuracy of this closure-model. Following this prior
   model evaluation, the three-stream combustion model is applied to
   large-eddy simulation, and calculations of all four burner
   configurations, designated as PM1-\{50, 100, 150, 2001 are performed.
   Through comparisons with experimental data and equilibrium computations
   it was found that the flow-field is sensitive to the scalar inflow
   composition, and scalar boundary conditions consistent with experimental
   measurements were used for all simulations. The effect of wall
   heat-losses on the temperature and species profiles is assessed in an
   approximate way, suggesting that species profiles are unaffected by the
   heat-transfer between pilot and coflow streams. Comparisons of
   statistical results and thermo-chemical correlations show that the model
   is capable of predicting flow-field, temperature, and major species
   profiles. The simulations over-predict the fuel-consumption for PM1-150
   and PM1-200, which has also been observed in previous investigations.
   Aspects regarding model extensions to account for heat-losses and
   transient extinction/re-ignition processes are discussed. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel data-driven based approach for the
   estimation of the state of charge (SoC) of multiple types of lithium ion
   battery (LiB) cells with adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF). A
   modified second-order RC network based battery model is employed for the
   state estimation. Based on the battery model and experimental data, the
   SoC variation per mV voltage for different types of battery chemistry is
   analyzed and the parameters are identified. The AEKF algorithm is then
   employed to achieve accurate data-driven based SoC estimation, and the
   multi-parameter, closed loop feedback system is used to achieve
   robustness. The accuracy and convergence of the proposed approach is
   analyzed for different types of LiB cells, including convergence
   behavior of the model with a large initial SoC error. The results show
   that the proposed approach has good accuracy for different types of LiB
   cells, especially for C/LFP LiB cell that has a flat open circuit
   voltage (OCV) curve. The experimental results show good agreement with
   the estimation results with maximum error being less than 3\%. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Compressive response and energy absorption of a composite honeycomb is
   studied. The base material is a circular cell hexagonally packed
   thin-wall polycarbonate honeycomb. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer
   is used as the filler material. Filled honeycomb specimens are
   quasi-statically loaded under controlled displacement along an inplane
   direction. Synergistic energy absorption in the filled specimen is
   observed, as its load response is much greater than the sum of the
   individual load responses of unfilled honeycomb and the filler material,
   respectively. Analysis of the crush response is conducted using two
   methods: (a) Digital image correlation (DIC) to monitor strains and
   displacement fields in the sample during initial stages of loading and
   in the vicinity of first failure. (b) Finite element (FE) modeling of
   the filled honeycomb using the ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code,
   accounting for the hyperelastic compression response of the PDMS filler.
   The smeared crack approach (SCA) is implemented in the honeycomb to
   simulate the longitudinal tearing of the cell wall and to subsequently
   capture the localization failure in the model. Good agreement between
   experiment and analysis is reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A 3D phase field model is developed to investigate the
   electrohydrodynamic (EHD) two phase flows. The explicit finite
   difference method, enhanced by parallel computing, is employed to solve
   the coupled non-linear governing equations for the electric field, the
   fluid flow field and free surface deformation. Numerical tests indicate
   that an appropriate interpolation of densities within the interface is
   critical in ensuring numerical stability for highly stratified flows.
   The 3D phase field model compares well with the Taylor theory for the
   deformation of a single dielectric droplet in an electric field.
   Computed results show that the deformation of a leaky dielectric droplet
   in an electric field undergoes various stages before it reaches the
   final oblate shape. This is caused by the free charge relaxation near
   the fluid-fluid interface. The coalescence of four droplets in an
   electric field illustrates a truly 3D deformation behavior and a complex
   evolving fluid flow field associated with the participating droplets.
   The coalescence is a result of combined actions produced by the global
   electric force, the circulatory flows generated by the local
   electrohydrodynamic stress and the electrically-induced deformation. The
   3D phase field model is also applied in modeling of an
   electrohydrodynamic patterning process for manufacturing nanoscaled
   structures, in which complex 3D flow structures develop as the
   electrically-induced deformation evolves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Clustering with a new distance measure based on a dual-rooted tree}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{251}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel distance measure for clustering high
   dimensional data based on the hitting time of two Minimal Spanning Trees
   (MST) grown sequentially from a pair of points by Prim's algorithm. When
   the proposed measure is used in conjunction with spectral clustering, we
   obtain a powerful clustering algorithm that is able to separate
   neighboring non-convex shaped clusters and to account for local as well
   as global geometric features of the data set. Remarkably, the new
   distance measure is a true metric even if the Prim algorithm uses a
   non-metric dissimilarity measure to compute the edges of the MST. This
   metric property brings added flexibility to the proposed method. In
   particular, the method is applied to clustering non Euclidean
   quantities, such as probability distributions or spectra, using the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence as a base measure. We reduce computational
   complexity by applying consensus clustering to a small ensemble of dual
   rooted MSTs. We show that the resultant consensus spectral clustering
   with dual rooted MST is competitive with other clustering methods, both
   in terms of clustering performance and computational complexity. We
   illustrate the proposed clustering algorithm on public domain benchmark
   data for which the ground truth is known, on one hand, and on real-world
   astrophysical data on the other hand. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{27-38}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Current trends in parallel processors call for the design of efficient
   massively parallel algorithms for scientific computing. Parallel
   algorithms for Monte Carlo simulations of thermodynamic ensembles of
   particles have received little attention because of the inherent serial
   nature of the statistical sampling. In this paper, we present a
   massively parallel method that obeys detailed balance and implement it
   for a system of hard disks on the GPU. We reproduce results of serial
   high-precision Monte Carlo runs to verify the method. This is a good
   test case because the hard disk equation of state over the range where
   the liquid transforms into the solid is particularly sensitive to small
   deviations away from the balance conditions. On a Tesla K20, our GPU
   implementation executes over one billion trial moves per second, which
   is 148 times faster than on a single Intel Xeon E5540 CPU core, enables
   27 times better performance per dollar, and cuts energy usage by a
   factor of 13. With this improved performance we are able to calculate
   the equation of state for systems of up to one million hard disks. These
   large system sizes are required in order to probe the nature of the
   melting transition, which has been debated for the last forty years. In
   this paper we present the details of our computational method, and
   discuss the thermodynamics of hard disks separately in a companion
   paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To generate insights into how production of new items and
   remanufacturing and disposal of returned products can be effectively
   coordinated, we develop a model of a hybrid
   manufacturing-remanufacturing system. Formulating the model as a Markov
   decision process, we investigate the structure of the optimal policy
   that jointly controls production, remanufacturing, and disposal
   decisions. Considering the average profit maximization criterion, we
   show that the joint optimal policy can be characterized by three
   monotone switching curves. Moreover, we show that there exist
   serviceable (i.e., as-new) and remanufacturing (i.e., returned)
   inventory thresholds beyond which production cannot be optimal but
   disposal is always optimal. We also identify conditions under which
   idling and disposal actions are always optimal when the system is empty.
   Using numerical comparisons between models with and without
   remanufacturing and disposal options, we generate insights into the
   benefit of utilizing these options. To effectively coordinate
   production, remanufacturing, and disposal activities, we propose a
   simple, implementable, and yet effective heuristic policy. Our extensive
   numerical results suggest that the proposed heuristic can greatly help
   firms to effectively coordinate their production, remanufacturing, and
   disposal activities and thereby reduce their operational costs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper investigates robust H-2 and H-infinity step tracking control
   methods for networked control systems subject to random time delays
   modeled by Markov chains. To make full use of the delay information, the
   proposed two-mode dependent output feedback controller depends on both
   sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator delays. To actively
   compensate for the controller-to-actuator delays, we propose the ``send
   all, apply one{''} scheme: Sending a sequence of control signals, then
   at the actuator/plant node, applying the appropriate control signal
   according to the actual controller-to-actuator delay. Using the
   augmentation method, the resulting closed-loop system can be formulated
   as a discrete-time Markovian jump linear system. The H-2 and H-infinity
   step tracking problems are tackled by solving a set of linear matrix
   inequalities with nonconvex constraints. Both numerical simulations and
   experiments on a networked dc motor system are conducted to illustrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In the last several decades, research in the field of drug delivery has
   been challenged with the fabrication of carrier systems engineered to
   deliver therapeutics to the target site with sustained and controlled
   release kinetics. Herein, we report the fabrication of microparticles
   composed of two distinct compartments: i) one compartment containing a
   pH responsive polymer, acetal-modified dextran, and PLGA
   (polylactide-co-glycolide), and ii) one compartment composed entirely of
   PLGA. We demonstrate the complete release of dextran from the
   microparticles during a 10-hour period in an acidic pH environment and
   the complete degradation of one compartment in less than 24 h. This is
   in congruence with the stability of the same microparticles in neutral
   pH over the 24-hour period. Such microparticles can be used as pH
   responsive carrier systems for drug delivery applications where their
   cargo will only be released when the optimum pH window is reached. The
   feasibility of the microparticle system for such an application was
   confirmed by encapsulating a cancer therapeutic, irinotecan, in the
   compartment containing the acetal-modified dextran polymer and the pH
   dependent release over a 5-day period was studied. It was found that
   upon pH change to an acidic environment, over 50\% of the drug was first
   released at a rapid rate for 10 h, similar to that observed for the
   dextran release, before continuing at a more controlled rate for 4 days.
   As such, these microparticles can play an important role in the
   fabrication of novel drug delivery systems due to the selective,
   controlled, and pH responsive release of their encapsulated
   therapeutics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   that the positional and angular accuracies of our image-processing

   between the displacements in neighboring time intervals, trajectories of
   different videos of the same particle can be merged into a very long

Abstract = {{Strength of adhesion between materials is known to be strongly
   influenced by interface irregularities. In this work, I devise a
   perturbative approach to describe the effect of self-affine roughness on
   non-contact adhesive interactions. The hierarchy of the obtained
   analytical solutions is the following. First, analytical formulae are
   deduced to describe roughness corrections to the van der Waals
   interaction energies between a hemi-space adherend, bounded by a
   self-affine surface, and a point-like adherent. Second, the problem of
   two hemi-spaces, one of which has a planar surface, and the other is
   bounded by a self-affine surface, is solved analytically. In the latter
   case, a numerical analysis is performed to delineate the behavior of the
   roughness corrections as a function of the parameters, characterizing
   self-affine fractal surface roughness. The problem of two hemi-spaces,
   both bounded by self-affine fractal surfaces, is also addressed in this
   work. The model's predictions are compared with previously reported
   theoretical results and available experimental data. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The reorganization of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) upon formation
   of molecular junctions plays an important role in the resulting
   transport and thermoelectric properties. By considering a wide range of
   Au-molecule-Au junctions-created from phenyl molecules with different
   lengths and end-groups-we demonstrate that the-extent of reorganization
   of FMOs is based on: (i) stabilization due to the physical presence of
   electrodes, and (ii) change in the electron electron (e-e) interactions
   due to charge transfer. In molecular systems with charge (electron)
   transfer into the molecule, the opposing effects of stabilization and
   increased e-e interactions result in a small overall reorganization of
   FMOs. In contrast, for molecular systems with charge transfer out of the
   molecule, the complementary effects of stabilization and reduced e-e
   interactions result in a large overall reorganization of FMOs to lower
   energies. Further, we present a computationally efficient approach to
   quantitatively compute the-extent of reorganization, which has potential
   for high-throughput analysis of molecular junctions.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for the determination of the subcritical neutron multiplication
   of nuclear materials are of interest in the field of nuclear
   nonproliferation and safeguards. A series of measurements were performed
   at the Joint Research Center facility in Ispra, Italy to investigate the
   possibility of using a time-correlated pulse-height (TCPH) analysis to
   estimate the sub-critical multiplication of nuclear material. The
   objective of the measurements was to evaluate the effectiveness of this
   technique, and to benchmark the simulation capabilities of
   MCNPX-PoliMi/MPPost. In this campaign, two low-multiplication samples
   were measured: a 1-kg mixed oxide (MOX) powder sample and several
   low-mass plutonium-gallium (PuGa) disks. The measured results
   demonstrated that the sensitivity of the TCPH technique could not
   clearly distinguish samples with very-low levels of multiplication.
   However, the simulated TCPH distributions agree well with the measured
   data, within 12\% for all cases, validating the simulation capabilities
   of MCNPX-PoliMi/MPPost. To investigate the potential of the TCPH method
   for identifying high-multiplication samples, the validated
   MCNPX-PoliMi/MPPost codes were used to simulate sources of higher
   multiplications. Lastly, a characterization metric, the cumulative
   region integral (CRI), was introduced to estimate the level of
   multiplication in a source. However, this response was shown to be
   insensitive over the range of multiplications of interest. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{One of the most important questions to be answered with regard to
   digital pulse shape discrimination (PSD) systems based on organic
   scintillators is What sampling properties are required for a
   fastwaveform digitizer used for digitizing neutron/gamma-ray pulses,
   while an accurate PSD is desired? AnswerMg this question is the main
   objective of this paper. Specifically, the paper describes the influence
   of the resolution and sampling frequency of a waveform digitizer on the
   PSD performance of organic scintillators. The results presented in this
   paper are meant to help the reader choosing a waveform digitizer with
   appropriate bit resolution and sampling frequency. The results presented
   here show that a 12-bit. 250-MHz digitizer is a good choice for
   applications that require good PSD performance. However, when more
   accurate PSD performance is the main requirement, this paper presents
   PSD figures of merit to qualify the impact of further increasing either
   sampling frequency or resolution of the digitizer. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Measuring neutrons in the presence of high gamma ray fluence is a
   challenge with multi particle detectors. Organic liquid scintillators
   such as the EJ-309 are capable of accurate pulse-shape discrimination
   (PSD) but the chance for particle misclassification is not negligible
   for some applications. By varying the distance from an EJ-309
   scintillator to a strong-gamma-ray source and keeping a weak-neutron
   source at a fixed position, various gamma-to-neutron ratios can be
   measured and PSD performance can be quantified. Comparing neutron
   pulse-height distributions allows for pulse-height specific PSD
   evaluation, and quantification and visualization of deviation from
   (CI)-C-252 alone. Even with the addition of the misclassified
   gamma-rays, the PSD is effective in separating particles so that neutron
   count rate can be predicted with less than 10\% error up to a
   gamma-to-neutron ratio of almost 650 for applications which can afford a
   reduction in neutron detection efficiency, PSD can be sufficiently
   effective in discriminating particles to measure a weak neutron source
   in a high gamma-ray background. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Current economic restructuring policies have ignored unintended
   environmental consequences and cobenefits, the understanding of which
   can provide foundations for effective policy decisions for green economy
   transformation. Using the input-output life cycle assessment model and
   taking China as an example, we find that household consumption, fixed
   capital formation, and export are main drivers to China's environmental
   impacts. At the product scale, major contributors to environmental
   impacts vary across different types of impacts. Stimulating the
   development of seven strategic emerging industries will cause unintended
   consequences, such as increasing nonferrous metal ore usage, terrestrial
   acidification, photochemical oxidant formation, human toxicity, and
   terrestrial ecotoxicity. Limiting the surplus outputs in the
   construction materials industry and metallurgy industry may only help
   mitigate some of the environmental impacts caused by China's regulated
   pollutants, with little effect on reducing other impacts, such as marine
   eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, photochemical oxidant
   formation, and particulate matter formation. However, it will bring
   cobenefits by simultaneously reducing mineral ore usage, human toxicity,
   marine ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Sustainable materials
   management and integrated policy modeling are possible ways for
   policy-making to avoid unintended consequences and effectively utilize
   cobenefits.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to generate a path for a mobile agent
   that carries sensors used for classification, where the path is to
   optimize strategic objectives that account for misclassification and the
   consequences of misclassification, and where the weights assigned to
   these consequences are chosen by a strategist. We propose a model that
   accounts for the interaction between the agent kinematics (i.e., the
   ability to move), informatics (i.e., the ability to process data to
   information), classification (i.e., the ability to classify objects
   based on the information), and strategy (i.e., the mission objective).
   Within this model, we pose and solve a sequential decision problem that
   accounts for strategist preferences and the solution to the problem
   yields a sequence of kinematic decisions of a moving agent. The solution
   of the sequential decision problem yields the following flying tactics:
   ``approach only objects whose suspected identity matters to the
   strategy{''}. These tactics are numerically illustrated in several
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) facilitate the
   angiogenic response of endothelial cells (ECs) within three-dimensional
   (3D) matrices in vivo and in engineered tissues in vitro in part through
   paracrine mediators and by acting as stabilizing pericytes. However, the
   molecular interactions between BMSCs and nascent tubules during the
   process of angiogenesis are not fully understood. In this study, we have
   used a tractable 3D co-culture model to explore the functional role of
   the alpha 6 beta 1 integrin adhesion receptor on BMSCs in sprouting
   angiogenesis. We report that knockdown of the alpha 6 integrin subunit
   in BMSCs significantly reduces capillary sprouting, and causes their
   failure to associate with the nascent vessels. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that the BMSCs with attenuated alpha 6 integrin proliferate
   at a significantly lower rate relative to either control cells
   expressing non-targeting shRNA or wild type BMSCs; however, despite
   adding more cells to compensate for this deficit in proliferation,
   deficient sprouting persists. Collectively, our findings demonstrate
   that the alpha 6 integrin subunit in BMSCs is important for their
   ability to stimulate vessel morphogenesis. This conclusion may have
   important implications in the optimization of cell-based strategies to
   promote angiogenesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Higher-order adaptive finite-element methods for Kohn-Sham density
   functional theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{308-343}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We present an efficient computational approach to perform real-space
   electronic structure calculations using an adaptive higher-order
   finite-element discretization of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory
   (DFT). To this end, we develop an a priori mesh-adaption technique to
   construct a close to optimal finite-element discretization of the
   problem. We further propose an efficient solution strategy for solving
   the discrete eigenvalue problem by using spectral finite-elements in
   conjunction with Gauss-Lobatto quadrature, and a Chebyshev acceleration
   technique for computing the occupied eigenspace. The proposed approach
   has been observed to provide a staggering 100-200-fold computational
   advantage over the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. Using
   the proposed solution procedure, we investigate the computational
   efficiency afforded by higher-order finite-element discretizations of
   the Kohn-Sham DFT problem. Our studies suggest that staggering
   computational savings of the order of 1000-fold relative to linear
   finite-elements can be realized, for both all-electron and local
   pseudopotential calculations, by using higher-order finite-element
   discretizations. On all the benchmark systems studied, we observe
   diminishing returns in computational savings beyond the sixth-order for
   accuracies commensurate with chemical accuracy, suggesting that the
   hexic spectral-element may be an optimal choice for the finite-element
   discretization of the Kohn-Sham DFT problem. A comparative study of the
   computational efficiency of the proposed high-erorder finite-element
   discretizations suggests that the performance of finite-element basis is
   competing with the plane-wave discretization for non-periodic local
   pseudopotential calculations, and compares to the Gaussian basis for
   all-electron calculations to within an order of magnitude. Further, we
   demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to compute the
   electronic structure of a metallic system containing 1688 atoms using
   modest computational resources, and good scalability of the present
   implementation up to 192 processors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, computational models are developed for simulations of
   representative volume element (RVE) specimens of lithium-ion battery
   cells under in-plane constrained compression tests. For cell components
   in the finite element analyses, the effective compressive moduli are
   obtained from in-plane constrained compressive tests, the Poisson's
   ratios are based on the rule of mixture, and the stress plastic strain
   curves are obtained from the tensile tests and the rule of mixture. The
   Gurson's material model is adopted to account for the effect of porosity
   in separator and electrode sheets. The computational results show that
   the computational models can be used to examine the micro buckling of
   the component sheets, the macro buckling of the cell RVE specimens, and
   the formation of the kinks and shear bands observed in experiments, and
   to simulate the load displacement curves of the cell RVE specimens. The
   initial micro buckling mode of the cover sheets in general agrees with
   that of an approximate elastic buckling solution. Based on the
   computational models, the effects of the friction on the deformation
   pattern and void compaction are identified. Finally, the effects of the
   initial clearance and biaxial compression on the deformation patterns of
   the cell RVE specimens are demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{400-404}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a high-temperature, rechargeable metal-air battery that
   relies on Ti or Zr metal as the anode and the shuttling of oxygen anions
   between the cathode and the anode through a solid-oxide ion-conducting
   electrolyte. The cathode has much in common with solid-oxide fuel cells.
   Key in the proposed battery is the use of Ti or Zr as the anode as these
   metals are unique in their ability to dissolve oxygen up to
   concentrations of 33\% with minimal structural and volumetric changes.
   First-principles statistical mechanics calculations predict open circuit
   voltages around 2.5 V, substantially larger than the open circuit
   voltage of high-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. The calculations
   predict the stability of TiO and ZrO monoxides along with TiOx and ZrOx
   (with x as high as 1/2) solid solutions. These suboxide phases are all
   predicted to be metallic, indicating that electron transport in the
   anodes will not be rate limiting. The oxygen diffusion coefficients in
   the Ti and Zr suboxides at high temperature (similar to 700-800 degrees
   C) are predicted to be comparable to that of Li ions in intercalation
   compounds. These properties suggest theoretical capacities as high as
   840 mAh g(-1) and 500 mAh g(-1) for Ti and Zr based metal-air batteries

Abstract = {{Due to cell-to-cell variations in battery pack, it is hard to model the
   behavior of the battery pack accurately; as a result, accurate State of
   Charge (SoC) estimation of battery pack remains very challenging and
   problematic. This paper tries to put effort on estimating the SoC of
   cells series lithium-ion battery pack for electric vehicles with
   adaptive data-driven based SoC estimator. First, a lumped parameter
   equivalent circuit model is developed. Second, to avoid the drawbacks of
   cell-to-cell variations in battery pack, a filtering approach for
   ensuring the performance of capacity/resistance conformity in battery
   pack has been proposed. The multi-cells ``pack model{''} can be
   simplified by the unit model. Third, the adaptive extended Kalman filter
   algorithm has been used to achieve accurate SoC estimates for battery
   packs. Last, to analyze the robustness and the reliability of the
   proposed approach for cells and battery pack, the federal urban driving
   schedule and dynamic stress test have been conducted respectively. The
   results indicate that the proposed approach not only ensures higher
   voltage and SoC estimation accuracy for cells, but also achieves
   desirable prediction precision for battery pack, both the pack's voltage
   and SoC estimation error are less than 2\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in
   vasculogenesis (blood vessel formation) and angiogenesis (capillary
   formation from a pre-existing blood vessel). Dysregulation of VEGF has
   been associated with several diseases including cancer, rheumatoid
   arthritis, and psoriasis. As a result, serum level of VEGF has important
   implications as biomarker for different clinical disorders as well as
   for subsequent therapy monitoring. A simple detection method capable of
   rapid and sensitive analysis of VEGF in serum of patients with different
   clinical disorders is of paramount importance. Here, we report the
   fabrication and utilization of capture-antibody immobilized macro-porous
   poly(ethylene) glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel microspheres for
   quantitative and reproducible measurement of VEGF. We demonstrate that
   induction of porosity using PEG porogen improves the sensitivity of this
   simple hydrogel microsphere based system with a detection limit of 2.5
   pg/ml; indicating that the sensitivity of the assay exceeds that of the
   conventional technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Miniature enzyme-based amperometric and coulometric glucose sensors were
   fabricated and applied to measure tear glucose concentrations in
   anesthetized rabbits. Without perturbing the eyeball, 3 mu L of tear
   fluid was sampled from the marginal conjunctiva under the lower eyelid
   of anesthetized rabbits at various time points via a microliter glass
   capillary tube, and the miniature sensors were then inserted into the
   volume of collected tear fluids within the capillaries for detection.
   Intravenous bolus doses of insulin were administrated to the rabbits to
   lower the elevated blood glucose concentrations caused by anesthesia
   over the 7 h test periods. A significant correlation was found between
   tear and blood glucose levels for multiple rabbits, suggesting that
   electrochemical sensor-based tear glucose measurements may be a
   potential supplementary method for point-of-care glucose monitoring. (C)

Abstract = {{Exploring the synthesis of new biocompatible quantum dots (QDs) helps in
   overcoming the intrinsic toxicity of the existing QDs composed of highly
   toxic heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Hg, Pb, etc.) and is particularly
   interesting for the future practical application of QDs in biomedical
   imaging. Hence, in this report, a new one-pot approach to oil-soluble
   (highly toxic heavy metal-free) highly luminescent quaternary Zn-Ag-In
   Se (ZAISe) QDs was designed. Their photoluminescence (PL) emission could
   be systematically tuned from 660 to 800 nm by controlling the Ag/Zn feed
   ratio, and their highest PL quantum yield is close to 50\% after
   detailed optimization. Next, by using biodegradable RGD peptide
   (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid)-modified N-succinyl-N'octyl-chitosan
   (RGD-SOC) micelles as a water transfer agent, the versatility of these
   quaternary ZAISe QDs for multiscale bioimaging of micelles (namely, in
   vitro and in vivo evaluating the tumor targeting of drug carriers) was
   further explored, as a promising alternative for Cd- and Pb-based QDs.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the optical properties of finite systems composed of a
   series of graphene sheets separated by thin dielectric layers. Because
   these systems respond as conductors to electric fields in the plane of
   the graphene sheets and as insulators to perpendicular electric fields,
   they can be expected to have properties similar to those of hyperbolic
   metamaterials. We show that under typical experimental conditions
   graphene/dielectric multilayers have enhanced Purcell factors, and
   enhanced photonic densities of states in both the terahertz (THz) and
   midinfrared (mid-IR) frequency range. These behaviors can be traced to
   the coupled plasmon modes of the multilayer graphene system. We show
   that these results can be obtained with just a few layers of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{Loss to the open circuit voltage (V-oc) in organic photovoltaic cells is
   a critical bottleneck to achieving high power conversion efficiency. We
   demonstrate that the insertion of multilayers of a poly(phenylene
   ethynylene) spacer into the planar heterojunction between
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester
   incrementally escalates the V-oc of a polymer solar cell from 0.43 V to
   0.9 V. Through a combination of light intensity and temperature
   dependent measurements, we show that this control over the molecular
   structure local to the interface increases V-oc by raising the polaron
   pair energy and by suppressing the dark-diode current. (C) 2013 AIP

Title = {{Finite element analysis and experimental study on dynamic properties of
   a composite beam with viscoelastic damping}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the frequency dependent viscoelastic dynamics of
   a multifunctional composite structure from finite element analysis and
   experimental validation. The frequency-dependent behavior of the
   stiffness and damping of a viscoelastic material directly affects the
   system's modal frequencies and damping, and results in complex vibration
   modes and differences in the relative phase of vibration. A second order
   three parameter Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) method and a second order
   three fields Anelastic Displacement Fields (ADF) approach are used to
   implement the viscoelastic material model, enabling the straightforward
   development of time domain and frequency domain finite elements, and
   describing the frequency dependent viscoelastic behavior. Considering
   the parameter identification a strategy to estimate the fractional order
   of the time derivative and the relaxation time is outlined. Agreement
   between the curve fits using both the GHM and ADF and experiment is
   within 0.001 percent error. Continuing efforts are addressing the
   material modulus comparison of the GHM and the ADF model. There may be a
   theoretical difference between viscoelastic degrees of freedom at nodes
   and elements, but their numerical results are very close to each other
   in the specific frequency range of interest. With identified model
   parameters, numerical simulation is carried out to predict the damping
   behavior in its first two vibration modes. The experimental testing on
   the layered composite beam validates the numerical predication.
   Experimental results also show that elastic modulus measured from
   dynamic response yields more accurate results than static measurement,
   such as tensile testing, especially for elastomers. (C) 2013 Elsevier
