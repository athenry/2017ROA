Abstract = {{This letter describes a simple model for the backscattered signal
   received from the ocean surface by a horizontal-polarization marine
   radar operating at low grazing angles, including the effects of the
   logarithmic amplifiers conventionally used in these radars. Shadowing is
   accounted for via geometric optics. The range dependence of the mean
   radar signal predicted by this model compares well with that observed in
   two marine radar data sets collected under different environmental
   conditions. The model also indicates that the radar signal modulation (
   the deviation from the mean normalized by the mean) is proportional to
   the radial component of the surface slope in unshadowed regions. This
   suggests the possibility of direct quantitative wave observations using
   marine radar modulation data, without the need for calibration.}},

Abstract = {{In a klystron, charge overtaking of electrons leads to an infinity of ac
   current on the electron beam. This paper extends the klystron theory of
   orbital bunching to a traveling-wave tube (TWT). We calculate the
   harmonic content of the beam current in a TWT that results from an input
   signal of a single frequency. We assume that the electron orbits are
   governed by Pierce's classical three-wave, linear theory. The crowding
   of these linear orbits may lead to charge overtaking and, therefore,
   harmonic generation on the beam current, as in a klystron. We
   analytically calculate the buildup of harmonic content as a function of
   tube length from the input, and compare the results with the CHRISTINE
   code. Good agreement is found. Also found is the surprisingly high level
   of harmonic contents in the electron beam current, even when the TWT
   operates in the small signal regime. A dimensionless bunching parameter
   for a TWT, X = (2P(in)/(PbC))(1/2), is identified, which characterizes
   the harmonic content in the ac beam current, where Pin is the input
   power of the signal, P-b is the dc beam power, and C is Pierce's gain
   parameter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method for detection and isolation of
   wastegate (WG) faults in a turbocharged (TC) gasoline engine. This paper
   starts with a fault effect analysis on the WG faults, including WG stuck
   open and stuck closed, which is an early step in a detection strategy
   design. Then, a second-order sliding-mode observer (SOSMO) is proposed
   to capture the exhaust manifold dynamics. The observer uses
   experimentally validated engine models to estimate the WG position and a
   virtual force. The virtual force represents the external disturbances
   that disrupt the WG operation and enables the proposed SOSMO to estimate
   the WG position robust to the faults. Using this force, a detection and
   isolation algorithm is presented and experimentally verified on a modern
   TC gasoline engine. Test bench results show that the proposed strategy
   can successfully detect and isolate the two different WG faults.}},

Abstract = {{In sparse target inference problems, it has been shown that significant
   gains can be achieved by adaptive sensing using convex criteria. We
   generalize this previous work on adaptive sensing to: a) include
   multiple classes of targets with different levels of importance and b)
   accommodate multiple sensor models. Optimization policies are developed
   to allocate a limited resource budget to simultaneously locate, classify
   and estimate a sparse number of targets embedded in a large space.
   Bounds on the performance of the proposed policies are derived by
   analyzing a baseline policy, which allocates resources uniformly across
   the scene, and an oracle policy which has a priori knowledge of the
   target locations/classes. These bounds quantify the potential benefit of
   adaptive sensing as a function of target frequency and importance.
   Numerical results indicate that the proposed policies perform close to
   the oracle bound when signal quality is sufficiently high. Moreover, the
   proposed policies improve on previous policies in terms of reducing
   estimation error, reducing misclassification probability, and increasing
   expected return. To account for sensors with different levels of
   agility, three sensor models are considered: global adaptive (GA), which
   can allocate different amounts of resource to each location in the
   space; global uniform (GU), which can allocate resources uniformly
   across the scene; and local adaptive (LA), which can allocate fixed
   units to a subset of locations. Policies that use a mixture of GU and LA
   sensors are shown to perform similarly to those that use GA sensors
   while being more easily implementable.}},

Abstract = {{Kronecker PCA involves the use of a space versus time Kronecker product
   decomposition to estimate spatio-temporal covariances. In this paper,
   the addition of a sparse correction factor is considered, which
   corresponds to a model of the covariance as a sum of Kronecker products
   of low (separation) rank and a sparse matrix. This sparse correction
   extends the diagonally corrected Kronecker PCA of {[}Greenewald, and
   Hero, 2014] to allow for sparse unstructured ``outliers{''} anywhere in
   the covariance matrix, e.g., arising from variables or correlations that
   do not fit the Kronecker model well, or from sources such as sensor
   noise or sensor failure. We introduce a robust PCA-based algorithm to
   estimate the covariance under this model. An extension to Toeplitz
   temporal factors is also provided, producing a parameter reduction for
   temporally stationary measurement modeling. High dimensional MSE
   performance bounds are given for these extensions. Finally, the proposed
   extension of KronPCA is evaluated on both simulated and real data coming
   from yeast cell cycle experiments. This establishes the practical
   utility of robust Kronecker PCA in biological and other applications.}},

Abstract = {{Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has evolved into an
   established treatment option for type B aortic dissection (TBAD) since

   decreased due to the minimally invasive character of TEVAR, with
   adequate stabilization of the dissection, restoration of true lumen
   perfusion, and subsequent positive aortic remodeling. However, several
   studies have reported severe setbacks of this technique. Indeed, little
   is known about the biomechanical behavior of implanted thoracic
   stent-grafts and the impact on the vascular system. This study sought to
   systematically review the performance and behavior of implanted thoracic

Abstract = {{Electrified vehicles (EVs) couple transportation and electrical
   infrastructures, impacting vehicle sustainability, transportation
   resiliency, and electrical grid stability. These impacts occur across
   timescales; grid stability at the millisecond scale, resiliency at the
   daily scale, and sustainability over years and decades. Integrated
   models of these systems must share data to explore timescale
   dependencies, and reveal unanticipated outcomes. This paper examines EV
   adoption for sustainability, resiliency, and stability effects.
   Sustainability findings, consistent with previous studies, indicate that
   electrification generally reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, and increases SOx and NOx. Electrified vehicles enhance
   vehicle resiliency (ability of vehicle to complete typical trips during
   fuel outage). Coupled results enhance EV resilience research, finding
   that a 16-km (10-mi) all-electric range plug-in hybrid EV improves
   resiliency similar to 50\% versus a gasoline-only vehicle. Increasing EV
   market share reduces grid stability. Stability depends upon charging
   profiles and background electrical demand. Stability-related grid
   outages increase with EV market penetration. This paper modeled these
   systems in their coupled form across timescales yielding results not
   obvious if the systems were modeled in isolation. (C) 2015 American

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{98-111}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The features of blast and impact that can damage a delicate target
   supported by a structure include both the peak pressure and the impulse
   delivered to the structure. This study examines how layers of elastic
   and visco-elastic materials may be assembled to mitigate these features.
   The impedance mismatch between two elastic layers is known to reduce the
   pressure, but dissipation is required to mitigate the transmitted
   impulse in light-weight armor. A novel design concept called impact or
   blast tuning is introduced in which a multi-layered armor is used to
   tune the stress waves resulting from an impact or blast to specific
   frequencies that match the damping frequencies of visco-elastic layers.
   The material and geometrical parameters controlling the viscous
   dissipation of the energy within the armor are identified for a
   simplified one-dimensional system, to provide insight into how the
   optimal design of multi-use armor might be based on this concept. (C)

Abstract = {{In peer-to-peer user-private information retrieval, or P2P UPIR, the
   goal is to provide increased privacy for users querying a database. This
   is accomplished by leveraging a P2P network in which users forward each
   other's queries to the database. That is, the database is trusted to
   serve correct answers to user queries, but not trusted to know the
   identity of the user who sent particular queries (or the source of the
   queries): users wish to maintain anonymity (relative to other users)
   with respect to the database. In this paper, we analyze protocols by
   Swanson and Stinson that are based on combinatorial designs; the use of
   combinatorial designs for P2P UPIR is a natural approach, because the
   ``balance{''} properties of designs translate into desirable (and
   sometimes optimal) security properties in the resulting protocols. Our
   main contribution is to extend previous work by analyzing the privacy
   properties of suggested P2P UPIR protocols with respect to coalitions of
   honest-but-curious users. Previous work focuses on privacy properties
   achieved with respect to the database; as such, our work fills an
   important gap in the analysis of these protocols. We provide an analysis
   of the probabilistic advantage user coalitions have in guessing the
   source of a query. In particular, when a set of queries is linked by
   subject matter (i.e., the content of the queries reveals the fact that
   they have a common source), it is difficult to protect against user
   coalitions. We provide new results with respect to user attacks on
   linked queries, and we analyze the use of query hops as a mitigation
   technique, in which queries are probabilistically written to one or more
   memory spaces before forwarding to the database.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is widely used for tracking
   antibodies and biomolecules in vivo. Clinical and preclinical
   applications include intraoperative imaging, tracking therapeutics, and
   fluorescent labeling as a surrogate for subsequent radiolabeling.
   Despite their extensive use, one of the fundamental properties of NIR
   dyes, the residualization rate within cells following internalization,
   has not been systematically studied. This rate is required for the
   rational design of probes and proper interpretation of in vivo results.
   In this brief report, we measure the cellular residualization rate of
   eight commonly used dyes encompassing three core structures (cyanine,
   boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY), and oxazine/thiazine/carbopyronin).
   We identify residualizing (half-life > 24 h) and non-residualizing
   (half-life < 24 h) dyes in both the far-red (similar to 650-680 nm) and
   near-infrared (similar to 740-800 nm) regions.
   This data will allow researchers to independently and rationally select
   the wavelength and residualizing nature of dyes for molecular imaging
   agent design.}},

Title = {{The impact of a magnesium zirconate thermal barrier coating on

   formation of combustion chamber deposits}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The accumulation and burn-off of combustion chamber deposits create
   uncontrolled shifting of the homogeneous charge compression ignition
   operability range. This combustion chamber deposit-created operational
   variability places increased control burden on a multi-mode engine.
   However, the operational variability can be mitigated by manipulating
   combustion chamber deposit accumulation. A magnesium zirconate thermal
   barrier coating was applied to the piston of a homogeneous charge
   compression ignition engine in an effort to reduce combustion chamber
   deposit accumulation through elevated piston surface temperatures. While
   reduced combustion chamber deposit thicknesses were observed on the
   magnesium zirconate piston periphery, combustion chamber deposit
   accumulation in the bowl region increased relative to aluminum piston
   operation. Additionally, combustion chamber deposit thicknesses on the
   aluminum cylinder head were reduced during operation with the magnesium
   zirconate coated piston. Chamber-wide alterations to combustion chamber
   deposit accumulation taken together with the increased burn duration and
   hydrocarbon emissions measured during operation with the magnesium
   zirconate piston indicate significant interaction between the directly
   injected fuel spray and thermal barrier coating porosity. The porosity
   and surface roughness of the magnesium zirconate thermal barrier coating
   are speculated to create fuel pooling/absorption within the piston bowl,
   increasing combustion chamber deposit accumulation in the bowl and
   leaning the remaining fuel-air charge. The charge leaning lengthens the
   magnesium zirconate burn duration and reduces cylinder head combustion
   chamber deposit accumulation. Furthermore, hydrocarbon emissions were
   increased during magnesium zirconate operation due to late desorption
   and subsequent incomplete burning of fuel from piston bowl and the
   presence of incombustibly lean areas in the remaining cylinder charge.}},

Abstract = {{Planetary gear (PG) power-split hybrid powertrains have been used in
   producing hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles from the Toyota, General
   Motor, and Ford for years. Some of the most recent designs use clutches
   to enable multiple operating modes to improve launching performance
   and/or fuel economy. Adding clutches and multiple operating modes,
   however, also increases production cost and design complexity. To enable
   an exhaustive but fast search for optimal designs among a large number
   of hardware configurations, clutch locations, and mode selections, an
   automated modeling and screening process is developed in this paper.
   Combining this process with the power-weighted efficiency analysis for
   rapid sizing method (PEARS), an optimal and computationally efficient
   energy management strategy, the extremely large design space of
   configuration, component sizing, and control becomes feasible to search
   through. This methodology to identify optimal designs has yet to be
   reported in the literature. A case study to evaluate the proposed
   methodology uses the configuration adopted in the Toyota Hybrid Synergy
   (THS-II) system used in the Prius model year 2010 and the Hybrid Camry.
   Two designs are investigated to compare with the simulated Prius design:
   one uses all possible operating modes; and the other uses a suboptimal
   design that limits the number of clutches to three.}},

Abstract = {{Multimode combustion (MMC) concepts using homogeneous charge compression
   ignition (HCCI) gasoline combustion at low loads and spark assisted
   compression ignition (SACI) gasoline combustion at medium loads have the
   potential for improved fuel efficiency relative to spark ignition (SI)
   gasoline combustion. Two MMC concepts are compared in this paper with
   respect to fuel efficiency and tailpipe NOx emissions. The first concept
   uses stoichiometric HCCI and SACI to allow standard three-way catalyst
   (TWC) operation. The second concept also uses HCCI and SACI, but cycles
   between lean and rich combustion and uses a TWC with increased oxygen
   storage capacity (OSC) for potentially even greater fuel efficiency
   improvement. This paper performs a preliminary comparison of the two MMC
   concepts by analyzing two scenarios: (1) cycling between stoichiometric
   HCCI at 2 bar BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) and stoichiometric
   SACI at 3 bar BMEP, and (2) cycling between lean HCCI at 2 bar BMEP and
   rich SACI at 3 bar BMEP. The effects of excess oxygen ratio during HCCI
   operation and the frequency of oxygen depletion events on TWC
   performance and fuel efficiency are investigated. Results show that MMC
   lean/rich cycling can achieve better fuel efficiency than stoichiometric
   HCCI/SACI cycling. NOx emissions are moderately higher, but may still be
   low enough to meet current and future emission regulations.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-induced motion (FIM) experiments of a single circular cylinder or
   multiple cylinders in an array involve several configuration and
   hydrodynamic parameters, such as diameter, mass, damping, stiffness,
   spacing, Reynolds number, and flow regime, and deviation from circular
   cross section. Due to the importance of the FIM both in suppression for
   structural robustness and in enhancement for hydrokinetic energy
   conversion, systematic experiments are being conducted since the early
   1960s and several more decades of experimentation are required. Change
   of springs and dampers is time consuming and requires frequent
   recalibration. Emulating springs and dampers with a controller makes
   parameter change efficient and accurate. There are two approaches to
   this problem: The first involves the hydrodynamic force in the
   closed-loop and is easier to implement. The second called virtual
   damping and spring (V-ck) does not involve the hydrodynamic force in the
   closed-loop but requires an elaborate system identification (SI)
   process. V-ck was developed in the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory
   (MRELab) of the University of Michigan for the first time in 2009 and
   resulted in extensive data generation. In this paper, the second
   generation of V-ck is developed and validated by comparison of the FIM
   experiments between a V-ck emulated oscillator and an oscillator with
   physical springs and dampers. The main findings are: (a) the V-ck system
   developed keeps the hydrodynamic force out of the control-loop and,
   thus, does not bias the FIM, (b) The controller-induced lag is minimal
   and significantly reduced compared to the first generation of V-ck built
   in the MRELab due to use of an Arduino embedded board to control a
   servomotor instead of Labview, (c) The SI process revealed a static,
   third-order, nonlinear viscous model but no need for dynamic terms with
   memory, and (d) The agreement between real and virtual springs and
   dampers is excellent in FIM including vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs)
   and galloping measurements over the entire range of spring constants and
   velocities tested (16,000<Re<140,000).}},

Abstract = {{The input to the stochastic orienteering problem (Gupta et al. in SODA,
   pp 1522-1538, 2012) consists of a budget B and metric (V, d) where each
   vertex has a job with a deterministic reward and a random processing
   time (drawn from a known distribution). The processing times are
   independent across vertices. The goal is to obtain a non-anticipatory
   policy (originating from a given root vertex) to run jobs at different
   vertices, that maximizes expected reward, subject to the total distance
   traveled plus processing times being at most B. An adaptive policy can
   choose the next vertex to visit based on observed random instantiations.
   Whereas, a non-adaptive policy is just given by a fixed ordering of
   vertices. The adaptivity gap is the worst-case ratio of the optimal
   adaptive and non-adaptive rewards. We prove an lower bound on the
   adaptivity gap of stochastic orienteering. This provides a negative
   answer to the O(1)-adaptivity gap conjectured by Gupta et al. (2012),
   and comes close to the upper bound. This result holds even on a line
   metric. We also show an upper bound on the adaptivity gap for the
   correlated stochastic orienteering problem, where the reward of each job
   is random and possibly correlated to its processing time. Using this, we
   obtain an improved quasi-polynomial time -approximation algorithm for
   correlated stochastic orienteering.}},

Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{247-258}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a general framework for reconstructing sparse images
   from undersampled (squared)magnitude data corrupted with outliers and
   noise. This phase retrieval method uses a layered approach, combining
   repeated minimization of a convex majorizer (surrogate for a nonconvex
   objective function), and iterative optimization of that majorizer using
   a preconditioned variant of the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). Since phase retrieval is nonconvex, this
   implementation uses multiple initial majorization vectors. The
   introduction of a robust 1-norm data fit term that is better adapted to
   outliers exploits the generality of this framework. The derivation also
   describes a normalization scheme for the regularization parameter and a
   known adaptive heuristic for the ADMM penalty parameter. Both 1-D Monte
   Carlo tests and 2-D image reconstruction simulations suggest the
   proposed framework, with the robust data fit term, reduces the
   reconstruction error for data corrupted with both outliers and additive
   noise, relative to competing algorithms having the same total
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of quality mapping for the prediction of the
   spatial variation in local properties in thin-walled high-pressure die
   castings (HPDC) of the magnesium alloy AM60. The work investigates the
   role of casting parameters on local ductility and yield strength and
   presents a model for predicting local ductility and yield strength in a
   cast component. A design of experiment (DOE) was created to examine the
   role of various casting parameters on local properties such as ductility
   and yield strength. Over 1,200 tensile samples were excised from cast
   parts and tested. Casting simulations were also conducted for each
   experimental condition. Local properties were predicted, and the local
   property (quality map) model was compared with a prototype production
   component. The results of this model were used as input to a performance
   simulation software code to simulate the component-level behavior under
   two different loading conditions. In this study, the authors bypassed
   the traditional Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME;
   process-microstructure-properties) approach in favor of a semi-empirical
   quality mapping approach to provide estimates of manufacturing sensitive
   local properties for use in process and component design.}},

   carboxylic carbon region. DOM extracts prepared by the two methods were
   similar in their overall chemical characteristics that serve as proxies
   for organic matter sources. For example, only small differences were
   observed in the fluorescence index (FI) values of the extracts, and all
   values were within the range expected for terrestrially-derived DOM.
   EEMS spectra of both extracts had ``humic-like{''} peak A areas smaller
   than that of standard reference Suwannee River fulvic acid. Of 2801
   distinct chemical formulas assigned during FT-ICR MS analysis of the two
   extracts, 66\% were present in both; 15\% were unique to the XAD-8
   extract, and 19\% were unique to the DEAE-cellulose extract. Van
   Krevelen plots showed that the DEAE-cellulose extract had more
   tannin-like and condensed aromatic entities and formulas with higher
   O/Cratios, whereas the XAD-8 extract had more lignin-like material and
   formulas with higher H/C ratios. Overall, differences in chemical
   characteristics of the extracts reflect the mechanisms by which the
   extractants operate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
   reporters are powerful tools for analyzing cell signaling and function
   at single-cell resolution in standard 2D cell cultures, but these
   reporters rarely have been applied to 3D environments. FRET interactions
   between donor and acceptor molecules typically are determined by changes
   in relative fluorescence intensities, but wavelength-dependent
   differences in light absorption complicate this analysis method in 3D
   settings. Herein we report fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
   (FLIM) with phasor analysis, a method that displays fluorescence
   lifetimes on a pixel-wise basis in real time to quantify apoptosis in
   breast cancer cells stably expressing a genetically encoded FRET
   reporter. This microscopic imaging technology allowed us to identify
   treatment-induced apoptosis in single breast cancer cells in
   environments ranging from 2D cell culture, spheroids with cancer and
   bone marrow stromal cells, and living mice with orthotopic human breast
   cancer xenografts. Using this imaging strategy, we showed that combined
   metabolic therapy targeting glycolysis and glutamine pathways
   significantly reduced overall breast cancer metabolism and induced
   apoptosis. We also determined that distinct subpopulations of bone
   marrow stromal cells control the resistance of breast cancer cells to
   chemotherapy, suggesting heterogeneity of treatment responses of
   malignant cells in different bone marrow niches. Overall, this study
   establishes FLIM with phasor analysis as an imaging tool for apoptosis
   in cell-based assays and living mice, enabling real-time, cellular-level
   assessment of treatment efficacy and heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate treatment of material interfaces in compressible multiphase
   flows poses important challenges for high-resolution numerical methods.
   Although high-order interface-capturing schemes have been used to
   accurately simulate gas/liquid interfaces with the Euler equations,
   these methods can result in temperature spikes at material
   discontinuities. While this phenomenon is not problematic for Euler
   simulations, it gives rise to numerical errors when heat conduction is
   included. In this work, we identify the source of these errors and
   propose a methodology to prevent their occurrence for various models
   Used to represent gas/liquid interfaces in compressible flows based on a
   ``single-fluid{''} formulation, in which interfaces are represented by
   discontinuities in the material properties. Our focus lies in materials
   (gases and liquids primarily, but also solids) that can be described by
   a stiffened equation of state, though our approach is generalizable to
   other equations. We show that numerical approaches that prevent pressure
   oscillations at interfaces may generate temperature errors, which affect
   the energy (and pressure) through the heat conduction term. We
   demonstrate that the material properties entering the equation of state
   must be computed according to suitable transport equations in
   conservative or non-conservative forms; the pressure and temperature
   must be calculated based on the appropriate properties. To verify the
   analysis and compute problems with gas/liquid interfaces of relevance,
   we develop a three-dimensional, high-order accurate, solution-adaptive
   finite difference framework. In particular, we show that temperatures
   and pressures may be significantly overestimated in calculations of
   shock-induced bubble collapse in water if temperature errors are not
   prevented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The femoral enthesis of the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is
   known to be more susceptible to injury than the tibial enthesis. To
   determine whether anatomic differences might help explain this
   difference, we quantified the microscopic appearance of both entheses in
   15 unembalmed knee specimens using light microscopy, toluidine blue
   stain and image analysis. The amount of calcified fibrocartilage and
   uncalcified fibrocartilage, and the ligament entheseal attachment angle
   were then compared between the femoral and tibial entheses via linear
   mixed-effects models. The results showed marked differences in anatomy
   between the two entheses. The femoral enthesis exhibited a 3.9-fold more
   acute ligament attachment angle than the tibial enthesis (p<0.001), a
   43\% greater calcified fibrocartilage tissue area (p<0.001), and a 226\%
   greater uncalcified fibrocartilage depth (p<0.001), with the latter
   differences being particularly pronounced in the central region. We
   conclude that the ACL femoral enthesis has more fibrocartilage and a
   more acute ligament attachment angle than the tibial enthesis, which
   provides insight into why it is more vulnerable to failure. (c) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{8-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several compositions of the Cu4-xLixS2 (x=1, 2, 3) series were
   synthesized via solid-state reaction of the elements. The structural
   stability at various temperatures and the effect of Li:Cu ratio on the
   thermal conductivity and the electrochemical performance of
   Cu4-xLixS2/Li half-cells during charge-discharge process were
   investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements
   showed a sharp endothermic peak at 140 degrees C for Cu4-5LixS2 samples
   with x=1 and 2, which is ascribed to a structural phase transition.
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on various Cu(4-x)LixS(2) samples
   at temperatures below and above 140 degrees C indicated a structural
   phase transition from the room temperature low-symmetry structure to the
   high temperature cubic structure of Cu2S. The thermal conductivity of
   Cu4-xLixS2 samples decreases with decreasing Cu:Li ratio and with
   increasing temperature. The thermal conductivity of Cu4-xLixS2 samples
   at room temperature decreases from 1.2 W/m K for Cu:Li=3:1 to 0.7 W/m K
   for Cu:Li=1:3. Cyclic voltammetry of Cu4-xLixS2/Li half-cells showed
   that high discharge capacity (165 mA h g(-1)) and stable reversible
   charge-discharge process is observed for Cu:Li=2:2, whereas other Cu:Li
   ratios lead to low discharge capacity and poor reversibility. The
   electrochemical behavior of Cu4-xLixS2/Li half-cells is rationalized by
   taking into account the competing reactions of Li+ ions with CuS and
   Cu2S during discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) are promising in regenerating a
   live vascular replacement. However, the vascular cell source is limited,
   and it is crucial to develop a scaffold that accommodates new type of
   vascular progenitor cells and facilitates in vivo lineage specification
   of the cells into functional vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to
   regenerate vascular tissue. In the present study, integration-free human
   induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were established from patient
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells through episomal vector nucleofection
   of reprogramming factors. The established hiPSCs were then induced into
   mesoderm-originated cardiovascular progenitor cells (CVPCs) with a
   highly efficient directed lineage specification method. The derived
   CVPCs were demonstrated to be able to differentiate into functional
   VSMCs. Subcutaneous implantation of CVPCs seeded on macroporous
   nanofibrous poly(t-lactide) scaffolds led to in vivo VSMC lineage
   specification and matrix deposition inside the scaffolds. In summary, we
   established integration-free patient-specific hiPSCs from peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells, derived CVPCs through directed lineage
   specification, and developed an advanced scaffold for these progenitor
   cells to further differentiate in vivo into VSMCs and regenerate
   vascular tissue in a subcutaneous implantation model. This study has
   established an efficient patient-specific approach towards in vivo
   regeneration of vascular tissue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Inhibition of osteoblast mineralization by phosphorylated phage-derived
   apatite-specific peptide}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{120-130}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Functionalization of biomaterials with material- and cell-specific
   peptide sequences allows for better control of their surface properties
   and communication with the surrounding environment. Using a
   combinatorial phage display approach, we previously identified the
   peptide VTKHLNQISQSY (VTK) with specific affinity to biomimetic apatite.
   Phosphorylation of the serine residues of the peptide (pVTK) caused a
   significant increase in binding to apatite, as well as a dose-dependent
   inhibition of osteoblast mineralization. In this study, we investigated
   the mechanisms behind pVTK mediated inhibition of mineralization using
   MC3T3 cells and testing the hypothesis that mineralization is inhibited
   via alteration of the Enpp1-TNAP-Ank axis. Inhibition of mineralization
   was not due to disruption of collagen deposition or calcium chelation by
   the negatively charged pVTK. The timing of peptide administration was
   important in inhibiting mineralization pVTK had a greater effect at
   later stages of osteogenic differentiation (days 7-12 of culture
   corresponding to matrix maturation and mineralization), and could
   prevent progression of mineralization once it had started. pVTK
   treatment resulted in a significant decrease in ectonucleotide
   pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1) enzyme activity and gene
   expression. The expression of ankylosis protein (Ank), osteopontin (OPN)
   and Pit-1 genes was also significantly reduced with peptide treatment,
   while tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), bone sialoprotein
   (BSP), and Runx2 gene expression was significantly higher. The ability
   of pVTK to inhibit mineralization can potentially be translated into
   therapeutics against pathological calcification seen in cardiovascular
   disease, osteoarthritis or craniosynostosis, or be used to prevent
   failure of biomaterials due to calcification, such as bioprosthetic
   heart valves. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly flexible nanocomposites have tremendous potential as smart,

   investigating the influence of filler volume fraction on microscale
   morphology, piezoresistive response while bonded to mechanically loaded

   bonded sensor reveals that viscoelasticity and filler volume fraction
   profoundly affect the piezoresistive response. EIT is able to accurately
   capture and discern between multiple points of contact in each volume
   fraction with lower volume fractions being more sensitive thereby

Abstract = {{CuO/CeO2-TiO2 catalysts have been widely studied for the thermocatalytic
   NO reduction with CO. Here, we examine to what extent this reaction can
   be photocatalytically enhanced beyond the mere thermocatalytic activity
   by irradiating the catalyst with UV light under reaction conditions
   while observing the reaction progress via DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance
   infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). The reaction was studied in a
   batch reactor at four temperatures (35, 65, 100, and 200 degrees C). The
   most pronounced effect of photocatalytic enhancement was observed at 65
   degrees C where an enhanced CO conversion of 64.4\% was achieved,
   compared with 11.5\% CO conversion without UV irradiation. The
   photocatalytic enhancement of the CO conversion diminished as the
   temperature increased to 200 degrees C, where the CO conversion process
   became entirely dominated by thermal catalysis. The promoting effect of
   ceria on the CO + NO reaction has been revealed and rationalized on the
   basis of physical and chemical characterizations results. XPS and TPR
   results suggest that the electronic state interaction between Ce and the
   other two components (Ti and Cu) in the catalysts might lead to a higher
   oxygen vacancy concentration that facilitates oxygen transport from
   ceria to copper species resulting in the high catalytic activity for NO
   reduction by CO. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{75-76}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the deformation
   responses and failure mechanisms of hybrid 3D textile composites
   (H3DTCs) subjected to quasi-static three-point bending. The term
   ``hybrid{''} refers to different constituent fiber tows, including
   carbon, glass, and Kevlar that are integrally woven into a single
   preform. Three different hybrid architectures, manufactured by varying
   the percentages and lay-ups of the constituent fiber tows, were examined
   to understand the effect of hybridization on the resulting performance
   enhancement, including the bending modulus, flexural yield stress, and
   strain to failure. All the architectures show a ``plastic-like{''}
   nonlinear flexural response, indicating considerable damage tolerance
   and durability for this class of materials. It has been found that
   increasing the thickness of the specimens can increase the strain to
   failure in flexure. For an asymmetric H3DTC, which refers to an
   architecture that has carbon plies on one side and glass plies on the
   other (through-the-thickness), an increased flexural yield stress can be
   achieved by placing the glass on the side that experiences compressive
   straining in flexure, whereas the failure strain is reduced by placing
   the carbon on the side which experiences tension. Distributed matrix
   cracking was observed in regions of predominant tension through a
   digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Although the experimental
   results show architecture-dependent responses, fiber tow kinking, which
   develops on the compressive side of the specimen is determined to be a
   strength limiting mechanism for this class of materials subjected to
   flexural loading. The experimental results are subsequently used as a
   basis for developing a mechanics based multiscale computational model
   for H3DTC deformation, damage and failure response in flexure. Details
   of the modeling strategy and the development of damage and failure
   constitutive models are presented in Part II of this two-part sequence

Abstract = {{A mechanics based multiscale computational model is presented to predict
   the deformation, damage and failure response of hybrid 3D textile
   composites (H3DTCs) subjected to three-point bending. The geometry of
   the textile architecture was incorporated in a mesoscale finite element
   (FE) model, while the H3DTC was homogenized at the macroscale. The
   mesoscale model is a collection of repeat unit cells (RUCs) that are
   composed of different types of fiber tows embedded in a surrounding
   matrix. Matrix microdamage was modeled by a (pre-peak) nonlinear stress
   versus strain response, using a modified 12 deformation theory of
   plasticity incorporating a secant-modulus approach. Fiber tow pre-peak
   nonlinear response was computed using a novel, two-scale model, in which
   the subscale micromechanical analysis was carried out in closed-form
   based upon a unit cell of a fiber-matrix concentric cylinder.
   Consequently, the influence of matrix microdamage developing at the
   microscale manifests as the progressive degradation of fiber tow
   stiffness at the mesoscale. The smeared crack approach (SCA) was
   employed to model the post-peak softening of the constituents due to
   failure, including matrix macro-cracking, tow kinking, and tow breaking.
   This method offers a mesh objective result by relating the post-peak
   softening response to a traction-separation law that is associated with
   each failure mechanism through a characteristic length. Thus, the total
   energy release rate during failure in a continuum element is related to
   the fracture toughness of the material.
   The load-deflection responses, along with the progressive damage and
   failure events, including fiber tow kinking and rupture, are
   successfully predicted through the proposed computational model. In
   addition, the textile architecture-dependent effect, observed in the
   asymmetric H3DTC5, is also captured, demonstrating the predictive
   capability of the proposed modeling scheme. Since all the inputs are
   from the constituent level, the model is useful in understanding how the
   macroscopic response of H3DTC5 is influenced by textile architecture and
   constituent properties. The experimental studies are presented in Part I
   of this two-part sequence (Zhang et al., 2015). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{When an elastomeric material is deformed and subjected to temperatures
   above some characteristic value (the chemorheological temperature-near
   100 A degrees C for natural rubber), there are time and temperature
   dependent changes in its macromolecular structure. The macromolecular
   crosslinks undergo scission, recoiling and re-crosslinking. The process
   continues until the temperature decreases below the chemorheological
   temperature. The material now has modified properties (reduced
   stiffness) and permanent set on removal of the applied load.
   Cavitation and void growth in elastomers have been extensively studied
   when there is no scission and re-crosslinking. In this work, the problem
   is re-visited when the temperature exceeds the chemorheological
   temperature and changes occurs due to scission and re-crosslinking. The
   radial tension in the far field is fixed and the material changes with
   time due to scission and re-crosslinking. Thus, whereas previous work
   considered void growth under conditions of increasing radial tension and
   an unchanging material, this work considers a fixed radial load and an
   evolving material.
   The void is modeled as an initial small concentric spherical cavity in a
   large spherical body. The cavity surface is traction free and the outer
   surface is under radial tension. The material is modeled by a
   constitutive equation developed in earlier work that combines mechanical
   response with the kinetics of scission and re-crosslinking. A nonlinear
   Volterra integral equation is established for the time dependence of the
   void radius. A condition is developed for determining the rate of growth
   of the void radius. It is shown to be a monitor that can determine a
   time when a significant event, such as unbounded void growth rate,
   occurs. Numerical examples are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of nanocomposite/nanostructuring in thermoelectric materials
   has been proven to be an effective paradigm for optimizing the high
   thermoelectric performance primarily by reducing the thermal
   conductivity. In this work, we have studied the microstructure details
   of nanocomposites derived by incorporating a semi-metallic Bi
   nanoparticle phase in Bi2Te3 matrix and its correlation mainly with the
   reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity. Incorporating Hi
   inclusion in Bi2Te3 bulk thermoelectric material results in a
   substantial increase in the power factor and simultaneous reduction in
   the thermal conductivity. The main focus of this work is the correlation
   of the microstructure of the composite with the reduction in thermal
   conductivity. Thermal conductivity of the matrix and nanocomposites was
   derived from the thermal diffusivity measurements performed from room
   temperature to 150 degrees C. Interestingly, significant reduction in
   total thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite was achieved as compared
   to that of the matrix. A detailed analysis of high-resolution
   transmission electron microscope images reveals that this reduction in
   the thermal conductivity can be ascribed to the enhanced phonon
   scattering by distinct microstructure features such as interfaces, grain
   boundaries, edge dislocations with dipoles, and strain field domains.

   enhancing myoblast differentiation}},

Abstract = {{Myotube formation is crucial to restoring muscular functions, and
   biomaterials that enhance the myoblast differentiation into myotubes are
   highly desirable for muscular repair. Here, we report the synthesis of
   electroactive, ductile, and degradable copolymers and their application
   in enhancing the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes. A
   hyperbranched ductile polylactide (HPLA) was synthesized and then
   copolymerized with aniline tetramer (AT) to produce a series of
   electroactive, ductile and degradable copolymers (HPLAAT). The HPLA and
   HPLAAT showed excellent ductility with strain to failure from 158.9\% to
   42.7\% and modulus from 265.2 to 758.2 MPa. The high electroactivity of
   the HPLAAT was confirmed by UV spectrometer and cyclic voltammogram
   measurements. These HPLAAT polymers also showed improved thermal
   stability and controlled biodegradation rate compared to HPLA.
   Importantly, when applying these polymers for myotube formation, the
   HPLAAT significantly improved the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in
   vitro compared to HPLA. Furthermore, these polymers greatly promoted
   myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells as measured by quantitative
   analysis of myotube number, length, diameter, maturation index, and gene
   expression of MyoD and TNNT. Together, our study shows that these
   electroactive, ductile and degradable HPLAAT copolymers represent
   significantly improved biomaterials for muscle tissue engineering
   compared to HPLA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   of oxygen: Application to air separation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{532-540}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{BaO is a proven oxygen-selective sorbent for air separation via the
   BaO-BaO2 oxygen sorption-desorption cycle. However, the low transition
   O-2 pressure necessitates a high vacuum that is required for desorption,
   hence limiting its application. Here, we report facile synthesis of new
   oxygen-selective BaxSr1-xO/MgO nano-composite sorbents from which O-2
   can be desorbed at moderate vacuum pressures. These sorbents are
   obtained from BaxSr1-xMg(CO3)(2) precursors synthesized by
   co-precipitation followed by calcination. It is shown that the
   transition O-2 pressure for the oxide-peroxide cycle is significantly
   increased by increasing the Sr2+/Ba2+ ratio. XRD results show that the
   crystal structures are preserved while the lattice constants are reduced
   upon substitution of Ba2+ by Sr2+ in both precursor carbonates and
   peroxides. Transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy results show that Ba2+ and Sr2+ are mixed molecularly in
   BaxSr1-xO/MgO nanocomposite. We explain that the uniformly substituted
   Sr2+ in BaO/BaO2 changes the dissociation energy of peroxide ions and
   the equilibrium of the reversible reactions, promoting decomposition of
   BaO2. Cyclic O-2 sorption and desorption with BaxSr1-xO/MgO
   nano-composite is demonstrated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) in
   Japan resulted in significant releases of fission products. While
   substantial data exist concerning outdoor air radioactivity following
   the accident, the resulting indoor radioactivity remains pure
   speculation without a proper method for estimating the ratio of the
   indoor to outdoor airborne radioactivity, termed the airborne sheltering
   factor (ASF). Lacking a meaningful value of the ASF, it is difficult to
   assess the inhalation doses to residents and evacuees even when outdoor
   radionuclide concentrations are available. A simple model was developed
   and the key parameters needed to estimate the ASF were obtained through
   data fitting of selected indoor and outdoor airborne radioactivity
   measurement data obtained following the accident at a single location.
   Using the new model with values of the air exchange rate, interior air
   volume, and the inner surface area of the dwellings, the ASF can be
   estimated for a variety of dwelling types. Assessment of the inhalation
   dose to individuals readily follows from the value of the ASF, the
   person's indoor occupancy factor, and the measured outdoor radioactivity
   concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This research is motivated by the capacity allocation problem at a major
   provider of customized products to the oil and gas drilling industry. We
   formulate a finite-horizon, discrete-time, dynamic programming model in
   which a firm decides how to reserve capacity for emergency demand and
   how to prioritize two classes of regular demand. While regular demand
   can be backlogged, emergency demand will be lost if not fulfilled within
   the period of its arrival. Since backlogging cost accumulates over time,
   we find it optimal for the firm to adopt a dynamic prioritization policy
   that evaluates the priorities of different classes of regular demand
   every period. The optimal prioritization involves metrics that measure
   backlogging losses from various perspectives. We fully characterize the
   firm's optimal prioritization and reservation policy. Those
   characterizations shed light on managerial insights. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Significant composition-dependent incorporation of N into
   non-substitutional sites is often reported for dilute GaAsN alloys. To
   distinguish (N-N)(As), (N-As)(As), and (As-Ga-N-As) complexes, we
   compare Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and nuclear reaction
   analysis (NRA) spectra with Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics simulations
   along the {[}100], {[}110], and {[}111] directions. For the Monte Carlo
   simulation, we assume that (N-N)(As) is aligned along the {[}111]
   direction, while (N-As) As is aligned along the {[}010] direction. The
   measured channeling NRA spectra exhibit the highest (lowest) yield in
   the {[}111] ({[}100]) directions. Similar trends are observed for
   simulations of (N-As)(As), suggesting that (N-As)(As) is the dominant
   interstitial complex in dilute GaAsN. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a compact, robust, and stable terahertz source based on a

   optical beams of the two section digital distributed feedback laser
   diode. The laser is designed to offer an adjustable terahertz frequency
   difference between the emitted wavelengths by varying the applied
   currents to the laser sections. The plasmonic photomixer is comprised of
   an ultrafast photoconductor with plasmonic contact electrodes integrated
   with a logarithmic spiral antenna. We demonstrate terahertz wave
   generation with 0.15-3 THz frequency tunability, 2 MHz linewidth, and
   less than 5 MHz frequency stability over 1 minute, at useful power

   However, it suffers from a mismatch between the hole diffusion length

   substrate photoanode. Due to the supported destructive interference and
   surface plasmon resonance, photons are efficiently absorbed in an
   ultrathin hematite film. Compared with ultrathin hematite photoanodes
   with nanophotonic structures, this photoanode has comparable photon
   absorption but with intrinsically lower recombination losses due to its

Title = {{Mechanical performance of ECC with high-volume fly ash after
   sub-elevated temperatures}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{82-89}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) are known for their
   strain-hardening behavior under tension, and have been increasingly
   applied in engineering practice. However, the lack of understanding
   about the performance of ECC exposed to elevated temperatures limits
   their application in some special fields. Therefore, the residual
   mechanical performance of ECC containing very high volume fly ash (FA/C
   = 4.4) and polyvinyl alcohol fibers (HVFA-ECC) was investigated after
   temperature exposures of 20 degrees C, 50 degrees C, 100 degrees C and
   200 degrees C, considering the melting temperature of polyvinyl alcohol
   fiber is about 230 degrees C. The test results indicated that HVFA-ECC
   maintains its unique multiple cracking and pseudo strain hardening
   characteristics after temperature exposure within this range. The
   tensile properties, including the ultimate tensile strength and tensile
   strain capacity, increased after the 50 degrees C and 100 degrees C
   treatments, but diminished after the 200 degrees C exposure. To better
   understand the impacts of thermal exposure, tests were carried out on
   the fiber tensile strength, fiber/matrix interfacial bond and matrix
   fracture toughness. It was found that the fiber's tensile strength
   retained its room temperature value up to 100 degrees C exposure, but
   dropped significantly after undergoing the 200 degrees C heating. The
   interface parameters (chemical bonding G(d) and frictional bonding
   tau(0)) and the strain-hardening index (J'(b)/J(tip)) have a similar
   trend as the composite tensile properties, which explained the variation
   of composite response with thermal treatment. The test results indicates
   that HVFA-ECC can resist a sub-elevated temperature (<= 200 degrees C)
   exposure, and a moderate temperature treatment (<= 100 degrees C) may
   actually enhance ECC's tensile properties. This study provides a
   scientific basis for further development of ECC for elevated temperature
   applications and also a possible technique to improve ECC's mechanical
   properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{9702-9710}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that the Martian global dust storm occurred
   in 2001 had a long-term influence on high-altitude photoelectron fluxes
   by analyzing the observations of the magnetometer/electron reflectometer
   instrument on board Mars Global Surveyor, most likely because the dust
   altered the neutral atmosphere in a significant way in terms of
   photoelectron production and loss. This study investigates candidate
   atmospheres that can replicate observations, especially focusing on the
   role that thermospheric composition and density play in high-altitude
   photoelectrons. Through the simulations of our SuperThermal Electron
   Transport model, it is found that high-altitude photoelectron fluxes at
   more field-aligned pitch angles are very sensitive to composition change
   and surprisingly independent of density. For more perpendicular pitch
   angles, both composition and density take part in determining
   photoelectron fluxes. Also, a CO2 atmosphere is the only one of the
   tested atmospheres that can qualitatively match the observation, which
   suggests that the global dust storm might have altered the photoelectron
   fluxes via causing CO2 to be the dominant species at a much larger
   altitude range than usual.}},

Abstract = {{We report a Si nanocrystal thin film consisting of free-standing Si

   by chemical etching of Si powder, followed by filtering. After being
   mixed with SiO2 sol-gel and thermally annealed, a broadband
   photoluminescence (PL) from the thin film was observed. The RGB ratio of
   the PL can be tuned by changing the annealing temperature or atmosphere,
   which is 1.00/3.26/4.59 for the pure white light emission. The origins
   of the PL components could be due to differences in oxygen-passivation
   degree for Si nanocrystals. The results may find applications in
   white-light Si lasing and Si lighting.}},

Title = {{Computational fluid dynamics simulations of blood flow regularized by 3D
   phase contrast MRI}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is used
   clinically for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular flow and
   function, as it is capable of providing directly-measured 3D velocity
   maps. Alternatively, vascular flow can be estimated from model-based
   computation fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. CFD provides arbitrarily
   high resolution, but its accuracy hinges on model assumptions, while
   velocity fields measured with PC-MRI generally do not satisfy the
   equations of fluid dynamics, provide limited resolution, and suffer from
   partial volume effects. The purpose of this study is to develop a
   proof-of-concept numerical procedure for constructing a simulated flow
   field that is influenced by both direct PC-MRI measurements and a fluid
   physics model, thereby taking advantage of both the accuracy of PC-MRI
   and the high spatial resolution of CFD. The use of the proposed approach
   in regularizing 3D flow fields is evaluated.
   Methods: The proposed algorithm incorporates both a Newtonian fluid
   physics model and a linear PC-MRI signal model. The model equations are
   solved numerically using a modified CFD algorithm. The numerical
   solution corresponds to the optimal solution of a generalized Tikhonov
   regularization, which provides a flow field that satisfies the flow
   physics equations, while being close enough to the measured PC-MRI
   velocity profile. The feasibility of the proposed approach is
   demonstrated on data from the carotid bifurcation of one healthy
   volunteer, and also from a pulsatile carotid flow phantom.
   Results: The proposed solver produces flow fields that are in better
   agreement with direct PC-MRI measurements than CFD alone, and converges
   faster, while closely satisfying the fluid dynamics equations. For the
   implementation that provided the best results, the signal-to-error ratio
   (with respect to the PC-MRI measurements) in the phantom experiment was
   6.56 dB higher than that of conventional CFD; in the in vivo experiment,
   it was 2.15 dB higher.
   Conclusions: The proposed approach allows partial or complete
   measurements to be incorporated into a modified CFD solver, for
   improving the accuracy of the resulting flow fields estimates. This can
   be used for reducing scan time, increasing the spatial resolution,
   and/or denoising the PC-MRI measurements.}},

Title = {{An exploration of grip force regulation with a low-impedance myoelectric
   prosthesis featuring referred haptic feedback}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Haptic display technologies are well suited to relay
   proprioceptive, force, and contact cues from a prosthetic terminal
   device back to the residual limb and thereby reduce reliance on visual
   feedback. The ease with which an amputee interprets these haptic cues,
   however, likely depends on whether their dynamic signal behavior
   corresponds to expected behaviors-behaviors consonant with a natural
   limb coupled to the environment. A highly geared motor in a terminal
   device along with the associated high back-drive impedance influences
   dynamic interactions with the environment, creating effects not
   encountered with a natural limb. Here we explore grasp and lift
   performance with a backdrivable (low backdrive impedance) terminal
   device placed under proportional myoelectric position control that
   features referred haptic feedback.
   Methods: We fabricated a back-drivable terminal device that could be
   used by amputees and non-amputees alike and drove aperture (or grip
   force, when a stiff object was in its grasp) in proportion to a
   myoelectric signal drawn from a single muscle site in the forearm. In
   randomly ordered trials, we assessed the performance of N=10
   participants (7 non-amputee, 3 amputee) attempting to grasp and lift an
   object using the terminal device under three feedback conditions (no
   feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and joint torque feedback), and two
   object weights that were indiscernible by vision.
   Results: Both non-amputee and amputee participants scaled their grip
   force according to the object weight. Our results showed only minor
   differences in grip force, grip/ load force coordination, and slip as a
   function of sensory feedback condition, though the grip force at the
   point of lift-off for the heavier object was significantly greater for
   amputee participants in the presence of joint torque feedback. An
   examination of grip/ load force phase plots revealed that our amputee
   participants used larger safety margins and demonstrated less
   coordination than our non-amputee participants.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that a backdrivable terminal device may
   hold advantages over non-backdrivable devices by allowing grip/ load
   force coordination consistent with behaviors observed in the natural
   limb. Likewise, the inconclusive effect of referred haptic feedback on
   grasp and lift performance suggests the need for additional testing that
   includes adequate training for participants.}},

Title = {{Stimuli-Responsive Supramolecular Hydrogels with High Extensibility and
   Fast Self-Healing via Precoordinated Mussel-Inspired Chemistry}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Supramolecular hydrogels have the advantages of stimuli responsiveness
   and self-healing compared to covalently cross-linked hydrogels. However,
   the existing supramolecular hydrogels are usually poor in mechanical
   properties, especially in extensibility. In addition, these
   supramolecular hydrogels need a long self-healing time and have a low
   self-healing efficiency. In this manuscript, we report a novel strategy
   to develop highly extensible and fast self-healing supramolecular
   hydrogels by using precoordinated mussel-inspired catechol-Fe3+
   complexes as dynamic cross-linkers. The hydrogel can be fabricated and
   cast into various shapes by one-step photo-crosslinking. Thus,
   fabricated hydrogels can be stretched beyond 10 times their original
   lengths, and the high extensibility can completely recover within a very
   short time (less than 20 min) even after the hydrogels are entirely cut
   apart. Utilizing the dynamic nature of supramolecular hydrogels, we can
   realize different mechanical behaviors, including strength,
   extensibility, and recoverability by varying the loading conditions. In
   addition, the hydrogels respond to multiple stimuli, including
   mechanical force, temperature, and certain chemicals because of the
   dynamic catechol-Fe3+ bond.}},

Title = {{NMDA Receptors Mediate Stimulus-Timing-Dependent Plasticity and Neural
   Synchrony in the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Auditory information relayed by auditory nerve fibers and somatosensory
   information relayed by granule cell parallel fibers converge on the
   fusiform cells (FCs) of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the first brain
   station of the auditory pathway. In vitro, parallel fiber synapses on
   FCs exhibit spike-timing-dependent plasticity with Hebbian learning
   rules, partially mediated by the NMDA receptor (NMDAr). Well-timed
   bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation, in vivo equivalent of
   spike-timing-dependent plasticity, can induce stimulus-timing-dependent
   plasticity (StTDP) of the FCs spontaneous and tone-evoked firing rates.
   In healthy guinea pigs, the resulting distribution of StTDP learning
   rules across a FC neural population is dominated by a Hebbian profile
   while anti-Hebbian, suppressive and enhancing LRs are less frequent. In
   this study, we investigate in vivo, the NMDAr contribution to FC
   baseline activity and long term plasticity. We find that blocking the
   NMDAr decreases the synchronization of FC- spontaneous activity and
   mediates differential modulation of FC rate-level functions such that
   low, and high threshold units are more likely to increase, and decrease,
   respectively, their maximum amplitudes. Three significant alterations in
   mean learning-rule profiles were identified: transitions from an initial
   Hebbian profile towards (1) an anti-Hebbian; (2) a suppressive profile;
   and (3) transitions from an anti-Hebbian to a Hebbian profile. FC units
   preserving their learning rules showed instead, NMDAr-dependent
   plasticity to unimodal acoustic stimulation, with persistent depression
   of tone-evoked responses changing to persistent enhancement following
   the NMDAr antagonist. These results reveal a crucial role of the NMDAr
   in mediating FC baseline activity and long-term plasticity which have
   important implications for signal processing and auditory pathologies
   related to maladaptive plasticity of dorsal cochlear nucleus circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal transport properties of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)
   developed for molecular storage and catalytic separations play an
   important role in adsorption or catalysis processes but are rarely
   reported. We calculate the anisotropic thermal conductivities (kappa) of
   water-stable Zn-MOF-74 with the Boltzmann transport equation and the
   density-functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) method, which allows for a
   sufficiently large number of atoms in the simulations without much
   compromise on accuracy. We find an anisotropic kappa of 0.44 and 0.68
   W/m K at 300 K, across and along the pore directions, with acoustic
   contributions of 8\% and 30\%, respectively. These unusually low
   acoustic contributions are explained by the rattling-like behavior of
   phonons with large vibrational amplitude, low group velocity, and large
   scattering rate, which are caused by the unique 1-D tubing bundle
   structure. On the other hand, the cylindrical pores enable larger phonon
   speed and higher directional structural rigidity along the pore
   direction, leading to a higher kappa. The frequency-accumulated,
   directional kappa is explained using the spectral analysis and
   correlated to the structure characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) are
   rarely continuously measured using portable emission measurement systems
   (PEMSs). In this study, we utilize a PEMS to obtain real-world BC
   emission profiles for 25 HDDVs in China. The average fuel-based BC
   emissions of HDDVs certified according to Euro II, III, IV, and V
   standards are 2224 +/- 251, 612 +/- 740, 453 +/- 584, and 152 +/- 3 mg
   kg(-1), respectively. Notably, HDDVs adopting mechanical pump engines
   had significantly higher BC emissions than those equipped with
   electronic injection engines. Applying the useful features of PEMSs, we
   can relate instantaneous BC emissions to driving conditions using an
   operating mode binning methodology, and the average emission rates for
   Euro II to Euro IV diesel trucks can be constructed. From a macroscopic
   perspective, we observe that average speed is a significant factor
   affecting BC emissions and is well correlated with distance-based
   emissions (R-2 = 0.71). Therefore, the average fuel-based and
   distance-based BC emissions on congested roads are 40 and 125\% higher
   than those on freeways. These results should be taken into consideration
   in future emission inventory studies.}},

Abstract = {{We study the solar wind interaction with the Martian upper atmosphere
   during the 8 March 2015 interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) by
   using a global multifluid MHD model. Comparison of the simulation
   results with observations from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN
   (MAVEN) spacecraft shows good agreement. The total ion escape rate is
   increased by an order of magnitude, from 2.05 x 10(24) s(-1) (pre-ICME
   phase) to 2.25 x 10(25) s(-1) (ICME sheath phase), during this time
   period. Two major ion escape channels are illustrated: accelerated
   pickup ion loss through the dayside plume and ionospheric ion loss
   through the nightside plasma wake region. Interestingly, the tailward
   ion loss is significantly increased at the ejecta phase. Both bow shock
   and magnetic pileup boundary (BS and MPB) locations are decreased from
   (1.2R(M), 1.57R(M)) at the pre-ICME phase to (1.16R(M), 1.47R(M)),
   respectively, during the sheath phase along the dayside Mars-Sun line.
   Furthermore, both simulation and observational results indicate that
   there is no significant variation in the Martian ionosphere (at
   altitudes less than or similar to 200 km, i.e., the photochemical
   region) during this event.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing observations suggest Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) albedo
   has declined since 2001, even in the dry snow zone. We seek to explain
   the apparent dry snow albedo decline. We analyze samples representing
   2012-2014 snowfall across NW Greenland for black carbon and dust
   light-absorbing impurities (LAI) and model their impacts on snow albedo.
   Albedo reductions due to LAI are small, averaging 0.003, with episodic
   enhancements resulting in reductions of 0.01-0.02. No significant
   increase in black carbon or dust concentrations relative to recent
   decades is found. Enhanced deposition of LAI is not, therefore, causing
   significant dry snow albedo reduction or driving melt events. Analysis
   of Collection 5 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   surface reflectance data indicates that the decline and spectral shift
   in dry snow albedo contains important contributions from uncorrected
   Terra sensor degradation. Though discrepancies are mostly below the
   stated accuracy of MODIS products, they will require revisiting some
   prior conclusions with C6 data.}},

Abstract = {{The high demand for the expensive and scarce Pt as the catalysts in the
   cathodes is a severe obstacle in fuel cells. Here we describe a facile
   method for the rapid synthesis of Mo@Pt core-shell nanoparticles
   supported on carbon XC-72R (Mo@Pt/C) through thermal decomposition
   combined with chemical reduction to develop an efficient electrocatalyst
   for oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. The nanostructures and
   electrochemical properties of the as-prepared Mo@Pt/C catalysts were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), angle-resolved X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-angle annular dark-field scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results show that
   Mo@Pt nanoparticles dispersed uniformly on the surface of XC-72R.
   Compared with the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst, the Mo@Pt/C
   catalysts exhibit improved ORR catalytic activity and stability.
   Therefore, the Mo@Pt/C catalysts will hopefully be as an efficient
   electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDIn men with clinically localized prostate cancer who have
   undergone at least 1 previous negative biopsy and have elevated serum
   prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, long-term health outcomes
   associated with the assessment of urinary prostate cancer antigen 3
   (PCA3) and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2):v-ets
   erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) (ERG) gene fusion
   (T2:ERG) have not been investigated previously in relation to the
   decision to recommend a repeat biopsy.
   METHODSThe authors performed a decision analysis using a decision tree
   for men with elevated PSA levels. The probability of cancer was
   estimated using the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator
   (version 2.0). The use of PSA alone was compared with the use of PCA3
   and T2:ERG scores, with each evaluated independently, in combination
   with PSA to trigger a repeat biopsy. When PCA3 and T2:ERG score
   evaluations were used, predefined thresholds were established to
   determine whether the patient should undergo a repeat biopsy. Biopsy
   outcomes were defined as either positive (with a Gleason score of <7, 7,
   or >7) or negative. Probabilities and estimates of 10-year overall
   survival and 15-year cancer-specific survival were derived from previous
   studies and a literature review. Outcomes were defined as age-dependent
   and Gleason score-dependent 10-year overall and 15-year cancer-specific
   survival rates and the percentage of biopsies avoided.
   RESULTSIncorporating the PCA3 score (biopsy threshold, 25; generated
   based on the urine PCA3 level normalized to the amount of PSA messenger
   RNA) or the T2:ERG score (biopsy threshold, 10; based on the urine
   T2:ERG level normalized to the amount of PSA messenger RNA) into the
   decision to recommend repeat biopsy would have avoided 55.4\% or 64.7\%
   of repeat biopsies for the base-case patient, respectively, and changes
   in the 10-year survival rate were only 0.93\% or 1.41\%, respectively.
   Multi-way sensitivity analyses suggested that these results were robust
   with respect to the model parameters.
   CONCLUSIONSThe use of PCA3 or T2:ERG testing for repeat biopsy decisions
   can substantially reduce the number of biopsies without significantly
   affecting 10-year survival. Cancer 2015;121:4071-4079. (c) 2015 American
   Cancer Society.
   Newly developed biomarkers for prostate cancer are associated with
   repeat biopsy outcomes, but their impact on survival rates and on the
   number of unnecessary biopsies remains unclear. The current results
   indicate that new biomarkers significantly reduce the number of biopsies
   performed at the expense of some reduction in survival.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrated that the improvement in optical and electrical
   performance of high power LEDs was achieved using cone-shaped patterned
   sapphire substrate (PSS) and strip-shaped SiO2 distributed current
   blocking layer (DCBL). We found through transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) observation that densities of both the screw dislocation and edge
   dislocation existing in GaN epitaxial layer grown on PSS were much less
   than that of GaN epitaxial layer grown on flat sapphire substrate (FSS).
   Compared to LED grown on FSS, LED grown on PSS showed higher
   sub-threshold forward-bias voltage and lower reverse leakage current,
   resulting in an enhancement in device reliability. We also designed a
   strip-shaped SiO2 DCBL beneath a strip-shaped p-electrode, which
   prevents the current from being concentrated on regions immediately
   adjacent the strip-shaped p-electrode, thereby facilitating uniform
   current spreading into the active region. By implementing strip-shaped
   SiO2 DCBL, light output power of high power PSS-LED chip could be
   further increased by 13\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pore damage in cementitious binders caused by deicer salt frost exposure}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{204-216}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Pore structure measurements on scaled-off materials from concrete
   specimens subjected to deicer salt frost exposure and on the control
   mortar samples were undertaken in order to better understand the causes
   for deicer salt scaling. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained and
   the results clearly demonstrate that pore damage is severe with an
   increase in apparent capillary porosity of over 50\%. This is strong
   evidence of excessive pore pressure due to ice-growth within the surface
   region, which is promoted by the additional liquid present in the salt
   solution on concrete surface. The 3-D pore stresses in the surface zone
   result in residual compressive stresses within the two confined
   directions (length and width) and a net tensile stress in the unconfined
   direction. This stress state causes ``popout{''} of the cement paste.
   Ice nucleation and associated growth is controlled by paste pore
   structure that governs the rate of liquid transport by suction.
   Effective means of mitigating deicer salt scaling are: reduction in
   paste porosity by lowering water-binder (w/b) ratio or by means of
   pozzolanic reactions; utilization of hydrophobic surface treatment using
   silanes. A refined sorptivity model is presented to evaluate the scaling
   resistance of concrete. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We aimed to develop a hippocampal vascular injury surrogate
   marker for early prediction of late neurocognitive dysfunction in
   patients receiving brain radiation therapy (RT).
   Methods and Materials: Twenty-seven patients (17 males and 10 females,
   31-80 years of age) were enrolled in an institutional review
   board-approved prospective longitudinal study. Patients received
   diagnoses of low-grade glioma or benign tumor and were treated by (3D)
   conformal or intensity-modulated RT with a median dose of 54 Gy
   (50.4-59.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions). Six dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI
   scans were performed from pre-RT to 18-month post-RT, and quantified for
   vascular parameters related to blood-brain barrier permeability,
   K-trans, and the fraction of blood plasma volume, V-p. The temporal
   changes in the means of hippocampal transfer constant K-trans and V-p
   after starting RT were modeled by integrating the dose effects with age,
   sex, hippocampal laterality, and presence of tumor or edema near a
   hippocampus. Finally, the early vascular dose response in hippocampi was
   correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction at 6 and 18 months post-RT.
   Results: The mean K-trans Increased significantly from pre-RT to 1-month
   post-RT (P<.0004), which significantly depended on sex (P<.0007) and age
   (P<.00004), with the dose response more pronounced in older females.
   Also, the vascular dose response in the left hippocampus of females
   correlated significantly with changes in memory function at 6 (r =
   -0.95, P<.0006) and 18-months (r = -0.88, P<.02) post-RT.
   Conclusions: The early hippocampal vascular dose response could be a
   predictor of late neurocognitive dysfunction. A personalized hippocampus
   sparing strategy may be considered in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{In silico evaluation and exploration of antibiotic tuberculosis
   treatment regimens}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Improvement in tuberculosis treatment regimens requires
   selection of antibiotics and dosing schedules from a large design space
   of possibilities. Incomplete knowledge of antibiotic and host immune
   dynamics in tuberculosis granulomas impacts clinical trial design and
   success, and variations among clinical trials hamper side-by-side
   comparison of regimens. Our objective is to systematically evaluate the
   efficacy of isoniazid and rifampin regimens, and identify modifications
   to these antibiotics that improve treatment outcomes.
   Results: We pair a spatio-temporal computational model of host immunity
   with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on isoniazid and rifampin.
   The model is calibrated to plasma pharmacokinetic and granuloma
   bacterial load data from non-human primate models of tuberculosis and to
   tissue and granuloma measurements of isoniazid and rifampin in rabbit
   granulomas. We predict the efficacy of regimens containing different
   doses and frequencies of isoniazid and rifampin. We predict impacts of
   pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modifications on antibiotic efficacy. We
   demonstrate that suboptimal antibiotic concentrations within granulomas
   lead to poor performance of intermittent regimens compared to daily
   regimens. Improvements from dose and frequency changes are limited by
   inherent antibiotic properties, and we propose that changes in
   intracellular accumulation ratios and antimicrobial activity would lead
   to the most significant improvements in treatment outcomes. Results
   suggest that an increased risk of drug resistance in fully intermittent
   as compared to daily regimens arises from higher bacterial population
   levels early during treatment.
   Conclusions: Our systems pharmacology approach complements efforts to
   accelerate tuberculosis therapeutic development.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm to simulate the many-body depletion interaction
   between anisotropic colloids in an implicit way, integrating out the
   degrees of freedom of the depletants, which we treat as an ideal gas.
   Because the depletant particles are statistically independent and the
   depletion interaction is short-ranged, depletants are randomly inserted
   in parallel into the excluded volume surrounding a single translated
   and/or rotated colloid. A configurational bias scheme is used to enhance
   the acceptance rate. The method is validated and benchmarked both on
   multi-core processors and graphics processing units for the case of hard
   spheres, hemispheres, and discoids. With depletants, we report novel
   cluster phases in which hemispheres first assemble into spheres, which
   then form ordered hcp/fcc lattices. The method is significantly faster
   than any method without cluster moves and that tracks depletants
   explicitly, for systems of colloid packing fraction phi(c) < 0.50, and
   additionally enables simulation of the fluid-solid transition. (C) 2015

Title = {{Evaluating Serum Markers for Hormone Receptor-Negative Breast Cancer}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading
   cause of cancer death in females worldwide. Death rates have been
   declining, largely as a result of early detection through mammography
   and improved treatment, but mammographic screening is controversial
   because of over-diagnosis of breast disease that might not require
   treatment, and under-diagnosis of cancer in women with dense breasts.
   Breast cancer screening could be improved by pairing mammography with a
   tumor circulating marker, of which there are currently none. Given
   genomic similarities between the basal breast cancer subtype and serous
   ovarian cancer, and given our success in identifying circulating markers
   for ovarian cancer, we investigated the performance in hormone
   receptor-negative breast cancer detection of both previously identified
   ovarian serum markers and circulating markers associated with
   transcripts that were differentially expressed in breast cancer tissue
   compared to healthy breast tissue from reduction mammaplasties.
   Methods
   We evaluated a total of 15 analytes (13 proteins, 1 miRNA, 1
   autoantibody) in sera drawn at or before breast cancer surgery from 43
   breast cancer cases (28 triple-negative-TN-and 15 hormone
   receptor-negative-HRN-/HER2-positive) and 87 matched controls.
   Results
   In the analysis of our whole cohort of breast cancer cases,
   autoantibodies to TP53 performed significantly better than the other
   selected 14 analytes showing 25.6\% and 34.9\% sensitivity at 95\% and
   90\% specificity respectively with AUC: 0.7 (p<0.001). The subset of 28
   TN cancers showed very similar results. We observed no correlation
   between anti-TP53 and the 14 other markers; however, anti-TP53
   expression correlated with Body-Mass-Index. It did not correlate with
   tumor size, positive lymph nodes, tumor stage, the presence of
   metastases or recurrence.
   Conclusion
   None of the 13 serum proteins nor miRNA 135b identified women with HRN
   or TN breast cancer. TP53 autoantibodies identified women with HRN
   breast cancer and may have potential for early detection, confirming
   earlier reports. TP53 autoantibodies are long lasting in serum but may
   be affected by storage duration. Autoantibodies to TP53 might correlate
   with Body-Mass-Index.}},

Title = {{Grain boundary resistance to amorphization of nanocrystalline silicon
   carbide}},
Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Under the C displacement condition, we have used molecular dynamics
   simulation to examine the effects of grain boundaries (GBs) on the
   amorphization of nanocrystalline silicon carbide (nc-SiC) by point
   defect accumulation. The results show that the interstitials are
   preferentially absorbed and accumulated at GBs that provide the sinks
   for defect annihilation at low doses, but also driving force to initiate
   amorphization in the nc-SiC at higher doses. The majority of surviving
   defects are C interstitials, as either C-Si or C-C dumbbells. The
   concentration of defect clusters increases with increasing dose, and
   their distributions are mainly observed along the GBs. Especially these
   small clusters can subsequently coalesce and form amorphous domains at
   the GBs during the accumulation of carbon defects. A comparison between
   displacement amorphized nc-SiC and melt-quenched single crystal SiC
   shows the similar topological features. At a dose of 0.55 displacements
   per atom (dpa), the pair correlation function lacks long range order,
   demonstrating that the nc-SiC is fully amorphilized.}},

Abstract = {{We model the adsorption of hydrophobically ethoxylated urethane (HEUR)
   thickeners onto two hydrophobic surfaces separated by a 50 nm gallery
   using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) with implicit solvent
   and three-dimensional self-consistent field theory (SCFT) with explicit
   solvent. The CG-MD simulations can be readily extended to encompass very
   long HEUR chains (up to 540 EO groups) but cannot with current computer
   speed simulate adsorption of HEURs with hydrophobes longer than 12
   carbons (C12). The SCFT method can readily simulate HEURs with longer,
   C16, hydrophobes but has a greater challenge simulating very long EO
   chains. For HEURs with 180 EO units and C8 and C12 hydrophobes, both
   methods can be applied, allowing a combination of the two methods to
   span much of the parameter space of interest to experimentalists. It is
   demonstrated that depending on the hydrophobe strength and the HEUR
   concentration, HEUR chains can adsorb to the surfaces directly or
   indirectly (as adsorbed micelles or admicelles). We show that for
   hydrophobes as large or larger than C12 micellization and subsequent
   adsorption of the micelles play an important role in accurate prediction
   of adsorption isotherms and the structure of adsorbed layers and that
   micelles in solution form nodes that allow two or more HEUR chains to
   bridge the gallery between the two surfaces. The study suggests the need
   to investigate the influence of admicelles on the effective steric
   interaction potential, which, in turn, will influence both colloidal
   stability and rheology of HEUR thickened latex paints.}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{We show temporal and frequency information can be effectively encoded in
   memristive devices with inherent short-term dynamics. Ag/Ag2S/Pd based
   memristive devices with low programming voltage (similar to 100 mV) were
   fabricated and tested. At weak programming conditions, the devices
   exhibit inherent decay due to spontaneous diffusion of the Ag atoms.
   When the devices were subjected to pulse train inputs emulating
   different spiking patterns, the switching probability distribution
   function diverges from the standard Poisson distribution and evolves
   according to the input pattern. The experimentally observed switching
   probability distributions and the associated cumulative probability
   functions can be well-explained using a model accounting for the
   short-term decay effects. Such devices offer an intriguing opportunity
   to directly encode neural signals for neural information storage and
   analysis. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model quantifying the effect of temperature variations on

   inspected as important metrics that dominate the energy requirements and
   noise immunity when the device is incorporated into large systems. To
   study the dynamic thermal noise, the effect of the Langevin thermal

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Using multi-step deposition mode, we developed an innovational strategy
   of homogenously multi-layered (HM) structure to tailor the roughening
   kinetics of sputtered W films. Dynamic scaling analysis showed that all
   sublayers of HM W films exhibited the same anomalous roughening
   behavior, which originated from the limited surface diffusion.
   Intriguingly, different from its single-layered counterpart, the HM W
   films exhibited a suppression effect of kinetic roughening, which could
   be well manipulated by film modulation period. Detailed experimental
   characterization and phenomenological model analysis suggested that this
   roughening suppression arises from the multi-interruption of the
   continuous film roughening process, forming an interlayer interface
   after every interruption and restarting the sublayer roughening on the

Abstract = {{Through in situ indentation of TiN in a high-resolution transmission
   electron microscope, the nucleation of full as well as partial
   dislocations has been observed from \{001\} and \{111\} surfaces,
   respectively. The critical elastic strains associated with the
   nucleation of the dislocations were analyzed from the recorded atomic
   displacements, and the nucleation stresses corresponding to the measured
   critical strains were computed using density functional theory. The
   resolved shear stress was estimated to be 13.8 GPa for the partial
   dislocation 1/6 <110> \{111\} and 6.7 GPa for the full dislocation 1/2
   <110> \{110\}. Such an approach of quantifying nucleation stresses for
   defects via in situ high-resolution experiment coupled with density
   functional theory calculation may be applied to other unit processes.}},

Title = {{Learning to walk with an adaptive gain proportional myoelectric
   controller for a robotic ankle exoskeleton}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Robotic ankle exoskeletons can provide assistance to users
   and reduce metabolic power during walking. Our research group has
   investigated the use of proportional myoelectric control for controlling
   robotic ankle exoskeletons. Previously, these controllers have relied on
   a constant gain to map user's muscle activity to actuation control
   signals. A constant gain may act as a constraint on the user, so we
   designed a controller that dynamically adapts the gain to the user's
   myoelectric amplitude. We hypothesized that an adaptive gain
   proportional myoelectric controller would reduce metabolic energy
   expenditure compared to walking with the ankle exoskeleton unpowered
   because users could choose their preferred control gain.
   Methods: We tested eight healthy subjects walking with the adaptive gain
   proportional myoelectric controller with bilateral ankle exoskeletons.
   The adaptive gain was updated each stride such that on average the
   user's peak muscle activity was mapped to maximal power output of the
   exoskeleton. All subjects participated in three identical training
   sessions where they walked on a treadmill for 50 minutes (30 minutes of
   which the exoskeleton was powered) at 1.2 ms(-1). We calculated and
   analyzed metabolic energy consumption, muscle recruitment, inverse
   kinematics, inverse dynamics, and exoskeleton mechanics.
   Results: Using our controller, subjects achieved a metabolic reduction
   similar to that seen in previous work in about a third of the training
   time. The resulting controller gain was lower than that seen in previous
   work (beta = 1.50 +/- 0.14 versus a constant beta = 2). The adapted gain
   allowed users more total ankle joint power than that of unassisted
   walking, increasing ankle power in exchange for a decrease in hip power.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that humans prefer to walk with
   greater ankle mechanical power output than their unassisted gait when
   provided with an ankle exoskeleton using an adaptive controller. This
   suggests that robotic assistance from an exoskeleton can allow humans to
   adopt gait patterns different from their normal choices for locomotion.
   In our specific experiment, subjects increased ankle power and decreased
   hip power to walk with a reduction in metabolic cost. Future exoskeleton
   devices that rely on proportional myolectric control are likely to
   demonstrate improved performance by including an adaptive gain.}},

Abstract = {{Phase transformations induced in the cubic C-type lanthanide
   sesquioxides, Ln(2)O(3) (Ln = Sm, Gd, Ho, Tm, and Lu), by dense
   electronic excitation are investigated. The structural modifications
   resulting from exposure to beams of 185 MeV Xe and 2246 MeV Au ions are
   characterized using synchrotron x-ray diffraction and Raman
   spectroscopy. The formation of a B-type polymorph, an X-type
   nonequilibrium phase, and an amorphous phase are observed. The specific
   phase formed and the transformation rate show dependence on the material
   composition, as well as the ion beam mass and energy. Atomistic
   mechanisms for these transformations are determined, indicating that
   formation of the B-type phase results from the production of
   anti-Frenkel defects and the aggregation of anion vacancies into planar
   clusters, whereas formation of the X-type and amorphous phases requires
   extensive displacement of both anions and cations. The observed
   variations in phase behavior with changing lanthanide ionic radius and
   deposited electronic energy density are related to the energetics of
   these transformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Single-phase polycrystalline powders of Fe1-xSnxSb2Se4 (x = 0 and 0.13)
   were synthesized by a solid-state reaction of the elements at 773 K.
   X-ray diffraction on Fe0.87Sn0.13Sb2Se4 single-crystal and powder
   samples indicates that the compound is isostructural to FeSb2Se4 in the
   temperature range from 80 to 500 K, crystallizing in the monoclinic
   space group C2/m (No. 12). Electron-transport data reveal a marginal
   alteration in the resistivity, whereas the thermopower drops by similar
   to 60\%. This suggests a decrease in the activation energy upon
   isoelectronic substitution of 13\% Fe by Sn. Magnetic susceptibility and
   magnetization measurements from 2 to 500 K reveal that the
   Fe1-xSb2SnxSe4 phases exhibit ferromagnetic behavior up to similar to
   450 K (x = 0) and 325 K (x = 0.13). Magnetotransport data for FeSb2Se4
   reveal large negative magnetoresistance, suggesting spin polarization of
   free carriers in the sample. The high-T-c ferromagnetism in
   Fe1-xSnxSb2Se4 phases and the decrease in Tc of the Fe0.87Sn0.13Sb2Se4
   sample are rationalized by taking into account (1) the separation
   between neighboring magnetic centers in the crystal structures and (2)
   the formation of bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to induce
   long-range ferromagnetic ordering.}},

Abstract = {{The conic sector theorem is a powerful input-output stability analysis
   tool, providing a fine balance between generality and simplicity of
   system characterisations that is conducive to practical stability
   analysis and robust controller synthesis. Without means to
   systematically identify and impose exterior conic properties, existing
   analysis and synthesis methods are limited to employing a special case
   of the conic sector theorem which may prove overly conservative when
   considering very strictly passive plants. This paper removes the current
   limitation by establishing the exterior conic sector lemma, which
   provides matrix inequalities equivalent to exterior conic bounds for
   linear time-invariant systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper physically and numerically models the influence of biofilms
   on heavy metal removal in a gravel filter. Experimental flow columns
   were constructed to determine the removal of Cu, Pb and Zn by gabbro and
   dolomite gravel lithologies with and without natural biofilm from
   sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS). Breakthrough experiments
   showed that, whilst abiotic gravel filters removed up to 51\% of metals,
   those with biofilms enhanced heavy metal removal by up to a further
   29\%, with Cu removal illustrating the greatest response to biofilm
   growth. An advection-diffusion equation successfully modelled metal
   tracer transport within biofilm columns. This model yielded a permanent
   loss term (k) for metal tracers of between 0.01 and 1.05, correlating
   well with measured data from breakthrough experiments. Additional 16S
   rRNA clone library analysis of the biofilm indicated strong sensitivity
   of bacterial community composition to the lithology of the filter
   medium, with gabbro filters displaying Proteobacteria dominance (54\%)
   and dolomite columns showing Cyanobacteria dominance (47\%).}},

   that uses a novel set of non-anticipativity constraints to capture the
   dynamic multi-stage nature of appointment requests as well as the
   sequencing of customers. We describe several ways to improve the
   computational efficiency of decomposition methods to solve our model. We
   also present some theoretical findings based on small problems to help
   motivate decision rules for larger problems. Our numerical experiments

Abstract = {{The diversity of engineering education research provides an opportunity
   for cross-fertilization of ideas and creativity, but it also can result
   in fragmentation of the field and duplication of effort. One solution is
   to establish a standardized taxonomy of engineering education terms to
   map the field and communicate and connect research initiatives. This
   report describes the process for developing such a taxonomy, the EER
   Taxonomy. Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education
   research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266
   individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday
   workshop, seven conference sessions, and several other virtual and
   in-person activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms
   arranged in 14 branches and six levels. This taxonomy was found to
   satisfy four criteria for validity and reliability: (1) keywords
   assigned to a set of abstracts were reproducible by multiple
   researchers, (2) the taxonomy comprised terms that could be selected as
   keywords to fully describe 243 articles in three journals, (3) the
   keywords for those 243 articles were evenly distributed across the
   branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the authors of 31 conference papers
   agreed with 90\% of researcher-assigned keywords. This report also
   describes guidelines developed to help authors consistently assign
   keywords for their articles by encouraging them to choose terms from
   three categories: (1) context/focus/topic, (2)
   purpose/target/motivation, and (3) research approach.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{60-67}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae produces a water-insoluble
   organic phase (biocrude) and an aqueous phase that also contains
   algae-derived organic compounds (water-soluble biocrude). We determined
   the influences of the HTL reaction time and algae loading (wt.\% biomass
   in algae paste) on the yields and compositions of these two biocrudes.
   To the best of our knowledge this is the first detailed study of the
   water-soluble biocrude and how its yield and composition vary with
   processing conditions. Increasing the HTL reaction time from 10 to 60
   min led to lower yields of water-soluble biocrude (from 6.4 to 3.6
   wt.\%) and higher yields of water-insoluble biocrude (from 38 to 41
   wt.\%). The total biocrude yield, however, was insensitive to the
   processing time. Longer HTL processing times also led to fewer and
   lighter GC-elutable compounds in the water-soluble biocrude. Increasing
   the algae loading from 8.6 to 18.7 wt.\% led to higher yields of
   water-insoluble biocrude (from 29 to 44 wt.\%) and lower yields of
   water-soluble biocrude (from 6.6 to 2.6 wt.\%). The increase in the
   water-insoluble portion was much greater than the decrease in the
   water-soluble portion, so the total biocrude yield increased with
   loading. Increasing the wt.\% of algae in the slurry placed in the
   reactors also produced biocrudes with greater heating value. HTL of
   algae paste with higher biomass content had the twin benefits of
   providing more total biocrude and a higher quality biocrude. Reaction
   time and algae loading can be used to manipulate the proportions of
   water-soluble biocrude and biocrude that spontaneously separate from the
   aqueous phase after HTL. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   Harvesting}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MECHANICS REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bistable composite laminates have received a considerable attention due
   to their fabulous behavior and potential for morphing and energy
   harvesting. A bistable or multistable laminate is a type of composite
   structure that exhibits multiple stable static configurations. The
   characterization of unsymmetric fiber-reinforced laminated composite
   plates as a bistable structure is well established and quantitatively
   determined after about 30 years of research. As predicting cured shapes
   of unsymmetric composite laminates became well identified, attention was
   directed to the design of these structures for morphing applications.
   Bistable composite laminates have attracted researchers as a morphing
   structure because a bistable structure settles at one of its equilibrium
   positions without demanding continuous power to remain there. If the
   structure is triggered to leave an equilibrium position, it will snap or
   jump to the other equilibrium position. The snapthrough response is
   highly geometrically nonlinear. With the increased demand for broadband
   vibration energy harvesters, bistable composite laminates, which are
   able to gain large-amplitude vibrations in snapthrough motion, have
   recently attracted attention. This paper aims to summarize, review, and
   assess references and findings concerned with the response of bistable
   composite laminates for morphing and energy harvesting to date. It also
   highlights the remaining challenges and possible future research work as
   research in bistable composites transitions from phenomena to
   application.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic power spectrum of the solar wind at 1 AU exhibits a
   breakpoint at a frequency of about 0.1-1 Hz, with the spectrum being
   steeper above the breakpoint than below the breakpoint. Because magnetic
   discontinuities contain much of the Fourier power in the solar wind, it
   is suspected that current sheet thicknesses (i.e., discontinuity
   thicknesses) may play a role in determining the frequency of this
   breakpoint. Using time series measurements of the solar wind magnetic
   field from the Wind spacecraft, the effect of current sheet thicknesses
   on the breakpoint is investigated by time stretching the solar wind time
   series at the locations of current sheets, effectively thickening the
   current sheets in the time series. This localized time stretching
   significantly affects the magnetic power spectral density of the solar
   wind in the vicinity of the high-frequency breakpoint: a substantial
   fraction of the Fourier power at the breakpoint frequency is contained
   in current sheets that occupy a small fraction of the spatial volume of
   the solar wind. It is concluded that current sheet thickness appears to
   play a role in determining the frequency f(B) of the high-frequency
   breakpoint of the magnetic power spectrum of the solar wind. This
   analysis of solar wind data is aided by comparisons with power spectra
   generated from artificial time series.}},

Title = {{Integrated redistricting, location-allocation and service sharing with
   intra-district service transfer to reduce demand overload and its
   disparity}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{132-143}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Service demand overload has been one of the main concerns in
   district-based service planning, because it strongly affects service
   quality. Moreover, the overload problem usually involves overload
   disparity among districts. The disparity often results from outdated
   district boundaries not reflecting up-to-date spatial demand
   distributions. A lack of systematic methodologies, however, has hindered
   solving such overload and disparity problems despite the increasing
   availability of information on spatial service demand and supply. This
   paper presents a novel mathematical programming model to address the
   service demand overload problem by reorganizing services in multiple
   spatial scales. The mathematical program optimizes simultaneously (1)
   redistricting service areas, (2) allocating multiple service resources
   into service-providing units in each district, and (3) sharing services
   between service-providing units within a district. Information on
   geographically distributed units is used as the spatial data of the
   model. This new model integrates districting and location-allocation
   problems as a combined problem. A heuristic solution approach is also
   presented to solve large problem instances. As a case study, a judicial
   service overload problem is examined for a state court system in the
   United States. This new integrated approach enables efficient
   utilization of the geographically distributed service capacity. In
   addition, these new features of the model allow for better utilization
   of spatial information for practical service planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   pumps}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports an evaluation and a comparison of two architectures
   for implementing Si-micromachined high-flow Knudsen pumps. Knudsen
   pumps, which operate on the principle of thermal transpiration, have
   been shown to have great promise for micro-scale gas phase fluidic
   systems such as micro gas chromatographs. Simultaneously achieving both
   a high flow rate and adequate blocking pressure has been a persistent
   challenge, which is addressed in this work by combining multiple pumps
   in series and addressing the resulting challenges in thermal management.
   The basic building block is a Si-micromachined pump with approximate to
   100000 parallel channels in a 4 mm x 6 mm footprint. In the primary
   approach, multiple pump stages are stacked vertically with interleaved
   Si-micromachined spacers. A stacked 4-stage Knudsen pump has a form
   factor of 10 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm. In an alternate approach, multiple stages
   are arranged in a planar array. The experimental results demonstrate
   multiplication of the output pressure head with the number of stages,
   while the flow rate is maintained. For example, a stacked 4-stage
   Knudsen pump with 8 W power operated at atmospheric pressure provided a
   blocking pressure of 0.255 kPa, which was 3.6 x of that provided by a
   single-stage pump with 2 W power; while both provided a approximate to
   30 sccm maximum flow rate. The performance can be customized for
   practical applications such as micro gas chromatography.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To determine how well demographic and clinical factors predict
   the initiation of Active Surveillance (AS).
   METHODS AS has been suggested as a way to reduce overtreatment of men
   who have prostate cancer; however, factors associated with the decision
   to choose AS are poorly quantified. Using the Michigan Urological
   Surgery Improvement Collaborative registry, we identified 2977 men with
   prostate cancer who made treatment decisions from January 1, 2012,
   through December 31, 2013. We used chi-square and Wilcoxon tests to
   examine the association between factors and initiation of AS. Logistic
   regression models were fit for D'Amico risk categories. Measures of
   model discrimination and calibration were estimated, including area
   under the curve (AUC) and Brier score (BS).
   RESULTS Patient age, Gleason score, clinical T-stage, urology practice,
   and tumor volume (greatest percent of a core involved with cancer and
   proportion of positive cores) were associated with the decision to
   choose AS in the intermediate-risk cohort (AUC = 0.875, BS = 0.07) and
   the complete cohort (AUC = 0.89, BS = 0.10). Patient age, urology
   practice, and tumor volume were significant in the low-risk cohort (AUC
   = 0.71, BS = 0.22). The addition of urology practice increased AUC in
   the low-risk cohort from 0.71 to 0.76 and reduced BS from 0.22 to 0.21.
   CONCLUSION The urology practice at which a patient is seen is an
   important predictor for whether patients will initiate AS. Predictions
   were least accurate for low-risk patients, suggesting that factors such
   as patient preference play a role in treatment decisions. (C) 2015

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1951-1970}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive morphing trailing-edge wings have the potential to reduce the
   fuel burn of transport aircraft. However, to take full advantage of this
   technology and to quantify its benefits, design studies are required. To
   address this need, the aerodynamic performance benefits of a morphing
   trailing-edge wing are quantified using aerodynamic design optimization.
   The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
   equations with a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. A gradient-based
   optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an adjoint method
   that computes the required derivatives. The baseline geometry is
   optimized using a multipoint formulation and 192 shape design variables.
   The average drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching
   moment, geometric constraints, and a 2.5g maneuver bending moment
   constraint. The trailing edge of the wing is optimized based on the
   multipoint optimized wing. The trailing-edge morphing is parameterized
   using 90 design variables that are optimized independently for each
   flight condition. A total of 407 trailing-edge optimizations are
   performed at different flight conditions to span the entire cruise
   flight envelope. A 1\% drag reduction at on-design conditions and a 5\%
   drag reduction near off-design conditions are observed. The
   effectiveness of the trailing-edge morphing is demonstrated by comparing
   it with the optimized results of a hypothetical fully morphing wing. In
   addition, the fuel-burn reductions for a number of flights are computed
   using the optimization results. A1\% cruise fuel-burn reduction is
   achieved using an adaptive morphing trailing edge for a typical
   long-haul twin-aisle mission.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a study on the evolution behaviors of the transfer
   characteristics of MoS2 and WSe2 field-effect transistor biosensors when
   they are subjected to tumor necrosis factor-alpha and streptavidin
   solutions with varying analyte concentrations. Both MoS2 and WSe2
   sensors exhibit very low detection limits (similar to 60 fM for tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha detection; similar to 70 fM for streptavidin
   detection). However, WSe2 sensors exhibit the higher linear-regime
   sensitivities in comparison with MoS2 sensors. In particular, WSe2
   sensors exhibit high linear-regime sensitivities up to similar to
   1.54\%/fM for detecting streptavidin at a concentration of similar to 70
   fM. Such relatively higher sensitivities obtained from WSe2 sensors are
   attributed to their intrinsic ambipolar transfer characteristics, which
   make their ON-state carrier concentrations significantly lower than
   those of MoS2 sensors, and therefore, the target-molecule-induced doping
   effect results in more prominent channel conductance modulation in WSe2
   transistor sensors than in MoS2 sensors. Furthermore, this work strongly
   implies that the target-molecule-induced surface scattering also plays
   an important role in determining the response behaviors of the sensors
   made from atomically layered materials. Especially, the competition
   between target-molecule-induced p-doping and surfacescattering effects
   is responsible for the sensor behavior variation observed in the p-type
   conduction branch of WSe2 sensors. This work advances the critical
   device physics highly relevant with the fabrication and implementation
   of reliable nanoelectronic biosensors based on emerging atomically
   layered semiconductors. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Title = {{Influence of environmental factors on indoor radon concentration levels

Journal = {{RADIATION MEASUREMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{52-58}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A series of experiments was conducted to measure indoor radon
   concentrations variations and observe any correlations with indoor and
   outdoor atmospheric parameters for over a period of one year. Indoor
   environmental parameters and radon concentrations were measured on an
   hourly basis in a two-story building both in a laboratory on the
   well-ventilated ground floor and in the basement below it which had
   negligible ventilation. The monthly average indoor radon concentration
   value of 29 +/- 21 Bq m(-3) in the laboratory was below the ICRP
   recommended limit of 200-300 Bq m(-3). The monthly normalization factor
   for that location ranged from 0.5 to 2.0, while the seasonal
   normalization factor ranged from 0.78 to 2.0. In the unventilated
   basement, however, the average monthly indoor radon concentration was
   1083 +/- 6 Bq m(-3) with little seasonal variation. The basement is only
   used for storage and thus the elevated radon concentration does not pose
   a serious health risk. The results indicated that indoor radon levels
   are higher in the autumn-winter season than in the spring-summer season.
   Analysis further showed that indoor radon concentrations negatively
   correlated with indoor humidity (correlation coefficient R = -0.14, p <
   0.01), outdoor temperature (correlation coefficient R = -03, p < 0.01),
   outdoor dew point temperature (correlation coefficient R = -0.17, p <
   0.01) and outdoor wind speeds (correlation coefficient R = -0.25, p <
   0.05). Radon concentrations correlated positively with outdoor
   barometric pressure (correlation coefficient R = 0.35, p < 0.01),
   indoor-outdoor temperature difference (correlation coefficient R = 0.32,
   p < 0.05) and indoor-outdoor barometric pressure difference (correlation
   coefficient R = 0.67, p < 0.01). Indoor temperature, indoor barometric
   pressure and outdoor wind direction showed no clear correlations with
   indoor radon concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe a technique for fabricating ultrathin foils in

   non-conducting center rod, so that the liner dimensions are 1 cm in
   height, 6.55 mm in diameter, and 400 nm in thickness. The liner-plasmas
   are imploded by discharging similar to 600 kA with similar to 200 ns
   rise time using a 1 MA linear transformer driver, and the resulting
   implosions are imaged four times per shot using laser-shadowgraphy at
   532 nm. This technique enables the study of plasma implosion physics,
   including the magneto Rayleigh-Taylor, sausage, and kink instabilities
   on initially solid, imploding metallic liners with university-scale
   pulsed power machines. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is a non-invasive ablation method that mechanically
   fractionates tissue by controlling acoustic cavitation. Previous work
   has revealed that tissue mechanical properties play a significant role
   in the histotripsy process, with stiffer tissues being more resistant to
   histotripsy-induced tissue damage. In this study, we propose a thermal
   pretreatment strategy to precondition tissues before histotripsy. We
   hypothesize that a thermal pretreatment can be used to alter tissue
   stiffness by modulating collagen composition, thus changing tissue
   susceptibility to histotripsy. More specifically, we hypothesize that
   tissues will soften and become more susceptible to histotripsy when
   preheated at similar to 60 degrees C because of collagen denaturation,
   but that tissues will rapidly stiffen and become less susceptible to
   histotripsy when preheated at similar to 90 degrees C because of
   collagen contraction. To test this hypothesis, a controlled temperature
   water bath was used to heat various ex vivo bovine tissues (tongue,
   artery, liver, kidney medulla, tendon and urethra). After heating, the
   Young's modulus of each tissue sample was measured using a tissue
   elastometer, and changes in tissue composition (i.e., collagen
   structure/density) were analyzed histologically. The susceptibility of
   tissues to histotripsy was investigated by treating the samples using a
   750-kHz histotripsy transducer. Results revealed a decrease in stiffness
   and an increase in susceptibility to histotripsy for tissues (except
   urethra) preheated to 58 degrees C. In contrast, preheating to 90
   degrees C increased tissue stiffness and reduced susceptibility to
   histotripsy for all tissues except tendon, which was significantly
   softened due to collagen hydrolysis into gelatin. On the basis of these
   results, a final set of experiments were conducted to determine the
   feasibility of using high-intensity focused ultrasound to provide the
   thermal pretreatment. Overall, the results of this study indicate the
   initial feasibility of a thermal pretreatment strategy to precondition
   tissue mechanical properties and alter tissue susceptibility to
   histotripsy. Future work will aim to optimize this thermal pretreatment
   strategy to determine if this approach is practical for specific
   clinical applications in vivo without causing unwanted damage to
   surrounding or overlying tissue. (E-mail: evlaisav@umich.edu) (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Chaotic behavior presents intrinsic richness due to the existence of an
   infinity number of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). The possibility of
   stabilizing these periodic patterns with a small amount of energy makes
   this kind of response interesting to various dynamical systems. Energy
   harvesting has as a goal the use of available mechanical energy by
   promoting a conversion into electrical energy. The combination of these
   two approaches may establish autonomous systems where available
   environmental mechanical energy can be employed for control purposes.
   Two different goals can be defined as priority, allowing a change
   between them: vibration reduction and energy harvesting enhancement.
   This work deals with the use of harvested energy to perform chaos
   control. Both control actuation and energy harvesting are induced
   employing piezoelectric materials, in a simultaneous way. A bistable
   piezomagnetoelastic structure subjected to harmonic excitations is
   investigated as a case study. Numerical simulations show situations
   where it is possible to perform chaos control using only the energy
   generated by the harvesting system.}},

Abstract = {{Electric machines are a key component of electric/hybrid electric
   vehicle (EV/HEV) powertrains. Thus, computationally efficient models for
   electric machines are essential for powertrain-level design, simulation,
   and optimization. In this paper, a finite-element-based method for
   quickly generating torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric
   machines is presented. First, magnetostatic finite-element analysis
   (FEA) is conducted on a `` base{''} machine design. This analysis
   produces torque, normalized losses, flux linkage, and the maximum
   magnetic field intensity in the permanent magnets for a wide range of
   currentmagnitudes and phase angles. These values are then scaled based
   upon changing the size of the machine and the effective number of turns
   of the machine windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine
   designs and their corresponding efficiency maps using postprocessing
   techniques. Results suggest that, by avoiding resolving the FEA for the
   scaled designs, the proposed techniques can be used to quickly generate
   efficiency maps, and thus are useful for EV/HEV powertrain-level
   simulation and optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The human ankle produces a large burst of `push-off' mechanical power
   late in the stance phase of walking, reduction of which leads to
   considerably poorer energy economy. It is, however, uncertain whether
   the energetic penalty results from poorer efficiency when the other leg
   joints substitute for the ankle's push-off work, or from a higher
   overall demand for work due to some fundamental feature of push-off.
   Here, we showthat greatermetabolic energy expenditure is indeed
   explained by a greater demand for work. This is predicted by a simple
   model of walking on pendulum-like legs, because proper push-off reduces
   collision losses from the leading leg. We tested this by experimentally
   restricting ankle push-off bilaterally in healthy adults (N=8) walking
   on a treadmill at 1.4 m s(-1), using ankle-foot orthoses with steel
   cables limiting motion. These produced up to similar to 50\% reduction
   in ankle push-off powerandwork, resulting in up to similar to 50\%
   greater netmetabolic power expenditure towalk at the same speed. For
   each 1 J reduction in ankle work, we observed 0.6 J more dissipative
   collision work by the other leg, 1.3 J more positivework fromthe leg
   joints overall, and 3.94 J more metabolic energy expended. Loss of ankle
   push-off required more positivework elsewhere to maintain walking speed;
   this additional work was performed by the knee, apparently at reasonably
   high efficiency. Ankle push-off may contribute to walking economy by
   reducing dissipative collision losses and thus overall work demand.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A master equation study of vibrational relaxation and dissociation of
   oxygen is conducted using state-specific O-2-O transition rates,
   generated by extensive trajectory simulations. Both O-2-O and O-2-O-2
   collisions are concurrently simulated in the evolving nonequilibrium gas
   system under constant heat bath conditions. The forced harmonic
   oscillator model is incorporated to simulate the state-to-state
   relaxation of oxygen in O-2-O-2 collisions. The system of master
   equations is solved to simulate heating and cooling flows. The present
   study demonstrates the importance of atom-diatom collisions due to the
   extremely efficient energy randomization in the intermediate O-3
   complex. It is shown that the presence of atomic oxygen has a
   significant impact on vibrational relaxation time at temperatures
   observed in hypersonic flow. The population of highly-excited O-2
   vibrational states is affected by the amount of atomic oxygen when
   modeling the relaxation under constant heat bath conditions. A model of
   coupled state-to-state vibrational relaxation and dissociation of oxygen
   is also discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Circular dichroism spectroscopy is essential for structural
   characterization of proteins and chiral nanomaterials. Chiral structures
   from plasmonic materials have extraordinary strong circular dichroism
   effects compared to their molecular counterparts. While being
   extensively investigated, the comprehensive account of circular
   dichroism effects consistent with other plasmonic phenomena is still
   missing. Here we investigated the circular differential scattering of a
   simple chiral plasmonic system, a twisted side-by-side Au nanorod dimer,
   using single-particle circular dichroism spectroscopy complimented with
   electromagnetic simulations. This approach enabled us to quantify the
   effects of structural symmetry breaking, namely, size-mismatch between
   the constituent Au nanorods and large twist angles on the resulting
   circular differential scattering spectrum. Our results demonstrate that,
   if only scattering is considered as measured by dark-field spectroscopy,
   a homodimer of Au nanorods with similar sizes produces a circular
   differential scattering line shape that is different from the bisignate
   response of the corresponding conventional CD spectrum, which measures
   extinction, that is, the sum of scattering and absorption. On the other
   hand, symmetry breaking in a heterodimer with Au nanorods with different
   sizes yields a bisignate circular differential scattering line shape. In
   addition, we provide a general method for correcting linear dichroism
   artifacts arising from slightly elliptically polarized light in a
   typical dark-field microscope, as is necessary especially when measuring
   highly anisotropic nanostructures, such as side-by-side nanorods. This
   work lays the foundation for understanding absorption and scattering
   contributions to the CD line shape of single chiroplasmonic
   nanostructures free from ensemble-averaging, especially important for
   self-assembled chiral nanostructures that usually exist as both
   enantiomers.}},

Title = {{Comparison of 3D kinetic and hydrodynamic models to ROSINA-COPS
   measurements of the neutral coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{583}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) is a Jupiter-family comet and the object
   of investigation of the European Space Agency mission Rosetta. This
   report presents the first full 3D simulation results of 67P's neutral
   gas coma. In this study we include results from a direct simulation
   Monte Carlo method, a hydrodynamic code, and a purely geometric
   calculation which computes the total illuminated surface area on the
   nucleus. All models include the triangulated 3D shape model of 67P as
   well as realistic illumination and shadowing conditions. The basic
   concept is the assumption that these illumination conditions on the
   nucleus are the main driver for the gas activity of the comet. As a
   consequence, the total production rate of 67P varies as a function of
   solar insolation. The best agreement between the model and the data is
   achieved when gas fluxes on the night side are in the range of 7\% to
   10\% of the maximum flux, accounting for contributions from the most
   volatile components. To validate the output of our numerical simulations
   we compare the results of all three models to in situ gas number density
   measurements from the ROSINA COPS instrument. We are able to reproduce
   the overall features of these local neutral number density measurements
   of ROSINA COPS for the time period between early August 2014 and January
   1 2015 with all three models. Some details in the measurements are not
   reproduced and warrant further investigation and refinement of the
   models. However, the overall assumption that illumination conditions on
   the nucleus are at least an important driver of the gas activity is
   validated by the models. According to our simulation results we find the
   total production rate of 67P to be constant between August and November
   2014 with a value of about 1 x 10(26) molecules s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Certain operative cases occur unpredictably and/or have long
   operative times, creating a conflict between Accreditation Council for
   Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) rules and adequate training
   experience.
   METHODS: A ProModel-based simulation was developed based on historical
   data. Probabilistic distributions of operative time calculated and
   combined with an ACGME compliant call schedule.
   RESULTS: For the advanced surgical cases modeled (cardiothoracic
   transplants), 80-hour violations were 6.07\% and the minimum number of
   days off was violated 22.50\%. There was a 36\% chance of failure to
   fulfill any (either heart or lung) minimum case requirement despite
   adequate volume.
   CONCLUSIONS: The variable nature of emergency cases inevitably leads to
   work hour violations under ACGME regulations. Unpredictable cases
   mandate higher operative volume to ensure achievement of adequate
   caseloads. Publically available simulation technology provides a
   valuable avenue to identify adequacy of case volumes for trainees in
   both the elective and emergency setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Electrocatalytic oxidation of polyhydric alcohols represents an
   important route for coproduction of biorenewable chemicals and energy.
   However, the governing factors leading to high product selectivity
   remain unclear. Herein, we investigate the selective oxidation of
   1,2-propanediol (PDO) to pyruvate or lactate in electrocatalytic
   reactors over carbon-supported platinum (Pt/C) and gold (Au/C) anode
   catalysts. PDO-fed alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells
   successfully cogenerated electricity and valuable chemicals with peak
   power densities of 46.3 mW cm(-2) on Pt/C and 10.0 mW cm(-2) on Au/C.
   Pt/C was highly selective for primary alcohol group oxidation to lactate
   (86.8\%) under fuel cell conditions, but Au/C yielded significant
   amounts of pyruvate, a product that has previously eluded heterogeneous
   catalytic studies on Au. Sequential oxidation of lactate to pyruvate was
   not observed on Au/C but did occur slowly on Pt/C. The electrode
   potential dependent product distribution was investigated, and it was
   revealed that pyruvate selectivity on Au/C was sensitive to anode
   potential and could be varied from 20 to 56\%. On the basis of observed
   product distributions and linear sweep voltammetry of intermediate
   products, we propose that the intermediates hydroxyacetone and
   pyruvaldehyde, which are not stable in high pH electrolyte, can be
   further oxidized to pyruvate on Au/C only if they are trapped within the
   thick liquid diffusion layer of the carbon cloth supported catalyst
   layer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of reaction energies
   identified the most favorable reaction intermediates and provided
   insight into the likely reaction pathways.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 13 diesel buses and 12 diesel trucks in Macao were tested
   using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS) including a
   SEMTECH-DS for gaseous emissions and a SEMTECH-PPMD for PM2,5. The
   average emission rates of gaseous pollutants and CO2 are developed with
   the operating mode defined by the instantaneous vehicle specific power
   (VSP) and vehicle speed. Both distance-based and fuel mass-based
   emission factors for gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO, THC and NOx) are
   further estimated under typical driving conditions. The average
   distance-based NOx emission of heavy-duty buses (HDBs) is higher than 13
   g km-1. Considering the unfavorable conditions for selective reductions
   catalyst (SCR) systems, such as low-speed driving conditions, more
   effective technology options (e.g., dedicated natural gas buses and
   electric buses) should be considered by policy makers in Macao. We
   identified strong effects of the vehicle size, engine displacement and
   driving conditions on real-world CO2 emission factors and fuel
   consumption for diesel vehicles. Therefore, detailed profiles regarding
   vehicle specifications can reduce the uncertainty in their fleet-average
   on-road fuel consumption. In addition, strong correlations between
   relative emission factors and driving conditions indicated by the
   average speed of generated micro-trips are identified based on a
   micro-trip method. For example, distance-based emission factors of HDBs
   will increase by 39\% for CO, 29\% for THC, 43\% for NOx and 26\% for
   CO2 when the average speed decreases from 30 km h-1 to 20 km h(-1). The
   mitigation of on-road emissions from diesel buses and trucks by
   improving traffic conditions through effective traffic and economic
   management measures is therefore required. This study demonstrates the
   important role of PEMS in understanding vehicle emissions and mitigation
   strategies from science to policy perspectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The critical energy release rate, defined as G(c) = 2 gamma+gamma(p)
   (where gamma is the cohesive energy and gamma(p) is the plastic work),
   is widely used as a macroscopic fracture criterion. During embrittlement
   of aluminum by gallium, impurity segregation is localized to a small
   region along the grain boundary and the bulk plastic properties are
   unaffected. Yet, the critical energy release rate (which is
   predominantly described by the plastic work {[}gamma(p)] since gamma(p)
   > >gamma) significantly decreases. In this work, we recognize that as
   the cohesive energy (gamma) decreases during corrosion due to an
   increase in impurity concentration, the stress needed at the notch tip
   to form the crack decreases, and this, in turn, decreases the plastic
   work by reducing dislocation emission at the notch tip. We study two
   different models proposed in the past that can capture this dependence
   of gamma(p) on gamma during liquid metal (Ga) embrittlement of aluminum
   alloy (Al 7075). The parameters in these models are computed from first
   principles atomistic calculations and recent experiments. We compare and
   contrast these models on their ability to describe various aspects of
   embrittlement such as fracture toughness, K-IC, and subcritical value of
   stress intensity, K-Iscc. Extension of the approach to predict threshold
   fatigue crack initiation in Al7075 is suggested.}},

   Renewable Portfolio Standards}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{250-261}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) include preferences
   for solar generation, with goals of increasing the generation diversity,
   reducing solar costs, and encouraging local solar industries. Depending
   on their policy design, these preferences can impact the RPS program
   costs and emissions reduction. This study evaluates the impact of these
   policies on costs and emissions, coupling an economic dispatch model
   with optimized renewable site selection. Three policy designs of an
   increased RPS in Michigan are investigated: (1) 20\% Solar Carve-Out,
   (2) 5\% Distributed Generation Solar Carve-Out, and (3) 3 x Solar
   Multiplier. The 20\% Solar Carve-Out scenario was found to increase RPS
   costs 28\%, while the 5\% Distributed Generation Solar Carve-Out
   increased costs by 34\%. Both of these solar preferences had minimal
   impact on total emissions. The 3 x Solar Multiplier decreases total RPS
   program costs by 39\%, but adds less than half of the total renewable
   generation of the other cases, significantly increasing emissions of
   CO2, NOR, and SO2 relative to an RPS without the solar credit
   multiplier. Sensitivity analysis of the installed cost of solar and the
   natural gas price finds small changes in the results of the Carve-Out
   cases, with a larger impact on the 3 x Solar Multiplier. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) level-1b radiances have been
   shown to be well calibrated (similar to 0.3 K or higher) and have little
   secular drift (similar to 4 mK yr(-1)) since operation started in
   September 2002. This paper investigates the linear trends of 10 years
   (2003-12) of AIRS global-mean radiances in the CO(2)v(2) band that are
   sensitive to emissions from the stratosphere (stratospheric channels).
   AIRS lower-stratospheric channels have a cooling trend of no more than
   0.23 K decade(-1) whereas the midstratospheric channels consistently
   show a statistically significant cooling trend as large as 0.58 K
   decade(-1). The 95\% confidence interval for the trend is similar to +/-
   0.20 K decade(-1). Two sets of synthetic AIRS radiances are computed
   using the principal component-based radiative transfer model (PCRTM),
   one based on a free-running GFDL Atmospheric Model, version 3 (AM3),
   over the same period and one based on ERA-Interim. The GFDL AM3
   simulations overestimate the cooling trends in the mid- to
   upper-stratospheric channels but slightly underestimate them in the
   lower-stratospheric channels. The synthetic radiances based on
   ERA-Interim, however, have statistically significant positive trends at
   virtually all stratospheric channels. This confirms the challenge to the
   GCM modeling and reanalysis community to create a better simulation or
   assimilation of the stratospheric climate. It is shown that the linear
   trends in AIRS radiances can be reproduced to a large extent by the
   spectral radiative kernel technique and the trends from the AIRS L2
   temperature retrievals and from the change of CO2. This suggests a
   closure between AIRS L1 radiances and L2 retrievals and the potential
   merit of AIRS data in studies of stratosphere changes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Large area x-ray imagers based on complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensor (APS) technology
   have been proposed for various medical imaging applications including
   digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The low electronic noise (50-300
   e(-)) of CMOS APS x-ray imagers provides a possible route to shrink the
   pixel pitch to smaller than 75 mu m for microcalcification detection and
   possible reduction of the DBT mean glandular dose (MGD).
   Methods: In this study, imaging performance of a large area (29x23
   cm(2)) CMOS APS x-ray imager {[}Dexela 2923 MAM (PerkinElmer, London)]
   with a pixel pitch of 75 mu m was characterized and modeled. The authors
   developed a cascaded system model for CMOS APS x-ray imagers using both
   a broadband x-ray radiation and monochromatic synchrotron radiation. The
   experimental data including modulation transfer function, noise power
   spectrum, and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) were theoretically
   described using the proposed cascaded system model with satisfactory
   consistency to experimental results. Both high full well and low full
   well (LFW) modes of the Dexela 2923MAMCMOS APS x-ray imager were
   characterized and modeled. The cascaded system analysis results were
   further used to extract the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for
   microcalcifications with sizes of 165-400 mu m at various MGDs. The
   impact of electronic noise on CNR was also evaluated.
   Results: The LFW mode shows better DQE at low air kerma (K-a < 10 mu Gy)
   and should be used for DBT. At current DBT applications, air kerma (K-a
   similar to 10 mu Gy, broadband radiation of 28 kVp), DQE of more than
   0.7 and similar to 0.3 was achieved using the LFW mode at spatial
   frequency of 0.5 line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm) and Nyquist frequency
   similar to 6.7 lp/mm, respectively. It is shown that microcalcifications
   of 165-400 mu m in size can be resolved using a MGD range of 0.3-1 mGy,
   respectively. In comparison to a General Electric GEN2 prototype DBT
   system (at MGD of 2.5 mGy), an increased CNR (by similar to 10) for
   microcalcifications was observed using the Dexela 2923MAMCMOS APS x-ray
   imager at a lower MGD (2.0 mGy).
   Conclusions: The Dexela 2923 MAM CMOS APS x-ray imager is capable to
   achieve a high imaging performance at spatial frequencies up to 6.7
   lp/mm. Microcalcifications of 165 mu m are distinguishable based on
   reported data and their modeling results due to the small pixel pitch of
   75 mu m. At the same time, potential dose reduction is expected using
   the studied CMOS APS x-ray imager. (C) 2015 American Association of

Abstract = {{The SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 has been associated with early metastasis and
   poorer prognosis in breast cancers, especially the most aggressive
   triple-negative subtype. In line with previous reports, we found that
   tumoral CXCR4 expression in patients with locally advanced breast cancer
   was associated with increased metastases and rapid tumor progression.
   Moreover, high CXCR4 expression identified a group of bone
   marrow-disseminated tumor cells (DTC)-negative patients at high risk for
   metastasis and death. The protein epitope mimetic (PEM) POL5551, a novel
   CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited binding of SDF-1 to CXCR4, had no direct
   effects on tumor cell viability, but reduced migration of breast cancer
   cells in vitro. In two orthotopic models of triple-negative breast
   cancer, POL5551 had little inhibitory effect on primary tumor growth,
   but significantly reduced distant metastasis. When combined with
   eribulin, a chemotherapeutic microtubule inhibitor, POL5551 additively
   reduced metastasis and prolonged survival inmice after resection of the
   primary tumor compared with single-agent eribulin. Hypothesizing that
   POL5551 may mobilize tumor cells from their microenvironment and
   sensitize them to chemotherapy, we used a ``chemotherapy framing{''}
   dosing strategy. When administered shortly before and after eribulin
   treatment, three doses of POL5551 with eribulin reduced bone and liver
   tumor burden more effectively than chemotherapy alone. These data
   suggest that sequenced administration of CXCR4 antagonists with
   cytotoxic chemotherapy synergize to reduce distant metastases. (C) 2015

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3167-3186}},

Abstract = {{A partitioned solution framework is developed for time-domain
   aerothermoelastic simulation of hypersonic vehicles. The motivation for
   development of such an approach stems from the fact that hypersonic
   vehicles consist of multiple substructures, each containing different
   dominant physics. Different model forms are therefore required to
   capture the main physics of each substructure, and direct coupling of
   the various substructures of the vehicle is not straightforward. The
   methodology of this paper is based on a partitioned time-marching
   formulation, in which individual components of the vehicle are modeled
   separately, and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the
   systems within each time step. This approach is advantageous in that it
   does not require direct coupling of the substructures, therefore
   allowing for the models to be of dissimilar form. The methodology is
   applied to a representative configuration consisting of an all-movable
   hypersonic vehicle lifting surface model containing aerothermoelastic
   effects attached to a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator representing
   the fuselage. Results from validation cases are first presented. The
   partitioned solution methodology is then used to investigate the impact
   of lifting surface-fuselage inertial coupling on overall vehicle
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Cis-1,2,-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE) is a toxic, persistent contaminant
   occurring mainly as a daughter product of incomplete degradation of
   perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). This paper reports
   on abiotic reductive dechlorination of cis-DCE by mackinawite (FeS1-x ),
   a ferrous monosulfide, under variable geochemical conditions. To assess
   in situ abiotic cis-DCE dechlorination by mackinawite in the field,
   mackinawite suspensions prepared in a field groundwater sample collected
   from a cis-DCE contaminated field site were used for dechlorination
   experiments. The effects of geochemical variables on the dechlorination
   rates were monitored. A set of dechlorination experiments were also
   carried out in the presence of aquifer sediment from the site over a
   range of pH conditions to better simulate the actual field situations.
   The results showed that the suspensions of freshly prepared mackinawite
   reductively transformed cis-DCE to acetylene, whereas the conventionally
   prepared powder form of mackinawite had practically no reactivity with
   cis-DCE under the same experimental conditions. Significant cis-DCE
   degradation by mackinawite has not been reported prior to this study,
   although mackinawite has been shown to reductively transform PCE and
   TCE. This study suggests feasibility of using mackinawite for in situ
   remediation of cis-DCE-contaminated sites with high S levels such as
   estuaries under naturally achieved or stimulated sulfate-reducing
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the sequential (i.e., online) detection of false data
   injection attacks in smart grid, which aims to manipulate the state
   estimation procedure by injecting malicious data to the monitoring
   meters. The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector,
   injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a
   significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient,
   and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on
   the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge.
   Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a
   variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power
   system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number
   of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing
   first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection
   delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For wide-area
   monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed sequential
   detector using an adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered
   sampling. The resulting distributed detector features single bit per
   sample in terms of the communication overhead, while preserving the high
   performance of the proposed centralized detector.}},

Abstract = {{We present distributed network algorithms to compute weighted and

   we present another algorithm which provides (1/2 - epsilon)

   improving on the previously known algorithms which attain (1/4 -

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the longest-standing open problems in computational geometry is
   bounding the complexity of the lower envelope of n univariate functions,
   each pair of which crosses at most s times, for some fixed s. This
   problem is known to be equivalent to bounding the length of an order-s
   Davenport-Schinzel sequence, namely, a sequence over an n-letter
   alphabet that avoids alternating subsequences of the form
   a...b...a...b... with length s+2. These sequences were introduced by
   Davenport and Schinzel in 1965 to model a certain problem in
   differential equations and have since been applied to bound the running
   times of geometric algorithms, data structures, and the combinatorial
   complexity of geometric arrangements.
   Let lambda(s)(n) be the maximum length of an order-s DS sequence over n
   letters. What is lambda(s) asymptotically? This question has been
   answered satisfactorily {[}Hart and Sharir 1986; Agarwal et al. 1989;
   Klazar 1999; Nivasch 2010], when s is even or s <= 3. However, since the
   work of Agarwal et al. in the mid-1980s, there has been a persistent gap
   in our understanding of the odd orders.
   In this work, we effectively close the problem by establishing sharp
   bounds on Davenport-Schinzel sequences of every order s. Our results
   reveal that, contrary to one's intuition, lambda(s)(n) behaves
   essentially like lambda(s-1)(n) when s is odd. This refutes conjectures
   by Alon et al. {[}2008] and Nivasch {[}2010].}},

   +/- 2\% and 95 +/- 4 lm W-1 when all glass modes are also extracted. The
   use of a thick electron transport layer further reduces surface plasmon
   modes, resulting in an increase in the substrate and air modes by 50 +/-
   8\% compared with devices lacking the grids. The sub-anode grid has
   minimal impact on organic light-emitting device emission wavelength and
   viewing angle, and is likely to prove beneficial for a broad range of
   display and lighting applications.}},

Abstract = {{Congenital airway obstruction poses a life-threatening challenge to the
   newborn. We present the first case of three-dimensional (3D) modeling
   and 3D printing of complex fetal maxillofacial anatomy after prenatal
   ultrasound indicated potential upper airway obstruction from a midline
   mass of the maxilla. Using fetal MRI and patient-specific computer-aided
   modeling, the craniofacial anatomy of the fetus was manufactured using a
   3D printer. This model demonstrated the mass to be isolated to the upper
   lip and maxilla, suggesting the oral airway to be patent. The decision
   was made to deliver the infant without a planned ex utero intrapartum
   treatment procedure. The neonate was born with a protuberant cleft lip
   and palate deformity, without airway obstruction, as predicted by the
   patient-specific model. The delivery was uneventful, and the child was
   discharged without need for airway intervention. This case demonstrates
   that 3D modeling may improve prenatal evaluation of complex
   patient-specific fetal anatomy and facilitate the multidisciplinary
   approach to perinatal management of complex airway anomalies.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of present study was to develop and evaluate methods to
   assess stimulation responses of the lumbar extensors, as part of a
   longer-term goal of detecting fatigue during prolonged sitting. Three
   stimulation frequencies (2, 5, and 8Hz) were tested in separate stages,
   which include 3 stimulation trains and 4 sampling blocks. Repeated
   measures analyses of variance were used to determine whether any
   significant differences in mean stimulation responses occurred with
   respect to stimulation frequency, sampling block, and stimulation train.
   Reliability of measured stimulation responses was assessed within and
   between sampling blocks using intraclass correlation coefficients.
   Stimulation frequencies significantly affected the stimulation responses
   and time-to-potentiation differed between the 3 stimulation frequencies;
   it was highest for 2Hz stimulation. All 3 stimulation frequencies
   resulted in excellent reliability within and between sampling blocks.
   Use of the current protocol at 2Hz is recommended as appropriate to
   measure the lumbar extensors status during prolonged sitting. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Older combustion facilities are favored to comply with imposed
   regulations limiting emissions of trace toxic metals by modifying the
   operation of existing emissions control devices to concurrently capture
   the regulated toxic metal compound; a prominent example of this is
   adsorption of mercury by added activated carbon within electrostatic
   precipitators (ESPs). Our previous quasi-1-D analyses employed
   simplifying assumptions, some of which were initially proposed decades
   ago. The present study leverages a modern computational platform to
   remove restrictive, simplifying assumptions and capture details of
   multi-phase flows and electric and electro-hydrodynamic phenomena that
   were previously out of computational reach. The results reveal the
   conflicting interdependent trends in particulate matter (PM) collection
   and adsorption of a trace gas-phase pollutant, assumed here to be
   mercury. In particular, we show the power of the inverse correlation
   between PM removal efficiency and trace pollutant adsorption efficiency,
   for two representative particle size distributions for increasing
   treatment times and under constant electrical conditions (applied
   voltage and current density). Also noteworthy is the finding that the
   two mechanisms of trace pollutant adsorption within an ESP, in-flight
   adsorption by suspended sorbent particles and wall-bounded adsorption by
   sorbent-covered walls, cannot be treated as additive. Wall-bounded
   adsorption depletes trace pollutant concentrations in the concentration
   boundary layer near the walls, reducing the driving potential for
   in-flight adsorption in these regions. For the conditions simulated, the
   additional rate of pollutant removal by the former is almost entirely
   counter-balanced by diminished rates of pollutant removal by the latter.
   Such findings highlight the need to optimize emissions control processes
   originally designed for a single pollutant but operated for the purpose
   of dual-pollutant control.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The aims of this study were to determine long-term fatigue
   effects in the lower limbs associated with standing work and to estimate
   possible age and gender influences.
   Background: The progressive accumulation of muscle fatigue effects is
   assumed to lead to musculoskeletal disorders, as fatigue generated by
   sustained low-level exertions exhibits long-lasting effects. However,
   these effects have received little attention in the lower limbs.
   Method: Fourteen men and 12 women from two different age groups
   simulated standing work for 5 hr including 5-min seated rest breaks and
   a 30-min lunch. The younger group was also tested in a control day.
   Muscle fatigue was quantified by electrically induced muscle twitches
   (muscle twitch force {[}MTF]), postural stability, and subjective
   evaluation of discomfort.
   Results: MTF showed a significant fatigue effect after standing work
   that persisted beyond 30 min after the end of the workday. MTF was not
   affected on the control day. The center of pressure displacement speed
   increased significantly over time after standing work but was also
   affected on the control day. Subjective evaluations of discomfort
   indicated a significant increase in perception of fatigue immediately
   after the end of standing work; however, this perception did not persist
   30 min after. Age and gender did not influence fatigue.
   Conclusion: Objective measures show the long-term effects of muscle
   fatigue after 5 hr of standing work; however, this fatigue is no longer
   perceived after 30 min of rest postwork.
   Application: The present results suggest that occupational activities
   requiring prolonged standing are likely to contribute to lower-extremity
   and/or back disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) is an approximate computing technique that
   processes data in the form of long pseudorandom bit-streams which can be
   interpreted as probabilities. Its key advantages are low-complexity
   hardware and high-error tolerance. SC has recently been finding
   application in several important areas, including image processing,
   artificial neural networks, and low-density parity check decoding.
   Despite a long history, SC still lacks a comprehensive design
   methodology, so existing designs tend to be either ad hoc or based on
   specialized design methods. In this paper, we demonstrate a fundamental
   relation between stochastic circuits and spectral transforms. Based on
   this, we propose a general, transform-based approach to the analysis and
   synthesis of SC circuits. We implemented this approach in a program
   spectral transform use in stochastic circuit synthesis (STRAUSS), which
   also includes a method of optimizing stochastic number-generation
   circuitry. Finally, we show that the area cost of the circuits generated
   by STRAUSS is significantly smaller than that of previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Shipboard integrated power systems, the key enablers of ship
   electrification, call for effective power management control (PMC) to
   achieve optimal and reliable operation in dynamic environments under
   hardware limitations and operational constraints. The design of PMC can
   be treated naturally in a model predictive control (MPC) framework,
   where a cost function is minimized over a prediction horizon subject to
   constraints. The real-time implementation of MPC-based PMC, however, is
   challenging due to computational complexity of the numerical
   optimization. In this paper, an MPC-based PMC for a shipboard power
   system is developed and its real-time implementation is investigated. To
   meet the requirements for real-time computation, an integrated
   perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming (IPA-SQP)
   algorithm is applied to solve a constrained MPC optimization problem.
   Several operational scenarios are considered to evaluate the performance
   of the proposed PMC solution. Simulations and experiments show that
   real-time optimization, constraint enforcement, and fast load following
   can be achieved with the IPA-SQP algorithm. Different performance
   attributes and their tradeoffs can be coordinated through proper tuning
   of the design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive controller is presented for the control of combustion
   phasing in a multicylinder homogeneous charge compression ignition
   engine. Adaptive parameter estimation is used to modify a model-based
   feedforward controller for each cylinder's start of injection (SOI)
   timing in an effort to mitigate model errors and increase the
   feedforward control accuracy. In-cylinder pressure measurements are used
   to calculate combustion phasing, which is compared with the prediction
   of an online nonlinear engine model to drive the parameter estimation
   that adapts the feedforward controller. It is demonstrated through
   experiments that the adaptive parameter can reduce the parameterization
   effort by allowing the model to adapt and match the response of each
   cylinder. It is also shown that the adaptive feedforward control is more
   accurate in the sense that load transitions can be achieved with less
   correction from the feedback controller. Overall, an average reduction
   of 41\% in the absolute value of the SOI feedback component at steady
   state is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Internal model control (IMC) explicitly incorporates the plant model and
   its approximate inverse and offers an intuitive controller structure and
   calibration procedure. In the presence of plant-model uncertainty,
   combining the IMC structure with parameter estimation through the
   certainty equivalence principle leads to adaptive IMC (AIMC), where
   either the plant model or its inverse is identified. This paper proposes
   a composite AIMC (CAIMC) that explores the IMC structure and
   simultaneous plant dynamics and inverse dynamics identification to
   achieve improved performance of AIMC. A toy plant is used to illustrate
   the feasibility and potential of CAIMC. The advantages of CAIMC are
   later demonstrated on the boost-pressure control problem of a
   turbocharged gasoline engine. The design of the CAIMC assumes that the
   plant model and its inverse are represented by the first-order linear
   dynamics. The unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties due to linearization
   and variations in operating conditions are compensated through
   adaptation. The resulting CAIMC is first applied to a physics-based
   high-order and nonlinear proprietary turbocharged gasoline engine model,
   and then validated on a turbocharged 2-L four-cylinder gasoline engine
   on a vehicle with vacuum-actuated wastegate. Both the simulation and
   experimental results show that the CAIMC cannot only effectively
   compensate for uncertainties but also auto-tune the IMC controller for
   the best performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes hardware-in-the-loop simulations to develop the
   motor speed map of electrohydraulic power steering systems for heavy
   commercial vehicles. The current method that relies on the test driver's
   hands and feet to obtain electrohydraulic power steering motor speed
   maps causes a number of problems, such as inaccurate steering rates and
   vehicle speeds and the risk of rollover during tests. In order to
   overcome these weaknesses, this study employs a hardware-in-the-loop
   simulation system, a vehicle model, and an experimental development
   method. A hardware-in-the-loop simulation system was set up to simulate
   a steering system on the road. The system includes a system drive, data
   acquisition, system controller sets, and an electrohydraulic power
   steering system. This hardware-in-the-loop simulation system is
   controlled in real time because the amount of the torque from the
   resistant torque motor, which applies the self-aligning moments
   generated between the ground and the tires to the steering system, is
   affected by the steering angle of the steering-wheel motor. For
   calculation of the resistant torque with respect to various driving
   conditions, a vehicle model was employed in this study. It includes
   calculation of the self-aligning moments with the tire property data,
   the moments due to the kingpin inclination, the vehicle dynamics, and
   the steering-system modeling. The resultant values were input into the
   resistant torque motor. In addition to the hardware-in-the-loop
   simulation system and the vehicle model, the concept of a desirable
   steering torque which parameterizes the steering feel was introduced in
   this study. Using the desirable steering torque, the steering feel could
   be quantified, and desirable steering feels were established. In this
   study, in order to validate the hardware-in-the-loop simulations, a
   heavy commercial vehicle was designated as the target vehicle. The
   target vehicle's tire and specifications such as the dimensions, the
   weight, the steering system, and the mechanical links were adopted, and
   a desirable steering-torque map was established by a professional test
   driver. The development results were presented.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the relationship between decentralized fault diagnosis
   and decentralized control of discrete event systems under dynamic
   observations. The key system-theoretic properties that arise in these
   problems are those of codiagnosability and coobservability,
   respectively. It was shown by Wang et al. (2011) that coobservability is
   transformable to codiagnosability; however, the transformation for the
   other direction has remained an open problem. In this paper, we consider
   a general language-based dynamic observations setting and show how the
   notion of K-codiagnosability can be transformed to coobservability. When
   the observation properties are transition-based, we present a new
   approach for the verification of transition-based codiagnosability. An
   upper bound of the diagnosis delay for decentralized diagnosis under
   transition-based observations is derived. Moreover, we show that
   transition-based {[}co]diagnosability is transformable to
   transition-based {[}co]observability. Our results thereby complement
   those in Wang et al. (2011) and provide a thorough characterization of
   the relationship between the two notions of codiagnosability and
   coobservability and their verification. In particular, our results allow
   the leveraging of the large existing literature on decentralized control
   synthesis to solve corresponding problems of decentralized fault
   diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pre-compensation of servo contour errors using a model predictive

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{50-60}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Methods for pre-compensating contour errors in servo systems by adding
   components of the predicted contour error to the reference position
   command have recently been proposed in the literature. Such methods are
   very effective when the curvatures of the desired path are small but
   their performance degrades at locations of sharp curvature because they
   lack look-ahead capabilities. This paper presents an improved method for
   pre-compensating contour errors in servo systems by modifying reference
   position commands using a model predictive control framework. The
   pre-compensation value at any given location along the desired path is
   defined as a weighted average of contour errors within a prediction
   horizon, and the weights are selected to minimize the sum of squares of
   the estimated contour errors over the chosen prediction horizon.
   Constraint enforcement functionalities are also built into the proposed
   method to ensure that the pre-compensated reference commands stay within
   specified velocity and acceleration limits. Simulations and experiments
   are used to compare the performance of the proposed method to a recently
   proposed pre-compensation approach which lacks look-ahead and constraint
   enforcement capabilities. Significant improvements in contouring
   accuracy over the existing method are demonstrated. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fluid filled fiber reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) have been a
   popular choice for actuators in prosthetics and soft robots owing to
   their high power density and cost effective manufacturing. While a
   narrow class of FREEs known as McKibben's actuators have been
   extensively studied, there is a wide unexplored class that could be
   potentially used as actuators and soft structural members. This paper
   analyzes the mobility of generalized FREEs based on simple geometric
   relationships that result from the inextensibility of fibers and fluidic
   actuation. The analysis conducted can be classified into instantaneous
   kinematics and global or large deformation kinematics. Instantaneous
   kinematics reveals that the most general deformation pattern of the FREE
   is a screw motion about the axis of its cylinder, whose pitch is a
   function of fiber orientations. Furthermore, a set of fiber angles,
   which do not deform under volumetric actuation were identified as the
   locked manifold (LM). Global kinematic analysis revealed that every FREE
   continued to deform until its fiber configuration approached the LM.
   These insights were corroborated with finite element analysis (FEA) and
   testing for a small sample of FREE actuators.}},

Abstract = {{AimsThe levator ani muscle (LA) injury associated with vaginal birth
   occurs in a characteristic site of injury on the inner surface of the
   pubic bone to the pubovisceral portion of the levator ani muscle's
   origin. This study investigated the gross and microscopic anatomy of the
   pubic origin of the LA in this region.
   MethodsPubic origin of the levator ani muscle was examined in situ then
   harvested from nine female cadavers (35-98 years). A combination of
   targeted feature sampling and sequential sampling was used where each
   specimen was cut sequentially in approximately 5mm thick slices apart in
   the area of known LA injury. Histological sections were stained with
   Masson's trichrome.
   ResultsThe pubovisceral origin is transparent and thin as it attaches
   tangentially to the pubic periosteum, with its morphology changing from
   medial to lateral regions. Medially, fibers of the thick muscle belly
   coalesce toward multiple narrow points of bony attachment for individual
   fascicles. In the central portion there is an aponeurosis and the
   distance between muscle and periosteum is wider (approximate to 3mm)
   than in the medial region. Laterally, the LA fibers attach to the
   levator arch where the transition from pubovisceral muscle to the
   iliococcygeal muscle occurs.
   ConclusionsThe morphology of the levator ani origin varies from the
   medial to lateral margin. The medial origin is a rather direct
   attachment of the muscle, while lateral origin is made through the
   levator arch. Neurourol. Urodynam. 34:774-780, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Methanotrophs have multiple methane monooxygenases that are well known
   to be regulated by copper, i.e., a ``copper switch.{''} At low
   copper/biomass ratios the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) is
   expressed while expression and activity of the particulate methane
   monooxygenase (pMMO) increases with increasing availability of copper.
   In many methanotrophs there are also multiple methanol dehydrogenases
   (MeDHs), one based on Mxa and another based on Xox. Mxa-MeDH is known to
   have calcium in its active site, while Xox-MeDHs have been shown to have
   rare earth elements in their active site. We show here that the
   expression levels of Mxa-MeDH and Xox-MeDH in Methylosinus trichosporium
   OB3b significantly decreased and increased, respectively, when grown in
   the presence of cerium but the absence of copper compared to the absence
   of both metals. Expression of sMMO and pMMO was not affected. In the
   presence of copper, the effect of cerium on gene expression was less
   significant, i.e., expression of Mxa-MeDH in the presence of copper and
   cerium was slightly lower than in the presence of copper alone, but
   Xox-MeDH was again found to increase significantly. As expected, the
   addition of copper caused sMMO and pMMO expression levels to
   significantly decrease and increase, respectively, but the simultaneous
   addition of cerium had no discernible effect on MMOexpression. As a
   result, it appears Mxa-MeDH can be uncoupled from methane oxidation by
   sMMO in M. trichosporium OB3b but not from pMMO.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Research supports the central role cognitive strategies can play in
   successful concept generation by individual designers. Design heuristics
   have been shown to facilitate the creation of new design concepts in the
   early, conceptual stage of the design process, as well as throughout the
   development of ideas. However, we know relatively little about their use
   in differing disciplines. This study examined evidence of design
   heuristic use in a protocol study with 12 mechanical engineers and 12
   industrial designers who worked individually to develop multiple
   concepts. The open-ended design problem was for a novel product, and the
   designers' sketches and comments were recorded as they worked on the
   problem for 25 min and in a retrospective interview. The results showed
   frequent use of design heuristics in both disciplines and a significant
   relationship to the rated creativity of the concepts. Though industrial
   designers used more heuristics in their concepts, there was a high
   degree of similarity in heuristic use. Some differences between design
   disciplines were observed in the choice of design heuristics, where
   industrial designers showed a greater emphasis on user experience,
   environmental contexts, and added features. These findings demonstrate
   the prevalence of design heuristics in individual concept generation and
   their effectiveness in generating creative concepts, across two design
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{The fuel consumption of ground vehicles is significantly affected by how
   they are driven. The fuel-optimized vehicular automation technique can
   improve fuel economy for the host vehicle, but their effectiveness on a
   platoon of vehicles is still unknown. This article studies the
   performance of a well-known fuel-optimized vehicle automation strategy,
   i.e., Pulse-and-Glide (PnG) operation, on traffic smoothness and fuel
   economy in a mixed traffic flow. The mixed traffic flow is assumed to be
   a single-lane highway on flat road consisting of both driverless and
   manually driven vehicles. The driverless vehicles are equipped with fuel
   economy-oriented automated controller using the PnG strategy. The
   manually driven vehicles are simulated using the Intelligent Driver
   Models (IDM) to mimic the average car-following behavior of human
   drivers in naturalistic traffics. A series of simulations are conducted
   with three scenarios, i.e., a single car, a car section, and a car
   platoon. The simulation results show that the PnG strategy can
   significantly improve the fuel economy of individual vehicles. For
   traffic flows, the fuel economy and traffic smoothness vary

Abstract = {{The rapid rise in incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has motivated
   the need for improved methods for surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus.
   Early neoplasia is flat in morphology and patchy in distribution and is
   difficult to detect with conventional white light endoscopy (WLE). Light
   offers numerous advantages for rapidly visualising the oesophagus, and
   advanced optical methods are being developed for wide-field and
   cross-sectional imaging to guide tissue biopsy and stage early
   neoplasia, respectively. We review key features of these promising
   methods and address their potential to improve detection of Barrett's
   neoplasia. The clinical performance of key advanced imaging technologies
   is reviewed, including (1) wide-field methods, such as high-definition
   WLE, chromoendoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence and trimodal
   imaging and (2) cross-sectional techniques, such as optical coherence
   tomography, optical frequency domain imaging and confocal laser
   endomicroscopy. Some of these instruments are being adapted for
   molecular imaging to detect specific biological targets that are
   over-expressed in Barrett's neoplasia. Gene expression profiles are
   being used to identify early targets that appear before morphological
   changes can be visualised with white light. These targets are detected
   in vivo using exogenous probes, such as lectins, peptides, antibodies,
   affibodies and activatable enzymes that are labelled with fluorescence
   dyes to produce high contrast images. This emerging approach has
   potential to provide a `red flag' to identify regions of premalignant
   mucosa, outline disease margins and guide therapy based on the
   underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer progression.}},

Abstract = {{Low-latency, low-overhead and reliable control channels are essential to
   the efficient operation of wireless networks. However, control channels
   that utilize current in-band and out-of-band designs do not fully meet
   this requirement. In this paper, we design and implement Aileron, a
   novel control channel based on automatic modulation recognition that
   carries control frames over an OFDM(A) PHY by varying the modulation
   rate of the OFDM subcarriers. With Aileron, the control information is
   embedded into the modulation type, not as the actual symbol value. The
   thus-transmitted information can be received with little to no frame
   synchronization. We have evaluated Aileron using both extensive
   simulations and real-world measurements, and discovered that control
   frames can be transmitted with more than 80 percent accuracy using only
   10 OFDM blocks on a channel with SNR of merely 10 dB. In order to
   demonstrate its applicability and efficiency in realistic networking
   scenarios, we also show how Aileron can be used in conjunction with a
   fine-grained channel access protocol to increase throughput under
   heterogeneous link conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless networks are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which a malicious
   node poses as many identities in order to gain disproportionate
   influence. Many defenses based on spatial variability of wireless
   channels exist, but depend either on detailed, multi-tap channel
   estimation-something not exposed on commodity 802.11 devices-or valid
   RSSI observations from multiple trusted sources, e.g., corporate access
   points-something not directly available in ad hoc and delay-tolerant
   networks with potentially malicious neighbors. We extend these
   techniques to be practical for wireless ad hoc networks of commodity
   802.11 devices. Specifically, we propose two efficient methods for
   separating the valid RSSI observations of behaving nodes from those
   falsified by malicious participants. Further, we note that prior
   signalprint methods are easily defeated by mobile attackers and develop
   an appropriate challenge-response defense. Finally, we present the Mason
   test, the first implementation of these techniques for ad hoc and
   delay-tolerant networks of commodity 802.11 devices. We illustrate its
   performance in several real-world scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing falsification is a key security threat in cooperative spectrum
   sensing in cognitive radio networks. Intelligent malicious users (IMUs)
   adjust their malicious behaviors according to their objectives and the
   network's defense schemes. Without long-term collection of information
   on users' reputation, the existing schemes fail to thwart such malicious
   behaviors. In this paper, we construct a joint spectrum sensing and
   access framework to thwart the malicious behaviors of both rational and
   irrational IMUs. Lack of reputation information makes the malicious
   behavior resistance degrade performance since the honest users may be
   misjudged as IMUs. Based on the moral hazard principal-agent model, we
   design an incentive compatible mechanism to provide a moderate
   punishment to IMUs. Our findings show that neither spectrum sensing nor
   spectrum access alone can prevent malicious behaviors without any
   information on users' reputation. According to the different properties
   of malicious behavior resistance by spectrum sensing and spectrum
   access, we employ joint spectrum sensing and access to optimally prevent
   the IMUs sensing falsification. The proposed malicious behavior
   resistance mechanism is shown to achieve almost the same performance as
   the ideal case with truthful sensing.}},

Abstract = {{A deep community in a graph is a connected component that can only be
   seen after removal of nodes or edges from the rest of the graph. This
   paper formulates the problem of detecting deep communities as
   multi-stage node removal that maximizes a new centrality measure, called
   the local Fiedler vector centrality (LFVC), at each stage. The LFVC is
   associated with the sensitivity of algebraic connectivity to node or
   edge removals. We prove that a greedy node/edge removal strategy, based
   on successive maximization of LFVC, has bounded performance loss
   relative to the optimal, but intractable, combinatorial batch removal
   strategy. Under a stochastic block model framework, we show that the
   greedy LFVC strategy can extract deep communities with probability one
   as the number of observations becomes large. We apply the greedy LFVC
   strategy to real-world social network datasets. Compared with
   conventional community detection methods we demonstrate improved ability
   to identify important communities and key members in the network.}},

Abstract = {{Models for ignition delay are investigated and fuel-specific properties
   are included to predict the effects of different fuels on the ignition
   delay. These models follow the Arrhenius type expression for the
   ignition delay modified with the oxygen concentration and Cetane number
   to extend the range of validity. In this investigation, two
   fuel-sensitive spray ignition delay models are developed: a global model
   and a local model. The global model is based on the global combustion
   chamber charge properties including temperature, pressure, and
   oxygen/fuel content. The local model is developed to account for
   temporal and spatial variations in properties of separated spray zones
   such as local temperature, oxidizer, and fuel concentrations obtained by
   a quasi-dimensional multizone fuel spray model. These variations are
   integrated in time to predict the ignition delay. Often ignition delay
   models are recalibrated for a specific fuel but in this study, the
   global ignition delay model includes the Cetane number to capture
   ignition delay of various fuels. The local model uses Cetane number and
   local stoichiometric oxygen to fuel molar ratio. The model is therefore
   capable of predicting spray ignition delays for a set of fuels with a
   single calibration. Experimental dataset of spray ignition delay in a
   constant volume chamber is used for model development and calibration.
   The models show a good accuracy for the predicted ignition delay of four
   different fuels: JP8, DF2, n-heptane, and n-dodecane. The investigation
   revealed that the most accurate form of the models is from a calibration
   done for each individual fuel with only a slight decrease in accuracy
   when a single calibration is done for all fuels. The single calibration
   case is the more desirable outcome as it leads to general models that
   cover all the fuels. Of the two proposed models, the local model has a
   slightly better accuracy compared to the global model. Results for both
   models demonstrate the improvements that can be obtained for the
   ignition delay model when additional fuel-specific properties are
   included in the spray ignition model. Other alternative fuels like
   synthetic oxygenated fuels were included in the investigation. These
   fuels behave differently such that the Cetane number does not provide
   the same explanation for the trend in ignition delay. Though of lower
   accuracy, the new models do improve the predictive capability when
   compared with existing types of ignition delay models applied to this
   kind of fuels.}},

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{1152-1166}},

Abstract = {{A multiphysics framework for the high-fidelity simulation of CRUD
   deposition is developed to better understand the coupled physics and
   their respective feedback mechanisms. This framework includes the
   primary physics of lattice depletion, computational fluid dynamics, and
   CRUD chemistry. The three physics are coupled together via the
   operator-splitting technique, where predictor-corrector and fixed-point
   iteration schemes are utilized to converge the nonlinear solution.
   High-fidelity simulations may provide a means to predict and assess
   potential operating issues, including CRUD induced power shift and CRUD
   induced localized corrosion, known as CIPS and CILC, respectively. As a
   proof-of-principle, a coupled 500-day cycle depletion simulation of a
   pressurized water reactor fuel pin cell was performed using the coupled
   code suite; a burnup of 31 MWd/kgHM was reached. The simulation
   recreated the classic striped CRUD pattern often seen on pulled fuel
   rods containing CRUD. It is concluded that the striping is caused by the
   flow swirl induced by spacer grid mixing vanes. Two anti-correlated
   effects contribute to the striping: (1) the flow swirl yields
   significant azimuthal temperature variations, which impact the locations
   where CRUD deposits, and (2) the flow swirl is correlated to increased
   shear stress along the cladding surface and subsequent erosion of the
   CRUD layer. The CIPS condition of the core is concluded to be primarily
   controlled by lithium tetraborate precipitation, referred to as boron
   hideout, which occurs in regions experiencing subcooled nucleate boiling
   as soluble boron and lithium species reach their solubility limit within
   the CRUD layer. Subsequently, a localized reduction in power occurs due
   to the high neutron absorption cross section of boron-10. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Malware is a burgeoning threat for smartphones and continuing advancing.
   Traditional defenses to malware, however, are not suitable for
   smartphones due to their resource intensive nature. This necessitates
   the design of novel mechanisms that can consider the specifics of the
   smartphone malware and smartphones themselves. In this paper, we
   introduce a lightweight permission enforcement approach-Tap-Wave-Rub
   (TWR)-for smartphone malware prevention. TWR is based on simple
   cyber-physical human interactions, i.e., human gestures, that are very
   quick and intuitive but less likely to be exhibited in users' daily
   activities. Presence or absence of such gestures, prior to accessing an
   application, can effectively inform the OS whether the access request is
   benign or malicious. In particular, we present the design of two
   mechanisms: 1) acceleration-based phone tapping detection and 2)
   proximity-based finger tapping, rubbing, or hand waving detection. The
   first mechanism is geared for near field communication applications,
   which usually require the user to tap her phone with another device. The
   second mechanism involves very simple gestures, i.e., tapping or rubbing
   a finger near the top of phone's screen or waving a hand close to the
   phone, and broadly appeals to many applications (e.g., SMS). In
   addition, we present the TWR-enhanced Android permission model, the
   prototypes implementing the underlying gesture recognition mechanisms,
   and a variety of novel experiments to evaluate these mechanisms. Our
   results suggest the proposed approach could be very effective for
   malware detection/prevention, with quite low false positives and false
   negatives, while imposing little to no additional burden on the users.}},

Title = {{Effective non-reflective boundary for Lamb waves: Theory, finite element
   implementation, and applications}},

Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{22-41}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a new approach to designing non-reflective
   boundary (NRB) for inhibiting Lamb wave reflections at structural
   boundaries. Our NRB approach can be effectively and conveniently
   implemented in commercial finite element (FE) codes. The paper starts
   with a review of the state of the art: (a) the absorbing layers by
   increasing damping (ALID) approach; and (b) the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer
   absorbing boundary conditions (LK ABC) approach is briefly presented and
   its inadequacy for Lamb wave applications is explained. Hence, we
   propose a modified Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer approach to be used in the NRB
   design for Lamb wave problems; we call our approach MLK NRB. The
   implementation of this MLK NRB was realized using the spring-damper
   elements which are available in most commercial FE codes. Optimized
   implementation parameters are developed in order to achieve the best
   performance for Lamb wave absorption. Our MLK NRB approach is compared
   with the state of the art ALID and LK ABC methods. Our MLK NRB shows
   better performance than ALID and LK ABC for all Lamb modes in the
   thin-plate structures considered in our examples. Our MLK NRB approach
   is also advantageous at low frequencies and at cut-off frequencies,
   where extremely long wavelengths exist. A comprehensive study with
   various design parameters and plate thicknesses which illustrates the
   advantages and limitations of our MLK NRB approach is presented. MLK NRB
   applications for both transient analysis in time domain and harmonic
   analysis in frequency domain are illustrated. The article finishes with
   conclusions and suggestions for future work. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This experimental work systematically compares the stoichiometric
   alcohol-gasoline and gasoline-alcohol Dual-Fuel Spark Ignition (DFSI)
   combustion for engine particle number (PN) reduction and fuel economy
   improvement using a high compression ratio gasoline engine.
   Alcohol-gasoline DFSI is based on port fuel injection (PFI) of alcohols
   with high oxygenated content, high octane number and high latent heat of
   vaporization and direct injection (DI) of high energy density and high
   volatility fuel. Alternatively the gasoline-alcohol DFSI is based on PFI
   of gasoline and DI of alcohols. Two different alcohols were used,
   including methanol and ethanol for both DFSI strategies. Alcohol mass
   ratio was varied from 0\% to 100\% for all DFSI combustion control
   strategies. Both alcohol-gasoline DFSI and gasoline-alcohol DFSI are
   effective approaches of using alternative alcohol fuels in practical
   gasoline engines with the potential to reduce PN and improve fuel
   economy. With increasing alcohol mass ratio, significant reductions of
   the PN were observed for both combustion strategies, which could result
   in a more than 95\% reduction of PN compared to the baseline. The
   magnitudes of the particle number density for the nucleation and the
   accumulation peaks decreased dramatically for all DFSI combustion
   control strategies. Gasoline-alcohol DFSI generally showed higher fuel
   economy improvement and PN reduction compared to the alcohol-gasoline
   DFSI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar satellite and ground-based Ku- and
   X-band scatterometer measurements are used to explore the scattering
   mechanism for ice in shallow Arctic lakes, wherein strong radiometric
   responses are seen for floating ice, and low returns are evident where
   the ice has grounded. Scatterometer measurements confirm that high
   backscatter is from the ice/water interface, whereas polarimetric
   decomposition suggests that the dominant scattering mechanism from that
   interface is single bounce. Using Fresnel equations, a simple model for
   surface bounce from the ice/water interface is proposed, and its
   predictions are supported by experimental parameters such as co-pol
   phase difference, co-pol ratio, and the results of rigorous numerical
   modeling. Despite early research suggesting double-bounce scattering
   from columnar air bubbles and the ice/water interface as the dominant
   scattering mechanism in shallow lakes, this paper strongly supports a
   single-bounce model.}},

Abstract = {{Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have
   recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations
   globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which
   existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This
   paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems.
   The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for
   solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in
   this hierarchy results in ``tighter{''} relaxations at the computational
   cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are
   capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing
   relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the
   higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger
   problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative
   algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the
   higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming
   solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300
   buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield
   globally optimal solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Compactness and efficiency are the two basic considerations of the
   wireless battery chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid
   EVs. The double-sided LCC compensation topology for wireless power
   transfer (WPT) has been proved to be one of the efficient solutions
   lately. However, with the increase of the numbers of compensation
   components, the volume of the system may become larger, which makes it
   less attractive. To improve the compactness, a bipolar coupler structure
   with a compensation-integrated feature is proposed. The inductors of the
   LCC compensation networks are designed as planar-type and attached to
   the power-transferring main coils. Extra space and magnetic cores for
   the compensated inductors outside of the coupler are saved. The cost is
   that extra couplings between the compensated coils (inductors) and the
   main coils are induced. To validate the feasibility, the proposed
   coupler is modeled and investigated by 3-D finite-element analysis tool
   first. The positioning of the compensated coils, the range of the extra
   couplings, and the tolerance to misalignment are studied. This is
   followed by the circuit modeling and characteristic analysis of the
   proposed WPT topology based on the fundamental harmonic approximation.
   At last, a 600 mm x 600 mm with a nominal 150-mm-gap wireless charger
   prototype, operated at a resonant frequency of 95 kHz and a rated power
   of 5.6 kW has been built and tested. A peak efficiency of 95.36\% from a
   dc power source to the battery load is achieved at rated operation
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{As the wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has been proved to be a
   convenient and reliable charging method to plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles and electric vehicles, the loosely coupled transformer
   structure and size are the primary and fundamental concern to design an
   efficient WPT system. In this paper, a double D (DD) coil and a unipolar
   coil are selected to conduct the study. We focus on the coil structure
   design to achieve the maximum coupling coefficient as well as efficiency
   with two situations: 1) with no misalignment, and 2) with a 75-mm
   door-to-door and 100-mm front-to-back misalignment at which the maximum
   operating capability can still be achieved. A coil size optimization
   process is proposed for both the DD coil and the unipolar coil
   configurations. The relationship between the size of the secondary
   (receiving) coil, which determines the weight of the pad on the vehicle,
   and achievable maximum efficiency is studied for both coil topologies.
   The interoperability between the two coil topologies is studied. The
   proposed transformer structures with aluminum shielding meet human
   exposure regulations of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
   Radiation Protection guidelines as a foundation. Finally, experiments
   validated the analyses.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies systems of polynomial equations that provide
   information about orientability of matroids.
   First, we study systems of linear equations over F-2, originally alluded
   to by Bland and Jensen in their seminal paper on weak orientability. The
   Bland Jensen linear equations for a matroid M have a solution if and
   only if M is weakly orientable. We use the Bland Jensen system to
   determine weak orientability for all matroids on at most nine elements
   and all matroids between ten and twelve elements having rank three. Our
   experiments indicate that for small rank, about half the time, when a
   simple matroid is not orientable, it is already non-weakly orientable,
   and further this may happen more often as the rank increases. Thus,
   about half of the small simple non-orientable matroids of rank three are
   not representable over fields having order congruent to three modulo
   four. For binary matroids, the Bland Jensen linear systems provide a
   practical way to check orientability.
   Second, we present two extensions of the Bland Jensen equations to
   slightly larger systems of non-linear polynomial equations. Our systems
   of polynomial equations have a solution if and only if the associated
   matroid M is orientable. The systems come in two versions, one directly
   extending the Bland Jensen system for F2, and a different system working
   over other fields. We study some basic algebraic properties of these
   systems.
   Finally, we present an infinite family of non-weakly-orientable
   matroids, with growing rank and co-rank. We conjecture that these
   matroids are minor-minimal non-weakly-orientable matroids. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Changes in the composition of type I and type III collagen in tissue can
   shed light on various diseases. However, many of the current collagen
   detection techniques require invasive and destructive tissue sampling.
   In this study, a low cost, low complexity light emitting diode (LED)
   based system was developed to realize both non-invasive detection and
   specific discrimination of collagen and elastin variations in tissue
   based on fluorescence lifetimes. Modulated LED excitation was applied to
   frequency domain (FD) fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy to calculate
   tissue autofluorescence lifetimes. Using this method, fluorescence
   lifetimes from collagen type I versus type III were clearly separated at
   3.95 ns and 5.01 ns, respectively, distinct from the elastin lifetime at
   6.78 ns. The probe was tested on bovine ocular tissues, with cornea
   showing much shorter average lifetime of 4.27 ns than sclera at 7.48 ns.
   Furthermore, measurements of an 8 mm murine skin wound at 14 days
   post-wounding also showed distinct, longer average lifetimes at 9.74 ns
   versus normal skin at 6.72 ns. This FD tissue detection technique can
   potentially offer a way to examine tissue structures and discern the
   underlying pathology nondestructively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Scheduling distributed energy storage units to provide multiple services

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{48-57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{When energy storage units (ESUs) within the distribution grid, such as
   batteries, provide local services such as supporting the integration of
   photovoltaics, peak shaving, and infrastructure upgrade deferral, they
   are inactive or only partially used most of time. Moreover, they are
   often not profitable because of their high investment costs. Their
   unused capacities could be used to provide power system services, such
   as frequency control, allowing them to generate additional revenues.
   However, individual units might not be available to provide system
   services over the entire frequency control contract duration, since they
   must also provide their local services. This paper shows how a set of
   distributed ESUs can simultaneously provide local services individually
   and system services in aggregate. Using a model predictive control
   approach, a central scheduler dynamically allocates parts of the energy
   and power capacities of each ESU to either the local or grid service
   with the objective of maximizing the profit of the aggregation. A key
   contribution of this paper is the development of an algorithm that
   handles both resource aggregation and optimal provision of multiple
   services. We find that multitasking can almost double an ESU's profits
   as compared with a single-service approach, and that the benefits from
   aggregation increase with the frequency control contract duration and
   with the forecast error. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Higher penetration of renewable energy sources and market liberalization
   increase both the need for transmission capacity and the uncertainty in
   power system operation. New methods for power system operational
   planning are needed to allow for efficient use of the grid, while
   maintaining security against disturbances. In this paper, we propose a
   risk model for risks related to outages, accounting for available
   remedial measures and the impact of cascading events. The new risk model
   is used to formulate risk-based constraints for the post-contingency
   line flows, which are included in an optimal power flow (OPF)
   formulation. Forecast uncertainty is accounted for by formulating the
   relevant constraints as a joint chance constraint, and the problem is
   solved using a sampling-based technique. In a case study of the IEEE 30
   bus system, we demonstrate how the proposed risk-based, probabilistic
   OFF allows us to control the risk level, even in presence of
   uncertainty. We investigate the trade-off between generation cost and
   risk level in the system, and show how accounting for uncertainty leads
   to a more expensive, but more secure dispatch. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   that the intrinsic properties of the composites can be maintained after

Abstract = {{The composition of the neutral gas comas of most comets is dominated by
   H2O, CO and CO2, typically comprising as much as 95 per cent of the
   total gas density(1). In addition, cometary comas have been found to
   contain a rich array of other molecules, including sulfuric compounds
   and complex hydrocarbons. Molecular oxygen (O-2), however, despite its
   detection on other icy bodies such as the moons of Jupiter and
   Saturn(2,3), has remained undetected in cometary comas. Here we report
   in situ measurement of O-2 in the coma of comet
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with local abundances ranging from one per
   cent to ten per cent relative to H2O and with a mean value of 3.80 +/-
   0.85 per cent. Our observations indicate that the O-2/H2O ratio is
   isotropic in the coma and does not change systematically with
   heliocentric distance. This suggests that primordial O-2 was
   incorporated into the nucleus during the comet's formation, which is
   unexpected given the low upper limits from remote sensing observations'.
   Current Solar System formation models do not predict conditions that
   would allow this to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Cirrus cloud seeding has been proposed as a possible technique that
   might thin cirrus clouds leading to reduced heating. The technique was
   shown to be viable in one model evaluation. Here we use an updated
   version of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) and
   reevaluate whether seeding is a viable mechanism for cooling. We explore
   different model setups (with and without secondary organic aerosols
   acting as heterogeneous ice nuclei). None of the updated versions of the
   CAM5 lead to a significant amount of negative climate forcing and hence
   do not lead to cooling. We only calculate a net negative cloud forcing
   (-0.740.25Wm(-2)) if we restrict the modeled subgrid-scale updraft
   velocity during nucleation to <0.2ms(-1) and if the deposition of water
   vapor onto preexisting ice crystals during nucleation is not included.
   Hence, we do not find that cirrus cloud seeding is a viable climate
   intervention technique.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{20}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{CuInSe2 and its solid solution with other trivalent metals (M) have
   emerged as technologically significant device materials with
   applications in photovoltaics, thermoelectric, nonlinear optics, etc.
   However, the complex chemical composition and large tolerance of the
   CuMSe2 structure to a wide range of off-stoichiometry generally lead to
   the formation of undesirable impurity binary phases and electronic
   defects during fabrication starting from elements. In this work, we
   demonstrate a simple and elegant strategy for the synthesis of CuInSe2
   with improved control over the chemical composition. The reaction
   proceeds via a redox induced phase transformation of the line compound
   copper diselenide (CuSe2) upon incremental addition of elemental indium.
   Taking into consideration the chemical and structural similarity between
   CuSe, and CuInSe2, we demonstrate the stepwise direct conversion of the
   structural template CuSe2 into (1-x)CuSe2/xCuInSe(2) nanocomposites
   without the formation of undesirable binary or ternary indium phases.
   Through X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy it is
   observed that the structural template provided by CuSe2 serves as
   pathway for the formation of CuInSe2 particles in the size range of 5 to
   50 nm.}},

Abstract = {{We parametrize a molecular dynamics force field for poly(ethylene oxide)
   (PEO) within the Dry Martini coarse-grained (CG) implicit solvent model
   and show that it yields similar distributions of bond lengths, angles
   and torsional angles, and a similar dependence of radius of gyration on
   PEO chain length as those obtained from atomistic and explicit solvent
   CG simulations. We apply these new parameters to simulate self-assembly
   of long-chain single-end-capped CnEm surfactants and double-end-capped
   telechelic polymers CnEmCn, where n is the number of alkane carbons and
   m the number of ethylene oxide monomers. We determine that the average
   equilibrium micelle aggregation number at high concentrations is around
   23 hydrophobes for C12E100, C12E100C12, and C12E200C12, consistent with
   experimental/theoretical results. However, for EO block less than 200
   monomers at 300 K, for example, for C12E45C12 and C12E136C12, telechelic
   polymers phase separate to form a polymer dense phase at low
   concentrations due to the formation of bridged flower-like micelles,
   with critical concentrations for phase separation also in agreement with
   experimental values.}},

Title = {{Utilizing multiple state variables to improve the dynamic range of
   analog switching in a memristor}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Memristors and memristive systems have been extensively studied for data
   storage and computing applications such as neuromorphic systems. To act
   as synapses in neuromorphic systems, the memristor needs to exhibit
   analog resistive switching (RS) behavior with incremental conductance
   change. In this study, we show that the dynamic range of the analog RS
   behavior can be significantly enhanced in a tantalum-oxide-based
   memristor. By controlling different state variables enabled by different
   physical effects during the RS process, the gradual filament expansion
   stage can be selectively enhanced without strongly affecting the abrupt
   filament length growth stage. Detailed physics-based modeling further
   verified the observed experimental effects and revealed the roles of
   oxygen vacancy drift and diffusion processes, and how the diffusion
   process can be selectively enhanced during the filament expansion stage.
   These findings lead to more desirable and reliable memristor behaviors
   for analog computing applications. Additionally, the ability to
   selectively control different internal physical processes demonstrated
   in the current study provides guidance for continued device optimization
   of memristor devices in general. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Evidence for bandgap opening in buckled epitaxial graphene from

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{17}},

Abstract = {{We utilize ultrafast time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as a
   direct, sensitive, and non-contact all-optical probe to investigate the
   hot-carrier relaxation and cooling dynamics of buckled epitaxial
   graphene. This special form of graphene is grown epitaxially on
   nitrogen-seeded single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC(000 (1) over bar))
   substrates by thermal decomposition of Si atoms. The pre-deposited
   interfacial nitrogen atoms pin the first graphene layer to the SiC
   substrate, and cause it and subsequent graphene layers to buckle into
   nanoscale folds, which opens an energy gap of up to similar to 0.7 eV.
   We observe a remarkable increase of up to two orders of magnitude in the
   relaxation rate of the THz carrier dynamics of this semiconducting form
   of epitaxial graphene relative to pristine epitaxial graphene, which we
   attribute to a large enhancement of the optical-phonon-mediated carrier
   cooling and recombination over a wide range of electron temperatures due
   to the finite bandgap. Our results suggest that the introduced bandgap
   is spatially non-homogenous, with local values close to the optical
   phonon energy of similar to 200 meV, which allows the conduction and the
   valence band to be bridged by optical phonon emission. We also
   demonstrate that carrier relaxation times can be modified by orders of
   magnitude by careful bandgap engineering, which could find application
   in novel graphene-based devices that incorporate both metallic and
   semiconducting forms of graphene. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of stimulation modalities (e.g. electrical, optical, and
   chemical) on a large array of neural probes can enable an investigation
   of important underlying mechanisms of brain disorders that is not
   possible through neural recordings alone. Furthermore, it is important
   to achieve this integration of multiple functionalities in a compact
   structure to utilize a large number of the mouse models. Here we present
   a successful optical modulation of in vivo neural signals of a
   transgenic mouse through our compact 2D MEMS neural array (optrodes).
   Using a novel fabrication method that embeds a lower cladding layer in a
   silicon substrate, we achieved a thin silicon 2D optrode array that is
   capable of delivering light to multiple sites using SU-8 as a waveguide
   core. Without additional modification to the microelectrodes, the
   measured impedance of the multiple microelectrodes was below 1 MO at 1
   kHz. In addition, with a low background noise level (+/- 25 mu V),
   neural spikes from different individual neurons were recorded on each
   microelectrode. Lastly, we successfully used our optrodes to modulate
   the neural activity of a transgenic mouse through optical stimulation.
   These results demonstrate the functionality of the 2D optrode array and
   its potential as a next-generation tool for optogenetic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to estimate various sources of numerical error and to
   adaptively control them is a powerful tool in quantifying uncertainty in
   predictive simulations. This work attempts to develop reliable estimates
   of numerical errors resulting from spatial, temporal and stochastic
   approximations of fluid dynamic equations using a discrete adjoint
   approach. Each source of error is isolated and the accuracy of the error
   estimation is verified. When applied to unsteady flow simulations of
   vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT), the procedure demonstrates good
   recovery of discretization errors to provide accurate estimate of the
   objective functional. The framework is then applied to a VAWT simulation
   with inherent stochasticity and is confirmed to effectively estimate
   errors in computing statistical quantities of interest. The ability to
   use these stochastic error estimates as a basis for adaptive sampling is
   also presented. Predictive science is typically constrained by finite
   computational resources and this work demonstrates the viability of
   adjoint-based approaches to budget available computational resources to
   effectively pursue uncertainty quantification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{812}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{In this work we investigate the effects of photoionization on the charge
   state composition of the solar wind. Using measured solar EUV and X-ray
   irradiance, the Michigan Ionization Code and a model for the fast and
   slow solar wind, we calculate the evolution of the charge state
   distribution of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe with and without
   including photoionization for both types of wind. We find that the solar
   radiation has significant effects on the charge state distribution of C,
   N, and O, causing the ionization levels of these elements to be higher
   than without photoionization; differences are largest for oxygen. The
   ions commonly observed for elements heavier than O are much less
   affected, except in ICMEs where Fe ions more ionized than 16+ can also
   be affected by the solar radiation. We also show that the commonly used
   O7+/O6+ density ratio is the most sensitive to photoionization; this
   sensitivity also causes the value of this ratio to depend on the phase
   of the solar cycle. We show that the O7+/O6+ ratio needs to be used with
   caution for solar wind classification and coronal temperature estimates,
   and recommend the C6+/C4+ ratio for these purposes.}},

Title = {{Targeted NF1 cancer therapeutics with multiple modes of action: small

   metabolite, 2-methoxyoestradiol}},

Abstract = {{Background: Both the number and size of tumours in NF1 patients increase
   in response to the rise in steroid hormones seen at puberty and during
   pregnancy. The size of tumours decreases after delivery, suggesting that
   hormone-targeting therapy might provide a viable new NF1 treatment
   approach. Our earlier studies demonstrated that human NF1 tumour cell
   lines either went through apoptosis or ceased growth in the presence of
   2-methoxyoestradiol (2ME2), a naturally occurring anticancer metabolite
   of 17-beta estradiol. Previous reports of treatment with sulfamoylated
   steroidal and non-steroidal derivatives of 2ME2 showed promising
   reductions in tumour burden in hormone-responsive cancers other than
   NF1. Here we present the first studies indicating that 2ME2 derivatives
   could also provide an avenue for treating NF1, for which few treatment
   options are available.
   Methods: STX3451,
   (2-(3-Bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-methoxy-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrah
   ydroisoquinoline), a non-steroidal sulphamate analogue of 2ME2, was
   tested in dose-dependent studies of malignant and benign NF1 human
   tumour cell lines and cell lines with variable controlled neurofibromin
   expression. The mechanisms of action of STX3451 were also analysed.
   Results: We found that STX3451-induced apoptosis in human malignant
   peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines, even in the presence
   of elevated oestrogen and progesterone. It inhibits both PI3 kinase and
   mTOR signalling pathways. It disrupts actin-and microtubule-based
   cytoskeletal structures in cell lines derived from human MPNSTs and in
   cells derived from benign plexiform neurofibromas. STX3451 selectively
   kills MPNST-derived cells, but also halts growth of other tumour-derived
   NF1 cell lines.
   Conclusion: STX3451 provides a new approach for inducing cell death and
   lowering tumour burden in NF1 and other hormone-responsive cancers with
   limited treatment options.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines thermal efficiency penalties and greenhouse gas as
   well as other pollutant emissions associated with pulverized coal (PC)
   power plants equipped with postcombustion CO2 capture for carbon
   sequestration. We find that, depending on the source of heat used to
   meet the steam requirements in the capture unit, retrofitting a PC power
   plant that maintains its gross power output (compared to a PC power
   plant without a capture unit) can cause a drop in plant thermal
   efficiency of 11.3-22.9\%-points. This estimate for efficiency penalty
   is significantly higher than literature values and corresponds to an
   increase of about 5.3-7.7 US cent/kWh in the levelized cost of
   electricity (COE) over the 8.4 US cent/kWh COE value for PC plants
   without CO2 capture. The results follow from the inclusion of mass and
   energy feedbacks in PC power plants with CO2 capture into previous
   analyses, as well as including potential quality considerations for safe
   and reliable transportation and sequestration of CO2. We conclude that
   PC power plants with CO2 capture are likely to remain less competitive
   than natural gas combined cycle (without CO2 capture) and on-shore wind
   power plants, both from a levelized and marginal COE point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) is the irreversible necrosis of heart with
   approximately 1.5 million cases every year in the United States. Tissue
   engineering offers a promising strategy for cardiac repair after MI.
   However, the optimal cell source for heart tissue regeneration and the
   ideal scaffolds to support cell survival, differentiation, and
   integration, remain to be developed. To address these issues, we
   developed the technology to induce cardiovascular progenitor cells
   (CPCs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) towards desired
   cardiomyocytes as well as smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. We
   fabricated extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking nanofibrous
   poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds with porous structure of high
   interconnection for cardiac tissue formation. The CPCs were seeded into
   the scaffolds to engineer cardiac constructs in vitro. Fluorescence
   staining and RT-PCR assay showed that the scaffolds facilitated cell
   attachment, extension, and differentiation. Subcutaneous implantation of
   the cell/scaffold constructs in a nude mouse model showed that the
   scaffolds favorably supported survival of the grafted cells and their
   commitment to the three desired lineages in vivo. Thus, our study
   suggested that the porous nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds support cardiac
   tissue formation from CPCs. The integration of CPCs with the nanofibrous
   PLLA scaffolds represents a promising tissue engineering strategy for
   cardiac repair.

Abstract = {{Biomaterials with injectability, conductivity and antibacterial effect
   simultaneously have been rarely reported. Herein, we developed a new
   series of in situ forming antibacterial conductive degradable hydrogels
   using quaternized chitosan (QCS) grafted polyaniline with oxidized
   dextran as crosslinker. The chemical structures, morphologies,
   electrochemical property, conductivity, swelling ratio, rheological
   property, in vitro biodegradation and gelation time of hydrogels were
   characterized. Injectability was verified by in vivo subcutaneous
   injection on a Sprague Dawley rat. The antibacterial activity of the
   hydrogels was firstly evaluated employing antibacterial assay using
   Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. The hydrogels
   containing polyaniline showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared
   to QCS hydrogel, especially for hydrogels with 3 wt\% polyaniline
   showing 95 kill\% and 90 kill\% for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively.
   Compared with QCS hydrogel, the hydrogels with 3 wt\% polyaniline still
   showed enhanced antibacterial activity for E. coli in vivo. The
   adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were used to evaluate
   the cytotoxicity of the hydrogels and hydrogels with polyaniline showed
   better cytocompatibility than QCS hydrogel. The electroactive hydrogels
   could significantly enhance the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts
   compared to QCS hydrogel. This work opens the way to fabricate in situ
   forming antibacterial and electroactive degradable hydrogels as a new
   class of bioactive scaffolds for tissue regeneration applications. (C)

Title = {{cnvCurator: an interactive visualization and editing tool for somatic
   copy number variations}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of the most important somatic aberrations, copy number
   variations (CNVs) in tumor genomes is believed to have a high
   probability of harboring oncotargets. Detection of somatic CNVs is an
   essential part of cancer genome sequencing analysis, but the accuracy is
   usually limited due to various factors. A post-processing procedure
   including manual review and refinement of CNV segments is often needed
   in practice to achieve better accuracy.
   Results: cnvCurator is a user-friendly tool with functions specifically
   designed to facilitate the process of interactively visualizing and
   editing somatic CNV calling results. Different from other general
   genomics viewers, the index and display of CNV calling results in
   cnvCurator is segment central. It incorporates multiple CNV-specific
   information for concurrent, interactive display, as well as a number of
   relevant features allowing user to examine and curate the CNV calls.
   Conclusions: cnvCurator provides important and practical utilities to
   assist the manual review and edition of results from a chosen somatic
   CNV caller, such that curated CNV segments will be used for down-stream
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The development of organic optoelectronic devices relies on controlling
   interfaces during thin-film deposition and requires an accurate
   characterization of the film composition at these interfaces. Dynamic
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is widely used to investigate
   multilayer thin-film structures. Routine analysis protocols are well
   established for classical semiconductor samples, but for organic or
   mixed metallic organic samples the limitations of the technique are less
   well established. In the current work, low-energy dynamic SIMS is used
   on metal-organic multilayered model structures similar to those in
   organic optoelectronic devices to study the origin of diffusion of metal
   into the organic layer (e.g., irradiation-induced diffusion during SIMS
   analysis or during the deposition process). Samples contain silver and
   organic compounds sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation in
   vacuum onto a Si substrate. They are analyzed using 4 250 eV to 1 keV
   Cs+ primary ion beam. It is found that the mixing of silver into the
   organic layer depends on the impact energy and the conditions for sample
   preparation. This irradiation effect can be minimized by a back-side
   depth profiling approach, which was developed in this work. By applying
   this method, it is shown that some silver is likely to diffuse into the
   organic layers during the deposition process.}},

Abstract = {{Development of both fundamental research and clinical applications of
   photoacoustic imaging call for ultrasound detectors of high sensitivity,
   flat frequency response, and compact size, which are not easily

   the microring's unique properties make it act as a high-performance
   ultrasound detector in photoacoustic imaging systems. The imprinted
   polymer microring has high detection sensitivity, broadband frequency
   response, compact size, and good operation robustness. Application of
   microrings in photoacoustic tomography generates truthful reconstructed
   images; use of microring in photoacoustic microscopy leads to improved
   image resolution; and the detector's compact size makes it promising for
   photoacoustic endoscopic applications. When integrated with other

Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate irradiation-induced
   point defect evolution in fcc pure Ni, Ni0.5Fe0.5, and Ni0.8Cr0.2 solid
   solution alloys. We find that irradiation-induced interstitials form
   dislocation loops that are of 1/3 < 1 1 1 >\{1 1 1\}-type, consistent
   with our experimental results. While the loops are formed in all the
   three materials, the kinetics of formation is considerably slower in
   NiFe and NiCr than in pure Ni, indicating that defect migration barriers
   and extended defect formation energies could be higher in the alloys
   than pure Ni. As a result, while larger size clusters are formed in pure
   Ni, smaller and more clusters are observed in the alloys. Vacancy
   diffusion occurs at relatively higher temperatures than interstitials,
   and their clustering leads to the formation of stacking fault
   tetrahedra, consistent with our experiments. The results also show that
   the surviving Frenkel pairs are composition dependent and are largely Ni
   dominated. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Single-domain spectral methods have been largely restricted to tensor
   product bases on a tensor product grid. To break the ``tensor
   barrier{''}, we studied approximation in two idealized families of
   domains. One family is bounded by a ``squircle{''}, the zero isoline of
   B(x - y) - x(2v) + y(2v) - 1. The boundary varies smoothly from a circle
   {[}v - 1] to the square {[}v = infinity]. The other family is bounded by
   a ``perturbed quadrifolium{''}, the plane algebraic curve delta(x(2) +
   y(2)) - (x(2) + y(2))(3) - (x(2) - y(2))(2)); this varies smoothly from
   the singular, self-intersecting curve known as the quadrifolium to a
   circle as 6 varies from zero to infinity. We compared two different
   bivariate polynomial bases, truncating by total degree. Zernike
   polynomials are natural for the disk: tensor products of Chebyshev
   polynomials are equally sensible for the square. Both yield an
   exponential rate of convergence for our non-tensor, neither
   disk-nor-square domains: indeed, the Chebyshev basis worked well for the
   disk and the Zernike polynomials were good for the square. The expected
   differences due to numerical ill-conditioning did not emerge, much to
   our surprise. The price for the nontensor domain was that
   hyperinterpolation was necessary, that is, least squares fitting with
   more interpolation constraints than unknowns. Denoting the number of
   interpolation points by P and the basis size by N, a ratio of PIN around
   two to three was optimum while P near one was very inacccurate. A
   uniform grid, truncated to include only those points within the squircle
   or other boundary curve, was satisfactory even without interpolation
   points on the boundary (although boundary points are a cost-effective
   improvement). Interpolation costs were greatly reduced by exploiting the
   invariance of the squircle-bounded and perturbed-quadrifolium domains to
   the eight element D-4 dihedral group. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A low-cost and real-time frequency division multiplexing system is
   proposed based on multi-longitudinal mode fiber laser sensor array and
   beat signal demodulation technology. The lasers have staggered cavity
   lengths with corresponding mode spacing. Beat signals of the
   longitudinal modes of each laser in the array are detected by a common
   detector. A relationship is worked out between the maximum multiplexing
   number of the sensors and maximum detectable frequency. A multiplexing
   array with four laser sensors is investigated experimentally and its
   potential application for strain measurement is also demonstrated. In
   the proposed multiplexing system, only one common photodetector and a
   commercial frequency analyzer are used to monitor all sensors
   simultaneously, which greatly decreases the cost of the system and makes
   it more competitive in large-scale monitoring field.}},

Abstract = {{A radiant porous burner with augmented preheating (i.e., superadiabatic
   radiant burner, SRB) is experimentally investigated. The porous alumina
   (Al2O3) burner with a square cross-section consists of a small-pored
   upstream section for internally preheating the incoming gas mixture, a
   large-pored downstream section for establishing flame, a preheater for
   externally recovering heat from the exiting flue gas and preheating the
   inlet air for the burner in addition to the internal heat recirculation
   in the small-pored upstream section, and radiation corridors for
   extracting heat from the flame and transferring it to radiating disk
   surfaces. Temperature distribution and combustion stability limits of
   flame in the SRB and the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO)
   emissions are measured. Results show that the SRB can be operated even
   at very fuel-lean condition because of the internal and external heat
   recirculation, showing blow-off and flash-back limits for a given
   fuel-equivalence ratio. It is observed that the superadiabatic radiation
   temperature on the disk surfaces is higher than the flue gas temperature
   at the same axial location, experimentally confirming the previous
   theoretical and computational results of SRBs. Improved performance of
   CO and NOx emissions compared with the conventional porous radiant
   burners also indicates that the SRB is acceptable for practical
   application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal characteristics of plastic instability denoted by
   locally extreme values in strain rate contours computed with digital
   image correlation are investigated in biaxial deformation of AA5182-O
   sheet. Temporal characteristics are similar to those of Portevin-Le
   Chatelier (PLC) bands in uniaxial tension. Spatial characteristics,
   however, dramatically differ from PLC band morphologies in uniaxial
   tension. Initiation occurs in a localized deformation ring (LDR) that
   does not include the pole, followed by a rapid transition to a circular
   region that includes pole, i.e. a localized deformation circle (LDC). A
   critical strain is required to trigger serrated flow at the pole, and a
   negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress at the pole suggests
   that the underlying microstructural mechanism is dynamic strain aging.
   Plastic instability hops between the LDR and the LDC until a critical
   strain is reached at which it appears in a localized deformation band,
   with no circular symmetry, that hops around the pole. Future model
   development will require modifications to existing theoretical
   frameworks to account for the unique spatial characteristics of plastic
   instability during biaxial deformation of AA5XXX alloys. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, a high-performance T-1-T-2 dual-model contrast agent by
   gadolinium-doped iron oxide nanoparticle (GION) is developed. Following
   its development, the application of this agent in vivo by combining
   doxorubicin (DOX) and folic acid (FA) (FA-GION-DOX) for targeted drug
   delivery to monitor cancer treatment is explored. GION showed transverse
   and longitudinal relaxivities up to 182.7 x 10(-3) and 7.87 x
   10(-3)m(-1) s(-1), respectively, upon Gd/Fe ratio in GION at 1/4. DOX
   released from FA-GION-DOX is pH dependent and only kills cancer cell
   after FA receptor-mediated internalization into the acidic environment
   of endosomes and lysosomes. Systemic delivery of FA-GION-DOX
   significantly inhibits the growth of tumors and shows good magnetic
   resonance enhancement in a human cervical cancer xenograft model. Thus,
   FA-GION-DOX has a potential application for the targeted and magnetic

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design of a microcoupler in the near-infrared
   region. The proposed structure consists of two alternately arranged
   complementary media. The complementary media, which consist of
   double-positive material and double-negative material, also can be made
   of a pair of single-negative materials. Simulation results show that the
   proposed structure has an excellent coupling efficiency compared to
   direct coupling. It has a maximum coupling efficiency closing to 1 at
   1550 nm. As the total size of the coupling structure decreases, the
   passband exhibits a property of gradual blue shift. Therefore, we can
   design couplers operating in different frequency bands with high
   coupling efficiency. The influence of the permittivity and the thickness
   of each material layer on the coupling efficiency are also studied in
   detail. The proposed microcoupler has potential guidance in the design
   and development of high-performance coupling structures. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{A dual-particle imaging (DPI) system, capable of simultaneously imaging
   fast neutrons and gamma rays, has been operated in the presence of
   mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel to assess the system's angular resolution and
   material-characterization capabilities. The detection principle is based
   on the scattering physics of neutrons (elastic scattering) and gamma
   rays (Compton scattering) in organic and inorganic scintillators. The
   detection system is designed as a combination of a two-plane Compton
   camera and a neutronscatter camera. The front plane consists of E1-309
   liquid scintillators and the back plane consists of interleaved EJ-309
   and Nai(Tl) scintillators. MCNPX-PoliMi was used to optimize the
   geometry of the system and the resulting prototype was built and tested
   using a CI-252 source as an SNM surrogate. A software package was
   developed to acquire and process data in real Lime. The software was
   used for a measurement campaign to assess the angular resolution of the
   imaging system with MOX samples. Measurements of two MOX canisters of
   similar isotopics and intensity were performed for 6 different canister
   separations (from 5 degrees to 30 degrees, corresponding to distances of
   21 cm and 131 cm, respectively). The measurements yielded a minimum
   separation of 20 degrees at 2.5 m (86-cm separation) required to see 2
   separate hot spots. Additionally, the results displayed good agreement
   with MCNPX-PoliMi simulations. These results indicate an angular
   resolution between 15 degrees and 20 degrees, given the 5 degrees step.
   Coupled with its large field of view, and its capability to
   differentiate between spontaneous fission and (on) sources, the DPI
   system shows its potential for nuclear-nonproliferation applications.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical model to estimate both production
   frontier and energy demand frontier, and evaluate the energy efficiency
   in the automotive manufacturing sector using plant-level production and
   utility consumption data. By using the stochastic frontier analysis, two
   modelsan output efficiency model (production frontier) and an input
   efficiency model (energy demand frontier)are developed to analyze the
   plant's energy efficiency performance relative to the best practice'
   among peers. Both the structure and parameters of two stochastic
   frontier functions are identified to understand the relationship between
   production inputs (e.g., utilities and plant-specific variables) and the
   overall productivity. A case study of a set of automotive engine
   manufacturing plants is conducted and shows that electricity has higher
   efficiency than other forms of utility in those production-related
   activities, and the regional and climate factors have significant
   impacts on energy efficiency. The models provide a way to measure how
   far from the production frontier as well as how far from the energy
   demand frontier the plant is. The results also provide useful
   information about the inefficient energy components in manufacturing
   facilities. The opportunities of improving plant-level efficiency in
   automotive manufacturing plants can be revealed by the results.

Abstract = {{Colloidal crystal structures with complexity and diversity rivaling
   atomic and molecular crystals have been predicted and obtained for hard
   particles by entropy maximization. However, thus far homochiral
   colloidal crystals, which are candidates for photonic metamaterials, are
   absent. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that chiral polyhedra
   exhibiting weak directional entropic forces self-assemble either an
   achiral crystal or a chiral crystal with limited control over the
   crystal handedness. Building blocks with stronger faceting exhibit
   higher selectivity and assemble a chiral crystal with handedness
   uniquely determined by the particle chirality. Tuning the strength of
   directional entropic forces by means of particle rounding or the use of
   depletants allows for reconfiguration between achiral and homochiral
   crystals. We rationalize our findings by quantifying the chirality
   strength of each particle, both from particle geometry and potential of
   mean force and torque diagrams.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Various toxicants, drugs and their metabolites carry potential ovarian
   toxicity. Ovarian follicles, the functional unit of the ovary, are
   susceptible to this type of damage at all stages of their development.
   However, despite of the large scale of potential negative impacts,
   assays that study ovarian toxicity are limited. Exposure of cultured
   ovarian follicles to toxicants of interest served as an important tool
   for evaluation of toxic effects for decades. Mouse follicles cultured on
   the bottom of a culture dish continue to serve an important approach for
   mechanistic studies. In this paper, we demonstrated the usefulness of a
   hydrogel based 3-dimensional (3D) mouse ovarian follicle culture as a
   tool to study ovarian toxicity in a different setup. The 3D in vitro
   culture, based on fibrin alginate interpenetrating network (FA-IPN),
   preserves the architecture of the ovarian follicle and physiological
   structure-function relationship. We applied the novel 3D high-throughput
   (HTP) in vitro ovarian follicle culture system to study the ovotoxic
   effects of an anti-cancer drug, Doxorobucin (DXR). The fibrin component
   in the system is degraded by plasmin and appears as a clear circle
   around the encapsulated follicle. The degradation area of the follicle
   is strongly correlated with follicle survival and growth. To analyze
   fibrin degradation in a high throughput manner, we created a custom
   MATLAB (R) code that converts brightfield micrographs of follicles
   encapsulated in FA-IPN to binary images, followed by image analysis. We
   did not observe any significant difference between manually processed
   images to the automated MATLAB (R) method, thereby confirming that the
   automated program is suitable to measure fibrin degradation to evaluate
   follicle health. The cultured follicles were treated with DXR at
   concentrations ranging from 0.005 nM to 200 nM, corresponding to the
   therapeutic plasma levels of DXR in patients. Follicles treated with DXR
   demonstrated decreased survival rate in greater DXR concentrations. We
   observed partial follicle survival of 35\% +/- 3\% (n = 80) in 0.01nM
   treatment and 48\% +/- 2\% (n = 92) in 0.005 nM, which we identified as
   the IC50 for secondary follicles. In summary, we established a 3D in
   vitro ovarian follicle culture system that could be used in an HTP
   approach to measure toxic effects on ovarian follicles.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{40}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{We study percolation on self-dual hypergraphs that contain hyperedges
   with four bounding vertices, or `four-edges', using three different
   generators, each containing bonds or sites with three distinct
   probabilities p, r, and t connecting the four vertices. We find explicit
   values of these probabilities that satisfy the self-duality conditions
   discussed by Bollobas and Riordan. This demonstrates that explicit
   solutions of the self-duality conditions can be found using generators
   containing bonds and sites with independent probabilities. These
   solutions also provide new examples of lattices where exact percolation
   critical points are known. One of the generators exhibits three distinct
   criticality solutions (p, r, t). We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations of
   two of the generators on two different hypergraphs to confirm the
   critical values. For the case of the hypergraph and uniform generator
   studied by Wierman et al, we also determine the threshold p = 0.441 374
   +/- 0.000 001, which falls within the tight bounds that they derived.
   Furthermore, we consider a generator in which all or none of the
   vertices can connect, and find a soluble inhomogeneous percolation
   system that interpolates between site percolation on the union-jack
   lattice and bond percolation on the square lattice.}},

   plant inspired innovation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{111}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Inspired by the impulsive movements in plants, this research
   investigates the physics of a novel fluidic origami concept for its
   pressure-dependent multistability. In this innovation, fluid-filled
   tubular cells are synthesized by integrating different Miura-Ori sheets
   into a three-dimensional topological system, where the internal
   pressures are strategically controlled similar to the motor cells in
   plants. Fluidic origami incorporates two crucial physiological features
   observed in nature: one is distributed, pressurized cellular
   organization, and the other is embedded multi-stability. For a single
   fluidic origami cell, two stable folding configurations can coexist due
   to the nonlinear relationships among folding, crease material
   deformation and internal volume change. When multiple origami cells are
   integrated, additional multi-stability characteristics could occur via
   the interactions between pressurized cells. Changes in the fluid
   pressure can tailor the existence and shapes of these stable folding
   configurations. As a result, fluidic origami can switch between being
   mono-stable, bistable and multi-stable with pressure control, and
   provide a rapid `snap-through' type of shape change based on the similar
   principles as in plants. The outcomes of this research could lead to the
   development of new adaptive materials or structures, and provide
   insights for future plant physiology studies at the cellular level.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical body shape model (SBSM) for children was developed for
   generating a child body shape with desired anthropometric parameters. A
   standardised template mesh was fit to whole-body laser scan data from
   137 children aged 3-11 years. The mesh coordinates along with a set of
   surface landmarks and 27 manually measured anthropometric variables were
   analysed using principal component (PC) analysis. PC scores were
   associated with anthropometric predictors such as stature, body mass
   index (BMI) and ratio of erect sitting height to stature (SHS) using a
   regression model. When the original scan data were compared with the
   predictions of the SBSM using each subject's stature, BMI and SHS, the
   mean absolute error was 10.45.8mm, and 95th percentile error was 24.0
   +/- 18.5mm. The model, publicly available online, will have utility for
   a wide range of applications.Practitioner Summary: A statistical body
   shape model for children helps to account for inter-individual
   variability in body shapes as well as anthropometric dimensions. This
   parametric modelling approach is useful for reliable prediction of the
   body shape of a specific child with a few given predictors such as

Abstract = {{Controlling variations in part surface shapes is critical to
   high-precision manufacturing. To estimate the surface variations, a
   manufacturing plant usually employs a number of multi-resolution
   metrology systems to measure surface flatness and roughness with limited
   information about surface shape. Conventional research establishes
   surface models by considering spatial correlation; however, the
   prediction accuracy is restricted by the measurement range, speed, and
   resolution of metrology systems. In addition, existing monitoring
   approaches do not locate abnormal variations and lead to high rates of
   false alarms or misdetections. This article proposes a new methodology
   for efficiently measuring and monitoring surface variations by fusing
   in-plant multi-resolution measurements and process information. The
   fusion is achieved by considering cross-correlations among the measured
   data and manufacturing process variables along with spatial
   correlations. Suchcross-correlations are induced by cutting force
   dynamics and can be used to reduce the amount of measurements or improve
   prediction precision. Under a Bayesian framework, the prediction model
   is combined with measurements on incoming parts to progressively make
   inferences on surface shapes. Based on the inference, a new monitoring
   scheme is proposed for jointly detecting and locating defective areas
   without significantly increasing false alarms. A case study demonstrates
   the effectiveness of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding energy transport and dissipation in nanoscale devices is
   of increasing importance. Novel transport and dissipation phenomena are
   expected to arise in these devices as the characteristic dimensions
   become comparable to the wavelength, coherence length, and mean free
   path (MFP) of charge and energy carrierselectrons and phonons. Of
   particular importance are irreversible processes that occur in all
   nanoscale devices under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated
   with Joule heating and resultant temperature gradients. Therefore, the
   ability to measure local temperatures with nanometer resolution is
   critical for characterizing and understanding irreversibility, heat
   dissipation, and transport in nanoscale devices. A novel approach for
   high-resolution characterization of temperature fields is scanning
   thermal microscopy (SThM), which leverages special scanning probes with
   integrated temperature sensors. This review discusses various SThM
   techniques and highlights recent advances in ultra-high-vacuum SThM
   techniques for quantitative nanoscale thermometry. Further, we discuss
   applications of SThM to the elucidation of energy transport and
   dissipation in functional devices as well as prototypical
   low-dimensional devices.}},

Abstract = {{Placing sensors in every station of a process or every element of a
   system to monistor its state or performance is usually too expensive or
   physically impossible. Therefore, a systematic method is needed to
   select important sensing variables. The method should not only be
   capable of identifying important sensors/signals among multistream
   signals from a distributed sensing system, but should also be able to
   extract a small set of interpretable features from the high-dimensional
   vector of a selected signal. For this purpose, we develop a new
   hierarchical regularization approach called hierarchical nonnegative
   garrote (NNG). At the first level of hierarchy, a group NNG is used to
   select important signals, and at the second level, the individual
   features within each signal are selected using a modified version of NNG
   that possesses good properties for the estimated coefficients.
   Performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other
   existing methods through Monte Carlo simulation. A case study is
   conducted to demonstrate the proposed methodology that can be applied to
   develop a predictive model for the assessment of vehicle design comfort
   based on the tested drivers' motion trajectory signals. This article has
   supplementary material online.}},

Title = {{The Collapse and Expansion of Liquid-Filled Elastic Channels and Cracks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The rate at which fluid drains from a collapsing channel or crack
   depends on the interaction between the elastic properties of the solid
   and the fluid flow. The same interaction controls the rate at which a
   pressurized fluid can flow into a crack. In this paper, we present an
   analysis for the interaction between the viscous flow and the elastic
   field associated with an expanding or collapsing fluid-filled channel.
   We first examine an axisymmetric problem for which a completely
   analytical solution can be developed. A thick-walled elastic cylinder is
   opened by external surface tractions, and its core is filled by a fluid.
   When the applied tractions are relaxed, a hydrostatic pressure gradient
   drives the fluid to the mouth of the cylinder. The relationship between
   the change in dimensions, time, and position along the cylinder is given
   by the diffusion equation, with the diffusion coefficient being
   dependent on the modulus of the substrate, the viscosity of the fluid,
   and the ratio of the core radius to the exterior radius of the cylinder.
   The second part of the paper examines the collapse of elliptical
   channels with arbitrary aspect ratios, so as to model the behavior of
   fluid-filled cracks. The channels are opened by a uniaxial tension
   parallel to their minor axes, filled with a fluid, and then allowed to
   collapse. The form of the analysis follows that of the axisymmetric
   calculations, but is complicated by the fact that the aspect ratio of
   the ellipse changes in response to the local pressure. Approximate
   analytical solutions in the form of the diffusion equation can be found
   for small aspect ratios. Numerical solutions are given for more extreme
   aspect ratios, such as those appropriate for cracks. Of particular note
   is that, for a given cross-sectional area, the rate of collapse is
   slower for larger aspect ratios. With minor modifications to the initial
   conditions and the boundary conditions, the analysis is also valid for
   cracks being opened by a pressurized fluid.}},

Title = {{Residual Stresses Due to Rigid Cylinder Indentation and Rolling at a
   Very High Rolling Load}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, residual stresses due to indentation and rolling of a
   rigid cylinder on a finite plate at a very high rolling load with a
   relative peak pressure of 22 are examined by two-dimensional plane
   strain finite element analyses using ABAQUS for the first time. In the
   finite element analyses, the roller is modeled as rigid and has
   frictionless contact with the finite plate. The geometry of the finite
   plate and its boundary conditions are assigned to correspond to those of
   fillet rolling of crankshafts with the constraint in the rolling
   direction. Finite element analyses with different meshes for single
   indentation on an elastic flat plate under plane strain conditions are
   first carried out, and the results are bench-marked with those of the
   elastic Hertzian solutions to establish the requirement of the finite
   element meshes for acceptable numerical results. The results show that
   the accuracy of computational results is limited by the discretization
   of the finite element analysis by a plot of the contact width as a
   function of the load. For accurate peak pressure, a total of at least
   eight linear elements are needed. Finite element analyses with different
   meshes for single indentation on an elastic-plastic flat plate under
   plane strain conditions are then carried out. The plate material is
   modeled as an elastic-plastic power-law strain hardening material with a
   nonlinear kinematic hardening rule for loading and unloading. The
   computational results are compared to establish the requirement of the
   finite element meshes for acceptable numerical results within 4 mm
   distance to the rolling surface for the crankshaft fatigue analyses. The
   computational results for rolling at the relative peak pressure of 22
   show that the symmetric Hertzian or modified Hertzian pressure
   distribution should not be used to represent the contact pressure
   distribution for rolling simulation, while the computational results for
   rolling at the relative peak pressure of 5 show that the symmetric
   Hertzian or modified Hertzian pressure distribution may be used to
   represent the contact pressure distribution for rolling simulation. The
   computational results for the rolling case also show a significantly
   higher longitudinal compressive residual stress and a lower out-of-plane
   compressive residual stress along the contact surface when compared to
   those for the single indentation case. The results suggest that the
   effects of rolling must be accounted for when two-dimensional finite
   element analyses of crankshaft sections are used to investigate the
   residual stresses due to fillet rolling of the crankshafts under the
   prescribed roller loads. Due to the boundary conditions of the finite
   plate, the compressive residual stresses are larger when compared to
   those when the boundary conditions of the finite plate are fully
   relaxed.}},

Abstract = {{Failure mode and fatigue behavior of dissimilar friction stir spot welds
   in lap-shear specimens of transformation-induced plasticity steel
   (TRIP780) and hot-stamped boron steel (HSBS) sheets are examined in this
   paper. Optical micrographs of the dissimilar TRIP780/HSBS friction stir
   spot welds made by a concave silicon nitride tool before and after
   testing are obtained and examined. These micrographs indicate that
   subject to quasi-static and cyclic loading conditions, the TRIP780/HSBS
   welds fail from cracks growing through the TRIP780 sheets where the tool
   was plunged into and the thickness was reduced. The bending moments and
   the transverse shear force near the welds are derived with consideration
   of the load offset, the weld gap, and the bend distance for calculation
   of analytical global stress intensity factor solutions for the welds in
   lap-shear specimens. A fatigue model of kinked crack growth is used to
   estimate fatigue lives based on the local stress intensity factor
   solutions for kinked cracks. The estimated fatigue lives with
   consideration of the weld gap and the bend distance are in agreement
   with the fatigue test results under low-cycle loading conditions and
   lower than the fatigue test results under high-cycle loading conditions.
   The estimated fatigue lives suggest that the weld gap and the bend
   distance can significantly affect fatigue lives of the friction stir
   spot welds in lap-shear specimens under cyclic loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir forming (FSF) is a new environmentally friendly
   manufacturing process for lap joining of dissimilar materials.
   Fundamentally, this process is based on frictionally heating and

   material. In this research, the significant process parameters were
   identified and optimized for Al 6014 alloy and mild steel using a design
   of experiments (DOE) methodology. The overall joint structure and grain
   microstructure were mapped as the FSF process progressed and the
   aluminum work material deformed through different stages. It was found
   that the work material within the joint exhibited two layers,
   thermomechanical affected zone, which formed due to the contact pressure
   and angular momentum of the tool, and heat affected formation zone,
   which was composed of work material formed through the hole in the steel
   sheet and into the anvil cavity. Two different geometries of anvil
   design were employed to investigate geometrical effects during FSF of

Abstract = {{In this study, a coupled thermomechanical model has been developed for
   the plunge stage of friction-stir welding (FSW) for joining dissimilar
   Al 6061 to TRIP steel. Governing equations of mass, momentum, and energy
   have been formulated for the bulk material and the interface,
   respectively. Generalized material properties defined with the field
   variable a are introduced for material identification at different
   regions. Local instant formulation based on binary phase flow theories
   has been proposed for developing conservation equations at the
   interface. These analytical derivations are then implemented into a
   finite-element model for numerical simulations. In the early stage of
   plunging, the estimated axial force correlates well with the
   experimental results, where a short plateau can be observed before the
   final peak occurs. Discrepancies at the later stage can be attributed to
   different experimental configurations and related simplified model
   assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of a sliding microflap to simultaneously reduce
   rotorcraft vibrations and noise was examined at a descending flight
   condition of advance ratio 0.15 with significant blade-vortex

   configuration, were considered. Closed-loop control studies were
   conducted on a hingeless rotor configuration resembling MBB BO-105,
   using the adaptive higher harmonic control algorithm. The performance of
   the microflap was also compared to a conventional trailing-edge plain
   flap. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and control authority of
   the microflap for simultaneous BVI noise and vibration reduction in
   rotorcraft. Finally, a new saturation control algorithm is developed for
   limiting the microflap or flap deflections such that the best
   utilization of on-blade controllers implemented through multiple control
   surfaces is achieved. The performance of the new algorithm is compared
   to the existing ones on the dual and five-microflap configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study is to present dual solutions for the
   problem of magneto-hydrodynamic Jeffery-Hamel nano-fluid flow in
   non-parallel walls. To do so, we employ a new analytical technique,
   Predictor Homotopy Analysis Method (PHAM). This effective method is
   capable to calculate all branches of the multiple solutions
   simultaneously. Moreover, comparison of the PHAM results with numerical
   results obtained by the shooting method coupled with a Runge-Kutta
   integration method illustrates the high accuracy for this technique. For
   the current problem, it is found that the multiple (dual) solutions
   exist for some values of governing parameters especially for the
   convergent channel cases (alpha = -1). The fluid in the non-parallel
   walls, divergent and convergent channels, is the drinking water
   containing different nanoparticles; Copper oxide (CuO), Copper (Cu) and
   Silver (Ag). The effects of nanoparticle volume fraction parameter
   (phi), Reynolds number (Re), magnetic parameter (Mn), and angle of the
   channel (alpha) as well as different types of nanoparticles on the flow
   characteristics are discussed.}},

Title = {{Modeling NAPL dissolution from pendular rings in idealized porous media}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{8182-8197}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The dissolution rate of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) often governs the
   remediation time frame at subsurface hazardous waste sites. Most
   formulations for estimating this rate are empirical and assume that the
   NAPL is the nonwetting fluid. However, field evidence suggests that some
   waste sites might be organic wet. Thus, formulations that assume the
   NAPL is nonwetting may be inappropriate for estimating the rates of NAPL
   dissolution. An exact solution to the Young-Laplace equation, assuming
   NAPL resides as pendular rings around the contact points of porous media
   idealized as spherical particles in a hexagonal close packing
   arrangement, is presented in this work to provide a theoretical
   prediction for NAPL-water interfacial area. This analytic expression for
   interfacial area is then coupled with an exact solution to the
   advection-diffusion equation in a capillary tube assuming
   Hagen-Poiseuille flow to provide a theoretical means of calculating the
   mass transfer rate coefficient for dissolution at the NAPL-water
   interface in an organic-wet system. A comparison of the predictions from
   this theoretical model with predictions from empirically derived
   formulations from the literature for water-wet systems showed a
   consistent range of values for the mass transfer rate coefficient,
   despite the significant differences in model foundations (water wetting
   versus NAPL wetting, theoretical versus empirical). This finding implies
   that, under these system conditions, the important parameter is
   interfacial area, with a lesser role played by NAPL configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Warm forming is a sheet metal stamping process at elevated temperature
   that can significantly expand the forming limits of light weight alloys
   such as aluminum. Most of the work detailed in the literature has been
   based on a laboratory setting with minimal guidance on how to design
   warm forming dies for high-volume production. The challenges that arise
   when transferring this technology from the laboratory to production are
   generally focused on the attainment of thermal stability within the die.
   Thermal stability is required to both maintain the dimensions of the
   matched die and to provide the sheet with ample formability. Achieving a
   thermally stable die is a direct function of how the die is heated and
   insulated. When this is done properly, temperature gradients throughout
   the die and at the parting surface can be minimized. This work outlines
   the upfront design approach used for a production-level warm forming
   die. The die was designed utilizing analytical and thermal finite
   element analysis tools that were developed specifically to assist with
   the identification of key design characteristics, such as heater
   wattages and locations, thermocouple placement, insulation strategy, and
   overall die architecture. A three-piece warm forming die fitted with
   resistance heating cartridges was constructed based on the presented
   design approach. The performance of the die was then validated through
   simulation and experimental comparisons. The results confirm the
   performance of the die and validate the predictability of the
   steady-state temperature response of the parting surface by the thermal
   finite element software. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing

Abstract = {{The forming limit diagram (FLD) is a tool that is used by automotive
   engineers to assess and compare the formabilities of sheet metals. The
   FLD is experimentally determined by portraying the biaxial strain
   distribution in the plane of the sheet under proportional loading paths.
   However, experimental determination of the FLD is time consuming. With
   increasing interest in warm forming of aluminum sheets, the process for
   determining the forming limit diagram is further complicated and more
   cumbersome as the forming limits change with increasing temperatures.
   Accordingly, a process for predicting the FLD based on the material
   constitutive model is of interest. This paper presents a finite element
   based criterion for predicting the FLD under isothermal conditions. The
   paper provides experimental validation for the predicted results using
   select automotive 5xxx series aluminum alloys. The findings indicate
   that the developed criterion can adequately predict the forming limit
   for each strain path. (C) 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, ant colony algorithms (ACAs) are used to solve the
   fixture layout optimization problem for a single workpiece machined in a
   single manufacturing stage. Assembly processes, however, are normally
   multi-station manufacturing processes, whose fixture layout optimization
   problem is much more complex. The purpose of this research is to develop
   an augmented ACA based on continuous optimization methods to optimize
   fixture layouts for 2D rigid parts in multi-station assembly processes.
   The algorithm is augmented by changing the mutation step size in the
   global search, the limiting step size in the local search, the new

   to properly select the coordinates of two locating pins to minimize the
   sensitivity index. A case about three-station automotive side aperture
   assembly processes is studied to verify the effectiveness of the
   augmented ACA. The results show that the augmented ACA can generate more

Abstract = {{A cellular manufacturing process was developed for fabrication and
   assembly of a full-scale biodiesel microreactor capable of producing
   biodiesel fuel at the rate of 2.47 L/min and at a capacity of over 1.2
   million liters of fuel per year. The scale-up of the microreactor was
   done through fabrication of over 14,000 individual microchannel laminae,
   and assembly of these laminae into a hierarchical system of modules and
   manifolds, thus duplicating many times over the intensification of the
   reaction rate per reactor volume that occurs in a single microchannel
   lamina. The work describes the design of the microreactor, the
   production process to fabricate and assemble the microreactor, the
   design of the manufacturing cell, and the testing of the microreactor to

Abstract = {{Disassembly is an important aspect of end of life product treatment, as
   well as having products disassembled in an efficient and responsible
   manner. Disassembly line balancing is a technique that enables a product
   to be disassembled as efficiently and economically viable as possible;
   however, considering all possible end of life (EOL) states of a product
   makes disassembly line balancing very difficult. The EOL state and the
   possibility of multiple recovery options of a product can alter both
   disassembly tasks and task times for the disassembly of the EOL product.
   This paper shows how generating a joint precedence graph based on the
   different EOL states of a product is beneficial to achieving an optimal
   line balance where traditional line balancing approaches are used. We
   use a simple example of a pen from the literature to show how a joint
   disassembly precedence graph is created and a laptop example for joint
   precedence graph generation and balancing. We run multiple scenarios
   where the EOL conditions have different probabilities and compare
   results for the case of deterministic task times. We also consider the
   possibility where some disassembly task times are normally distributed
   and show how a stochastic joint precedence graph can be created and used
   in a stochastic line balancing formulation. (C) 2014 The Society of

Abstract = {{We show that, near periodic orbits, a class of hybrid models can be
   reduced to or approximated by smooth continuous-time dynamical systems.
   Specifically, near an exponentially stable periodic orbit undergoing
   isolated transitions in a hybrid dynamical system, nearby executions
   generically contract superexponentially to a constant-dimensional
   subsystem. Under a non-degeneracy condition on the rank deficiency of
   the associated Poincare map, the contraction occurs in finite time
   regardless of the stability properties of the orbit. Hybrid transitions
   may be removed from the resulting subsystem via a topological quotient
   that admits a smooth structure to yield an equivalent smooth dynamical
   system. We demonstrate reduction of a high-dimensional underactuated
   mechanical model for terrestrial locomotion, assess structural stability
   of deadbeat controllers for rhythmic locomotion and manipulation, and
   derive a normal form for the stability basin of a hybrid oscillator.
   These applications illustrate the utility of our theoretical results for
   synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws for rhythmic hybrid
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) without aggregation and oxidation in
   solvents are highly desired in the fields of antibiosis, electronics,

   nm Cu NPs with narrow size distribution in water at a low temperature of
   45 degrees C under ambient atmosphere, using L-ascorbic acid and
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a reductant and a capping
   agent, respectively. The size and shape of the Cu NPs can be controlled
   by changing the reaction time, molar ratio of L-ascorbic acid to copper
   chloride, and concentration of CTAB. In addition, the Cu NP aqueous
   dispersions showed good stability after one month of storage under
   ambient atmosphere because of their great resistance against aggregation
   and oxidation. This study opens a facile and green way to prepare stable
   Cu NP aqueous dispersions for their practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion is cto communication; it colors our interpretation of events and
   social interactions. Emotion expression is generally multimodal,
   modulating our facial movement, vocal behavior, and body gestures. The
   method through which this multimodal information is integrated and
   perceived is not well understood. This knowledge has implications for
   the design of multimodal classification algorithms, affective
   interfaces, and even mental health assessment. We present a novel data
   set designed to support research into the emotion perception process,
   the University of Michigan Emotional McGurk Effect Data set (UMEME).
   UMEME has a critical feature that differentiates it from currently
   existing data sets; it contains not only emotionally congruent stimuli
   (emotionally matched faces and voices), but also emotionally incongruent
   stimuli (emotionally mismatched faces and voices). The inclusion of
   emotionally complex and dynamic stimuli provides an opportunity to study
   how individuals make assessments of emotion content in the presence of
   emotional incongruence, or emotional noise. We describe the collection,
   annotation, and statistical properties of the data and present evidence
   illustrating how audio and video interact to result in specific types of
   emotion perception. The results demonstrate that there exist consistent
   patterns underlying emotion evaluation, even given incongruence,
   positioning UMEME as an important new tool for understanding emotion
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of a giant dielectric constant of > 10(5) in calcium
   copper titanate (CCTO) has generated significant interest for
   application in electronic devices. Over the past decade, many methods
   have been developed to synthesize CCTO particles in an effort to
   capitalize upon the outstanding dielectric properties. Polymer film
   capacitors are one application where CCTO could greatly increase the
   typically low dielectric constant of the polymer. Recent work has shown
   that the aspect ratio of the dispersed filler can greatly affect the
   dielectric constant of the polymer with high aspect ratio nanowires
   (NWs) producing greater dielectric constant and energy density than
   spherical particles. While CCTO NWs hold great potential to improve the
   properties of nanocomposite capacitors, no method currently exists for
   their preparation and their integration is challenged by the barrier
   layer capacitance which leads to high dielectric loss. Here, a novel
   two-step hydrothermal reaction is developed for the large-scale
   synthesis of CCTO NWs and an insulating barrier layer is applied to
   greatly reduce the toss while preserving the high dielectric constant.

Title = {{A Novel Health Information Technology Communication System to Increase
   Caregiver Activation in the Context of Hospital-Based Pediatric
   Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), commonly
   referred to as blood and marrow transplantation (BMT), is an intense
   treatment modality that requires the involvement of engaged caregivers
   during the patient's (child's) prolonged hospitalization. The ubiquity
   of electronic health records (EHRs) and a trend toward patient-centered
   care could allow a novel health information technology (IT) system to
   increase parental engagement. The paucity of research on acute care,
   hospital-based (inpatient) health IT applications for patients or
   caregivers provides an opportunity for testing the feasibility of such
   applications. The pediatric BMT population represents an ideal patient
   group to conduct an evaluation due to the lengthy inpatient stays and a
   heightened need for patient activation.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the
   feasibility of implementing the BMT Roadmap in caregivers as an
   intervention during their child's inpatient hospitalization. The BMT
   Roadmap is an inpatient portal prototype optimized for tablet with a
   user-centered design. It integrates patient-specific laboratory and
   medication data from the EHR in real-time and provides support in terms
   of discharge goals, home care education, and other components.
   Feasibility will be proven if (1) the BMT Roadmap functions and can be
   managed by the study team without unexpected effort, (2) the system is
   accessed by users at a defined minimum threshold, and (3) the
   qualitative and quantitative research conducted provides quality data
   that address the perceived usefulness of the BMT Roadmap and could
   inform a study in a larger sample size.
   Methods: This will be a single-arm, nonrandomized feasibility study. We
   aim to enroll 10 adult caregivers (age >= 18 years) of pediatric
   patients (aged 0-25 years) undergoing autologous (self-donor) or
   allogeneic (alternative donor) BMT. Assenting minors (aged 10-18) will
   also be invited to participate. Recruitment of study participants will
   take place in the outpatient pediatric BMT clinic. After signing an
   informed consent, the research study team will provide participants with
   the BMT Roadmap, available on an Apple iPad, which will used throughout
   the inpatient hospitalization. To measure the study outcomes,
   approximately 6-8 semistructured qualitative interviews will be
   conducted periodically from pre-BMT to 100 days post-BMT and an
   additional 15-20 semistructured interviews will be conducted among BMT
   health care providers to assess perceived usefulness and usability of
   the system, as well as any associated workflow impacts. Quantitative
   survey instruments will only be administered to adult participants (age
   = 18 years).
   Results: Recruitment will begin in September 2015, and preliminary
   findings are expected in 2016.
   Conclusions: This protocol offers a framework for the design and
   analysis of a personalized health IT system that has the potential to
   increase patient and caregiver engagement in acute care, hospital-based
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructures of ferritic-martensitic alloys HT9 and T91 were
   characterized following 5 MeV Fe++ ion irradiation to 140 displacements
   per atom (dpa) at 440 degrees C with either a raster-scanned or
   defocused beam. Alloys were pre-implanted with 0-100 appm He and then
   subjected to either a raster-scanned beam or a defocused beam. Relative
   to the defocused beam, a raster-scanned beam suppressed microstructural
   evolution, evidenced by decreased diameter and number densities of
   voids, loop and precipitates, which lead to decreased void swelling,
   precipitate volume fraction and total dislocation loop line density.
   These results were consistent with the Fully Dynamic Rate Theory (FDRT)
   model which predicts that raster-scanning should lead to a decrease in
   defect population and suppression of nucleation and growth processes.

Title = {{Metastable orientational order of colloidal discoids}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The interplay between phase separation and kinetic arrest is important
   in supramolecular self-assembly, but their effects on emergent
   orientational order are not well understood when anisotropic building
   blocks are used. Contrary to the typical progression from disorder to
   order in isotropic systems, here we report that colloidal oblate
   discoids initially self-assemble into short, metastable strands with
   orientational order-regardless of the final structure. The model
   discoids are suspended in a refractive index and density-matched
   solvent. Then, we use confocal microscopy experiments and Monte Carlo
   simulations spanning a broad range of volume fractions and attraction
   strengths to show that disordered clusters form near coexistence
   boundaries, whereas oriented strands persist with strong attractions. We
   rationalize this unusual observation in light of the interaction
   anisotropy imparted by the discoids. These findings may guide
   self-assembly for anisotropic systems in which orientational order is
   desired, such as when tailored mechanical properties are sought.}},

Title = {{Influence of chemical disorder on energy dissipation and defect
   evolution in concentrated solid solution alloys}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A grand challenge in materials research is to understand complex
   electronic correlation and non-equilibrium atomic interactions, and how
   such intrinsic properties and dynamic processes affect energy transfer
   and defect evolution in irradiated materials. Here we report that
   chemical disorder, with an increasing number of principal elements
   and/or altered concentrations of specific elements, in single-phase
   concentrated solid solution alloys can lead to substantial reduction in
   electron mean free path and orders of magnitude decrease in electrical
   and thermal conductivity. The subsequently slow energy dissipation
   affects defect dynamics at the early stages, and consequentially may
   result in less deleterious defects. Suppressed damage accumulation with
   increasing chemical disorder from pure nickel to binary and to more
   complex quaternary solid solutions is observed. Understanding and
   controlling energy dissipation and defect dynamics by altering alloy
   complexity may pave the way for new design principles of
   radiation-tolerant structural alloys for energy applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present version 8 of the CHIANTI database. This version includes a

   improvement in the soft X-ray, extreme UV (EUV) and UV spectral regions,
   which several space missions currently cover. New data for neutrals and
   low charge states are also added. The data are assessed, but to improve
   the modelling of low-temperature plasma the effective collision
   strengths for most of the new datasets are not spline-fitted as
   previously, but are retained as calculated. This required a change of
   the format of the CHIANTI electron excitation files. The format of the
   energy files has also been changed. Excitation rates between all the
   levels are retained for most of the new datasets, so the data can in
   principle be used to model high-density plasma. In addition, the method
   for computing the differential emission measure used in the CHIANTI
   software has been changed.}},

Abstract = {{Starting with the early alchemists, a holy grail of science has been to
   make desired materials by modifying the attributes of basic building
   blocks. Building blocks that show promise for assembling new complex
   materials can be synthesized at the nanoscale with attributes that would
   astonish the ancient alchemists in their versatility. However, this
   versatility means that making a direct connection between building-block
   attributes and bulk structure is both necessary for rationally
   engineering materials and difficult because building block attributes
   can be altered in many ways. Here we show how to exploit the
   malleability of the valence of colloidal nanoparticle ``elements{''} to
   directly and quantitatively link building-block attributes to bulk
   structure through a statistical thermodynamic framework we term
   ``digital alchemy{''}. We use this framework to optimize building blocks
   for a given target structure and to determine which building-block
   attributes are most important to control for self-assembly, through a
   set of novel thermodynamic response functions, moduli, and
   susceptibilities. We thereby establish direct links between the
   attributes of colloidal building blocks and the bulk structures they
   form. Moreover, our results give concrete solutions to the more general
   conceptual challenge of optimizing emergent behaviors in nature and can
   be applied to other types of matter. As examples, we apply digital
   alchemy to systems of truncated tetrahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and
   isotropically interacting spheres that self-assemble diamond, fcc, and
   icosahedral quasicrystal structures, respectively. Although our focus is
   on colloidal systems, our methods generalize to any building blocks with
   adjustable interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of engineering education research provides an opportunity
   for cross-fertilization of ideas and creativity, but it also can result
   in fragmentation of the field and duplication of effort. One solution is
   to establish a standardized taxonomy of engineering education terms to
   map the field and communicate and connect research initiatives. This
   report describes the process for developing such a taxonomy, the EER
   Taxonomy. Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education
   research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266
   individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday
   workshop, seven conference sessions, and several other virtual and
   in-person activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms
   arranged in 14 branches and six levels. This taxonomy was found to
   satisfy four criteria for validity and reliability: (1) keywords
   assigned to a set of abstracts were reproducible by multiple
   researchers, (2) the taxonomy comprised terms that could be selected as
   keywords to fully describe 243 articles in three journals, (3) the
   keywords for those 243 articles were evenly distributed across the
   branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the authors of 31 conference papers
   agreed with 90\% of researcher-assigned keywords. This report also
   describes guidelines developed to help authors consistently assign
   keywords for their articles by encouraging them to choose terms from
   three categories: (1) context/focus/topic, (2)
   purpose/target/motivation, and (3) research approach.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An underwater steam plasma discharge, in which water itself is the
   ionizing media, is investigated as a means to introduce advanced
   oxidation species into contaminated water for the purpose of water
   purification. The steam discharge avoids the acidification observed with
   air discharges and also avoids the need for a feed gas, simplifying the
   system. Steam discharge operation did not result in a pH changes in the
   processing of water or simulated wastewater, with the actual pH
   remaining roughly constant during processing. Simulated wastewater has
   been shown to continue to decompose significantly after steam treatment,
   suggesting the presence of long-lived plasma produced radicals. During
   steam discharge operation, nitrate production is limited, and nitrite
   production was found to be below the detection threshold of (roughly 0.2
   mg L-1). The discharge was operated over a broad range of deposited
   power levels, ranging from approximately 30 W to 300 W. Hydrogen
   peroxide production was found to scale with increasing power.
   Additionally, the hydrogen peroxide production efficiency of the
   discharge was found to be higher than many of the rates reported in the
   literature to date.}},

Title = {{Emotion Recognition During Speech Using Dynamics of Multiple Regions of
   the Face}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, S, SI}},

Abstract = {{The need for human-centered, affective multimedia interfaces has
   motivated research in automatic emotion recognition. In this article, we
   focus on facial emotion recognition. Specifically, we target a domain in
   which speakers produce emotional facial expressions while speaking. The
   main challenge of this domain is the presence of modulations due to both
   emotion and speech. For example, an individual's mouth movement may be
   similar when he smiles and when he pronounces the phoneme /IY/, as in
   ``cheese{''}. The result of this confusion is a decrease in performance
   of facial emotion recognition systems. In our previous work, we
   investigated the joint effects of emotion and speech on facial movement.
   We found that it is critical to employ proper temporal segmentation and
   to leverage knowledge of spoken content to improve classification
   performance. In the current work, we investigate the temporal
   characteristics of specific regions of the face, such as the forehead,
   eyebrow, cheek, and mouth. We present methodology that uses the temporal
   patterns of specific regions of the face in the context of a facial
   emotion recognition system. We test our proposed approaches on two
   emotion datasets, the IEMOCAP and SAVEE datasets. Our results
   demonstrate that the combination of emotion recognition systems based on
   different facial regions improves overall accuracy compared to systems
   that do not leverage different characteristics of individual regions.}},

Title = {{Predicting readmission risk with institution-specific prediction models}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{89-96}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The ability to predict patient readmission risk is extremely
   valuable for hospitals, especially under the Hospital Readmission
   Reduction Program of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services which
   went into effect starting October 1, 2012. There is a plethora of work
   in the literature that deals with developing readmission risk prediction
   models, but most of them do not have sufficient prediction accuracy to
   be deployed in a clinical setting, partly because different hospitals
   may have different characteristics in their patient populations.
   Methods and materials: We propose a generic framework for
   institution-specific readmission risk prediction, which takes patient
   data from a single institution and produces a statistical risk
   prediction model optimized for that particular institution and,
   optionally, for a specific condition. This provides great flexibility in
   model building, and is also able to provide institution-specific
   insights in its readmitted patient population. We have experimented with
   classification methods such as support vector machines, and prognosis
   methods such as the Cox regression. We compared our methods with
   industry-standard methods such as the LACE model, and showed the
   proposed framework is not only more flexible but also more effective.
   Results: We applied our framework to patient data from three hospitals,
   and obtained some initial results for heart failure (HF), acute
   myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia (PN) patients as well as patients
   with all conditions. On Hospital 2, the LACE model yielded AUC 0.57,
   0.56, 0.53 and 0.55 for AMI, HF, PN and All Cause readmission
   prediction, respectively, while the proposed model yielded 0.66, 0.65,
   0.63, 0.74 for the corresponding conditions, all significantly better
   than the LACE counterpart. The proposed models that leverage all
   features at discharge time is more accurate than the models that only
   leverage features at admission time (0.66 vs. 0.61 for AMI, 0.65 vs.
   0.61 for HF, 0.63 vs. 0.56 for PN, 0.74 vs. 0.60 for All Cause).
   Furthermore, the proposed admission-time models already outperform the
   performance of LACE, which is a discharge-time model (0.61 vs. 0.57 for
   AMI, 0.61 vs. 0.56 for HF, 0.56 vs. 0.53 for PN, 0.60 vs. 0.55 for All
   Cause). Similar conclusions can be drawn from other hospitals as well.
   The same performance comparison also holds for precision and recall at
   top-decile predictions. Most of the performance improvements are
   statistically significant.
   Conclusions: The institution-specific readmission risk prediction
   framework is more flexible and more effective than the one-size-fit-all
   models like the LACE, sometimes twice and three-time more effective. The
   admission-time models are able to give early warning signs compared to
   the discharge-time models, and may be able to help hospital staff
   intervene early while the patient is still in the hospital. (C) 2015

Title = {{MULTIMODAL DIFFERENTIAL EMISSION MEASURE IN THE SOLAR CORONA}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{811}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescope on board the Solar
   Dynamics Observatory provides coronal extreme ultraviolet imaging over a
   broader temperature sensitivity range than the previous generations of
   instruments (Extreme Ultraviolet Imager; EUVI, EIT, and TRACE).
   Differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) of the solar corona
   based on AIA data is presented here for the first time. The main product
   of DEMT is the three-dimensional distribution of the local differential
   emission measure (LDEM). While in previous studies, based on EIT or EUVI
   data, there were three available EUV bands, the present study is based
   on the four cooler AIA bands (aimed at studying the quiet sun). The AIA
   filters allow exploration of new parametric LDEM models. Since DEMT is
   better suited for lower activity periods, we use data from Carrington
   Rotation 2099, when the Sun was in its most quiescent state during the
   AIA mission. Also, we validate the parametric LDEM models by using them
   to perform a bi-dimensional differential emission measure (DEM) analysis
   on sets of simultaneous AIA images, and comparing results with those
   obtained using other methods. Our study reveals a ubiquitous bimodal
   LDEM distribution in the quiet diffuse corona, characterized by two
   well-defined average centroid temperatures < T-0,T-1 > =(1.47 +/- 0.05)
   MK and < T-0,T-2 > =(2.57 +/- 0.05) MK. We argue that the nanoflare
   heating scenario is less likely to explain these results, and that
   alternative mechanisms, such as wave dissipation, appear better
   supported by our results.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, technology
   has rapidly penetrated the medical device industry over the past several
   years, and innovative groups have harnessed it to create devices with
   unique composition, structure, and customizability. These distinctive
   capabilities afforded by 3D printing have introduced new regulatory
   challenges. The customizability of 3D-printed devices introduces new
   complexities when drafting a design control model for FDA consideration
   of market approval. The customizability and unique build processes of
   3D-printed medical devices pose unique challenges in meeting regulatory
   standards related to the manufacturing quality assurance. Consistent
   material powder properties and optimal printing parameters such as build
   orientation and laser power must be addressed and communicated to the
   FDA to ensure a quality build. Postprinting considerations unique to
   3D-printed devices, such as cleaning, finishing and sterilization are
   also discussed. In this manuscript we illustrate how such regulatory
   hurdles can be navigated by discussing our experience with our group's
   3D-printed bioresorbable implantable device.}},

Title = {{Influence of contextual task constraints on preferred stride parameters

Abstract = {{Walking is not always a free and unencumbered task. Everyday activities
   such as walking in pairs, in groups, or on structured walkways can limit
   the acceptable gait patterns, leading to motor behavior that differs
   from that observed in more self-selected gait. Such different contexts
   may lead to gait performance different than observed in typical
   laboratory experiments, for example, during treadmill walking. We sought
   to systematically measure the impact of such task constraints by
   comparing gait parameters and their variability during walking in
   different conditions over-ground, and on a treadmill. We reconstructed
   foot motion from foot-mounted inertial sensors, and characterized
   forward, lateral and angular foot placement while subjects walked
   overground in a straight hallway and on a treadmill. Over-ground walking
   was performed in three variations: with no constraints (self-selected,
   SS); while deliberately varying walking speed (self-varied, SV); and
   while following a toy pace car programmed to vary speed
   (externally-varied, EV). We expected that these conditions would exhibit
   a statistically similar relationship between stride length and speed,
   and between stride length and stride period. We also expected treadmill
   walking (TM) would differ in two ways: first, that variability in stride
   length and stride period would conform to a constant-speed constraint
   opposite in slope from the normal relationship; and second, that stride
   length would decrease, leading to combinations of stride length and
   speed not observed in over-ground conditions. Results showed that all
   over-ground conditions used similar stride length-speed relationships,
   and that variability in treadmill walking conformed to a constant-speed
   constraint line, as expected. Decreased stride length was observed in
   both TM and EV conditions, suggesting adaptations due to heightened
   awareness or to prepare for unexpected changes or problems. We also
   evaluated stride variability in constrained and unconstrained tasks. We
   observed that in treadmill walking, lateral variability decreased while
   forward variability increased, and the normally-observed correlation
   between wider foot placement and external foot rotation was eliminated.
   Preferred stride parameters and their variability appear significantly
   influenced by the context and constraints of the walking task. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, an eco-routing algorithm is developed for vehicles in a
   signalized traffic network. The proposed method incorporates a
   microscopic vehicle emission model into a Markov decision process (MDP).
   Instead of using GPS-based vehicle trajectory data, which are used by
   many existing eco-routing algorithm, high resolution traffic data
   including vehicle arrival and signal status information are used as
   primary inputs. The proposed method can work with any microscopic
   vehicle model that uses vehicle trajectories as inputs and gives related
   emission rates as outputs. Furthermore, a constrained eco-routing
   problem is proposed to deal with the situation where multiple costs
   present. This is done by transferring the original MDP based formulation
   to a linear programming formulation. Besides the primary cost,
   additional costs are considered as constraints. Two numerical examples
   are given using the field data obtained from City of Pasadena,
   California, USA. The eco-routing algorithm for single objective is
   compared against the traditional shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra's
   algorithm. Average reductions of CO emission around 20\% are observed.

Abstract = {{SnSe and GeSe are layered compound semiconductors that can be exfoliated
   to form two-dimensional materials. In this work, we use predictive
   calculations based on density functional and many-body perturbation
   theory to study the electronic and optical properties of single-layer,
   double-layer, and bulk SnSe and GeSe. The fundamental band gap is direct
   in single-layer and double-layer GeSe, but indirect in single-layer and
   double-layer SnSe. Moreover, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and
   lack of inversion symmetry in the monolayer structures results in
   anisotropic spin splitting of the energy bands, with potential
   applications in directionally dependent spin transport. We also show
   that single-layer and double-layer SnSe and GeSe exhibit unusually
   strong optical absorbance in the visible range. Our results suggest that
   single-layer and double-layer SnSe and GeSe are promising materials for
   ultrathin-film photovoltaic applications with theoretical upper bounds
   to the conversion efficiency that approach the efficiency records
   realized in organic and dye-sensitized solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{A microfluidic card is described for simultaneous and rapid genetic
   detection of multiple microbial pathogens. The hydrophobic surface of
   native acrylic and a novel microfluidic mechanism termed ``airlock{''}
   were used to dispense sample into a series of 64 reaction wells without
   the use of valves, external pumping peripherals, multiple layers, or
   vacuum assistance. This airlock mechanism was tested with dilutions of
   whole human blood, saliva, and urine, along with mock samples of varying
   viscosities and surface tensions. Samples spiked with genomic DNA (gDNA)
   or crude lysates from clinical bacterial isolates were tested with loop
   mediated isothermal amplification assays (LAMP) designed to target
   virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Reactions were monitored in
   real time using the Gene-Z, which is a portable smartphone-driven
   system. Samples loaded correctly into themicrofluidic card in 99.3\% of
   instances. Amplification results confirmed no carryover of pre-dispensed
   primer between wells during sample loading, and no observable diffusion
   between adjacent wells during the 60 to 90 min isothermal reaction.
   Sensitivity was comparable between LAMP reactions tested within the
   microfluidic card and in conventional vials. Tests demonstrate that the
   airlock card works with various sample types, manufacturing techniques,
   and can potentially be used in many point-of-care diagnostics
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTherapy with zygomatic implants (ZIs) or conventional implants
   (CIs) has proven to be an effective method to restore oral function for
   systemically healthy patients. However, it is still a major challenge to
   fully restore oral function to edentulous adult patients with ectodermal
   dysplasia (ED).
   PurposeThe aim of this study was to determine an effective treatment
   protocol for restoring oral function using ZIs and CIs to edentulous
   adult ED patients.
   Materials and MethodsTen edentulous adult ED patients were treated in
   this study. The treatment protocol involved the following: (1) bone
   augmentation in the region of the anterior teeth; (2) placement of two
   ZIs and four CIs in the maxilla, and four CIs in the mandible; (3)
   fabrication of dental prosthesis; and (4) psychological and oral
   education. Following treatment of these patients, implant success rates,
   biological complications, patient satisfaction, and psychological
   changes were recorded.
   ResultsAlthough there was evidence of bone graft resorption in the
   maxilla, bone augmentation of the mandible was successful in all
   patients. Nine CIs in the maxilla failed and were removed. All ZIs were
   successful, and the CIs success rates were 77.50\% in the maxilla and
   100\% in the mandible, with a mean of 88.75\%. The mean peri-implant
   bone resorption for the CIs ranged from 1.30.4mm to 1.8 +/- 0.6mm, and
   four cases exhibited gingival hyperplasia in the maxilla and mandible.
   One hundred percent of the patients were satisfied with the restoration
   of their oral function, and >50\% of the patients exhibited enhanced
   self-confidence and self-esteem.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that oral function can be restored in
   edentulous adult ED patients using a comprehensive and systematic
   treatment protocol involving psychological and oral education, bone
   augmentation, implant placement, and denture fabrication. Despite these
   positive outcomes, bone augmentation remains challenging in the anterior
   region of the maxilla for edentulous adult ED patients.}},

Abstract = {{In the last 10 or 15 years, exciting new developments have occurred in
   the field of filters and multiplexers. The two words that best explain
   this phenomenon are ``topology{''} and ``technology.{''} Thus, this
   paper will cover new connections, new materials, and new processes. This
   paper summarizes what is new, describes the new devices, and avoids
   simply surveying the entire field. It is not possible to cover
   everything, and regrettably, some new and possibly exciting areas are
   omitted (such as filters fabricated using liquid crystal polymers,
   active element inclusion, extreme power devices used in accelerators),
   and others,, because something has to be left for the next paper! The
   paper does cover bandstop filters, intrinsically switched film bulk
   acoustic resonator, and barium-strontium-titanate filters, brand new
   derivations of lossy filter synthesis and dual-band filter synthesis,
   multimode networks, new work on optimal multiplexer (multiport network)
   configurations, and substrate integrated waveguide filters. In each of
   these areas significant new work has been recently performed and is
   presented in a summary format suitable for those thinking that the area
   of filters and multiplexers has become mature (stagnant) with nothing
   interesting to learn. Nothing could be further from the truth!}},

Abstract = {{Synopsis The natural habitats of fishes are characterized by movements
   of water driven by a multitude of physical processes of either natural
   or human origin. The resultant unsteadiness is exacerbated when flow
   interacts with surfaces, such as the bottom and banks, and protruding
   objects, such as corals, boulders, and woody debris. There is growing
   interest in the impacts on performance and behavior of fishes swimming
   in ``turbulent flows''. The ability of fishes to stabilize their
   postures and their swimming trajectories is thought to be important in
   determining species' distributions and densities, and hence the
   resultant assemblages in various habitats. A theoretical framework is
   proposed to quantify the interactions of fish and flows. Dimensionless
   parameters are derived based on a physical description of the flow
   structures and different regimes are predicted describing fishes'
   responses to a wide range of physical perturbations. We found the ratio
   of eddy size to fish size, the ``momentum ratio'' (ratio between
   momentum of the eddy and the momentum of the fish), as well as the time
   of interaction between eddy and fish to be especially important in
   determining thresholds for the fish's posture and trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency passive microwave observations allow for oceanic remote
   sensing of surface wind speed and rain rate from spaceborne and airborne
   platforms. For most instruments, the modeling of contributions of rain
   absorption and reemission in a particular field of view is simplified by
   the observing geometry. However, the simplifying assumptions that can be
   applied in most applications are not always valid for the scenes that
   the airborne Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) regularly observes.
   Collocated Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) and HIRAD
   observations of Hurricane Earl (2010) indicate that retrieval algorithms
   based on the usual simplified model, referred to here as the
   decoupled-pixel model (DPM), are not able to resolve two neighboring
   rainbands at the edge of HIRAD's swath. The DPM does not allow for the
   possibility that a single column of atmosphere can affect the
   observations at multiple cross-track positions. This motivates the
   development of a coupled-pixel model (CPM) that is developed and tested
   in this paper. Simulated observations as well as HIRAD's observations of
   Hurricane Earl (2010) are used to test the CPM algorithm. Key to the
   performance of the CPM algorithm is its ability to deconvolve the
   cross-track scene, as well as unscramble the signatures of surface wind
   speed and rain rate in HIRAD's observations. While the CPM approach was
   developed specifically for HIRAD, other sensors could employ this method
   in similar complicated observing scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{High surface area molybdenum carbides are attractive for use as
   catalysts and supports. Due to their pyrophoricity, carbides are
   typically passivated prior to use. Research described in this paper
   compared the synthesis, structural and compositional properties, and
   water gas shift activities of catalysts produced by depositing Pt onto
   unpassivated and passivated MO2C. Passivation had a profound effect on
   the character of interactions between the Pt precursor salt (H2PtCl6)
   and MO2C. Nanoscale Pt metal particles were deposited onto the
   unpassivated MO2C while very large Pt particles were deposited onto the
   passivated MO2C (p-MO2C). In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed
   reduction of Pt4+ in contact with the unpassivated MO2C with
   commensurate oxidation of Mo. Water gas shift activities were
   significantly higher for the Pt/MO2C compared to the Pt/p-MO2C catalyst.
   Overall, the results indicate that the passivation of MO2C prior to
   metal deposition had deleterious effects on the Pt loadings, structures,
   and activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the analysis, design, and microfabrication of a
   Knudsen pump for high flow generation. The Knudsen pump generates gas
   streams from the cold end to the hot end using free-molecular flow
   without moving parts. The designed Knudsen pump has densely arrayed
   vertically oriented 2-mu m wide rectangular channels for providing high
   flow. The temperature gradient is provided between a thin-film metal
   heater and a gridded Si heat sink in the Knudsen pump structure. The
   Knudsen pump is fabricated on a single silicon-on-insulator wafer using
   a four-mask lithographic process. The sidewalls of the rectangular
   channels are constructed by atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 on
   sacrificial Si channels and subsequent Si etching. The fabricated
   Knudsen pumps have designed footprints ranging from 0.4-3.2 cm(2). At
   atmospheric pressure, the fabricated Knudsen pumps provide a maximum
   measured air flow rate of >200 sccm with response time of <0.5 s.
   Experimental results have also shown that these Knudsen pumps are most
   suitable for pumping at moderate vacuum pressure of approximate to 200
   Torr (27 kPa). {[}2014-0367]}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the extent and consequences Of
   histotripsy-induced hemolysis in vivo.
   Materials and Methods: Porcine femoral venous blood was treated with
   histotripsy in 11 animals with systemic heparinization and 11 without
   heparin. Serum and hemodynamic measurements were obtained at 0, 2, 5,
   10, 15, and 30 minutes and 48-72 hours after the procedure. Fisher exact
   test Was used to determine differences in mortality between heparinized
   and nonheparinized groups. A linear mixed effects model was used to test
   for differences in blood analytes and hemodynamic variables over time.
   Results: Of 11 animals in the nonheparinized group, 5 died during or
   immediately after histotripsy (45\% nonheparin mortality vs 0\% heparin
   mortality, P = .035). Serum hematocrit, free hemoglobin, lactate
   dehydrogenase (LDH), and right ventricular systolic pressure changed
   significantly (P < .001) over the treatment time. Serum hematocrit
   decreased slightly (from 32.5\%+/- 3.6\% to 29.4\%+/- 4.2\%), whereas
   increases were seen in free hemoglobin (from 6.2 mg/dL +/- 4.6 to 348
   mg/dL +/- 100), LDH (from 365 U/L +/- 67.8 to 722 U/L +/- 84.7), and
   right ventricular systolic pressure (from 23.2 mm Hg +/- 7.2 to 39.7 mm
   Hg +/- 12.3). After 48-72 hours, hematocrit remained slightly decreased
   (P =.005), whereas LDH and free hemoglobin remained slightly increased
   compared with baseline (both P <.001).
   Conclusions: Intravascular histotripsy applied to free-flowing venous
   blood is safe with systemic heparinization, causing only transient
   hemodynanuic and metabolic disturbances, supporting its use as a future
   noninvasive thrombolytic therapy modality.}},

   materials and nanotechnologies, which have tremendously impacted both
   biomedical and physical sciences. Herein, novel emulsification and
   thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) techniques to fabricate linear
   polymers into nanofibrous hollow objects are reported for the first
   time. Through manipulating the emulsification conditions, the evolution
   of the emulsion structure can be controlled and nanofibrous hollow
   microspheres with a controllable opening size and nanofibrous shells can
   be fabricated. Through adjusting the rheological properties of the
   emulsions, nanofibrous hollow discs are also created. A new mechanistic
   hypotheses of the nanofibrous hollow object formation is proposed: the
   nano-and microscaled structures are independently determined by TIPS and
   the emulsification process, respectively. Guided by this theory, the
   nanofiber formation conditions for two further additional polymers
   (polyacrylonitrile and Nylon) under TIPS are identified, and
   solid/nanofi brous non-hollow/hollow microspheres are created from these
   two additional polymers under TIPS and emulsification for the first
   time. Therefore, the developed strategy is applicable to various polymer
   systems, and can broadly impact nano-and microfabrication technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Switchgrass is a biomass crop with no established market. Its adoption
   will involve a wide range of socio-economic factors, making it a
   particularly difficult system to analyze for environmental impact
   estimates. Life cycle assessment (LCA) provides a methodology to
   quantify the environmental impacts of a product or process throughout
   its entire supply chain. However, traditional LCA approaches fail to
   account for the local variability in non-homogeneous systems. Because of
   the time component and other realm dynamics it is essential to visualize
   as the switchgrass adoption process as a Complex Adaptive System (CAS).
   Agent-based modeling (ABM) can be used to supplement life cycle
   information to account for these dynamics variances. Here, we present an
   Agent-Based Life Cycle Analysis (AB-LCA) model of farmers' potential
   adoption of switchgrass as a biomass. The chosen modeling approach aims
   to understand the main factors influencing landowner decision-making and
   how these adoption patterns can affect the LCA of switchgrass ethanol.
   To help address these challenges, we developed an Agent-Based Model
   aimed at: (1) understanding the main factors influencing landowner
   decision-making and how these adoption patterns can affect the LCA of
   switchgrass ethanol and (2) improving the LCA modeling methodology by
   overcoming the issues involved with analyzing emerging technologies with
   dynamic and evolving supply chains. Particularly, we built an
   agent-based model using LCA data of switchgrass-based ethanol production
   that simultaneously captures socioeconomic factors, such as age, level
   of risk aversion, education level, and level of profit, of farmers that
   lead to switchgrass adoption and the changes in environmental impact
   that result from this particular behavior. The results show that the
   most influential factors affecting farmers' decisions are their current
   economic situation and crop prices. Age and their level of knowledge of
   the new crop have some impact but with limited extent. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which dislocation channeling induces irradiation
   assisted stress corrosion cracking was determined using Fe-13Cr15Ni
   austenitic stainless steel irradiated with protons to a dose of 5 dpa
   and strained at high temperature in both argon and simulated boiling
   water reactor normal water chemistry environments. Straining induced
   dislocation channels that were characterized by digital image
   correlation and confocal microscopy. Dislocation channels were found to
   be either continuous across the boundary, discontinuous, or
   discontinuous with slip in the boundary. Discontinuous channels were
   found to contain the least amount of strain but have the highest
   propensity for initiating cracks. Discontinuous dislocation
   channel-grain boundary intersections were shown to have the highest
   local stress. TEM in-situ straining of irradiated steels and atomistic
   simulation of dislocation-grain boundary interaction provided supporting
   evidence that channels that were unable to transfer strain underwent
   cracking. The inability of channels to relieve stress, by either slip in
   the adjacent grain or in the grain boundary, resulted in high local
   stresses and increased susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking
   initiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel miniaturized impedance matched antenna with omnidirectional
   horizontally polarized radiation pattern is presented. The antenna
   structure resembles a circular loop formed by a circular array of shunt
   miniaturized n-fold resonant dipole antennas, which will be referred to
   as miniature composite wire-loop antenna (MCWLA). The proposed antenna
   does not require an external matching network and can easily be matched
   to balanced ports with any desired impedance. MCWLAs can be made to be a
   very small fraction of the wavelength and yet to provide a relatively
   high radiation efficiency. The antenna input impedance can be adjusted
   by the number of array n-folded dipole elements, the number of folds and
   the diameter of the composite loop. The input impedance can be lowered
   by increasing the number of elements and/or by decreasing the loop
   diameter. Conversely, the input impedance, for a fixed number of
   elements and diameter, can be increased by increasing the fold number.
   The antenna efficiency increases with increasing the loop diameter. To
   demonstrate the proposed concept, a MCWLA is designed with diameter
   lambda/8 and is designed and fabricated using the standard PCB approach
   on a thin substrate (lambda/500). To achieve omnidirectional radiation
   pattern in H-plane, a minimum of three elements fed in-phase around the
   inscribing loop are used. It is shown that impedance match to a 50-O
   line can be achieved using fourfold miniaturized dipole elements. The
   simulation shows strong uniform current distribution on the A
   transformer balun that is used to connect the balanced port of the
   antenna to a small coaxial line at the center of the loop. The measured
   gain, including the loss through the balun, is to be 0 dBi and the gain
   variation in the H-plane is shown to be less than 0.5 dB for the
   prototype MCWLA.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors present a physical model developed to
   simulate accurate external ventricular drain (EVD) placement with
   realistic haptic and visual feedbacks to serve as a platform for
   complete procedural training. Insertion of an EVD via ventriculostomy is
   a common neurosurgical procedure used to monitor intracranial pressures
   and/or drain CSF. Currently, realistic training tools are scarce and
   mainly limited to virtual reality simulation systems. The use of 3D
   printing technology enables the development of realistic anatomical
   structures and customized design for physical simulators. In this study,
   the authors used the advantages of 3D printing to directly build the
   model geometry from stealth head CT scans and build a phantom brain mold
   based on 3D scans of a plastinated human brain. The resultant simulator
   provides realistic haptic feedback during a procedure, with
   visualization of catheter trajectory and fluid drainage. A
   multiinstitutional survey was also used to prove content validity of the
   simulator. With minor refinement, this simulator is expected to be a
   cost-effective tool for training neurosurgical residents in EVD
   placement.}},

Abstract = {{Nano/micro-structured Si/CNT/C and Si-Cu/CNT/C microspheres are prepared
   by two simple steps of spray drying and carbonization, which are
   efficient and easy to scale up. In the Si/CNT/C composites, silicon
   particles (about 50-200 nm) are covered by a layer of carbon formed by
   pyrolysis of phenol-formaldenhyde resin (PF), which, in turn, connects
   with the three-dimensional multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
   conductive network. Numerous open pores, which could buffer volume
   expansion of silicon and improve the electrode kinetics, are engendered
   in the microspheres due to the rapid evaporation of solvent and
   unfoldment of flexible MWCNTs. Moreover, introduction of small amount of
   copper (5 wt.\%) into the microspheres as Cu3Si phase reinforces the
   mechanical stability and improves the electronic conductivity. The
   favorable Si/CNT/C composite structure leads to significantly improved
   cycling stability and rate performance (ca. 1250 mA h g(-1) at 5 A
   g(-1)) compared to pristine Si particles. Addition of copper further
   enhances the capacity retention to 91.2\% after 80 cycles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An experimental study is presented of micro-hole drilling on the surface
   of stainless steel using a 10-ps Q-switched Nd:VAN pulsed laser at two
   wavelengths, 532 and 1064 nm, with multiple powers and different number
   of pulses. Results show that two primary ablation mechanisms for
   ultrashort laser machining, i.e., vaporization and phase explosion,
   which correspond to gentle and strong ablations, are correlated mainly
   with the applied laser power. From measured data, two ablation
   thresholds are calculated using a piece-wise linear fitting. Moreover,
   surface recast layer associated with strong ablation can be eliminated
   by an appropriate selection of laser processing parameters. The
   Hirschegg model is applied to analyze the evolution of hole depth as a
   function of laser processing parameters for the two wavelengths. For the
   532-nm wavelength laser ablation, the shapes and morphology of
   micro-holes evolve differently with low power from high power. In
   addition, the related reasons inducing multiple featured hole shapes are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Entry-level categories-the labels people use to name an object-were
   originally defined and studied by psychologists in the 1970s and 1980s.
   In this paper we extend these ideas to study entry-level categories at a
   larger scale and to learn models that can automatically predict
   entry-level categories for images. Our models combine visual recognition
   predictions with linguistic resources like WordNet and proxies for word
   ``naturalness{''} mined from the enormous amount of text on the web. We
   demonstrate the usefulness of our models for predicting nouns
   (entry-level words) associated with images by people, and for learning
   mappings between concepts predicted by existing visual recognition
   systems and entry-level concepts. In this work we make use of recent
   successful efforts on convolutional network models for visual
   recognition by training classifiers for 7404 object categories on
   ConvNet activation features. Results for category mapping and
   entry-level category prediction for images show promise for producing
   more natural human-like labels. We also demonstrate the potential
   applicability of our results to the task of image description
   generation.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a framework for the performance-based design (PBD)
   of high-rise buildings with respect to the occupant comfort performance
   objective. The performance is expressed in terms of the
   probability-conditional on the wind event intensity-that the fraction of
   the building occupants on one floor that perceive the motion is greater
   than a chosen threshold value. The framework is fully probabilistic, and
   numerous uncertainties affecting both the structural response and the
   human perception threshold are considered in the assessment of the
   exceedance probability. In addition, a new database-enabled online
   analysis module based on the proposed PBD framework {[}Performance-Based
   Data-Enabled Design module for Occupant Comfort (PBDED-OC)] is
   presented. The PBDED-OC allows the assessment of the occupant comfort
   performance of a tall building by taking advantage of databases of
   high-frequency base balance measurements or by adopting specific
   user-supplied wind tunnel data and is envisaged to be particularly
   useful during the preliminary design phase. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Database-enabled design (DED) frameworks offer convenient meshing of
   wind-tunnel driven databases with state-of-the-art analysis
   methodologies for the design of low-rise to high-rise buildings. These
   procedures can serve as an alternative or supplementary tool to codes
   and standards. Despite their obvious advantages over simplified
   code-specified procedures, the response estimates obtained from these
   data-driven frameworks are by nature susceptible to the accuracy of both
   the analysis schemes employed within the procedure as well as the
   aerodynamic databases that are driven by different wind tunnels,
   instrumentations, and experimental techniques. To examine and quantify
   these potential sources of discrepancy, this paper attempts to evaluate
   the performance of various cyber-based DED frameworks that are currently
   used in the preliminary design of tall buildings. To this end, a
   systematic comparison is carried out among along-wind and across-wind
   response estimates of a typical building example using some of the most

Abstract = {{Fuel efficient Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine
   combustion timing predictions must contend with non-linear chemistry,
   non-linear physics, period doubling bifurcation(s), turbulent mixing,
   model parameters that can drift day-to-day, and air-fuel mixture state
   information that cannot typically be resolved on a cycle-to-cycle basis,
   especially during transients. In previous work, an abstract
   cycle-to-cycle mapping function coupled with epsilon-Support Vector
   Regression was shown to predict experimentally observed cycle-to-cycle
   combustion timing over a wide range of engine conditions, despite some
   of the aforementioned difficulties. The main limitation of the previous
   approach was that a partially acasual randomly sampled training dataset
   was used to train proof of concept offline predictions. The objective of
   this paper is to address this limitation by proposing a new online
   adaptive Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) extension named Weighted
   Ring-ELM. This extension enables fully causal combustion timing
   predictions at randomly chosen engine set points, and is shown to
   achieve results that are as good as or better than the previous offline
   method. The broader objective of this approach is to enable a new class
   of real-time model predictive control strategies for high variability
   HCCI and, ultimately, to bring HCCI's low engine-out NOx and reduced CO2
   emissions to production engines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Fluidic origami: a plant-inspired adaptive structure with shape morphing

Abstract = {{Inspired by the physics behind the rapid plant movements and the rich
   topologies in origami folding, this research creates a unique class of
   multi-functional adaptive structure through exploring the innovation of
   fluidic origami. The idea is to connect multiple Miura folded sheets
   along their crease lines into a space-filling structure, and fill the
   tubular cells in-between with working fluids. The pressure and fluid
   flow in these cells can be strategically controlled much like in plants
   for nastic movements. The relationship between the internal fluid volume
   and the overall structure deformation is primarily determined by the
   kinematics of folding. This relationship can be exploited so that
   fluidic origami can achieve actuation/morphing by actively changing the
   internal fluid volume, and stiffness tuning by constraining the fluid
   volume. In order to characterize the working principles and performance
   potentials of these two adaptive functions, this research develops an
   equivalent truss frame model on a fluidic origami unit cell to analyze
   its fundamental elastic characteristics. Eigen-stiffness analysis based
   on this model reveals the primary modes of deformation and their
   relationships with initial folding configurations. Performances of the
   adaptive functions are correlated to the crease pattern design. In
   parallel to analytical studies, the feasibility of the morphing and
   stiffness tuning is also examined experimentally via a 3D printed
   multi-material prototype demonstrator. The research reported in this
   paper could lead to the synthesis of adaptive fluidic origami cellular
   metastructures or metamaterial systems for various engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{There are various issues of concern regarding electronic waste
   management, such as the toxicity of hazardous materials and the
   collection, recycling and recovery of useful resources. To understand
   the fate of electronic waste after collection and recycling, a products
   and materials flow analysis should be performed. This is a critical
   need, as material resources are becoming increasingly scarce and
   recycling may be able to provide secondary sources for new materials in
   the future. In this study, we investigate electronic waste systems,
   specifically the resource recovery or recycling aspects, as well as
   mapping electronic waste flows based on collection data in France.
   Approximately 1,588,453t of new electrical and electronic equipment were
   sold in the French market in 2010. Of this amount, 430,000t of
   electronic waste were collected, with the remaining 1,128,444t remaining
   in stock. Furthermore, the total recycled amounts were 354,106t and
   11,396t, respectively. The main electronic waste materials were ferrous
   metals (37\%), plastic (22\%), aluminium (12\%), copper (11\%) and glass
   (7\%). This study will contribute to developing sustainable electronic
   waste and resource recycling systems in France.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical models were developed that predict male and female femur
   geometry as functions of age, body mass index (BMI), and femur length as
   part of an effort to develop lower-extremity finite element models with
   geometries that are parametric with subject characteristics. The process
   for developing these models involved extracting femur geometry from
   clinical CT scans of 62 men and 36 women, fitting a template finite
   element femur mesh to the surface geometry of each patient, and then
   programmatically determining thickness at each nodal location. Principal
   component analysis was then performed on the thickness and geometry
   nodal coordinates, and linear regression models were developed to
   predict principal component scores as functions of age, BMI, and femur
   length. The average absolute errors in male and female external surface
   geometry model predictions were 4.57 and 4.23 mm, and the average
   absolute errors in male and female thickness model predictions were 1.67
   and 1.74 mm. The average error in midshaft cortical bone areas between
   the predicted geometries and the patient geometries was 4.4\%. The
   average error in cortical bone area between the predicted geometries and
   a validation set of cadaver femur geometries across 5 shaft locations
   was 2.9\%.}},

Title = {{Swarm Intelligence Based File Replication and Consistency Maintenance in
   Structured P2P File Sharing Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},

Abstract = {{In peer-to-peer file sharing systems, file replication helps to avoid
   overloading file owners and improve file query efficiency. There exists
   a tradeoff between minimizing the number of replicas (i.e., replication
   overhead) and maximizing the replica hit rate (which reduces file
   querying latency). More replicas lead to increased replication overhead
   and higher replica hit rates and vice versa. An ideal replication method
   should generate a low overhead burden to the system while providing low
   query latency to the users. However, previous replication methods either
   achieve high hit rates at the cost of many replicas or produce low hit
   rates. To reduce replicas while guaranteeing high hit rate, this paper
   presents SWARM, a file replication mechanism based on swarm
   intelligence. Recognizing the power of collective behaviors, SWARM
   identifies node swarms with common node interests and close proximity.
   Unlike most earlier methods, SWARM determines the placement of a file
   replica based on the accumulated query rates of nodes in a swarm rather
   than a single node. Replicas are shared by the nodes in a swarm, leading
   to fewer replicas and high querying efficiency. In addition, SWARM has a
   novel consistency maintenance algorithm that propagates an update
   message between proximity-close nodes in a tree fashion from the top to
   the bottom. Experimental results from the real-world PlanetLab testbed
   and the PeerSim simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the SWARM
   mechanism in comparison with other file replication and consistency
   maintenance methods. SWARM can reduce querying latency by 40-58 percent,
   reduce the number of replicas by 39-76 percent, and achieves more than
   84 percent higher hit rates compared to previous methods. It also can
   reduce the consistency maintenance overhead by 49-99 percent compared to
   previous consistency maintenance methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of disturbance response and error
   amplification for a simple system of coupled harmonic oscillators. We
   first suppose that identical oscillators are connected in a string in
   which each oscillator attempts to track its predecessor by using the
   same control law that depends on the relative position information from
   its immediate predecessor. Such an oscillator string is called a
   homogeneous oscillator string with predecessor-following architecture.
   Motivated by terminology from the problem of vehicle platooning, we say
   that the synchronized oscillator system is string unstable if the effect
   of a disturbance to the lead oscillator is amplified as it propagates
   along the string. With the use of a new Bode-like integral relation that
   must be satisfied by the complementary sensitivity function, we provide
   sufficient conditions for string instability. The sufficient conditions
   show that any string of oscillators that satisfies certain time domain
   performance specifications and bandwidth limitations must necessarily be
   string unstable. We further introduce a concept of time headway for the
   oscillator system and extend our analysis of string instability to
   consider the heterogeneous oscillator string and a more general
   communication range. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Ignition, flame structure and near-wall burning in transverse hydrogen
   jets in supersonic crossflow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{780}},
Pages = {{226-273}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We have investigated the properties of transverse sonic hydrogen jets in
   high-temperature supersonic crossflow at jet-to-crossflow momentum flux
   ratios J between 0.3 and 5.0. The crossflow was held fixed at a Mach
   number of 2.4, 1400 K and 40 kPa. Schlieren and OH{*} chemiluminescence
   imaging were used to investigate the global flame structure, penetration
   and ignition points; OH planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging over
   several planes was used to investigate the instantaneous reaction zone.
   It is found that J indirectly controls many of the combustion processes.
   Two regimes for low (<1) and high (>3) J are identified. At low J, the
   flame is lifted and stabilizes in the wake close to the wall possibly by
   autoignition after some partial premixing occurs; most of the heat
   release occurs at the wall in regions where OH occurs over broad
   regions. At high J, the flame is anchored at the upstream recirculation
   region and remains attached to the wall within the boundary layer where
   OH remains distributed over broad regions; a strong reacting shear layer
   exists where the flame is organized in thin layers. Stabilization occurs
   in the upstream recirculation region that forms as a consequence of the
   strong interaction between the bow shock, the jet and the boundary
   layer. In general, this interaction - which indirectly depends on J
   because it controls the jet penetration - dominates the fluid dynamic
   processes and thus stabilization. As a result, the flow field may be
   characterized by a flame structure characteristic of multiple
   interacting combustion regimes, from (non-premixed) flamelets to
   (partially premixed) distributed reaction zones, thus requiring a
   description based on a multi-regime combustion formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Using atomistic simulations and dislocation theory on a model system of
   semi-coherent (1 11\} interfaces, it is shown that misfit dislocation
   nodes adopt multiple atomic arrangements corresponding to the creation
   and redistribution of excess volume at the nodes. Four distinctive node
   structures were identified: volume-smeared nodes with (i) spiral or (ii)
   straight dislocation patterns, and volume-condensed nodes with (iii)
   triangular or (iv) hexagonal dislocation patterns. Volume-smeared nodes
   contain interfacial dislocations lying in the Cu-Ni interface but
   volume-condensed nodes contain two sets of interfacial dislocations in
   the two adjacent interfaces and jogs across the atomic layer between the
   two adjacent interfaces. Under biaxial tension/compression applied
   parallel to the interface, it is shown that the nucleation of lattice
   dislocations is preferred at the nodes and is correlated with the
   reduction of excess volume at the nodes. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on

Title = {{Coverage Path Planning with Real-time Replanning and Surface
   Reconstruction for Inspection of Three-dimensional Underwater Structures

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for planning coverage paths for inspecting
   complex structures on the ocean floor using an autonomous underwater
   vehicle (AUV). Our method initially uses a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) prior
   bathymetric map to plan a nominal coverage path that allows the AUV to
   pass its sensors over all points on the target area. The nominal path
   uses a standard mowing-the-lawn pattern in effectively planar regions,
   while in regions with substantial 3D relief it follows horizontal
   contours of the terrain at a given offset distance. We then go beyond
   previous approaches in the literature by considering the vehicle's state
   uncertainty rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption of an
   idealized path execution. Toward that end, we present a replanning
   algorithm based on a stochastic trajectory optimization that reshapes
   the nominal path to cope with the actual target structure perceived in
   situ. The replanning algorithm runs onboard the AUV in real time during
   the inspection mission, adapting the path according to the measurements
   provided by the vehicle's range-sensing sonars. Furthermore, we propose
   a pipeline of state-of-the-art surface reconstruction techniques we
   apply to the data acquired by the AUV to obtain 3D models of the
   inspected structures that show the benefits of our planning method for
   3D mapping. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in experiments at
   sea using the GIRONA 500 AUV, where we cover part of a breakwater
   structure in a harbor and an underwater boulder rising from 40m up to
   27m depth. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-sensitive in situ forming implants (ISFI) are a promising platform
   for the controlled release of therapeutic agents. The simple
   manufacturing, ease of placement, and diverse payload capacity make
   these implants an appealing delivery system for a wide range of
   applications. Tailoring the release profile is paramount for effective
   treatment of disease. In this study, three innovative formulation
   modifications were used to control drug release. Specifically, water,
   1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI),
   and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were incorporated into an ISFI solution
   containing the small molecular weight mock drug, sodium fluorescein. The
   effects of these additives on drug release, swelling, phase inversion,
   erosion, and implant microstructure were evaluated. Diagnostic
   ultrasound was used to monitor changes in swelling and phase inversion
   over time noninvasively. Water, DiI, and the combination of BSA/DiI
   functioned to reduce burst release 47.6\%, 76.6\%, and 59.0\%,
   respectively. Incorporation of water into the casting solution also
   enhanced the release of drug during the diffusion period of release by
   165.2\% relative to the excipient free control. Incorporation of BSA
   into the polymer solution did not significantly alter the burst release
   (p < 0.05); however, the onset of degradation facilitated release was
   delayed relative to the excipient-free control by 5 days. This study
   demonstrates that the use of excipients provides a facile method to
   tailor the release profile and degradation rate of implants without
   changing the polymer or solvent used in the implant formulation,
   providing fine control of drug dissolution during distinct phases of
   release. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second part of a comprehensive study on the locomotion
   characteristics of a metameric earthworm-like robot. Three major
   contributions from the first part paper are used as the foundations of
   this investigation: (a) the novel analytical models describing the
   kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the robot locomotion, (b) a
   gait generation algorithm based on the mechanism of retrograde
   peristalsis wave, and (c) the discovery of critical conditions for
   actuator-overload and anchor-slippage.
   This paper focuses on the issues of gait analysis and its experimental
   verification. Analysis on the kinematic model attains the optimal gait
   that corresponds to the maximum ideal average speed. However in
   practical applications, such ideal speed might not be achievable due to
   actuator overload and anchor slippage. Therefore, the dynamic model is
   exercised to survey the relationship between gait designs and the
   occurrence of the overload and slippage, and this survey identifies five
   types of locomotion with distinct dynamic characteristics. Then, this
   research branches out to investigate two important topics. The first
   topic is to understand how changes in the gait and physical parameters,
   such as the number of robot segments and the friction coefficients,
   affect the robot's locomotion behavior. The second topic is to optimize
   the gait designs in consideration of the effects from actuator overload
   and anchor slippage, such that the maximum achievable average speed can
   be obtained for different types of locomotion. The observations from
   these two topics of investigation reveal many insights regarding the
   physics of the metameric earthworm-like robot locomotion and provide
   comprehensive guidelines for the robot design and control. Finally, an
   eight-segment earthworm-like robot prototype is fabricated to
   experimentally verify the gait analysis, especially the relationship
   among gait design, average speed, and the occurrence of anchor slippage.}},

Abstract = {{Grassmannian rank-one update subspace estimation (GROUSE) is an
   iterative algorithm for identifying a linear subspace of from data
   consisting of partial observations of random vectors from that subspace.
   This paper examines local convergence properties of GROUSE, under
   assumptions on the randomness of the observed vectors, the randomness of
   the subset of elements observed at each iteration, and incoherence of
   the subspace with the coordinate directions. Convergence at an expected
   linear rate is demonstrated under certain assumptions. The case in which
   the full random vector is revealed at each iteration allows for much
   simpler analysis and is also described. GROUSE is related to incremental
   SVD methods and to gradient projection algorithms in optimization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel method for effectively mitigating high
   thermal stresses caused during local postweld heat treatment (PWHT) of
   welds in pressure vessels on which traditional heating method such as
   bull's eye heating arrangement has been proven difficult in meeting Code
   requirements for avoiding ``harmful{''} temperature gradients. The
   method involves the use of a secondary heat band (SHB) that
   strategically positioned at some distance away from primary PWHT heat
   band (HB) in terms of vessel characteristic length parameter root Rt,
   where R is vessel radius and t wall thickness. The basic principles
   associated with the SHB based technique are first demonstrated on a
   simple straight pipe girth weld configuration. Then, applications for
   treating nozzle welds in more complex spherical vessel, cylindrical
   vessel, and at end of cylindrical vessel are presented. Finally, a set
   of recommended guidelines are provided for defining both the SHB size
   and location for performing local PWHT on welds in three major
   nozzle/vessel weld configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the tension on the
   long head of the biceps tendon in the propagation of SLAP tears by
   studying the mechanical behavior of the torn superior glenoid labrum. A
   previously validated finite element model was extended to include a
   glenoid labrum with type II SLAP tears of three different sizes. The
   strain distribution within the torn labral tissue with loading applied
   to the biceps tendon was investigated and compared to the inact and
   unloaded conditions. The anterior and posterior edges of each SLAP tear
   experienced the highest strain in the labrum. Labral strain increased
   with increasing biceps tension. This effect was stronger in the labrum
   when the size of the tear exceeded the width of the biceps anchor on the
   superior labrum. Thus, this study indicates that biceps tension
   influences the propagation of a SLAP tear more than it does the
   initiation of a tear. Additionally, it also suggests that the tear size
   greater than the biceps anchor site as a criterion in determining
   optimal treatment of a type II SLAP tear. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research

Journal = {{MARINE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{87-106}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In support of the development of improved fillet weld sizing criteria
   for lightweight shipboard structures, a comprehensive static strength
   test program using longitudinal and transverse shear specimens according
   to AWS B4.0 Standards has been conducted. This test program covers base
   material with strength ranging from 71 ksi (490 MPa) to 96 ksi (660 MPa)
   and weld size ranging from 1/8 `' (3 mm) to 3/8 `' (10 mm). This paper
   focuses on a traction stress based analysis of the test data as an
   effort to establish a unified shear strength definition for
   load-carrying fillet weld specimens regardless of shear loading
   conditions. The proposed shear strength definition proves to be
   effective in correlating the fillet weld strength test data of the
   longitudinal and transverse shear specimens. The results of this
   investigation demonstrate that existing shear strength definitions used
   by various weld sizing criteria such as those given by Class Societies
   have two major limitations: (1) it cannot be related to a critical
   stress state on experimentally observed failure plane in transverse
   shear specimens; (2) it underestimates shear stress at failure due to
   severe stress concentration at weld end in typical longitudinal shear
   specimens. These two limitations have been shown to be the major cause
   for having two significantly different shear strength values: one is
   transverse shear strength obtained from transverse shear specimens and
   the other is longitudinal shear strength obtained from longitudinal
   shear specimens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{298}},
Pages = {{360-386}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Obtaining accuracy along domain boundaries is often the primary goal of
   a numerical simulation. In this work, we show how the test space of
   discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods can be optimized to achieve enhanced
   boundary accuracy for linear problems. Given some norm in which accuracy
   is desired, the optimal test functions render the numerical solution the
   best approximation to the true solution in that norm. For most norms,
   these test functions would be global in nature. However, for norms
   emphasizing boundary accuracy, they can be computed in an element-local
   manner and represent adjoint solutions for the interface fluxes. The
   resulting accuracy in these interface fluxes propagates globally,
   leading to convergence rates on the domain boundaries greater than 2p +
   1. Indeed, if the test functions and interface fluxes are well-resolved,
   exact boundary fluxes are obtained. Here, we demonstrate these ideas for
   several Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, including
   advection-diffusion and linearized Euler problems in both one and two
   dimensions. An extension of the theory to nonlinear problems will be
   presented in a future work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is an increasingly applicable policy
   in the competitive marketplace as a means of improving equipment
   reliability and efficiency. Not only has maintenance a close
   relationship with safety but its costs also make it even more attractive
   issue for researchers. This study proposes a model to evaluate the
   effectiveness of CBM policy compared to two other maintenance policies:
   Corrective Maintenance (CM) and Preventive Maintenance (PM). Maintenance
   policies are compared through two system performance indicators:
   reliability and cost. To estimate the reliability and costs of the
   system, the proposed Markovian discrete-event simulation model is
   developed under each of these policies. The applicability and usefulness
   of the proposed Markovian simulation model is illustrated for a
   series-parallel power generation system. The simulated characteristics
   of CBM system include its prognostics efficiency to estimate remaining
   useful life of the equipment. Results show that with an efficient
   prognostics, CBM policy is an effective strategy compared to other
   maintenance strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A network of small distributed wireless sensors is scattered over an
   extended geographic area that is to be monitored. A scenario of moving
   object entered the area and need to be classified as a Friend or Target
   is posed in this paper. Using Bayes theorem, sensors build beliefs
   around the object and classification decisions. As the object moves,
   sensors collaboratively choose a successor sensor and hand-off beliefs
   and classification decisions from the current active sensor to the
   successor. Sensor selection scheme is formulated as an Expected Value of
   Sample Information (EVSI) problem in the sequential Bayesian framework.
   Under the assumption that each measurement is independent and
   identically distributed we extended the EVSI problem analytically to
   account for consecutive samples of information. The scheme presents
   dynamic classification-driven solution for sensor optimization problem
   under incomplete information and object's time varying dynamics
   assumptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   play a major role in the development of personalized medicine and

Journal = {{ONCOTARGET}},

Abstract = {{A small sub-population of cells characterized by increased tumorigenic
   potential, ability to self-renew and to differentiate into cells that
   make up the tumor bulk, has been characterized in some (but not all)
   tumor types. These unique cells, named cancer stem cells, are considered
   drivers of tumor progression in these tumors. The purpose of this work
   is to understand if cancer stem cells play a functional role in the
   tumorigenesis of salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Here, we
   investigated the expression of putative cancer stem cell markers (ALDH,
   CD10, CD24, CD44) in primary human mucoepidermoid carcinomas by
   immunofluorescence, in vitro salisphere assays, and in vivo
   tumorigenicity assays in immunodeficient mice. Human mucoepidermoid
   carcinoma cells (UM-HMC-1, UM-HMC-3A, UM-HMC-3B) sorted for high levels
   of ALDH activity and CD44 expression (ALDH(high)CD44(high)) consistently
   formed primary and secondary salispheres in vitro, and showed enhanced
   tumorigenic potential in vivo (defined as time to tumor palpability,
   tumor growth after palpability), when compared to ALDH(low)CD44(low)
   cells. Cells sorted for CD10/CD24, and CD10/CD44 showed varying trends
   of salisphere formation, but consistently low in vivo tumorigenic
   potential. And finally, cells sorted for CD44/CD24 showed inconsistent
   results in salisphere formation and tumorigenic potential assays when
   different cell lines were evaluated. Collectively, these data
   demonstrate that salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinomas contain a
   small population of cancer stem cells with enhanced tumorigenic
   potential and that are characterized by high ALDH activity and CD44
   expression. These results suggest that patients with mucoepidermoid
   carcinoma might benefit from therapies that ablate these highly
   tumorigenic cells.}},

Abstract = {{We present frequency-tunable, continuous-wave terahertz sources based on

   ultrafast operation by concentrating a large number of photocarriers in
   close proximity to the device contact electrodes. Additionally, the
   relatively high thermal conductivity and high resistivity of GaAs allow
   operation under high optical pump power levels and long duty cycles
   without reaching the thermal breakdown limit of the photomixer. We
   experimentally demonstrate continuous-wave terahertz radiation with a
   radiation frequency tuning range of more than 2 THz and a record-high
   radiation power of 17 mu W at 1 THz through plasmonic photomixers

Abstract = {{In order to accurately control the microstructure and property of
   yttria-partially-stabilized-zirconia (YPSZ) coatings, this paper
   elaborated the particle in-flight behavior during supersonic atmospheric
   plasma spraying (SAPS) and its significance in determining the
   microstructure and thermal insulation properties of SAPS-YPSZ coatings.
   The results suggested that, for a Laval nozzle with an internal
   injection port, the influence of spray power on the particles velocity
   is more significant than the temperature. When the spray power and argon
   flow rate were kept unchanged, the increase of hydrogen percentage in
   the mixed plasma gas can increase the temperature while decrease the
   velocity. Compared with other spray parameters, the standoff distance
   had the most significant influence on both the temperature and velocity
   of in-flight particles. The particles temperature and velocity
   determined the melting state of particles and the content of unmelted
   nanoparticles of as-sprayed coatings, which decreased from 12\% to 6\%
   when the particles temperature and velocity increased by 10\% and 14\%,
   respectively. For a 300-mu m-thick YPSZ coating, thermal insulation
   temperature increased from 69 degrees C to 90 degrees C (increased by
   30\%) when the unmelted nanoparticle content increased from 6\% to 12\%.

   hydrophobically modified ethylene oxide urethane (HEUR) molecule,
   C16E45C16, and their corresponding starlike micelles, containing the
   surfactants C16E22 and C16E23, were studied by atomistic and
   coarse-grained molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. We used free energies
   from umbrella sampling to calculate the size distribution of micelle
   sizes and the average time for escape of a hydrophobic group from the
   micelle. Using the coarse-grained MARTINI force field, the most probable
   size of the model HEUR molecule was thereby determined to be about 80
   hydrophobes per micelle and the average hydrophobe escape time to be
   about 0.1 s, both of which are consistent with previous experimental
   studies. Atomistic simulations reveal that hydrogen bond formation and
   the mean lifetime of hydration waters of the poly(ethylene oxide) (or
   PEO) groups are location-dependent in the HEUR micelle, with PEO groups
   immediately adjacent to the C16 groups forming the fewest hydrogen bonds
   with water and having hydration waters with longer lifetimes than those
   of the PEO groups located further away from the C16 groups.}},

Title = {{Dimer covering and percolation frustration}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Covering a graph or a lattice with nonoverlapping dimers is a problem
   that has received considerable interest in areas, such as discrete
   mathematics, statistical physics, chemistry, and materials science. Yet,
   the problem of percolation on dimer-covered lattices has received little
   attention. In particular, percolation on lattices that are fully covered
   by nonoverlapping dimers has not evidently been considered. Here, we
   propose a procedure for generating random dimer coverings of a given
   lattice. We then compute the bond percolation threshold on random and
   ordered coverings of the square and the triangular lattices on the
   remaining bonds connecting the dimers. We obtain p(c) = 0.367 713(2) and
   p(c) = 0.235 340(1) for random coverings of the square and the
   triangular lattices, respectively. We observe that the percolation
   frustration induced as a result of dimer covering is larger in the
   low-coordination-number square lattice. There is also no relationship
   between the existence of long-range order in a covering of the square
   lattice and its percolation threshold. In particular, an ordered
   covering of the square lattice, denoted by shifted covering in this
   paper, has an unusually low percolation threshold and is topologically
   identical to the triangular lattice. This is in contrast to the other
   ordered dimer coverings considered in this paper, which have higher
   percolation thresholds than the random covering. In the case of the
   triangular lattice, the percolation thresholds of the ordered and random
   coverings are very close, suggesting the lack of sensitivity of the
   percolation threshold to microscopic details of the covering in highly
   coordinated networks.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the cycle life and failure resistance of lithium metal anodes
   is critical for next-generation rechargeable batteries. Here, we show
   that treating Li metal foil electrodes with ultrathin nm) Al2O3 layers
   using atomic layer deposition (ALD) without air exposure can prevent
   dendrite formation upon cycling at a current density of 1 mA/cm2. This
   has the effect of doubling the lifetime of the anode before failure both
   under galvanostatic deep discharge conditions and cyclic
   plating/stripping of symmetric Li Li cells. The ALD treated electrodes
   can be cycled for 1259 cycles before failure occurs, which is attributed
   to improved electrode morphology resulting from homogeneous Li ion flux
   across the electrode/electrolyte interface.}},

   behavioral declines in Caenorhabditis elegans}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Chemosensory neurons extract information about chemical cues from the
   environment. How is the activity in these sensory neurons transformed
   into behavior? Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we map a novel sensory
   neuron circuit motif that encodes odor concentration. Primary neurons,
   AWC(ON) and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde (BZ) and
   release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, which are
   required for odor-evoked responses in secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB.
   Consistently, both primary and secondary neurons are required for BZ
   attraction. Unexpectedly, this combinatorial code is altered in aged
   animals: odor-evoked activity in secondary, but not primary, olfactory
   neurons is reduced. Moreover, experimental manipulations increasing
   neurotransmission from primary neurons rescues aging-associated neuronal
   deficits. Finally, we correlate the odor responsiveness of aged animals
   with their lifespan. Together, these results show how odors are encoded
   by primary and secondary neurons and suggest reduced neurotransmission
   as a novel mechanism driving aging-associated sensory neural activity
   and behavioral declines.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease that is characterized by a
   decrease in bone mass and the deterioration in bone microarchitecture.
   This study investigates the feasibility of characterizing bone
   microstructure by analyzing the frequency spectrum of the photoacoustic
   (PA) signal from the bone. Modeling and numerical simulation of PA
   signal were performed on trabecular bone simulations and CT scans with
   different trabecular thicknesses. The resulting quasi-linear
   photoacoustic spectra were fittted by linear regression, from which the
   spectral parameter slope was quantified. The simulation based on two
   different models both demonstrate that bone specimens with thinner
   trabecular thicknesses have higher slope. Experiment on osteoporotic rat
   femoral heads with different mineral content was conducted. The finding
   from the experiment was in good agreement with the simulation,
   demonstrating that the frequency-domain analysis of PA signals can
   provide an objective assessment of bone microstructure and
   deterioration. Considering that PA measurement is non-ionizing,
   non-invasive, and has sufficient penetration in both calcified and
   non-calcified tissues, this new bone evaluation method based on
   photoacoustic spectral analysis holds potential for clinical management
   of osteoporosis and other bone diseases. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Title = {{The dynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser removal of 20 nm Ni films from
   an interface}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of femtosecond laser removal of 20 nm Ni films on glass
   substrates was studied using time-resolved pump-probe microscopy. 20 nm
   thin films exhibit removal at two distinct threshold fluences, removal
   of the top 7 nm of Ni above 0.14 J/cm(2), and removal of the entire 20
   nm film above 0.36 J/cm(2). Previous work shows the top 7 nm is removed
   through liquid spallation, after irradiation the Ni melts and rapidly
   expands leading to tensile stress and cavitation within the Ni film.
   This work shows that above 0.36 J/cm(2) the 20 nm film is removed in two
   distinct layers, 7 nm and 13 nm thick. The top 7 nm layer reaches a
   speed 500\% faster than the bottom 13 nm layer at the same absorbed
   fluence, 500-2000 m/s and 300-700 m/s in the fluence ranges studied.
   Significantly different velocities for the top 7 nm layer and bottom 13
   nm layer indicate removal from an interface occurs by a different
   physical mechanism. The method of measuring film displacement from the
   development of Newton's rings was refined so it could be shown that the
   13 nm layer separates from the substrate within 70 ps and accelerates to
   its final velocity within several hundred picoseconds. We propose that
   removal of the bottom 13 nm is consistent with heterogeneous nucleation
   and growth of vapor at the Ni-glass interface, but that the rapid
   separation and acceleration of the 13 nm layer from the Ni-glass
   interface requires consideration of exotic phases of Ni after
   excitation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Organic scintillators are frequently used for measurements that require
   sensitivity to both photons and Fast neutrons because of their pulse
   shape discrimination capabilities. In these measurement scenarios,
   particle identification is commonly handled using the charge-integration
   pulse shape discrimination method. This method works particularly well
   for high-energy depositions, but is prone to misclassification for
   relatively low-energy depositions. A novel algorithm has been developed
   for automatically performing charge-integration pulse shape
   discrimination in a consistent and repeatable manner. The algorithm is
   able to estimate the photon and neutron misclassification corresponding
   to the calculated discrimination parameters, and is capable of doing so
   using only the information measured by a single organic scintillator
   This paper describes the algorithm and assesses its performance by
   comparing algorithm-estimated misclassification to values computed via a
   more traditional time-of-flight estimation. A single data set was
   processed using four different low-energy thresholds: 40, 60, 90, and
   120 keVee. Overall, the results compared well between the two methods;
   in most cases, the algorithm-estimated values fell within the
   uncertainties of the TOF-estimated values. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A Bayesian approach is proposed for pulse shape discrimination of
   photons and neutrons in liquid organic scinitillators. Instead of
   drawing a decision boundary, each pulse is assigned a photon or neutron
   confidence probability. This allows for photon and neutron
   classification on an event-by-event basis. The sum of those confidence
   probabilities is used to estimate the number of photon and neutron
   instances in the data. An iterative scheme, similar to an
   expectation-maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, is used to
   infer the ratio of photons-to-neutrons in each measurement. Therefore,
   the probability space adapts to data with varying photon-to-neutron
   ratios. A time-correlated measurement of Am-Be and separate measurements
   of Cs-137, Co-60 and Th-232 photon sources were used to construct
   libraries of neutrons and photons. These libraries were then used to
   produce synthetic data sets with varying ratios of photons-to-neutrons.
   Probability weighted method that we implemented was found to maintain
   neutron acceptance rate of up to 90\% up to photon-to-neutron ratio
   2000, and performed 9\% better than the decision boundary approach.
   Furthermore, the iterative approach appropriately changed the
   probability space with an increasing number of photons which kept the
   neutron population estimate from unrealistically increasing. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We give algorithms for the optimization problem: max(rho) (Q, rho),
   where Q is a Hermitian matrix, and the variable rho is a bipartite
   separable quantum state. This problem lies at the heart of several
   problems in quantum computation and information, such as the complexity
   of QMA(2). While the problem is NP-hard, our algorithms are better than
   brute force for several instances of interest. In particular, they give
   PSPACE upper bounds on promise problems admitting a QMA(2) protocol in
   which the verifier performs only a logarithmic number of elementary
   gates on both proofs, as well as the promise problem of deciding if a
   bipartite local Hamiltonian has a large or small ground energy. For Q >=
   0, our algorithm runs in time exponential in parallel to Q parallel
   to(F). While the existence of such an algorithm was first proved
   recently by Brandao, Christandl and Yard (2011) {[}8], our algorithm is
   conceptually simpler. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative signal transduction mechanism of polydiacetylene (PDA)
   sensors is devised by combining stimuli-responsive polymer hydrogel as a
   matrix and PDA sensory materials as a signal-generating component. We
   hypothesized that volumetric expansion of the polymer hydrogel matrix by
   means of external stimuli can impose stress on the imbedded PDA
   materials, generating a sensory signal. PDA assembly as a sensory
   component was ionically linked with the alginate hydrogel in order to
   transfer the volumetric expansion force of alginate hydrogel efficiently
   to the sensory PDA molecules. Under the same swelling ratio of alginate
   hydrogel, alginate gel having embedded 1-dimensional thin PDA nanofibers
   (similar to 20 nm diameter) presented a sharp color change while
   0-dimensional PDA liposome did not give any sensory signal when it was
   integrated in alginate gel. The results implied that dimensionality is
   an important design factor to realize stimuli-responsive matrix-driven
   colorimetric PDA sensory systems; more effective contact points between
   1-dimensional PDA nanofibers and the alginate matrix much more
   effectively transfer the external stress exerted by the volumetric
   expansion force, and thin PDA nanofibers respond more sensitively to the
   stress.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Applying the Briggs-Bers ``pole-pinch{''} criterion to the exact
   transcendental dispersion relation of a dielectric traveling wave tube
   (TWT), we find that there is no absolute instability regardless of the
   beam current. We extend this analysis to the circuit band edges of a
   linear beam TWT by approximating the circuit mode as a hyperbola in the
   frequency-wave-number (omega-k) plane and consider the weak coupling
   limit. For an operating mode whose group velocity is in the same
   direction as the beam mode, we find that the lower band edge is not
   subjected to absolute instability. At the upper band edge, we find a
   threshold beam current beyond which absolute instability is excited. The
   nonexistence of absolute instability in a linear beam TWT and the
   existence in a gyrotron TWT, both at the lower band edge, is contrasted.
   The general study given here is applicable to some contemporary TWTs
   such as metamaterial-based and advanced Smith-Purcell TWTs.}},

Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{338}},
Pages = {{242-251}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Traditional analyses of slip at corners of contacts, based on linear
   elasticity and a Coulomb friction law, are very sensitive to the details
   of local geometries, owing to the effects of elastic singularities.
   Following the use of cohesive-zone models to address such issues in
   mode-II fracture, we present analyses of slip and wear at corners of
   contacts when a finite interfacial shear strength is incorporated with a
   Coulomb friction law. We show that the concept of an instantaneous
   cohesive-length scale, borrowed from the field of fracture mechanics,
   can be used to describe the nature of stress fields around corners, and
   defines when linear-elasticity and Coulomb friction can provide an
   accurate description of the interfacial behavior. We also show that the
   sensitivity of slip analyses to geometrical details decreases when the
   cohesive-length scale increases. We also show that the cohesive strength
   of an interface plays a crucial role in the propagation of a wear scar
   across an interface. If only Coulomb slip is assumed to occur, a wear
   scar may not progress beyond the original stick-slip boundary. If a
   finite interfacial shear strength is introduced into the analysis, the
   wear scar can propagate along the interface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   development and operational paths over a ship's life cycle and to
   identify system characteristics consistent within high performing
   designs. Decision metrics then contextualize a fuller extent of design
   engineer and operator preferences toward tradeoffs between value
   creation and active ship management. The case study specifically
   examines future scenarios subject to carbon emission regulations and
   uncertainty surrounding enforcement of the Energy Efficient Design
   Index. Results inform decisions about when, where, and how to
   incorporate the changeability that maximizes expected life cycle

Abstract = {{The nucleation and growth of helium (He) bubbles in the bulk and at 3 <
   110 >\{112\} and Sigma 73b < 110 >\{661\} grain boundaries (GBs) in bcc
   iron have been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The
   results show that a 1/2 < 111 >\{111\} dislocation loop is formed with
   the sequential collection of < 111 > interstitial crowdions at the
   periphery of the He cluster and is eventually emitted from the He
   cluster. Insertion of 45 He atoms into a He cluster leads to the
   formation of a 1/2 < 111 > dislocation loop in Sigma 3 GB. It is of
   interest to notice that the transition of a dislocation segment through
   the GB leads to the formation of a step at the GB plane following the
   loop formation, accounting for the formation of a residual GB defect. A
   1/2 < 111 > loop, with a \{110\} habit plane, is emitted with further
   increase of the He bubble size in the Sigma 3 GB. In contrast, the
   sequential insertion of He atoms in Sigma 73b GB continuously emits
   self-interstitial atoms (SIAs), but these SIAs rearrange at the core of
   the inherent GB dislocation, instead of forming a dislocation loop,
   which leads the GB dislocation to propagate along the {[}1112]
   direction. In the bulk and Sigma 3 GB, the He bubble exhibits
   three-dimensionally spherical shape, but it forms longitudinal shape
   along the dislocation line in the Sigma 73 GB, a shape commonly observed
   at GBs in experiments. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a game-theoretic framework for economic operations
   of future residential distribution systems with high participation of
   distributed electricity prosumers. Recently, the large-scale grid
   integration of distributed renewable energy is becoming a promising
   solution to restructuring the current power grid infrastructure and
   ensuring the reliability of energy supply. The wide adoption of
   distributed renewable energy mainly depends on the participation level
   of residential consumers and prosumers. Accordingly, there is an urgent
   need to investigate the economic operations of this new, highly complex
   retail electricity market that potentially has millions of interactive
   endpoints. This paper identifies the new roles of utilities and
   distributed electricity prosumers in the future retail electricity
   market. The game-theoretic algorithms used to clear the retail
   electricity market price consider the group coalition scenarios of
   multiple electricity prosumers. Several numerical case studies are
   conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed framework. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{MUSIC is a popular algorithm for estimating the direction of arrival
   (DOA) in array signal processing applications. In this paper, we analyze
   the performance of the MUSIC algorithm for a single source system, in
   the presence of noisy and missing data (when only a random subset of the
   entries in the data matrix are observed). We prove consistency of the
   DOA estimate when signal from a single source is impinging on low
   coherence arrays, and derive an analytic expression for the
   mean-squared-error (MSE) performance of MUSIC for the case of uniform
   linear arrays, in the large array and relatively large sample setting.
   Our analysis is mathematically justified in both the sample rich and
   deficient regimes. The expression for the MSE is a simple function of
   array geometry, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the fraction of entries
   observed, and the ratio of the number of sensors to number of snapshots.
   We derive a phase transition threshold which separates a regime where
   MUSIC is consistent from a regime where MUSIC is inconsistent. This
   threshold depends upon the SNR, the probability of observing entries in
   the data matrix, and number of sensors and snapshots in a simple manner
   which we make explicit.}},

Title = {{Universal cell capture by immobilized antimicrobial peptide plantaricin}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{18-22}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Plantaricin-423 is a short antimicrobial peptide and displays
   bactericidal activities against several food-borne pathogens and
   spoilage Gram positive bacteria. The goal of this study was to
   investigate the potential of using immobilized plantaricin for capturing
   microorganisms on glass arrays. The peptide used for immobilization
   consists of N-terminal domain of Plantaricin-423 with an additional
   cysteine (Pln-17C) to form disulfide bonds with thiol groups present on
   silanized slides. Our results showed that Pln-17C is able to capture all
   six strains that were tested with varying affinities. The cell capture
   occurred within five minutes of incubation and the binding level was
   highest for Listeria innocua followed by other Gram positive strains
   tested. Pln-17C was also able to capture Escherichia coli with lower
   affinity, but the binding was significantly lower for Mycobacterium
   smegmatis compared to other strains. In addition, we have observed that
   immobilized Pln-17C maintained its anti-listerial activity; however, it
   did not kill E. coli as expected. Our results demonstrate the
   feasibility of utilizing antimicrobial peptides in biosensors for
   pathogen detection and for creating antimicrobial surfaces. Moreover, in
   combination with other peptides, different target species from
   food-borne pathogens to biodefense agents can be captured on more
   stable, economic, and robust platforms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{219-224}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Decarboxylation of fatty acids is a path to fuel-range hydrocarbons from
   renewable plant and seed oils. Pt/C is an effective hydrothermal
   catalyst for decarboxylating saturated fatty acids without added
   hydrogen, but it has shown low selectivity and activity for
   decarboxylating unsaturated fatty acids, which are prevalent in plant
   oils from soy and algae. To develop better decarboxylation catalysts, we
   compared three different Sn containing alloys, Pt3Sn/C, PtSn/C, and
   PtSn3/C, to Pt/C by performing batch reactions in liquid water at 350
   degrees C for two hours with stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), and
   linoleic (C18:2) acids. Pt/C gave yields of 0.70 +/- 0.05, 0.16 +/-
   0.03, and 0.083 +/- 0.009 for the C-17 alkane, but none of the direct
   decarboxylation products (i.e., C-17 alkenes), for the oleic and
   linoleic acid feeds. Stearic acid was the major byproduct from the
   unsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, the PtSnx/C catalysts provided two
   to three times higher C-17 alkane yields at identical conditions.
   Experiments in D2O showed that water molecules were a source of hydrogen
   for saturation of the fatty acids. These results show that PtSnx alloys
   give better performance than Pt alone for the hydrothermal conversion of
   renewable fatty acids to fuel range hydrocarbons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Many ultrathin films of transition metal oxides exhibit nonmetallic
   behavior, in contrast to their metallic bulk counterpart, thus
   displaying a metal-insulator transition (MIT) as the film thickness is
   reduced. The nature of this MIT has been a long-standing issue in the
   epitaxial oxide research community. Here, we report the processing
   dependence of the critical thickness (t(c)) of MIT and the origin of the
   insulating phase in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) films. A t(c) of 3 unit cells
   (u.c.) is achieved by minimizing oxygen vacancies under optimal growth
   conditions, diminishing the epitaxial strain with a tunable buffer layer
   and suppressing surface strain by film capping. The electrical transport
   measurements demonstrate that the nonmetallic behavior in LSMO thin
   films is an unavoidable result of localization initiated by inherent
   disorder but amplified by the reduction in dimensionality.}},

   Ecosystems}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Forecasting bifurcations such as critical transitions is an active
   research area of relevance to the management and preservation of
   ecological systems. In particular, anticipating the distance to critical
   transitions remains a challenge, together with predicting the state of
   the system after these transitions are breached. In this work, a new
   model-less method is presented that addresses both these issues based on
   monitoring recoveries from large perturbations. The approach uses data
   from recoveries of the system from at least two separate parameter
   values before the critical point, to predict both the bifurcation and
   the post-bifurcation dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated, and
   its performance evaluated under different levels of measurement noise,
   with two ecological models that have been used extensively in previous
   studies of tipping points and alternative steady states. The first one
   considers the dynamics of vegetation under grazing; the second, those of
   macrophyte and phytoplankton in shallow lakes. Applications of the
   method to more complex situations are discussed together with the kinds
   of empirical data needed for its implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of obesity on
   occupant responses in frontal crashes using whole-body human finite
   element (FE) models representing occupants with different obesity
   levels. In this study, the geometry of THUMS 4 midsize male model was
   varied using mesh morphing techniques with target geometries defined by
   statistical models of external body contour and exterior ribcage
   geometry. Models with different body mass indices (BMIs) were calibrated
   against cadaver test data under high-speed abdomen loading and frontal
   crash conditions. A parametric analysis was performed to investigate the
   effects of BMI on occupant injuries in frontal crashes based on the
   Taguchi method while controlling for several vehicle design parameters.
   Simulations of obese occupants predicted significantly higher risks of
   injuries to the thorax and lower extremities in frontal crashes compared
   with non-obese occupants, which is consistent with previous field data

Abstract = {{A efficient indium tin oxide (ITO)-free transparent electrode based on
   an improved Ag film is designed by introducing small amount of Al during
   co-deposition, producing ultrathin and smooth Ag film with low loss. A
   transparent electrode as thin as 4 nm is achieved by depositing the film
   on top of Ta2O5 layer, and organic solar cells based on such ultrathin
   electrode are built, producing power conversion efficiency over 7\%. The
   device efficiency can be optimized by simply tuning Ta2O5 layer
   thickness external to the organic photovoltaic (OPV) structure to create
   an optical cavity resonance inside the photoactive layer. Therefore
   Ta2O5/Al-doped Ag films function as a high-performance electrode with
   high transparency, low resistance, improved photon management capability
   and mechanical flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{This work designs a class of biocompatible PEG-chitosan@CDs hybrid
   nanogels by integrating nonlinear poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), chitosan,
   and graphitic carbon dots (CDs) into a single nanoparticle for
   two-photon fluorescence (TPF) bioimaging, pH and near-infrared (NIR)
   light dual-responsive drug release, and synergistic therapy. Such hybrid
   nanogels can be simply prepared from a one-pot surfactant-free
   precipitation polymerization of the PEG macromonomers complexed with
   chitosan and CDs in water, resulting in a semi-interpenetration of
   chitosan chains and an immobilization of CDs in the nonlinear PEG
   networks. The embedded CDs in hybrid nanogels not only serve as an
   excellent confocal and TPF imaging contrast agent and fluorescent
   pH-sensing probe, but also enhance the loading capacity of the hybrid
   nanogels for hydrophobic anticancer drug. The chitosan can induce a
   pH-sensitive swelling/deswelling of the hybrid nanogels for pH-regulated
   drug release over the physiologically important range of 5.0-7.4 and
   surface modulation of embedded CDs to realize fluorescent pH sensing.
   The thermosensitive nonlinear PEG network can promote the drug release
   through the local heat produced by the embedded CDs under NIR
   irradiation. The in vitro results indicate that the hybrid nanogels
   demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy through the synergistic effect of
   combined chemo-photothermal treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma formation in a self-generated steam bubble is studied using a
   coaxial discharge tube with an axial powered electrode (nominal peak
   operating voltage 2000 V) and an external ground lead without any gas
   flow. The discharge is potentially attractive for water purification
   applications in that the production of reactive nitrogen species and the
   associated water acidification is avoided. The discharge was found to
   form after a finite delay, which is attributed to the vapor bubble
   formation necessary for plasma ignition. Steam bubble composition was
   confirmed using emission spectra. Plasma properties and power dissipated
   in the self-generated steam bubble were characterized using emission
   spectroscopy and Lissajous methods. Discharge density and gas
   temperature were found to vary significantly over the applied ac voltage
   cycle. The power dissipated as inferred from the Lissajous method was
   found to scale inversely with frequency over the low frequency range
   investigated (4 kHz and 5 kHz).}},

Abstract = {{Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most frequent malignant salivary
   gland cancer. Response to chemoradiotherapy is modest, and therefore
   radical surgery remains the standard-of-care. Emerging evidence suggests
   that Interleukin (IL)-6 signaling correlates with the survival of cancer
   stem cells and resistance to therapy. Here, we investigated whether
   inhibition of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signaling with tocilizumab
   (humanized anti-human IL-6R antibody) sensitizes MEC to chemotherapy
   using human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines (UM-HMC) and
   correspondent xenograft models. In vitro, we observed that tocilizumab
   inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation but had no measurable effect in MEC cell
   viability (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). In contrast, the anti-tumor effect of
   single agent tocilizumab on MEC xenografts was comparable to paclitaxel
   or cisplatin. Combination of tocilizumab with cisplatin or paclitaxel
   enhanced the inhibitory effect of chemotherapy on xenograft growth (P <
   0.05), time to failure (P < 0.01), decreased vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) expression and tumor microvessel density (P < 0.05)
   without added systemic toxicities. Notably, tocilizumab decreased the
   fraction of MEC cancer stem cells (ALDH(high)CD44(high)) in vitro, and
   prevented paclitaxel-induced increase in the fraction of cancer stem
   cells in vivo (P < 0.05). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that
   tocilizumab enhances the anti-tumor effect of conventional chemotherapy
   in preclinical models of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and suggest that
   patients might benefit from combination therapy with an inhibitor of
   IL-6R signaling and chemotherapeutic agent such as paclitaxel.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of MRI-guided radiotherapy, reference dosimetry must be
   thoroughly addressed to account for the effects of the magnetic field on
   absorbed dose to water and on detector dose response. While Monte Carlo
   plays an essential role in reference dosimetry, it is also crucial for
   determining quality correction factors in these new conditions. The Fano
   cavity test is recognized as fundamental to validate Monte Carlo
   transport algorithms. In the presence of magnetic fields, it is
   necessary to define special conditions under which such a test can be
   performed. The present theoretical study proposes two conditions in
   which the validity of Fano's theorem is demonstrated in the presence of
   a magnetic field and the analytic expression of energy deposition is
   verified. It is concluded that the proposed conditions form a valid
   basis for two types of Fano cavity tests in the presence of a magnetic
   field.}},

Abstract = {{A computational study was conducted to investigate the characteristics
   of auto-ignition in a syngas mixture at high-pressure and
   low-temperature conditions in the presence of thermal inhomogeneities.
   Highly resolved one-dimensional numerical simulations incorporating
   detailed chemistry and transport were performed. The temperature
   inhomogeneities were represented by a global sinusoidal temperature
   profile and a local Gaussian temperature spike (hot spot). Reaction
   front speed and front Damkohler number analyses were employed to
   characterise the propagating ignition front. In the presence of a global
   temperature gradient, the ignition behaviour shifted from spontaneous
   propagation (strong) to deflagrative (weak), as the initial mean
   temperature of the reactant mixture was lowered. A predictive
   Zel'dovich-Sankaran criterion to determine the transition from strong to
   weak ignition was validated for different parametric sets. At
   sufficiently low temperatures, the strong ignition regime was recovered
   due to faster passive scalar dissipation of the imposed thermal
   fluctuations relative to the reaction timescale, which was quantified by
   the mixing Damkohler number. In the presence of local hot spots, only
   deflagrative fronts were observed. However, the fraction of the reactant
   mixture consumed by the propagating front was found to increase as the
   initial mean temperature was lowered, thereby leading to more enhanced
   compression-heating of the end-gas. Passive scalar mixing was not found
   to be important for the hot spot cases considered. The parametric study
   confirmed that the relative magnitude of the Sankaran number translates
   accurately to the quantitative strength of the deflagration front in the
   overall ignition advancement.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskites are of interest as low-cost replacements for Pt-based NO
   oxidation catalysts. While the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed NO oxidation is
   fairly well understood, such is not the case for the oxides. The
   perovskite LaCoO3 itself has been shown to have good NO oxidation
   activity, and Sr substitution improves NO oxidation rates and reduces
   NO2 inhibition. In this work, we report density functional theory (DFT)
   results for the adsorption of NOx (x = 1, 2) to the undoped and Sr doped
   (100) LaO and CoO2 terminated LaCoO3. Further, we used first-principles
   thermodynamic models to determine the most common surface species under
   NO oxidation conditions. Nitrates and adsorbed NO are most stable on the
   LaO and CoO2 terminations, respectively. We explored the relative free
   energies of surface and vacancy-mediated pathways for NO oxidation. The
   vacancy-mediated pathways suffer from energetically costly removal of
   surface oxygen, while the surface pathway is most feasible for NO
   oxidation to occur. The perovskite surface free energy reaction pathway
   is compared to RuO2, MgO, and Pt. The CoO2 termination surface pathway
   is energetically most similar to that of Pt and is considered to be the
   most plausible for NO oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by a large health care data obtained from the U.S. Veterans
   Health Administration (VHA), we develop a multivariate version of
   hierarchical structured additive regression (STAR) models that involves
   a set of health care responses defined at the lowest level of the
   hierarchy, a set of patient factors to account for individual
   heterogeneity, and a set of higher level effects to capture dependence
   between patients within the same medical home team and facility. We show
   how a special class of such models can equivalently be represented and
   estimated in structural equation modeling framework. We then propose a
   Bayesian component selection with a spike and slab prior structure that
   allows inclusion or exclusion single effects as well as grouped
   coefficients representing particular model terms. A simple parameter
   expansion is used to improve mixing and convergence properties of Markov
   chain Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed methods are applied to a
   real-world application of the VHA patient centered medical home (PCMH)
   data and help to provide a good prediction of clinical workload
   portfolio for a certain mix of health care professionals based on
   patient key demographic, diagnostic, and medical attributes.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{961-977}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we study a Stochastic Minimum Cost Flow (SMCF) problem
   under arc failure uncertainty, where an arc flow solution may correspond
   to multiple path flow representations. We assume that the failure of an
   arc will cause flow losses on all paths using that arc, and for any path
   carrying positive flows, the failure of any arc on the path will lose
   all flows carried by the path. We formulate two SMCF variants to
   minimize the cost of arc flows, while respectively restricting the
   Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of random path
   flow losses due to uncertain arc failure (reflected as network
   topological changes). We formulate a linear program to compute possible
   losses, yielding a mixed-integer programming formulation of SMCF-VaR and
   a linear programming formulation of SMCF-CVaR. We present a kidney
   exchange problem under uncertain match failure as an application and use
   the two SMCF models to maximize the utility/social welfare of pairing
   kidneys subject to constrained risk of utility losses. Our results show
   the efficacy of our approaches, the conservatism of using CVaR, and
   optimal flow patterns given by VaR and CVaR models on diverse instances.}},

Title = {{The Future of Graduate Medical Education: A Systems-Based Approach to
   Ensure Patient Safety}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1199-1202}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the past 15 years, there has been growing recognition that improving
   patient safety must be more systems based and sophisticated than the
   traditional approach of simply telling health care providers to ``be
   more careful.{''} Drawing from his own experience, the author discusses
   barriers to systems-based patient safety initiatives and emphasizes the
   importance of overcoming those barriers. Physicians may be slow to adopt
   standardized patient safety initiatives because of a resistance to
   standardization, but faculty in training institutions have a
   responsibility to model safe, effective, systems-based approaches to
   patient care in order to instill these values in the residents they
   teach. Importantly, graduate medical education (GME) is well positioned
   to influence not only how future physicians provide care to patients but
   also how today's physicians and health care systems improve patient
   safety and care. The necessary systems-based knowledge and skills are
   rooted in both understanding and proficiently identifying threats to
   patient safety, their underlying causes, the development and
   implementation of effective countermeasures, and the measurement of
   whether the threat has been successfully addressed. This knowledge and
   its application is notably absent in the operation of most institutions
   that sponsor GME training programs in terms of didactic instruction and
   everyday demonstrated proficiency. Most important of all, faculty must
   model the behavior and competencies that are desirable in future
   physicians and not fall into the trap of the ``do as I say, not as I
   do{''} mentality, which can have a corrosive deleterious effect on the
   next generation of physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Speech recognition was measured as a function of the target-to-masker
   ratio (TMR) with syntactically similar speech maskers. In the first
   experiment, listeners were instructed to report keywords from the target
   sentence. Data averaged across listeners showed a plateau in performance
   below 0 dB TMR when masker and target sentences were from the same
   talker. In this experiment, some listeners tended to report the target
   words at all TMRs in accordance with the instructions, while others
   reported keywords from the louder of the sentences, contrary to the
   instructions. In the second experiment, stimuli were the same as in the
   first experiment, but listeners were also instructed to avoid reporting
   the masker keywords, and a payoff matrix penalizing masker keywords and
   rewarding target keywords was used. In this experiment, listeners
   reduced the number of reported masker keywords, and increased the number
   of reported target keywords overall, and the average data showed a local
   minimum at 0 dB TMR with same-talker maskers. The best overall
   performance with a same-talker masker was obtained with a level
   difference of 9 dB, where listeners achieved near perfect performance
   when the target was louder, and at least 80\% correct performance when
   the target was the quieter of the two sentences.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we incorporate the cyclical terms in dense media
   radiative transfer (DMRT) theory to model combined active and passive
   microwave remote sensing of snow over the same scene. The inclusion of
   cyclical terms is crucial if the DMRT is used to model both the active
   and passive contributions with the same model parameters. This is a
   necessity when setting out on a joint active/passive retrieval.
   Previously, the DMRT model has been applied to active and passive
   separately, and in each case with a separate set of model parameters.
   The traditional DMRT theory only includes the ladder terms of the
   Feynman diagrams. The cyclical terms are important in multiple volume
   scattering and volume-surface interactions. This leads to backscattering
   enhancement which represents itself as a narrow peak centered at
   backward direction. This effect is of less significance in passive
   remote sensing since emissivity is relating to the angular integral of
   bistatic scattering coefficients. The inclusion of cyclical terms in
   first-order radiative transfer (RT) accounts for the enhancement of the
   double bounce contribution and makes the results the same as that of
   distorted Born approximation in volume-surface interactions. In this
   paper, we develop the methodology of cyclical corrections within the
   framework of DMRT beyond first order to all orders of multiple
   scattering. The active DMRT equation is solved using a numerical
   iterative approach followed by cyclical corrections. Both
   quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA)-Mie theory with sticky spheres and
   bicontinuous media scattering model are used to illustrate the results.
   The cyclical correlation introduces around 1 dB increase in backscatter
   with a moderate snowpack optical thickness of similar to 0.2. The
   bicontinuous/DMRT model is next applied to compare with data acquired in
   the Nordic Snow Radar Experiment (NoSREx) campaign in the snow season of
   2010-2011. The model results are validated against coincidental active
   and passive measurements using the same set of physical parameters of
   snow in all frequency and polarization channels. Results show good
   agreement in multiple active and passive channels.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated great therapeutic potential of
   educating and unleashing our own immune system for cancer treatment.
   However, there are still major challenges in cancer immunotherapy,
   including poor immunogenicity of cancer vaccines, off-target side
   effects of immunotherapeutics, as well as suboptimal outcomes of
   adoptive Tcell transfer-based therapies. Nanomaterials with defined
   physico-biochemical properties are versatile drug delivery platforms
   that may address these key technical challenges facing cancer vaccines
   and immunotherapy. Nanoparticle systems have been shown to improve
   targeted delivery of tumor antigens and therapeutics against immune
   checkpoint molecules, amplify immune activation via the use of new
   stimuli-responsive or immunostimulatory materials, and augment the
   efficacy of adoptive cell therapies. Here, we review the current
   state-of-the-art in nanoparticle-based strategies designed to potentiate
   cancer immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines with subunit antigens
   (e.g., oncoproteins, mutated neo-antigens, DNA and mRNA antigens) and

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring has been
   widely recommended for evaluating the status of BP, but is lacking in
   practicality. Determination of the specific time points for BP
   measurement that are representative of 24-hour mean BP could be useful
   and convenient in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD).
   Methods: A total of 1,317 patients for whom 24-hour ambulatory BP
   monitoring was performed were enrolled in a multicenter study on
   hypertensive CKD. We analyzed the time points at which systolic blood
   pressure (SBP) values exhibited the smallest differences from 24-hour
   mean SBP (mSBP). We included office mSBP and analyzed the relationships
   between SBPs at the office and the time points with the smallest
   differences from 24-hour mSBP using several methods.
   Results: The time points with the smallest differences from 24-hour mSBP
   were 7: 00 AM, 2: 00 PM, and 9: 30 PM. In regression analysis, SBPs at
   7: 00 AM and 9: 30 PM were better correlated with 24-hour mSBP than SBPs
   at 2: 00 PM and the office. The proportions of patients with SBPs within
   30\% of 24-hour mSBP were higher at 7: 00 AM and 9: 30 PM. The best
   consistency between the uncontrolled hypertensive groups, defined as >=
   135 mmHg of 24-hour mSBP and higher values of SBPs corresponding to 135
   mmHg of 24-hour mSBP, were observed at the 7: 00 AM and 9: 30 PM time
   points.
   Conclusions: The specific time points for SBPs that correlated well with
   24-hour mSBP in hypertensive CKD patients were 7: 00 AM and 9: 30 PM.}},

Abstract = {{Singular spectrum analysis is developed for the processing of nonlinear
   vibration measurements containing noise in structural damage detection.
   The method uses system augmentation to make the nonlinear system into an
   augmented linear system. The measured response of the system is
   decomposed and the corresponding decomposition subspace of the
   components which contains the least interference is reconstructed.
   Direct system parameter identification technique is then used to solve
   the model properties of the augmented system. Minimum rank perturbation
   theory is generalized so that it can be applied to detect local damage
   of the augmented system. Excellent identification results are obtained
   when Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is applied, while identification
   result that without applying SSA shows large errors. The enhanced method
   is shown to be capable of yielding accurate identified results with
   noisy measurement in nonlinear systems. (C) 2015 Institute of Noise

   implementation of the progressive hedging algorithm to find near-optimal
   surgery schedules. We conduct numerical experiments using data from a
   large hospital to identify managerial insights related to surgery
   planning and the avoidance of surgery cancellations. We compare the
   progressive hedging algorithm to an easy-to-implement heuristic for
   practical problem instances to estimate the value of the stochastic
   solution. Finally, we discuss an implementation of the progressive
   hedging algorithm within a rolling horizon framework for extended

Abstract = {{Tumor-initiating cells, also designated as cancer stem cells, are
   proposed to constitute a subpopulation of malignant cells central to
   tumorigenesis, metastasis, and treatment resistance. We analyzed the
   activity of the proteasome, the primary organelle for targeted protein
   degradation, as a marker of tumor-and metastasis-initiating cells. Using
   human and mouse breast cancer cells expressing a validated fluorescent
   reporter, we found a small subpopulation of cells with low proteasome
   activity that divided asymmetrically to produce daughter cells with low
   or high proteasome activity. Breast cancer cells with low proteasome
   activity had greater local tumor formation and metastasis in
   immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. To allow flexible labeling
   of cells, we also developed a new proteasome substrate based on HaloTag
   technology. Patient-derived glioblastoma cells with low proteasome
   activity measured by the HaloTag reporter show key phenotypes associated
   with tumor-initiating cells, including expression of a stem cell
   transcription factor, reconstitution of the original starting
   population, and enhanced neurosphere formation. We also show that
   patient-derived glioblastoma cells with low proteasome activity have
   higher frequency of tumor formation in mouse xenografts. These studies
   support proteasome function as a tool to investigate tumor-and
   metastasis-initiating cancer cells and a potential biomarker for
   outcomes in patients with several different cancers.}},

Title = {{The Relationship between Microbial Community Evenness and Function in
   Slow Sand Filters}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Two full-scale slow sand filters (SSFs) were sampled periodically from
   April until November 2011 to study the spatial and temporal structures
   of the bacterial communities found in the filters. To monitor global
   changes in the microbial communities, DNA from sand samples taken at
   different depths and locations within the SSFs and at different filters
   ages was used for Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, 15
   water quality parameters were monitored to assess filter performance,
   with functionally relevant microbial members being identified by using
   multivariate statistics. The bacterial diversity in the SSFs was found
   to be much larger than previously documented, with community composition
   being shaped by the characteristics of the SSFs (filter age and depth)
   and sampling characteristics (month, side, and distance from the
   influent and effluent pipes). We found that several key genera
   (Acidovorax, Halomonas, Sphingobium, and Sphingomonas) were associated
   with filter performance. In addition, at the whole-community level, a
   strong positive correlation was found between species evenness and
   filter performance. This study is the first to comprehensively
   characterize the microbial community of SSFs and link specific microbes
   to water quality parameters. In doing so, we reveal key patterns in
   microbial community structure that relate to overall community function.
   IMPORTANCE The supply of sustainable, energy-efficient, and safe
   drinking water to an increasing world population is a huge challenge
   faced by the water industry. SSFs have been used for hundreds of years
   to provide a safe and reliable source of potable drinking water, with
   minimal energy requirements. However, a lack of knowledge pertaining to
   the treatment mechanisms, particularly the biological processes,
   underpinning SSF operation has meant that SSFs are still operated as
   ``black boxes.{''} Understanding these dynamics alongside
   performance-induced effects associated with operational differences will
   promote optimized SSF design, maintenance, and operation, creating more
   efficient and environmentally sustainable filters. Through a
   spatial-temporal survey of full-scale SSFs at various points of
   operation, we present the most detailed characterization to date of the
   functional microbial communities found in SSFs, linking various taxa and
   community metrics to optimal water quality production.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel flight safety assessment and management
   augmentation to the flight management system designed to assist a flight
   crew in avoiding or recovering from impending loss-of-control
   situations. Nominally, this system serves as a passive monitor but, in
   high-risk situations, warnings and (ultimately) override actions are
   initiated to mitigate the high-risk situation. In this work, flight
   safety assessment and management is applied to the task of preserving
   safety during takeoff, which is one of the highest-risk phases of
   flight. Flight safety assessment and management is specified as a
   deterministic Moore machine that can ultimately be certified using
   existing software certification processes. To facilitate understanding
   and to reduce state-space complexity, flight safety assessment and
   management's state machines are split into longitudinal and
   lateral-directional submachines that identify and mitigate
   loss-of-control contributing factors associated with aircraft dynamics
   and control constraints. Case studies based on documented takeoff
   accidents are presented to evaluate flight safety assessment and
   management's ability to maintain safe flight in realistic
   loss-of-control scenarios. Results from these case studies illustrate
   that flight safety assessment and management could have averted the
   takeoff accidents that were considered. A discussion of other factors
   that must be considered before realizing a comprehensive flight safety
   assessment and management capability for takeoff is provided.}},

Abstract = {{In managing chronic diseases such as glaucoma, the timing of periodic
   examinations is crucial, as it may significantly impact patients'
   outcomes. We address the question of when to monitor a glaucoma patient
   by integrating a dynamic, stochastic state space system model of disease
   evolution with novel optimization approaches to predict the likelihood
   of progression at any future time. Information about each patient's
   disease state is learned sequentially through a series of noisy medical
   tests. This information is used to determine the best time to next test
   based on each patient's individual disease trajectory as well as
   population information. We develop closed-form solutions and study
   structural properties of our algorithm. While some have proposed that
   fixed-interval monitoring can be improved upon, our methodology
   validates a sophisticated model-based approach to doing so. Based on
   data from two large-scale, 10+ years clinical trials, we show that our
   methods significantly outperform fixed-interval schedules and age-based
   threshold policies by achieving greater accuracy of identifying
   progression with fewer examinations. Although this work is motivated by
   our collaboration with glaucoma specialists, the methodology developed
   is applicable to a variety of chronic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{While the importance of ecosystem functioning is undisputed in the
   context of climate change and Earth system modeling, the role of
   short-scale temporal variability of hydrometeorological forcing (similar
   to 1h) on the related ecosystem processes remains to be fully
   understood. Various impacts of meteorological forcing variability on
   water and carbon fluxes across a range of scales are explored here using
   numerical simulations. Synthetic meteorological drivers that highlight
   dynamic features of the short temporal scale in series of precipitation,
   temperature, and radiation are constructed. These drivers force a
   mechanistic ecohydrological model that propagates information content
   into the dynamics of water and carbon fluxes for an ensemble of
   representative ecosystems. The focus of the analysis is on a cross-scale
   effect of the short-scale forcing variability on the modeled
   evapotranspiration and ecosystem carbon assimilation. Interannual
   variability of water and carbon fluxes is emphasized in the analysis.
   The main study inferences are summarized as follows: (a) short-scale
   variability of meteorological input does affect water and carbon fluxes
   across a wide range of time scales, spanning from the hourly to the
   annual and longer scales; (b) different ecosystems respond to the
   various characteristics of the short-scale variability of the climate
   forcing in various ways, depending on dominant factors limiting system
   productivity; (c) whenever short-scale variability of meteorological
   forcing influences primarily fast processes such as photosynthesis, its
   impact on the slow-scale variability of water and carbon fluxes is
   small; and (d) whenever short-scale variability of the meteorological
   forcing impacts slow processes such as movement and storage of water in
   the soil, the effects of the variability can propagate to annual and
   longer time scales.}},

   carefully in order to improve the mechanical properties of the spot
   welds. The objectives of the present work are to characterize the
   resistance spot weldment of DP600 sheet steels. The mechanical
   properties of the welded joints were evaluated using tensile-shear and
   cross-tensile tests. The time-temperature evolution during the welding
   cycle was measured. The microstructures observed in different sites of
   the welds were correlated to thermal history recorded by thermocouples
   in the corresponding areas. It was found that cracks initiated in the
   periphery region of weld nuggets with a martensitic microstructure and a
   pull-out failure mode was observed. It was also concluded that tempering
   during RSW was the main reason for hardness decrease in HAZ.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The separation of oil-water mixtures is a widely utilized unit
   operation, used for handling a wide variety of mixtures from industry
   including: petroleum drilling and refining, fracking, waste-water
   treatment, mining, metal fabrication and machining, textile and leather
   processing, and rendering. Membrane-based methods have become
   increasingly attractive for the separation of oil-water mixtures because
   they are relatively energy-efficient, can be readily used to separate a
   variety of industrial feed streams, and provide consistent permeate
   quality. In this perspective, we discuss the design strategies for
   membranes with selective wettability i.e., membranes that are either
   selectively wet by, or prevent wetting by, the oil or water phase. The
   design strategies include the parameterization of two important physical
   characteristics: the surface porosity and the breakthrough pressure. We
   also discuss how they are related for membranes with a periodic
   geometry. On the basis of this understanding, we explore principles that
   allow for the systematic design of membranes with selective wettability.
   A review of the current literature on the separation of oil-water
   mixtures using membranes with differing wettabilities is also presented.
   Finally, we conclude by discussing the current challenges and outlook
   for the future of the field.}},

Abstract = {{The United States Navy has, in recent years, recognized a need to begin
   implementation of set-based design (SBD) practices throughout the ship
   design process (Sullivan, 2008; Kassel, Cooper, and Mackenna, 2010;
   Eccles 2010; Doerry, 2009). As recently as 2010, the Navy's goals for
   inclusion of SBD methods for early-stage ship design were outlined in a
   paper by Kassel, Cooper, and Mackenna, entitled, ``Rebuilding the NAVSEA
   Early Stage Ship Design Environment{''} (2010). Liker et al. have also
   discussed the need for the development of design tools to ``facilitate a
   proper exchange of information{''} (1996). The Liker et al. (1996) paper
   outlines a clear need for a SBD tool to aid in the facilitation of the
   SBD methodology.
   The need for a SBD application and/or software tool is driven by the
   requirement of set-based communications when facilitating SBD practices.
   In SBD, the exchange of information must occur by conveying sets of
   design solutions and design values. However, in post-secondary school,
   designers and engineers are typically taught to utilize a point-based
   design and communications approach (Dym et al., 2006; Mistree et al.,
   1990). The point-based design approach results in the conveyance of a
   single ``best{''} design solution and design values (Singer, Doerry, and
   Buckley, 2009; Sobek, Alle, and Liker, 1999). One of the effects of the
   long practiced point-based design approach is an inability for most
   engineers and designers to communicate in a set-based manner.
   Recognizing the need for a method of promoting set-based communications,
   an application has been developed that utilizes a hierarchical structure
   and a type-1 fuzzy logic system (FLS) to aid in the facilitation of
   set-based communications and design negotiations, with the overall goal
   of promoting SBD practices. The software has been successfully applied
   to perform set-based preliminary ship designs in the educational setting
   (Singer, 2003; Gray, 2011; McKenney et al., 2011). A version of the
   software was also utilized by the U.S. Navy during the set-based
   preliminary design of the new ship-to-shore connector (Doerry 2010).
   This paper discusses the overall structure of the set-based
   communications and negotiation (SBCN) software, the fuzzy logic
   methodology used in the system, design negotiations, and the system
   input and output data. The design results, which have shown the ability
   for the software to promote set-based communications and SBD principal
   practices, such as the gradual reduction of design value set-ranges,
   will also be covered.}},

Abstract = {{A cyber-physical system (CPS) is composed of tightly-integrated
   computation, communication and physical elements. Medical devices,
   buildings, mobile devices, robots, transportation and energy systems can
   benefit from CPS co-design and optimization techniques. Cyber-physical
   vehicle systems (CPVSs) are rapidly advancing due to progress in
   real-time computing, control and artificial intelligence.
   Multidisciplinary or multi-objective design optimization maximizes CPS
   efficiency, capability and safety, while online regulation enables the
   vehicle to be responsive to disturbances, modeling errors and
   uncertainties. CPVS optimization occurs at design-time and at run-time.
   This paper surveys the run-time cooperative optimization or
   co-optimization of cyber and physical systems, which have historically
   been considered separately. A run-time CPVS is also cooperatively
   regulated or co-regulated when cyber and physical resources are utilized
   in a manner that is responsive to both cyber and physical system
   requirements. This paper surveys research that considers both cyber and
   physical resources in co-optimization and co-regulation schemes with
   applications to mobile robotic and vehicle systems. Time-varying
   sampling patterns, sensor scheduling, anytime control, feedback
   scheduling, task and motion planning and resource sharing are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women, with mortality
   resulting from metastasis. Metastases are often detected once tumour
   cells affect the function of solid organs, with a high disease burden
   limiting effective treatment. Here we report a method for the early
   detection of metastasis using an implanted scaffold to recruit and
   capture metastatic cells in vivo, which achieves high cell densities and
   reduces the tumour burden within solid organs 10-fold. Recruitment is
   associated with infiltration of immune cells, which include
   Gr1(hi)CD11b(+) cells. We identify metastatic cells in the scaffold
   through a label-free detection system using inverse spectroscopic
   optical coherence tomography, which identifies changes to nanoscale
   tissue architecture associated with the presence of tumour cells. For
   patients at risk of recurrence, scaffold implantation following
   completion of primary therapy has the potential to identify metastatic
   disease at the earliest stage, enabling initiation of therapy while the
   disease burden is low.}},

Title = {{Dynamic kirigami structures for integrated solar tracking}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Optical tracking is often combined with conventional flat panel solar
   cells to maximize electrical power generation over the course of a day.
   However, conventional trackers are complex and often require costly and
   cumbersome structural components to support system weight. Here we use
   kirigami (the art of paper cutting) to realize novel solar cells where
   tracking is integral to the structure at the substrate level.
   Specifically, an elegant cut pattern is made in thin-film gallium
   arsenide solar cells, which are then stretched to produce an array of
   tilted surface elements which can be controlled to within +/- 1 degrees.
   We analyze the combined optical and mechanical properties of the
   tracking system, and demonstrate a mechanically robust system with
   optical tracking efficiencies matching conventional trackers. This
   design suggests a pathway towards enabling new applications for solar
   tracking, as well as inspiring a broader range of optoelectronic and
   mechanical devices.}},

Title = {{Electronic cooling via interlayer Coulomb coupling in multilayer
   epitaxial graphene}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In van der Waals bonded or rotationally disordered multilayer stacks of
   two-dimensional (2D) materials, the electronic states remain tightly
   confined within individual 2D layers. As a result, electron-phonon
   interactions occur primarily within layers and interlayer electrical
   conductivities are low. In addition, strong covalent in-plane intralayer
   bonding combined with weak van der Waals interlayer bonding results in
   weak phonon-mediated thermal coupling between the layers. We demonstrate
   here, however, that Coulomb interactions between electrons in different
   layers of multilayer epitaxial graphene provide an important mechanism
   for interlayer thermal transport, even though all electronic states are
   strongly confined within individual 2D layers. This effect is manifested
   in the relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in ultrafast time-resolved
   terahertz spectroscopy. We develop a theory of interlayer Coulomb
   coupling containing no free parameters that accounts for the
   experimentally observed trends in hot-carrier dynamics as temperature
   and the number of layers is varied.}},

Abstract = {{A series of thioether-functionalized silsesquioxanes (SQs) was
   synthesized by radically initiated thiol-ene reactions of vinyl
   T-10/T-12 SQ cages with a variety of commercially available thiols. The
   objectives of this study were to develop model reactions as the basis
   for using the vinyl T-10/12 compounds as novel crosslinking agents in
   the synthesis of new types of thiol-ene crosslinked polymers. A second
   motivation was to develop model compounds with controlled refractive
   indices and Abbe numbers as possibly modifiers of polymers used for a
   wide variety of optical and photonic applications. The reactions proceed
   under mild conditions over 24 h to give thioether SQs in high yields
   (>90\%) and high purity without complex workup. The ease of synthesis
   coupled with the wide variety and availability of functionalized thiols
   provides a simple route to elaborating and functionalizing vinyl SQ
   cages. In addition, the resulting compounds exhibit refractive indices
   to 1.52 coupled with Abbe numbers to 51 due to the uniquely high
   electron density provided by the incorporated sulfur atoms, making them
   ideal compounds for use with optically transparent materials. In
   addition, cured forms of these compounds provide methods of raising the
   Abbe number of epoxy resins designed to index match fiberglass with the
   intent of making transparent fiberglass reinforced composites. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The B(C6F5)(3) catalyzed Piers-Rubinsztajn (oxysilylation) reaction of
   the cubic symmetry Q-cage {[}(HMe2SiOSiO1.5)(8)] with ethoxysilanes in
   hexane forms microporous 3-D networks coincident with ethane evolution.
   Slow drying provides monoliths whereas fast drying provides powders. The
   reaction is most efficient if initiated at 60 degrees C for 5 min and
   then allowed to progress at ambient. The products offer high specific
   surface areas {[}SSAs > 700m(2)/g, e.g. with Si(OEt)(4)], with
   micropores of 0.6-2.0 nm, mesopores of 2-40 nm, total pore volumes
   approximate to 0.5 cc/g, and thermal stabilities to 320 degrees C.
   Changes in reaction conditions (times, solvent volumes, catalyst
   concentrations) do not significantly change product properties pointing
   to rapid and complete reaction as evidenced by the near absence of
   residual Si-H under all conditions for 1: 1: Si-H: Si-OEt ratios.
   RSi(OEt)(3) gives similar 3-D microporous gels. Smaller R groups give
   higher SSAs than those with large R groups; however, R = n-octyl is not
   porous. Rigid, bridged compounds {[}(EtO)(3)Si-R-Si(OEt)(3)] (R =
   phenyl, biphenyl) offer high SSAs whereas flexible bridges {[}R =
   (CH2)(2) (or 8)] give reduced SSAs. All materials were characterized by
   FTIR, TGA, XRD and BET. XRD studies show periodicities suggesting some
   long range ordering as might be expected for reactions with cubic
   symmetry Q(8) cages. However, the fast reaction rates likely generate
   kinetic rather than thermodynamic products that cannot be expected to
   exhibit high degrees of ordering. Gel affinities for specific organics
   were studied showing some preferential ability to absorb specific
   solvents for example the 1: 1 OHS:vinylSi(OEt)(3) gels were more
   selective for toluene than the 1: 1 OHS: TEOS gels. (C) 2015 The Ceramic

Abstract = {{MoS2 and other semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
   are of great interest due to their excellent physical properties and
   versatile chemistry. Although many recent research efforts have been
   directed to explore attractive properties associated with MoS2
   monolayers, multilayer/few-layer MoS2 structures are indeed demanded by
   many practical scale-up device applications, because multilayer
   structures can provide sizable electronic/photonic state densities for
   driving upscalable electrical/optical signals. Currently there is a lack
   of processes capable of producing ordered, pristine multilayer
   structures of MoS2 (or other relevant TMDCs) with manufacturing-grade
   uniformity of thicknesses and electronic/photonic properties. In this
   article, we present a nanoimprint-based approach toward addressing this
   challenge. In this approach, termed as nanoimprint-assisted shear
   exfoliation (NASE), a prepatterned bulk MoS2 stamp is pressed into a
   polymeric fixing layer, and the imprinted MoS2 features are exfoliated
   along a shear direction. This shear exfoliation can significantly
   enhance the exfoliation efficiency and thickness uniformity of
   exfoliated flakes in comparison with previously reported exfoliation
   processes. Furthermore, we have preliminarily demonstrated the
   fabrication of multiple transistors and biosensors exhibiting excellent
   device-to-device performance consistency. Finally, we present a
   molecular dynamics modeling analysis of the scaling behavior of NASE.
   This work holds significant potential to leverage the superior
   properties of MoS2 and other emerging TMDCs for practical scale-up
   device applications.}},

Abstract = {{Enzyme inhibitors are ubiquitous in all living systems, and their
   biological inhibitory activity is strongly dependent on their molecular
   shape. Here, we show that small zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO
   NPs)-pyramids, plates, and spheres possess the ability to inhibit
   activity of a typical enzyme P-galactosidase (GAL) in a biomimetic
   fashion. Enzyme inhibition by ZnO NPs is reversible and follows
   classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with parameters strongly dependent
   on their geometry. Diverse spectroscopic, biochemical, and computational
   experimental data indicate that association of GAL with specific ZnO-NP
   geometries interferes with conformational reorganization of the enzyme
   necessary for its catalytic activity. The strongest inhibition was
   observed for ZnO nanopyramids and compares favorably to that of the best
   natural GAL inhibitors while being resistant to proteases. Besides the
   fundamental significance of this biomimetic function of anisotropic NPs,
   their capacity to serve as degradation-resistant enzyme inhibitors is
   technologically attractive and is substantiated by strong shape-specific
   antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA), endemic for most hospitals in the world.}},

Abstract = {{Designing scaffolds that can mimic native skeletal muscle tissue and
   induce 3D cellular alignment and elongated myotube formation remains an
   ongoing challenge for skeletal muscle tissue engineering. Herein, we
   present a simple technique to generate core shell composite scaffolds
   for mimicking native skeletal muscle structure, which comprise the
   aligned nanofiber yarn (NFY) core and the photocurable hydrogel shell.
   The aligned NFYs are prepared by the hybrid composition including
   poly(caprolactone), silk fibroin, and polyaniline via a developed dry
   wet electrospinning method. A series of core shell column and sheet
   composite scaffolds are ultimately obtained by encapsulating a piece and
   layers of aligned NFY cores within the hydrogel shell after
   photo-cross-linking. C2C12 myoblasts are seeded within the core shell
   scaffolds, and the good biocompatibility of these scaffolds and their
   ability to induce 3D cellular alignment and elongation are successfully
   demonstrated. Furthermore, the 3D elongated myotube formation within
   core shell scaffolds is also performed after long-term cultivation.
   These data suggest that these core shell scaffolds combine the aligned
   NFY core that guides the myoblast alignment and differentiation and the
   hydrogel shell that provides a suitable 3D environment for nutrition
   exchange and mechanical protection to perform a great practical
   application for skeletal muscle regeneration.}},

Title = {{Removal of Residual Nuclei Following a Cavitation Event: A Parametric

Abstract = {{The efficacy of ultrasound therapies such as shock-wave lithotripsy and
   histotripsy can be compromised by residual cavitation bubble nuclei that
   persist following the collapse of primary cavitation. In our previous
   work, we have developed a unique strategy for mitigating the effects of
   these residual bubbles using low-amplitude ultrasound pulses to
   stimulate their aggregation and subsequent coalescence-effectively
   removing them from the field. Here, we further develop this bubble
   removal strategy through an investigation of the effect of frequency on
   the consolidation process. Bubble removal pulses ranging from 0.5 to 2
   MHz were used to sonicate the population of residual nuclei produced
   upon collapse of a histotripsy bubble cloud. For each frequency,
   mechanical index (MI) values ranging from 0 to approximately 1.5 were
   tested. Results indicated that, when evaluated as a function of bubble
   removal pulse MI, the efficacy of bubble removal shows markedly similar
   trends for all frequencies tested. This behavior divides into three
   distinct regimes (with provided cutoffs being approximate): 1) MI < 0.2:
   Minimal effect on the population of remanent cavitation nuclei; 2) 0.2 <
   MI < 1: Aggregation and subsequent coalescence of residual bubbles, the
   extent of which trends toward a maximum; and 3) MI > 1: Bubble
   coalescence is compromised as bubble removal pulses induce
   high-magnitude inertial cavitation of residual bubbles. The major
   distinction in these trends came for bubble removal pulses applied at 2
   MHz, which were observed to generate the most effective bubble
   coalescence of all frequencies tested. We hypothesize that this is a
   consequence of the secondary Bjerknes force being the major facilitator
   of the consolidation process, the magnitude of which increases when the
   bubble size distribution is far from resonance such that the phase
   difference of oscillation of individual bubbles is minimal.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, piezo-aeroelastic energy harvesting has received greater
   attention. In the present study, a piezo-aeroelastic energy harvester
   using a nonlinear trailing-edge flap is proposed, and its nonlinear
   aeroelastic behaviors are investigated. The energy harvester is modeled
   using a piezo-aeroelastic model of a two-dimensional typical section
   airfoil with a trailing-edge flap (TEF). A piezo-aeroelastic analysis is
   carried out using RL and time-integration methods, and the results are
   verified with the experimental data. The linearizing method using a
   describing function is used for the frequency domain analysis of the
   nonlinear piezo-aeroelastic system. From the linear and nonlinear
   piezo-aeroelastic analysis, the limit cycle oscillation (LCO)
   characteristics of the proposed energy harvester with the nonlinear TEF
   are investigated in both the frequency and time domains. Finally, the
   authors discuss the air speed range for effective piezo-aeroelastic

Abstract = {{The present work illustrates an example of shape memory alloys and fuzzy
   controllers applied to active angular control of a sectioned airfoil.
   The main objective of the proposed control system is to modify the
   camber line of an airfoil based on the relative rotation between the
   different sections of the profile, given a reference angle. The changes
   of the sectioned airfoil angle result from the contraction/expansion of
   the shape memory alloy caused by heating of the wire with an electric
   current that changes its temperature by the Joule effect. Considering
   the presence of plant's nonlinear effects, especially in the
   mathematical model of the alloy, this work proposes the application of a
   control system based on fuzzy logic theory. Through numerical and
   experimental tests, the performance of the fuzzy controller is compared
   with an on-off controller applied in an airfoil.}},

Title = {{Hexaarylbiimidazoles as visible light thiol-ene photoinitiators}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1075-1089}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of this study is to determine if
   hexaarylbiimidazoles (HABIs) are efficient, visible light-active
   photoinitiators for thiol-ene systems. We hypothesize that, owing to the
   reactivity of lophyl radicals with thiols and the necessarily high
   concentration of thiol in thiol-ene formulations, HABIs will effectively
   initiate thiol-ene polymerization upon visible light irradiation.
   Methods. UV-vis absorption spectra of photoinitiator solutions were
   obtained using UV-vis spectroscopy, while EPR spectroscopy was used to
   confirm radical species generation upon HABI photolysis. Functional
   group conversions during photopolymerization were monitored using FTIR
   spectroscopy, and thermomechanical properties were determined using
   dynamic mechanical analysis.
   Results. The HABI derivatives investigated exhibit less absorptivity
   than camphorquinone at 469 nm; however, they afford increased
   sensitivity at this wavelength when compared with
   bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide. Photolysis of the
   investigated HABIs affords lophyl radicals. Affixing hydroxyhexyl
   functional groups to the HABI core significantly improved solubility.
   Thiol-ene resins formulated with HABI photoinitiators polymerized
   rapidly upon irradiation with 469 nm. The glass transition temperatures
   of the thiol-ene resin formulated with a
   bis(hydroxyhexyl)-functionalized HABI and photopolymerized at room and
   body temperature were 49.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C and 52.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C,
   respectively.
   Significance. Although thiol-enes show promise as continuous phases for
   composite dental restorative materials, they show poor reactivity with
   the conventional camphorquinone/tertiary amine photoinitiation system.
   Conversely, despite their relatively low visible light absorptivity,
   HABI photoinitiators afford rapid thiol-ene photopolymerization rates.
   Moreover, minor structural modifications suggest pathways for improved
   HABI solubility and visible light absorption. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{Support vector regression (SVR) algorithms have been applied to the
   identification of many nonlinear dynamic systems due to their excellent
   approximation and generalization capability. However, the standard SVR
   algorithm involves an iterative optimization process, which is often
   computationally expensive and inefficient. For applications such as the
   battery state-of-health (SOH) monitoring, where the identification
   algorithm needs to be applied repeatedly for multiple cells because of
   the variation in model dynamics (due to battery aging and cell-to-cell
   difference), the computational burden could pose difficulties for
   real-time or onboard implementation. In this paper, the battery V -Q
   curve identification problem for SOH monitoring is studied. Based on
   experimental battery aging data, we develop a model parametrization and
   adaptation framework utilizing the simple structure of SVR
   representation with determined support vectors (SVs) so that the model
   parameters can be estimated in real time. Through mathematical analysis
   and simulations using a mechanistic battery aging model, it is shown
   that the SVs of the battery models stay invariant, even when the
   batteries age or vary. The invariance of the SVs is verified using
   experimental aging data. Consequently, the resulting model for the
   battery V -Q curve can be directly incorporated into the battery
   management system (BMS) and adapted online for SOH monitoring. Moreover,
   the general characteristics of the data that could maintain the SVR
   invariance are identified. The proposed automated model parametrization
   process (via an optimization algorithm) can be extended to nonlinear
   dynamic systems with the given properties.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the near future emissions legislations of SI (spark ignition)
   internal combustion engines, this paper presents an experimental study
   on the M-G DFSI (Methanol-Gasoline Dual-fuel Spark Ignition) combustion
   for reducing PN (particle number) emissions and improving fuel economy
   in a high compression ratio gasoline engine. M-G DFSI was operated using
   port-injection of a highly oxygenated, high latent heat and high octane
   number fuel to reduce PN emissions and improve fuel economy, direct
   injection of a high energy density and high volatility fuel to obtain
   fast load response and high load. The effects of the ratio of methanol
   to gasoline during DFSI at stoichiometric conditions on PN reduction and
   fuel economy improvement were investigated. As the proportion of
   PFI-Methanol increases, the absolute and relative BSFCequivalent
   improvement in terms of fuel economy will be extended almost linearly.
   Also, both the nucleation mode and accumulation mode of PN emissions
   drops dramatically. Furthermore, there is an optimal PFI-methanol mass
   fraction value to get sufficient fuel economy improvement and PN
   emissions reduction while reaching the peak performance. It can be shown
   that Methanol-Gasoline DFSI is a potential combustion strategy to reduce
   PN emissions effectively and significantly improve fuel economy in

Abstract = {{This paper described the use of photoelasticity and digital image
   analysis to determine horizontal stress (rh) and to estimate the lateral
   earth pressure coefficient at rest (K-o) in 2-dimensional particulate
   assemblies. Square 25.4 by 25.4mm (1.0 by 1.0 in.) glass plates with
   12.7mm (0.50 in.) circular holes at their centers served as the
   photoelastic force sensors. Digital image processing and analysis
   quantified the intensities of the light colors at key locations of high
   stress concentration in the loaded sensors. The light colors were
   separated into red, green, and blue (RGB) components. It was shown that
   the R-intensity was the most sensitive to the applied stress and thus
   was used to determine the induced stresses. Calibration charts between
   relative red intensities and applied stress were developed. The
   calibrated sensors were attached to the sidewalls of the test box so
   that horizontal stress in 2-dimensional particulate assemblies could be
   measured. The relative red intensities from the sensors at the sidewalls
   of the test box were converted to horizontal stress values from which Ko
   could be estimated. The results showed that quantified intensities of
   light colors can be used for estimating stress in experimental
   photoelasticity.}},

Abstract = {{In distributed power generation systems a pivotal role is played by
   DC-DC power converters that are employed to connect local loads to local
   power sources. These converters are used either in combinations of
   series/parallel connections or as stand-alone devices. A lot of work has
   taken place in the stability analysis of these converters and several
   methods have been used/proposed with different properties, strengths and
   weaknesses. Describing all existing methods is probably a never ending
   task and therefore in this tutorial paper four different methods will be
   presented by pointing out their main properties and explaining briefly
   how they can be used in applications that involve power converters. More
   specifically, the chosen methods are based on 1) the Poincare map, 2)
   Saltation matrix, 3) trajectory sensitivity, and 4)
   steady-state-response analysis of the discrete-time model. Simple case
   studies from previous publications are collected and presented in order
   to further explain these methodologies. Finally, this paper intents to
   describe some of the future challenges that exist in the area of
   stability analysis of power converters especially when these are
   employed in distributed generation applications.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of Gait Asymmetry Due to Push-Off Deficiency in Unilateral

Abstract = {{Unilateral lower-limb amputees exhibit asymmetry in many gait features,
   such as ground force, step time, step length, and joint mechanics.
   Although these asymmetries result from weak prosthetic-side push-off,
   there is no proven mechanistic explanation of how that impairment
   propagates to the rest of the body. We used a simple dynamic walking
   model to explore possible consequences of a unilateral impairment
   similar to that of a transtibial amputee. The model compensates for
   reduced push-off work from one leg by performing more work elsewhere,
   for example during the middle of stance by either or both legs. The
   model predicts several gait abnormalities, including slower forward
   velocity of the body center-of-mass during intact-side stance, greater
   energy dissipation in the intact side, and more positive work overall.
   We tested these predictions with data from unilateral transtibial
   amputees (N = 11) and nonamputee control subjects (N = 10) walking on an
   instrumented treadmill. We observed several predicted asymmetries,
   including forward velocity during stance phases and energy dissipation
   from the two limbs, as well as greater work overall. Secondary
   adaptations, such as to reduce discomfort, may exacerbate asymmetry, but
   these simple principles suggest that some asymmetry may be unavoidable
   in cases of unilateral limb loss.}},

Abstract = {{A series of transition metal carbide and nitride catalysts (MO2C, MO2N,
   W2C, W2N, VC, VN, NbC, and NbN) were prepared and evaluated for
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The activity trend was MO2C similar to W2C
   similar to VN similar to NbN > MO2N similar to W2N >> VC similar to NbC,
   with carbides and nitrides of the same parent metal exhibiting
   significantly different turnover frequencies (TOF). For example, the
   MO2C catalyst exhibited a TOF of 0.36 S-1 at 300 degrees C whereas the
   TOF for the MO2N catalyst was 0.04 s(-1). The carbides and nitrides
   favored light hydrocarbons (C-1-C-4) exhibiting alpha values between
   0.31 and 0.43 at 290 degrees C, and were active for the water-gas shift
   reaction. Results from temperature programmed desorption and reaction
   indicated that both the MO2N and MO2C catalysts are capable of direct
   (without Hy assistance) CO dissociation; however, the activation barrier
   is much higher over MO2N than MO2C. The results also indicate that C-C
   coupling over the MO2C surface was facilitated by molecularly adsorbed
   CO (without Hy pre-adsorption), suggesting the primary pathway to C2+
   hydrocarbons was through the oxygenate mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Alternative splicing allows a single gene to produce multiple
   transcript-level splice isoforms from which the translated proteins may
   show differences in their expression and function. Identifying the major
   functional or canonical isoform is important for understanding gene and
   protein functions. Identification and characterization of splice
   isoforms is a stated goal of the HUPO Human Proteome Project and of
   neXtProt. Multiple efforts have catalogued splice isoforms as
   ``dominant{''}, ``principal{''}, or ``major{''} isoforms based on
   expression or evolutionary traits. In contrast, we recently proposed
   highest connected isoforms (HCIs) as a new class of canonical isoforms
   that have the strongest interactions in a functional network and
   revealed their significantly higher (differential) transcript-level
   expression compared to nonhighest connected isoforms (NCIs) regardless
   of tissues/cell lines in the mouse. HCIs and their expression behavior
   in the human remain unexplored. Here we identified HCIs for 6157
   multi-isoform genes using a human isoforrn network that we constructed
   by integrating a large compendium of heterogeneous genomic data. We
   present examples for pairs of transcript isoforms of ABCC3, RBM34,
   ERBB2, and ANXA7. We found that functional networks of isoforms of the
   same gene can show large differences. Interestingly, differential
   expression between HCIs and NCIs was also observed in the human on an
   independent set of 940 RNA-seq samples across multiple tissues,
   including heart, kidney, and liver. Using proteomic data from normal
   human retina and placenta, we showed that HCIs are a promising indicator
   of expressed protein isoforms exemplified by NUDPB6 and M6PR.
   Furthermore, we found that a significant percentage (20\%, p = 0.0003)
   of human and mouse HCIs are homologues, suggesting their conservation
   between species. Our identified HCIs expand the repertoire of canonical
   isoforms and are expected to facilitate studying main protein products,
   understanding gene regulation, and possibly evolution. The network is
   available through our web server as a rich resource for investigating
   isoform functional relationships
   (http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/hisonet). All MS/MS data were
   available at ProteomeXchange Web site (http://www.proteomexchange.org)

Abstract = {{We have developed the web-based Michigan Proteome Visualization Tool
   (MI-PVT) to visualize and compare protein expression and isoform-level
   function across human chromosomes and tissues
   (http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/mipvt). As proof of principle, we
   have populated the tool with Human Proteome Map (HPM) data. We were able
   to observe many biologically interesting features. From the vantage
   point of our chromosome 17 team, for example, we found more than 300
   proteins from chromosome 17 expressed in each of the 30 tissues and cell
   types studied, with the highest number of expressed proteins being 685
   in testis. Comparisons of expression levels across tissues showed low
   numbers of proteins expressed in esophagus, but esophagus had 12
   cytoskeletal proteins coded on chromosome 17 with very high expression
   (>1000 spectral counts). This customized MI-PVT should be helpful for
   biologists to browse and study specific proteins and protein data sets
   across tissues and chromosomes. Users can upload any data of interest in
   MI-PVT for visualization. Our aim is to integrate extensive
   mass-spectrometric proteomic data into the tool to facilitate finding
   chromosome-centric protein expression and correlation across tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Sequentially drilling multiple holes in bone is used clinically for
   surface preparation to aid in fusion of a joint, typically under
   non-irrigated conditions. Drilling induces a significant amount of heat
   and accumulates after multiple passes, which can result in thermal
   osteonecrosis and various complications. To understand the heat
   propagation over time, a 3D finite element model was developed to
   simulate sequential bone drilling. By incorporating proper material
   properties and a modified bone necrosis criteria, this model can
   visualize the propagation of damaged areas. For this study, comparisons
   between a 2.0 mm Kirschner wire and 2.0 mm twist drill were conducted
   with their heat sources determined using an inverse method and
   experimentally measured bone temperatures. Three clinically viable
   solutions to reduce thermally-induced bone damage were evaluated using
   finite element analysis, including tool selection, time interval between
   passes, and different drilling sequences. Results show that the ideal
   solution would be using twist drills rather than Kirschner wires if the
   situation allows. A shorter time interval between passes was also found
   to be beneficial as it reduces the total heat exposure time. Lastly,
   optimizing the drilling sequence reduced the thermal damage of bone, but
   the effect may be limited. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
   using the proposed model to study clinical issues and find potential
   solutions prior to clinical trials. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nuclear criticality safety analysis using computational methods such as
   a Monte Carlo method must establish, for a defined area of
   applicability, an upper subcritical limit (USL), which is a calculated
   multiplication factor k that can be treated as actually subcritical and
   is derived from a calculational margin (combination of bias and bias
   uncertainty) and a margin of subcriticality. Whisper, a nonparametric,
   extreme-value method based on sensitivity/uncertainty techniques and the
   associated software are presented. Whisper uses benchmark critical
   experiments, nuclear data sensitivities from the continuous-energy Monte
   Carlo transport software MCNP, and nuclear covariance data to set a
   baseline USL. Comparisons with a traditional parametric approach for
   validation, which requires benchmark data to be normally distributed,
   show that Whisper typically obtains similar or more conservative
   calculational margins; comparisons with a rank-order nonparametric
   approach show that Whisper obtains less stringent cakulational margins.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-81}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Monte Carlo particle transport codes used to model detector responses
   are traditionally run in analog mode. However, analog simulations of
   cross-correlation measurements are extremely time-consuming because the
   probability of coincident detection is small, approximately equal to the
   product of the probabilities of a single detection in each detector. The
   new implicit correlation method described here increases the number of
   correlated event scores, thereby reducing variance and required
   computation times. The cost of the implicit correlation method is
   comparable to the cost of simulating single-event detection for the
   lowest absolute detector efficiency in the problem. The new method is
   especially useful in the nuclear nonproliferation and safeguards fields
   for simulating correlation measurements of shielded special nuclear
   material.
   The new method was implemented in MCNPX-PoliMi for neutron-neutron
   cross-correlations with a Cf-252 spontaneous fission source measured by
   14 detectors at various angles. The method demonstrated good agreement
   with analog simulation and reference measurement results. Small
   differences between nonanalog and analog cross-correlation distributions
   are attributed to discretization errors that are often not present in
   practical applications. Improvement in the figure of merit was greater
   than a factor of 100 in all tested cases.}},

Title = {{Effects of soy-based oils on the tensile behavior of EPDM rubber}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The effects of soy-based oil on the constitutive behavior of EPDM rubber
   have been investigated. Soy polyols with various hydroxyl numbers as
   well as unmodified soybean oil have each been incorporated in the EPDM
   rubber as a partial replacement for petroleum oil. Tensile tests have
   been performed at low and high rates, and hysteresis and stress
   relaxation tests have been performed at low rates. It has been found
   from the tensile tests that the rubber with soy polyol of low hydroxyl
   number can provide very similar constitutive characteristics as the
   control. On the other hand, the constitutive characteristics are
   significantly changed by using soy polyol of high hydroxyl number or
   unmodified soybean oil. For example, the rubber with unmodified soybean
   oil elongates substantially up to stretch ratios of 13, which is
   approximately 100\% greater than that of the control. It has also been
   found from the tensile and hysteresis tests that the soy-based rubbers
   generally have better energy storing and dissipation characteristics
   than the control, such as storing more energy while maintaining lower
   peak stress, for an impact application. The test results indicate the
   potential for application based tuning of soy rubber properties by
   selecting an appropriate soy oil/EPDM blend or a polyol/EPDM blend with
   optimized functionality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Collaboration}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Heterogeneous computing on CPUs and GPUs has traditionally used fixed
   roles for each device: the GPU handles data parallel work by taking
   advantage of its massive number of cores while the CPU handles non
   data-parallel work, such as the sequential code or data transfer
   management. This work distribution can be a poor solution as it
   underutilizes the CPU, has difficulty generalizing beyond the single
   CPU-GPU combination, and may waste a large fraction of time transferring
   data. Further, CPUs are performance competitive with GPUs on many
   workloads, thus simply partitioning work based on the fixed roles may be
   a poor choice. In this article, we present the single-kernel multiple
   devices (SKMD) system, a framework that transparently orchestrates
   collaborative execution of a single data-parallel kernel across multiple
   asymmetric CPUs and GPUs. The programmer is responsible for developing a
   single data-parallel kernel in OpenCL, while the system automatically
   partitions the workload across an arbitrary set of devices, generates
   kernels to execute the partial workloads, and efficiently merges the
   partial outputs together. The goal is performance improvement by
   maximally utilizing all available resources to execute the kernel. SKMD
   handles the difficult challenges of exposed data transfer costs and the
   performance variations GPUs have with respect to input size. On real
   hardware, SKMD achieves an average speedup of 28\% on a system with one
   multicore CPU and two asymmetric GPUs compared to a fastest device
   execution strategy for a set of popular OpenCL kernels.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demands on safety, emission and fuel consumption require
   more accurate control models of micro internal combustion swing engine
   (MICSE). The objective of this paper is to investigate the constant
   speed control models of four-stroke MICSE. The operation principle of
   the four-stroke MICSE is presented based on the description of MICSE
   prototype. A two-level Petri net based hybrid model is proposed to model
   the four-stroke MICSE engine cycle. The Petri net subsystem at the upper
   level controls and synchronizes the four Petri net subsystems at the
   lower level. The continuous sub-models, including breathing dynamics of
   intake manifold, thermodynamics of the chamber and dynamics of the
   torque generation, are investigated and integrated with the discrete
   model in MATLAB Simulink. Through the comparison of experimental data
   and simulated DC voltage output, it is demonstrated that the hybrid
   model is valid for the four-stroke MICSE system. A nonlinear model is
   obtained from the cycle average data via the regression method, and it
   is linearized around a given nominal equilibrium point for the
   controller design. The feedback controller of the spark timing and valve
   duration timing is designed with a sequential loop closing design
   approach. The simulation of the sequential loop closure control design
   applied to the hybrid model is implemented in MATLAB. The simulation
   results show that the system is able to reach its desired operating
   point within 0.2 s, and the designed controller shows good MICSE engine
   performance with a constant speed. This paper presents the constant
   speed control models of four-stroke MICSE and carries out the simulation
   tests, the models and the simulation results can be used for further
   study on the precision control of four-stroke MICSE.}},

   removal are energy- and chemical-intensive and are not appropriate for
   application to anaerobic effluents. Innovative, energy efficient
   nitrogen removal processes are being developed and involve several novel
   chemotrophic processes. This review provides information about these
   processes, identifies how to control and retain the most desirable
   microorganisms, and considers the impact of reactor configuration on
   performance. Given the complexity of the technologies under development
   that remove nitrogen from anaerobically treated domestic wastewater, we
   conclude that computational models can support their development and
   that sensor-mediated controls are essential to achieving energy
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study examines the analytic validity of a software tool
   designed to provide individuals with risk assessments for colorectal
   cancer based on personal health and family history information. The
   software is compatible with the US Surgeon General's My Family Health
   Portrait (MFHP).
   Methods: An algorithm for risk assessment was created using accepted
   colorectal risk assessment guidelines and programmed into a software
   tool (MFHP). Risk assessments derived from 150 pedigrees using the MFHP
   tool were compared with ``gold standard{''} risk assessments developed
   by three expert cancer genetic counselors.
   Results: Genetic counselor risk assessments showed substantial, but not
   perfect, agreement. MFHP risk assessments for colorectal cancer yielded
   a sensitivity for colorectal cancer risk of 81\% (95\% confidence
   interval: 54-96\%) and specificity of 90\% (95\% confidence interval:
   83-94\%), as compared with genetic counselor pedigree review. The
   positive predictive value for risk for MFHP was 48\% (95\% confidence
   interval: 29-68\%), whereas the negative predictive value was 98\% (95\%
   confidence interval: 93-99\%). Agreement between MFHP and genetic
   counselor pedigree review was moderate (kappa = 0.54).
   Conclusion: The analytic validity of the MFHP colorectal cancer risk
   assessment software is similar to those of other types of screening
   tools used in primary care. Future investigations should explore the
   clinical validity and utility of the software in diverse population
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a
   computational model of the automation complacency effect, as operators
   work on a robotic arm task, supported by three different degrees of
   automation.
   Background: Some computational models of complacency in human-automation
   interaction exist, but those are formed and validated within the context
   of fairly simplified monitoring failures. This research extends model
   validation to a much more complex task, so that system designers can
   establish, without need for human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimentation,
   merits and shortcomings of different automation degrees.
   Method: We developed a realistic simulation of a space-based robotic arm
   task that could be carried out with three different levels of trajectory
   visualization and execution automation support. Using this simulation,
   we performed HITL testing. Complacency was induced via several trials of
   correctly performing automation and then was assessed on trials when
   automation failed. Following a cognitive task analysis of the robotic
   arm operation, we developed a multicomponent model of the robotic
   operator and his or her reliance on automation, based in part on visual
   scanning.
   Results: The comparison of model predictions with empirical results
   revealed that the model accurately predicted routine performance and
   predicted the responses to these failures after complacency developed.
   However, the scanning models do not account for the entire attention
   allocation effects of complacency.
   Applications: Complacency modeling can provide a useful tool for
   predicting the effects of different types of imperfect automation. The
   results from this research suggest that focus should be given to
   supporting situation awareness in automation development.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse systems are usually parameterized by a tuning parameter that
   determines the sparsity of the system. How to choose the right tuning
   parameter is a fundamental and difficult problem in learning the sparse
   system. In this paper, by treating the the tuning parameter as an
   additional dimension, persistent homological structures over the
   parameter space is introduced and explored. The structures are then
   further exploited in drastically speeding up the computation using the
   proposed soft-thresholding technique. The topological structures are
   further used as multivariate features in the tensor-based morphometry
   (TBM) in characterizing white matter alterations in children who have
   experienced severe early life stress and maltreatment. These analyses
   reveal that stress-exposed children exhibit more diffuse anatomical
   organization across the whole white matter region.}},

Abstract = {{In the case of mega-structures such as tall buildings and long-span
   bridges, the mitigation of the intensity of the wind excitation through
   aerodynamic tailoring of the external shape can be fundamental for
   meeting the performance goals. The search for the best performing shape
   through an automatic CFD-enabled optimization methodology is potentially
   less expensive, less time-consuming and more thorough than the common
   trial-and-error approach based on wind tunnel test results, therefore
   very attractive. This paper investigates the possibility of carrying out
   the multi-objective aerodynamic shape optimization of civil structures
   through an approach in which evolutionary algorithms are used in synergy
   with ordinary Kriging surrogates. A specifically developed strategy is
   adopted to update the Kriging models making efficient use of additional
   CFD runs. Shell scripting, parallelized computations and mesh morphing
   algorithms are exploited for enhancing the framework's efficiency and
   consistency. As a case study, the optimization of the shape of a tall
   building cross-section in terms of both the lift and the drag
   coefficient is considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The induction of donor-specific tolerance to transplanted cells and
   organs, while preserving immune function as a whole, remains a highly
   sought after and elusive strategy for overcoming transplant rejection.
   Tolerance necessitates modulating a diverse array of cell types that
   recognize and respond to alloantigens, including antigen presenting
   cells and T lymphocytes. Nanotherapeutic strategies that employ cellular
   and biomaterial engineering represent an emerging technology geared
   towards the goal of inducing transplant tolerance. Nanocarriers offer a
   platform for delivering antigens of interest to specific cell types in
   order to achieve tolerogenic antigen presentation. Furthermore, the
   technologies also provide an opportunity for local immunomodulation at
   the graft site. Nanocarriers delivering a combination of antigens and
   immunomodulating agents, such as rapamycin, provide a unique technology
   platform with the potential to enhance outcomes for the induction of
   transplant tolerance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-sensor addressing method for fiber Bragg grating aided fiber
   loop ringdown (FBG-FLRD) sensor array is proposed. It is capable of
   simultaneous measurement of temperature and force. Light from a
   wavelength-swept fiber laser (WSFL) is modulated into pulsed light to
   illuminate FBG-FLRD sensor array. Based on the time sequence of pulsed
   lights reflected by fiber Bragg grating array, each FBG-FLRD sensor can
   be distinguished. The time interval between the trigger signal of the
   WSFL and the pulsed light reflected by FBG offers temperature variation
   information. By measuring the ringdown time of each FBG-FLRD, the loss
   of fiber ring induced by temperature and force can be obtained. And then
   simultaneous measurement can be implemented in real time. To prove the
   validity of the proposed system, a six elements array is experimentally
   validated with interrogation frequency of 27.5 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Skull fracture is one of the most common pediatric traumas. However,
   injury assessment tools for predicting pediatric skull fracture risk is
   not well established mainly due to the lack of cadaver tests. Weber
   conducted 50 pediatric cadaver drop tests for forensic research on child
   abuse in the mid-1980s (Experimental studies of skull fractures in
   infants, Z Rechtsmed. 92: 87-94, 1984; Biomechanical fragility of the
   infant skull, Z Rechtsmed. 94: 93-101, 1985). To our knowledge, these
   studies contained the largest sample size among pediatric cadaver tests
   in the literature. However, the lack of injury measurements limited
   their direct application in investigating pediatric skull fracture
   risks. In this study, 50 pediatric cadaver tests from Weber's studies
   were reconstructed using a parametric pediatric head finite element (FE)
   model which were morphed into subjects with ages, head sizes/shapes, and
   skull thickness values that reported in the tests. The skull fracture
   risk curves for infants from 0 to 9 months old were developed based on
   the model-predicted head injury measures through logistic regression
   analysis. It was found that the model-predicted stress responses in the
   skull (maximal von Mises stress, maximal shear stress, and maximal first
   principal stress) were better predictors than global kinematic-based
   injury measures (peak head acceleration and head injury criterion (HIC))
   in predicting pediatric skull fracture. This study demonstrated the
   feasibility of using age- and size/shape-appropriate head FE models to
   predict pediatric head injuries. Such models can account for the
   morphological variations among the subjects, which cannot be considered
   by a single FE human model.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeThis work combines an n-dimensional fat sat(uration)
   radiofrequency (RF) pulse with steady-state incoherent (SSI) pulse
   sequences, e.g., spoiled gradient-echo sequence, to simultaneously
   produce B-0 insensitive fat suppression and magnetization transfer (MT)
   contrast. This pulse is then referred to as fat sat and MT contrast
   pulse.
   TheoryWe discuss the features of the fat sat and MT contrast pulse and
   the MT sensitivities of the SSI sequences when combining with fat sat.
   Moreover, we also introduce an adapted RF spoiling scheme for SSI
   sequences with fat sat. Methods: Simulations and phantom experiments
   were conducted to demonstrate the adapted RF spoiling. Fat suppression
   and MT effects are shown in 3T phantom experiments and in vivo
   experiments, including brain imaging, cartilage imaging, and
   angiography.
   ResultsTo ensure that the sequence reaches steady state, the adapted RF
   spoiling is required for fat sat SSI sequences. Fat sat and MT contrast
   pulse works robustly with field inhomogeneity and also produces MT
   contrasts.
   ConclusionSSI sequences with fat sat and MT contrast pulse and adapted
   RF spoiling can robustly produce fat suppressed and MT contrast images
   in the presence of field inhomogeneity. Magn Reson Med 74:739-746, 2015.

Abstract = {{Poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) is a biocompatible polymer that has mechanical
   properties suitable for bone tissue engineering; however, it must be
   integrated with biologics to stimulate bone formation. Bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) delivered from PCL produces bone when
   implanted subcutaneously, and erythropoietin (EPO) works synergistically
   with BMP2. In this study, EPO and BMP2 are adsorbed separately on two
   3D-printed PCL scaffold modules that are assembled for codelivery on a
   single scaffold structure. This assembled modular PCL scaffold with dual
   BMP2 and EPO delivery was shown to increase bone growth in an ectopic
   location when compared with BMP2 delivery along a replicate scaffold
   structure. EPO (200 IU/mL) and BMP2 (65 mu g/mL) were adsorbed onto the
   outer and inner portions of a modular scaffold, respectively. Protein
   binding and release studies were first quantified. Subsequently,
   EPO+BMP2 and BMP2 scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in mice for 4
   and 8 weeks, and the regenerated bone was analyzed with microcomputed
   tomography and histology; 8.6 +/- 1.4 mu g BMP2 (22\%) and 140 +/- 29 IU
   EPO (69.8\%) bound to the scaffold and <1\% BMP2 and 83\% EPO was
   released in 7 days. Increased endothelial cell proliferation on
   EPO-adsorbed PCL discs indicated protein bioactivity. At 4 and 8 weeks,
   dual BMP2 and EPO delivery regenerated more bone (5.1 +/- 1.1 and 5.5
   +/- 1.6 mm(3)) than BMP2 alone (3.8 +/- 1.1 and 4.3 +/- 1.7 mm(3)). BMP2
   and EPO scaffolds had more ingrowth (1.4\%+/- 0.6\%) in the outer module
   when compared with BMP2 (0.8\%+/- 0.3\%) at 4 weeks. Dual delivery
   produced more dense cellular marrow, while BMP2 had more fatty marrow.
   Dual EPO and BMP2 delivery is a potential method to regenerate bone
   faster for prefabricated flaps.}},

Abstract = {{Machine tool design starts with the determination of performance
   specifications. Precision of the NC axes is an important aspect of
   machine tool design. Conventionally, the precision specification of
   machine tools is empirically determined, resulting in poor designs with
   insufficient or excessive precision. To provide a cost-effective
   precision specification for complex machine tools, such as gear cutting
   machines, an active precision design approach is proposed to generate
   the specification of the positioning repeatability of NC axes to meet
   the designated working precision requirements of the machine tools. The
   methodology consists of error analysis and precision design in four
   steps: (1) workpiece surface formation modeling in terms of the motion
   axes and layout of the machine tool, and the generating principle of
   workpiece features; (2) workpiece machining error modeling based on the
   workpiece surface formation model by considering kinematic errors of the
   NC axes of the machine tool; (3) workpiece machining precision modeling
   via the machining error model; and (4) precision allocation according to
   the required workpiece precision and the machining error model. The
   methodology is demonstrated and validated through a case study of
   precision design for a six-axis CNC spiral bevel gear milling machine.}},

Abstract = {{Mass sensing using the onset and crossing of a dynamic bifurcation of a
   micromechanical system has been shown to reduce the mass threshold which
   may be detected and exhibited improved robustness to damping and noise
   compared to traditional tracking of resonant frequency shift. Previous
   investigations demonstrated that mass measurement over time via actively
   controlled strategies or explored passively operated threshold-type
   methods to indicate a pre-determined mass was adsorbed. Recently, an
   alternative idea integrating aspect of frequency shift- and
   bifurcation-based mass sensors and methods was proposed, providing
   initial illustration of a noteworthy ability to passively quantify
   progressive mass adsorption due to sequentially activated bifurcations.
   To advance the state of the art, this research provides a thorough
   investigation of this new sensing concept in terms of its dynamic
   characteristics and devises guidelines for effective, reliable
   operations. The conceptual foundation of the sensing method and an
   experimentally validated sensor model are reviewed. The results of
   numerous simulated operational trials and parametric investigations are
   detailed to reach important conclusions on sensor operations and
   versatility, and to uncover the influences of key operational conditions
   upon detection metrics. Finally, suitable microscale sensor
   architectures and fabrications are described to exemplify the
   flexibility of successfully realizing the mass sensing strategy.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1943-1951}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A sensing estimation scheme is presented that combines analog and
   threshold sensing on a piezoelectric microactuator for calibration of
   microscale inertial sensors. Using a variation of the Kalman filter, an
   asynchronous threshold sensor improves state estimates obtained from
   less reliable analog sensor measurements of microactuator motion. The
   resulting velocity estimates are compared with estimates without
   threshold sensing, and related to feasible calibration performance for
   gyroscopes. Results show that incorporating threshold sensors in a
   projected low-noise environment based on capacitive sensing will produce
   high-accuracy velocity measurements at certain fixed angles, with an
   approximately 80\% reduction in angular velocity estimation error.
   Experimental testing with noisier, more variable piezoelectric sensing
   shows improved estimation accuracy at all velocities and positions when
   threshold detections are added. In simulation, the addition of feedback
   control is shown to further improve estimation accuracy.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{779}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Convection in a horizontal duct aligned with a uniform magnetic field is
   analysed computationally. The motivation of the study is the concept of
   a liquid metal blanket for a tokamak fusion reactor, in which ducts are
   oriented toroidally, i.e. parallel to the main component of the magnetic
   field. Computations of two-dimensional (streamwise-uniform) flows
   appearing at very strong magnetic fields and of three-dimensional flows
   in long domains are conducted. Non-uniform volumetric internal heating
   is applied, while the walls are maintained at a constant temperature.
   Two-dimensional or nearly two-dimensional turbulent convection is found
   at high Grashof and Hartmann numbers typical for fusion reactor
   conditions. The turbulence results in stronger mixing and more uniform
   distribution of wall heat flux, indicating promising potential of this
   concept of the blanket.}},

Abstract = {{Production of type I collagen declines during aging, leading to skin
   thinning and impaired function. Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) is a
   pleiotropic lipid mediator that is synthesized from arachidonic acid by
   the sequential actions of cyclooxygenases (COX) and PGE synthases
   (PTGES). PGE(2) inhibits collagen production by fibroblasts in vitro. We
   report that PTGES1 and COX2 progressively increase with aging in
   sun-protected human skin. PTGES1 and COX2 mRNA were increased 3.4-fold
   and 2.7-fold, respectively, in the dermis of elderly (>80 years) versus
   young (21-30 years) individuals. Fibroblasts were the major cell source
   of both enzymes. PGE(2) levels were increased 70\% in elderly skin.
   Fibroblasts in aged skin display reduced spreading due to collagen
   fibril fragmentation. To investigate the relationship between spreading
   and PGE(2) synthesis, fibroblasts were cultured on micropost arrays or
   hydrogels of varying mechanical compliance. Reduced spreading/mechanical
   force resulted in increased expression of both PTGES1 and COX2 and
   elevated levels of PGE(2). Inhibition of PGE(2) synthesis by diclofenac
   enhanced collagen production in skin organ cultures. These data suggest
   that reduced spreading/mechanical force of fibroblasts in aged skin
   elevates PGE(2) production, contributing to reduced collagen production.
   Inhibition of PGE(2) production may be therapeutically beneficial for
   combating age-associated collagen deficit in human skin.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane biofilm development was evaluated to improve psychrophilic (15
   degrees C) anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treatment of domestic
   wastewater. An AnMBR containing three replicate submerged membrane
   housings with separate permeate collection was operated at three levels
   of membrane fouling by independently controlling biogas sparging for
   each membrane unit. High membrane fouling significantly improved
   permeate quality, but resulted in dissolved methane in the permeate at a
   concentration two to three times the equilibrium concentration predicted
   by Henry's law. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA targeting Bacteria and
   Archaea and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   targeting the methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) gene in methanogens
   indicated that the membrane biofilm was enriched in highly active
   methanogens and syntrophic bacteria. Restoring fouled membranes to a
   transmembrane pressure (TMP) near zero by increasing biogas sparging did
   not disrupt the biofilm's treatment performance, suggesting that
   microbes in the foulant layer were tightly adhered and did not
   significantly contribute to TMP. Dissolved methane oversaturation
   persisted without high TMP, implying that methanogenesis in the biofilm,
   rather than high TMP, was the primary driving force in methane
   oversaturation. The results describe an attractive operational strategy
   to improve treatment performance in low-temperature AnMBR by supporting
   syntrophy and methanogenesis in the membrane biofilm through controlled
   membrane fouling.}},

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to compute thermomechanical
   properties of cured epoxy resins reinforced with pristine and covalently
   functionalized carbon nanotubes. A DGEBA-DDS epoxy network was built
   using the `dendrimer' growth approach where 75\% of available epoxy
   sites were cross-linked. The epoxy model is verified through comparisons
   to experiments, and simulations are performed on nanotube reinforced
   cross-linked epoxy matrix using the CVFF force field in LAMMPS. Full
   stiffness matrices and linear coefficient of thermal expansion vectors
   are obtained for the nanocomposite. Large increases in stiffness and
   large decreases in thermal expansion were seen along the direction of
   the nanotube for both nanocomposite systems when compared to neat epoxy.
   The direction transverse to nanotube saw a 40\% increase in stiffness
   due to covalent functionalization over neat epoxy at 1 K whereas the
   pristine nanotube system only saw a 7\% increase due to van der Waals
   effects. The functionalized SWNT/epoxy nanocomposite showed an
   additional 42\% decrease in thermal expansion along the nanotube
   direction when compared to the pristine SWNT/epoxy nanocomposite. The
   stiffness matrices are rotated over every possible orientation to
   simulate the effects of an isotropic system of randomly oriented
   nanotubes in the epoxy. The randomly oriented covalently functionalized
   SWNT/Epoxy nanocomposites showed substantial improvements over the plain
   epoxy in terms of higher stiffness (200\% increase) and lower thermal
   expansion (32\% reduction). Through MD simulations, we develop means to
   build simulation cells, perform annealing to reach correct densities,
   compute thermomechanical properties and compare with experiments.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of BM-1197, a new potent
   and highly specific small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L), in
   preclinical models of human adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).
   Methods: Low passage primary human adenoid cystic carcinoma cells
   (UM-HACC-2A,-2B,-5,-6) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models
   (UM-PDX-HACC) were developed from surgical specimens obtained from 4
   patients. The effect of BM-1197 on cell viability and cell cycle were
   evaluated in vitro using this panel of low passage ACC cells. The effect
   of BM-1197 on tumor growth, recurrence and tumor cell apoptosis in vivo
   was evaluated with the PDX model of ACC (UM-PDX-HACC-5).
   Results: Exposure of low passage primary human ACC cells to BM-1197
   mediated an IC50 of 0.92-2.82 mu M. This correlated with an increase in
   the fraction of apoptotic cells (p < 0.0001) and an increase in
   caspase-3 activity (p < 0.0001), but no noticeable differences in cell
   cycle (p > 0.05). In vivo, BM-1197 inhibited tumor growth (p = 0.0256)
   and induced tumor cell apoptosis (p = 0.0165) without causing
   significant systemic toxicities, as determined by mouse weight over
   time. Surprisingly, weekly BM-1197 decreased the incidence of tumor
   recurrence (p = 0.0297), as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrated that single agent BM-1197 induces
   apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in preclinical models of adenoid
   cystic carcinoma. Notably, single agent BM-1197 inhibited tumor
   recurrence, which is considered a major clinical challenge in the
   clinical management of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Collectively, these
   results suggest that patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma might
   benefit from therapy with a BH3-mimetic small molecule. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background. Distraction enterogenesis may provide a novel therapy for
   short bowel syndrome. Previously described methods have relied on
   isolated intestinal segments or transmural fixation because of
   ineffective endoluminal attachment. We hypothesized that a novel
   approach of geometric coupling between a tapering device and the
   mesenteric curvature would allow trans-stomal distraction enterogenesis.
   Methods. A catheter device was designed with tapering stiffness,
   consisting of a stiff catheter with a taper to a flexible latex tip to
   prevent perforation. Yorkshire pigs underwent creation of a jejunal Roux
   limb with device placed via jejunostomy. Intestinal attachment was
   achieved without a substantial decrease in bowel perfusion as measured
   by laser Doppler. An external clamp was secured at the stoma to provide
   external fixation of the device. The catheter was advanced 1 cm/day for
   either 7 or 14 days before explant.
   Results. After 7 days, the distracted segment achieved a mean +/- SD
   increase in length of 37 +/- 6\% versus fed, nondistracted bowel,
   corresponding to an absolute gain of 10.6 +/- 1.7 cm (1.5 cm/day). After
   14 days, the Roux limb achieved an 80 +/- 2\% increase in length versus
   fed control bowel, corresponding to an absolute gain of 16.8 +/- 3.0 cm
   (1.2 cm/day). No perforation or stoma-related complication occurred.
   Conclusion. We describe a novel catheter device with tapering stiffness
   allowing for endoluminal distraction enterogenesis via geometric
   coupling This approach may allow development of clinically applicable
   technology for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of noble metal nanocrystals terminated with high-index
   facets has received increasing attention due to the remarkable
   improvement in their catalytic performance. Introducing a transition
   metal to noble metals (bimetallic nanocrystals) could result in a
   reduced cost and potentially improve properties. Keeping in mind both of
   these advantages, we have developed a new synthetic approach to
   fabricate size-controlled Pt3Fe concave nanocubes using a
   high-temperature organic solution system containing oleylamine and oleic
   acid. It further demonstrates that the particle size and concavity could
   be controlled by a number of parameters such as the ratio of oleylamine
   and oleic acid, the physicochemical properties of the metal carbonyl,
   the metal valence in the precursor, and the ratio of metal precursors.
   Catalytic tests show that the high-index-surface-terminated approximate
   to 12 nm Pt3Fe concave nanocubes exhibit superior performance in both
   the hydrogenation of styrene and reduction of 4-nitrophenol in
   comparison with their counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{In this study freezing characteristics was investigated experimentally
   on adequately air-entrained cementitious materials (Powers' spacing
   factor is between 60-160 mu m) with variables including water-binder
   (w/b) ratio, slag cement addition and a wide range of air content.
   Results confirm cryogenic suction as the primary transport mode of the
   external moisture into the surface region to amplify continuous ice
   growth in capillary pores therein. This leads to pore pressure build-up
   and eventually surface scaling. Three key factors are identified to
   govern this cryogenic suction mechanism: (I) the initial ice nucleation
   in capillary pores and (II) the presence of unfrozen moisture
   transported through (III) the capillary network. Air entrainment,
   although needed for protecting internal frost damage, yields no added
   gain in improving scaling resistance in concrete and is consistent with
   the capillary suction dominated scaling mechanism. Addition of salt in
   the pore solution suppresses the ice nucleation and subsequent growth
   which may explain the pessimum effect.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to pathophysiology are advancing but still have
   many limitations that arise from real biologic systems and their
   associated physiological phenomena being too complicated. Microfluidics
   is a novel technology in the field of engineering, which provides new
   options that may overcome these hurdles. Microfluidics handles small
   volumes of fluids and may apply to various applications such as DNA
   analysis chips, other lab-on-a-chip analyses, micropropulsion, and
   microthermal technologies. Among them, organ -on-a-chip applications
   allow the fabrication of minimal functional units of a single organ or
   multiple organs. Relevant to the field of nephrology, renal tubular
   cells have been integrated with microfluidic devices for making kidneys
   -on-a-chip. Although still early in development, kidneys-on-a-chip are
   showing potential to provide a better understanding of the kidney to
   replace some traditional animal and human studies, particularly as more

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access has been a subject of extensive study in recent
   years. The increasing volume of literature calls for better
   understanding of the characteristics of current spectrum utilization as
   well as better tools for analysis. A number of measurement studies have
   been conducted recently, revealing previously unknown features. On the
   other hand, analytical studies largely continues to rely on standard
   models like the two-state Markov (Gilbert-Elliot) model. In this paper,
   we present an alternative, stochastic differential equation (SDE) based
   spectrum utilization model that captures dynamic changes in channel
   conditions induced by primary users' activities. The SDE model is in
   closed form, can generate spectrum dynamics as a temporal process, and
   is shown to provides very good fit for real spectrum measurement data.
   We show how synthetic spectrum data can be generated in a
   straightforward manner using this model to enable realistic simulation
   studies. Moreover, we show that the SDE model can be viewed as a more
   general modeling framework (continuous in time and continuous in value)
   than commonly used discrete Markovian models: it is defined by only a
   few parameters but can be used to obtain the transition matrix of any
   N-state Markov model. This is verified by comparing the two-state GE
   model generated by the SDE model and that trained directly from the
   data. We show that the GE model is a good fit for the (quantized) data,
   thereby a fine choice when binary descriptions of the channel condition
   is sufficient. However, when highly resolution (in channel condition) is
   needed, the SDE model is much more accurate than an N-state model, and
   is much easier to train and store.}},

Abstract = {{Ion implantation is a useful technique to modify surface properties of
   polymers without altering their bulk properties. The objective of this
   work is to explore the 400 key C+ ion implantation effects on PMMA at
   different fluences ranging from 5 x 10(13) to 5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). The
   surface topographical examination of irradiated samples has been
   performed using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The structural and
   chemical modifications in implanted PMMA are examined by Raman and
   Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The effects of carbon
   ion implantation on optical properties of PMMA are investigated by
   UV-Visible spectroscopy. The modifications in electrical conductivity
   have been measured using a four point probe technique. AFM images reveal
   a decrease in surface roughness of PMMA with an increase in ion fluence
   from 5 x 10(14) to 5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). The existence of amorphization
   and sp(2)-carbon clusterization has been confirmed by Raman and FTIR
   spectroscopic analysis. The UV-Visible data shows a prominent red shift
   in absorption edge as a function of ion fluence. This shift displays a
   continuous reduction in optical band gap (from 3.13 to 0.66 eV) due to
   formation of carbon clusters. Moreover, size of carbon clusters and
   photoconductivity are found to increase with increasing ion fluence. The
   ion-induced carbonaceous clusters are believed to be responsible for an
   increase in electrical conductivity of PMMA from (2.14 +/- 0.06) x
   10(-10) (Omega-cm)(-1) (pristine) to (0.32 +/- 0.01) x 10(-5)

Abstract = {{Encapsulated in vitro follicle growth (eIVFG) has great potential to
   provide an additional fertility preservation option for young women and
   girls with cancer or other reproductive health threatening diseases.
   Currently, follicles are cultured for a defined period of time and
   analyzed as a cohort. However, follicle growth is not synchronous, and
   culturing follicles for insufficient or excessive times can result in
   compromised gamete quality. Our objective is to determine whether the
   selection of follicles based on size, rather than absolute culture time,
   better predict follicle maturity and oocyte quality. Multilayer
   secondary mouse follicles were isolated and encapsulated in 0.25\%
   alginate. Follicles were cultured individually either for defined time
   periods or up to specific follicle diameter ranges, at which point
   several reproductive endpoints were analyzed. The metaphase II (MII)
   percentage after oocyte maturation on day 6 was the highest (85\%) when
   follicles were cultured for specific days. However, if follicles were
   cultured to a terminal diameter of 300-350 mu m irrespective of absolute
   time in culture, 93\% of the oocytes reached MII. More than 90\% of MII
   oocytes matured from follicles with diameters of 300-350 mm showed
   normal spindle morphology and chromosome alignment, 85\% of oocytes
   showed two pronuclei after IVF, 81\% developed into the two-cell embryo
   stage and 38\% developed to the blastocyst stage, all significantly
   higher than the percentages in the other follicle size groups. Our study
   demonstrates that size-specific follicle selection can be used as a
   non-invasive marker to identify high-quality oocytes and improve
   reproductive outcomes during eIVFG.}},

Abstract = {{Solid cancers induce the formation of new blood vessels to promote
   growth and metastasis. Unlike the normal vascular networks, the tumor
   induced vasculatures exhibit abnormal shape and function. Past efforts
   have been focused on characterizing the altered growth factor signaling
   pathway in tumor capillary endothelial cells; however, the mechanical
   microenvironment of tumor also plays a significant role in regulating
   the formation of vascular patterns. Here, we used synthetic hydrogel
   based cell culture platforms to probe how activation of human umbilical
   endothelial cells (HUVECs) by tumor secreted factors alters the
   responses to matrix modulus and in turn the capillary network formation
   and drug sensitivity. Our study revealed that while in absence of
   activation, HUVECs prefer a substrate of appropriate stiffness for
   optimal capillary network formation; stimulation by tumor cells disrupts
   the mechano-responsive behavior of HUVECs. Additionally, the effect of
   vandetanib on reducing the capillary network was also investigated. The
   response of HUVECs to the anti-angiogenic agent was substrate modulus
   dependent displaying increased sensitivity on the compliant gels.
   Stimulation by tumor cells reduced the responsiveness to vandetanib,
   particularly when plated on stiffer gels.}},

Title = {{Assessing microbial competition in a hydrogen-based membrane biofilm

Abstract = {{The membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) is a novel technology that safely
   delivers hydrogen to the base of a denitrifying biofilm via
   gas-supplying membranes. While hydrogen is an effective electron donor
   for denitrifying bacteria (DNB), it also supports sulfate-reducing
   bacteria (SRB) and methanogens (MET), which consume hydrogen and create
   undesirable by-products. SRB and MET are only competitive for hydrogen
   when local nitrate concentrations are low, therefore SRB and MET
   primarily grow near the base of the biofilm. In an MBfR, hydrogen
   concentrations are greatest at the base of the biofilm, making SRB and
   MET more likely to proliferate in an MBfR system than a conventional
   biofilm reactor. Modeling results showed that because of this, control
   of the hydrogen concentration via the intramembrane pressure was a key
   tool for limiting SRB and MET development. Another means is biofilm
   management, which supported both sloughing and erosive detachment. For
   the conditions simulated, maintaining thinner biofilms promoted higher
   denitrification fluxes and limited the presence of SRB and MET. The 2-d
   modeling showed that periodic biofilm sloughing helped control
   slow-growing SRB and MET. Moreover, the rough (non-flat) membrane
   assembly in the 2-d model provided a special niche for SRB and MET that
   was not represented in the 1-d model. This study compared 1-d and 2-d
   biofilm model applicability for simulating competition in
   counter-diffusional biofilms. Although more computationally expensive,
   the 2-d model captured important mechanisms unseen in the 1-d model.

Abstract = {{Recently, as an alternative to metal spinal fusion cages, 3D printed
   bioresorbable materials have been explored; however, the static and
   fatigue properties of these novel cages are not well known.
   Unfortunately, current ASTM testing standards used to determine these
   properties were designed prior to the advent of bioresorbable materials
   for cages. Therefore, the applicability of these standards for
   bioresorbable materials is unknown. In this study, an image-based
   topology and a conventional 3D printed bioresorbable
   poly(epsilon)-caprolactone (PCL) cervical cage design were tested in
   compression, compression-shear, and torsion, to establish their static
   and fatigue properties. Difficulties were in fact identified in
   establishing failure criteria and in particular determining compressive
   failure load. Given these limitations, under static loads, both designs
   withstood loads of over 650 N in compression, 395 N in
   compression-shear, and 0.25 Nm in torsion, prior to yielding. Under
   dynamic testing, both designs withstood 5 million (5 M) cycles of
   compression at 125\% of their respective yield forces. Geometry
   significantly affected both the static and fatigue properties of the
   cages. The measured compressive yield loads fall within the reported
   physiological ranges; consequently, these PCL bioresorbable cages would
   likely require supplemental fixation. Most importantly, supplemental
   testing methods may be necessary beyond the current ASTM standards, to
   provide more accurate and reliable results, ultimately improving
   preclinical evaluation of these devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the motion of a spherical robot rolling on a generic

Abstract = {{The electrical properties and stability of ultra-high definition (UHD)
   amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) thin-film transistor (TFT) arrays with
   short channel (width/length = 12/3 mu m) were examined. A-IGZO TFT
   arrays have a mobility of similar to 6 cm(2)/V s, subthreshold swing
   (S.S.) of 0.34 V/decade, threshold voltage of 3.32 V, and drain current
   (I-d) on/off ratio of < 10(9) with I-off below 10 (13) A. Overall these
   devices showed slightly different electrical characteristics as compared
   to the long channel devices; non-saturation of output curve at high
   drain-to-source voltage (V-ds), negative shift of threshold voltage with
   increasing V-ds, and the mobility reduction at high gate voltage (V-gs)
   were observed. The second derivative method adopting Tikhonov's
   regularization theory is suggested for the robust threshold voltage
   extraction. The temperature dependency of gamma-value was established
   after taking into consideration the impact of source/drain contact
   resistances. The AC bias-temperature stress was used to simulate the
   actual operation of active matrix liquid crystal displays (AM-LCDs). The
   threshold voltage shift had a dependency on the magnitude of drain bias
   stress, frequency, and duty cycle due to the impact ionization
   accelerated at high temperature. This study demonstrates that the short
   channel effects, source/drain contact resistances and impact ionization
   have to be taken into account during optimization of UHD AM-LCDs. (C)

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar, have been the most common material
   used for ballistic applications by providing a variety of energy
   absorption mechanisms to dissipate a projectile's momentum. One
   important mechanism is interyarn friction, which can be controlled
   through surface treatment of the fibers. It was recently shown that the
   growth of ZnO nanowires on the surface of the fibers could increase the
   interyam friction, producing 10.85 times higher peak load and 22.70
   times higher energy absorption compared to neat fabrics. Here, it is
   demonstrated that variation of the morphology of the nanowires produces
   a drastic change in the pullout behavior with low aspect ratio nanowires
   producing the largest increase in pullout force. While weight of the
   modified fabrics increased only 20\% compared to the bare ones, tensile
   test results show that the growth of ZnO nanowires enhances both tensile
   strength and elastic modulus of the fabrics by 13\% and 10\%,
   respectively. A comprehensive post-test micrograph analysis is performed
   to reveal possible enhancement mechanisms of modified aramid fabrics
   with different nanowire morphologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{FeS has been recognized as a good scavenger for arsenic under anoxic
   conditions. To create a suitable adsorbent for flow-through reactors
   such as permeable reactive barriers, it has been suggested that this
   material may be coated onto sand. However, previous work on FeS-coated
   sand has focused on batch reactors, while flow-through reactors usually
   have higher solid-solution ratios. To ascertain whether differences in
   the solid-solution ratio (SSR) are important in this system, batch
   sorption experiments were conducted as a function of pH using As(III)
   and FeS-coated sands at various solid-solution ratios. The results
   showed little variation in the distribution coefficient with SSR at pH 7
   and 9. However, at pH 5, the results showed lower values of the
   distribution coefficient at lower SSRs, the reverse of typically
   reported SSR effects. Measured pe values showed a dependence on SSR,
   which, when coupled with chemical modeling of the Fe-As-S-H2O system,
   suggested a change in the removal mechanism with SSR, from adsorption to
   a reduced Fe(II) oxyhydroxide phase (represented by Fe-2(OH)(5)) to
   precipitation as As2S3 or AsS. On the other hand, at pH 7 and 9,
   arsenite adsorption is the most probable removal mechanism regardless of
   the pe. Thus, this study identified variations in pH and redox
   conditions, and the removal mechanisms that these parameters govern, as
   the reason for the apparent SSR effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Superlattice structures are widely used in electronic and optoelectronic
   devices, many of which depend heavily on thermal management for
   performance and reliability. It has been observed that silicon/germanium
   superlattices exhibit an enhancement in thermal conductivity at very
   short period lengths, which has been attributed to the contribution of
   coherent phonons. Here we investigate additional potential contributions
   to enhanced thermal conductivity in superlattices as period length is
   reduced, finding that a reduction in strain relaxation as well as

   grown at varying substrate temperatures with and without Bi-surfactant

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{275}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{A one-pot oxydehydration of glycerol to value-added compounds was
   carried out over metal-doped SiW/HZSM-5 catalyst at low temperature (90
   degrees C) and ambient pressure. Effects of metal types (Co, Ce, Ni and
   V) and loadings (0-8 wt.\%) on catalyst properties and catalytic
   activity were explored. Doping different types of metal and loading on
   the surface of SiW/HZSM-5 catalyst affected surface chemistry and
   textural chemistry as well as the catalytic activity for glycerol
   conversion and product yield distribution. The V at 6\% loading most
   effectively enhanced the activity of SiW/HZSM-5 for a one-pot
   oxydehydration of glycerol to value-added compounds. The presence of
   V6-SiW/HZSM-5 catalyst can enhance the glycerol conversion up to 99.67\%
   with the yields of glycolic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, acrolein,
   acrylic acid, and propionic acid of 19.45\%, 12.03\%, 23.62\%, 0.25\%,
   36.23\% and 7.06\%, respectively with less than 1.5\% of glycerol
   converting to some undesired products. The kinetic studies of a one-pot
   oxydehydration of glycerol over this catalyst (V6-SiW/HZSM-5) showed the
   rate of glycerol conversion depended upon the glycerol concentration
   according to the pseudo-first order kinetic rate and about the zero
   order with respect to the H2O2 concentration. The Eley-Rideal model,
   assuming the reaction between a non-dissociative adsorption of H2O2 and
   glycerol molecule provided the best fit with the experimental results.

Abstract = {{In microwave radiometric remote sensing, undetected radio frequency
   interference (RFI) can adversely affect the accuracy of the science
   products. A method is presented to adaptively tune the parameters of an
   RFI detection algorithm which controls the equivalent brightness
   temperature of undetected RFI. The method is adaptive in the sense that
   it adjusts to variations in the RFI environment, e. g., from high RFI
   conditions near some population centers to low RFI conditions in the
   tropical Pacific Ocean. The RFI environment is characterized by
   inferring the distribution of low-level undetected RFI from that of
   high-level detected RFI using appropriate scaling arguments. The
   resulting tuned algorithm adjusts its detection threshold to equalize
   the brightness temperature calibration bias due to RFI at the expense of
   the now variable measurement precision (noise equivalent delta
   temperature). This tradeoff between calibration bias and measurement
   precision can be represented as a modified version of the classic
   receiver-operating-characteristic curve. The radiometer on the
   Aquarius/SAC-D mission is used as an example.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{Early transition metal nitrides are promising materials for use in
   electrochemical capacitors and as electrocatalysts due to their high
   electronic conductivities, high surface areas and electrochemical
   stabilities. In addition to double-layer (electrostatic) charge storage,
   these materials store charge via a pseudocapacitive mechanism involving
   charge-transfer reactions. This paper describes electrochemical and
   in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic results that provide important
   insights regarding the pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism for
   molybdenum nitrides in aqueous acids. From analysis of the rest
   potentials at varying pH values, we concluded that electrons and protons
   were coupled during charge transfer with a ratio of similar to 2
   electrons per proton. Cycling the MO2N electrodes between -0.73 and
   -0.19 V, the stability window for this material, resulted in the removal
   of approximately one electron per Mo from a band that was primarily Mo
   in character. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra
   indicated minimal changes in the immediate local structure around Mo as
   the potential was varied. The results are consistent with reversible
   hydrogen insertion into and extraction from interstitial sites in the
   Mo2N lattice. Charge storage capacitances in excess of 1500 Fg(-1) are
   predicted for materials with full occupation of these interstitial
   sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) techniques can be used to discern
   between neutron and gamma-ray interactions in certain organic
   scintillators. Traditionally, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been
   used in organic-scintillator assemblies. However, silicon
   photomultipliers (SiPMs) have great potential to be used in many
   applications in which PMTs have been predominantly used, including those
   utilizing PSD techniques. To evaluate the current state of the art of
   the SiPM technology, SensL's 6-mm B-Series and C-Series SiPMs were
   compared to a fast Hamamatsu PMT in conjunction with a 6 x 6 x 6-mm(3)
   stilbene organic scintillator to assess the PSD performance of the
   detector assemblies. Measurements with a Cf-252 source were performed
   and a figure of merit (FOM) for discriminating between neutron and
   gamma-ray pulses between 100 keVee and 200 keVee was calculated for each
   assembly. A digital charge-integration PSD technique was used to process
   all measured data. The FOM for the B-Series SiPM, PMT, and C-Series SiPM
   was 1.37,1.93, and 2.13, respectively. The C-Series SiPM was shown to
   perform as well as the PMT in the experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{The control of electron energy probability functions (EEPFs) in low
   pressure partially ionized plasmas is typically accomplished through the
   format of the applied power. For example, through the use of pulse
   power, the EEPF can be modulated to produce shapes not possible under
   continuous wave excitation. This technique uses internal control. In
   this paper, we discuss a method for external control of EEPFs by
   transport of electrons between separately powered inductively coupled
   plasmas (ICPs). The reactor incorporates dual ICP sources (main and
   auxiliary) in a tandem geometry whose plasma volumes are separated by a
   grid. The auxiliary ICP is continuously powered while the main ICP is
   pulsed. Langmuir probe measurements of the EEPFs during the afterglow of
   the main ICP suggests that transport of hot electrons from the auxiliary
   plasma provided what is effectively an external source of energetic
   electrons. The tail of the EEPF and bulk electron temperature were then
   elevated in the afterglow of the main ICP by this external source of
   power. Results from a computer simulation for the evolution of the EEPFs
   concur with measured trends. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{34}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Perovskite structure (ABO(3)) thin films have wide applications in
   electronic devices due to their unique properties, including high
   dielectric permittivity, ferroelectricity and piezoelectric coupling.
   Here, we report an approach to grow highly textured thick lead titanate
   (PbTiO3) films on conductive substrates by a two-step hydrothermal
   reaction. Initially, vertically aligned TiO2 nanowire arrays are grown
   on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass, which act as template
   crystals for conversion to the perovskite structure. The PbTiO3 films
   are then converted from TiO2 NW arrays by diffusing Pb2+ ions into the
   template through a second hydrothermal reaction. The dielectric
   permittivity and piezoelectric coupling coefficient (d(33)) of the
   PbTiO3 films are as high as 795 at 1 kHz and 52 pm V-1, respectively.
   The reported process can also potentially be expanded for the assembly
   of other complex perovskite ATiO(3) (A = Ba, Ca, Cd, etc) films by using
   the highly aligned TiO2 NW arrays as templates. Therefore, the approach
   introduced here opens up a new door to synthesize ferroelectric thin
   films on conductive substrates for application in sensors, actuators,
   and ultrasonic transducers that are important in various industrial and
   scientific areas.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical electroactive elastomers with a modulus similar to that of
   soft tissues are highly desirable for muscle, nerve, and other soft
   tissue replacement or regeneration but have rarely been reported. In
   this work, superiorly stretchable electroactive polyurethane-urea
   elastomers were designed based on poly(lactide), poly(ethylene glycol),
   and aniline trimer (AT). A strain at break higher than 1600\% and a
   modulus close to soft tissues was achieved from these copolymers. The
   mechanisms of super stretchability of the copolymer were systematically
   investigated. Crystallinity, chemical cross-linking, ionic
   cross-linking, and hard domain formation were examined using
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) measurements, and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). The sphere-like hard domains self-assembled from AT segments were
   found to provide the crucial physical interactions needed for the novel
   super elastic material formation. These super stretchable copolymers
   were blended with conductive fillers such as polyaniline nanofibers and
   nanosized carbon black to achieve a high electric conductivity of 0.1
   S/cm while maintaining an excellent stretchability and a modulus similar
   to that of soft tissues (lower than 10 MPa).}},

Abstract = {{Parylene films are commonly used as transparent, flexible coatings in
   electronic devices and biomedical applications, exhibiting barrier
   properties against corrosion, low dielectric constant, and moisture
   resistance. Reactive vapor deposition of parylene results in conformal
   coverage of features at room temperature, which is advantageous for
   passivating, for example, organic optoelectronic devices. Conventional
   parylene deposition methods, however, coat surfaces virtually
   indiscriminately and utilize separate chambers for vaporization,
   pyrolysis, and polymerization, resulting in a large footprint and
   limited processing integration ability, especially at a laboratory
   scale. Here, we demonstrate the vaporization and pyrolysis of the
   di-p-xylylene (parylene dimer) in a single compact nozzle, producing a
   jet of monomer that polymerizes into a film upon contact with the
   substrate at room temperature. A guard flow jet is employed to shield
   the reactive monomer molecules en route to the substrate, thereby
   enabling polymer deposition and patterning in ambient atmosphere. We
   present an analytical model predicting film growth rate as a function of
   process parameters (e.g., gas flow rate and source, pyrolysis \&
   substrate temperatures). The effect of jet flow dynamics on film
   morphology is also discussed. A 100\% increase in the lifetime of
   air-sensitive OLEDs is demonstrated upon encapsulation of the devices
   with parylene-N film deposited by this technique. Potential advantages
   of this approach include increased material utilization efficiency,
   localized conformal coating capabilities, and an apparatus that is
   compact, inexpensive, and does not require vacuum.}},

Abstract = {{Small autonomous machines like biological cells or soft robots can
   convert energy input into control of function and form. It is desired
   that this behavior emerges spontaneously and can be easily switched over
   time. For this purpose we introduce an active matter system that is
   loosely inspired by biology and which we term an active colloidal cell.
   The active colloidal cell consists of a boundary and a fluid interior,
   both of which are built from identical rotating spinners whose activity
   creates convective flows. Similarly to biological cell motility, which
   is driven by cytoskeletal components spread throughout the entire volume
   of the cell, active colloidal cells are characterized by highly
   distributed energy conversion. We demonstrate that we can control the
   shape of the active colloidal cell and drive compartmentalization by
   varying the details of the boundary (hard vs. flexible) and the
   character of the spinners (passive vs. active). We report buckling of
   the boundary controlled by the pattern of boundary activity, as well as
   formation of core-shell and inverted Janus phase-separated
   configurations within the active cell interior. As the cell size is
   increased, the inverted Janus configuration spontaneously breaks its
   mirror symmetry. The result is a bubble-crescent configuration, which
   alternates between two degenerate states over time and exhibits
   collective migration of the fluid along the boundary. Our results are
   obtained using microscopic, non-momentum-conserving Langevin dynamics
   simulations and verified via a phase-field continuum model coupled to a
   Navier-Stokes equation.}},

   Instantaneous Energetic Cost}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates methods for the online optimization of assistive
   robotic devices such as powered prostheses, orthoses and exoskeletons.
   Our algorithms estimate the value of a physiological objective in
   real-time (with a body ``in-the-loop{''}) and use this information to
   identify optimal device parameters. To handle sensor data that are noisy
   and dynamically delayed, we rely on a combination of dynamic estimation
   and response surface identification. We evaluated three algorithms
   (Steady-State Cost Mapping, Instantaneous Cost Mapping, and
   Instantaneous Cost Gradient Search) with eight healthy human subjects.
   Steady-State Cost Mapping is an established technique that fits a cubic
   polynomial to averages of steady-state measures at different parameter
   settings. The optimal parameter value is determined from the polynomial
   fit. Using a continuous sweep over a range of parameters and taking into
   account measurement dynamics, Instantaneous Cost Mapping identifies a
   cubic polynomial more quickly. Instantaneous Cost Gradient Search uses a
   similar technique to iteratively approach the optimal parameter value
   using estimates of the local gradient. To evaluate these methods in a
   simple and repeatable way, we prescribed step frequency via a metronome
   and optimized this frequency to minimize metabolic energetic cost. This
   use of step frequency allows a comparison of our results to established
   techniques and enables others to replicate our methods. Our results show
   that all three methods achieve similar accuracy in estimating optimal
   step frequency. For all methods, the average error between the predicted
   minima and the subjects' preferred step frequencies was less than 1\%
   with a standard deviation between 4\% and 5\%. Using Instantaneous Cost
   Mapping, we were able to reduce subject walking-time from over an hour
   to less than 10 minutes. While, for a single parameter, the
   Instantaneous Cost Gradient Search is not much faster than Steady-State
   Cost Mapping, the Instantaneous Cost Gradient Search extends favorably
   to multi-dimensional parameter spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable biomaterials with intrinsically multifunctional properties
   such as high strength, photoluminescent ability (bioimaging monitoring),
   and antimicrobial activity (anti-infection), as well as high
   osteoblastic differentiation ability, play a critical role in successful
   bone tissue regeneration. However, fabricating a biomaterial containing
   all these functions is still a challenge. Here, urethane cross-linked
   intrinsically multifunctional silica-poly(citrate) (CMSPC)-based hybrid
   elastomers are developed by first one-step polymerization and further
   chemical crosslinked using isocyanate. CMSPC hybrid elastomers
   demonstrate a high modulus of 976 +/- 15 MPa, which is superior compared
   with most conventional poly(citrate)-based elastomers. Hybrid elastomers
   show strong and stable intrinsic photoluminescent ability (emission
   400-600 nm) due to the incorporation of silica phase. All elastomers
   exhibit high inherent antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus
   aureus. In addition, CMSPC hybrid elastomers significantly enhance the
   proliferation and metabolic activity of osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1). CMSPC
   hybrid elastomers significantly promote the osteogenic differentiation
   of MC3T3-E1 by improving alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium
   biomineralization deposits, as well as expressions of osteoblastic
   genes. These hybrid elastomers also show a minimal inflammatory response
   indicated by subcutaneous transplantation in vivo. These optimized
   structure and multifunctional properties make this hybrid elastomer
   highly promising for bone tissue regeneration and antiinfection and
   bioimaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a network consisting of two subnetworks (communities) connected
   by some external edges. Given the network topology, the community
   detection problem can be cast as a graph partitioning problem that aims
   to identify the external edges as the graph cut that separates these two
   subnetworks. In this paper, we consider a general model where two
   arbitrarily connected subnetworks are connected by random external
   edges. Using random matrix theory and concentration inequalities, we
   show that when one performs community detection via spectral clustering
   there exists an abrupt phase transition as a function of the random
   external edge connection probability. Specifically, the community
   detection performance transitions from almost perfect detectability to
   low detectability near some critical value of the random external edge
   connection probability. We derive upper and lower bounds on the critical
   value and show that the bounds are equal to each other when two
   subnetwork sizes are identical. Using simulated and experimental data we
   show how these bounds can be empirically estimated to validate the
   detection reliability of any discovered communities.}},

Abstract = {{Industry is responsible for nearly half of the global energy
   consumption. Recent studies on sustainable manufacturing focused on
   energy saving to reduce the unit production cost and environmental
   impacts. Besides energy consumption, certain manufacturing activities in
   machine shops, such as the use of cutting fluids, disposal of worn
   tools, and material consumption, also cause other environmental impacts.
   Since all these activities lead to carbon footprint directly or
   indirectly, carbon footprint can be employed as a new and overall
   environment criterion in manufacturing. In this study, an integrated
   model for processing parameter optimization and flow-shop scheduling was
   developed. Objectives to minimize both makespan and carbon footprint
   were considered simultaneously, which was solved by a multi-objective
   teaching learning-based optimization algorithm. Furthermore, three
   carbon-footprint-reduction strategies were employed to optimize the
   scheduling results: (i) postponing strategy, (ii) setup strategy, and
   (iii) processing parameter preliminary optimization strategy. In the
   theoretical aspect, the strategies greatly improved the performance of
   the optimization results through reducing machine idle time and cutting
   down the search space. From the perspective of practical applications,
   these strategies greatly help elevate production efficiency and reduce
   environmental impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flow monitoring in porous materials is critical for the engineering of

   electrochemical-sensor system that monitors the liquid flow in porous
   materials without affecting the real flow in paper-strip samples. The
   developed microfluidic sensor records an amperometric signal created by
   the solution movement mediated by paper wicking. This approach allows
   the in situ monitoring of the different hydrodynamic conditions of a
   specific paper geometry or composition. In addition, the method proposed
   in this work was employed to characterise the fluid flow of different
   nitrocellulose paper strips after oxygen-plasma treatment or dextran
   coating. The dextran fluid-flow modifiers were further used on the paper
   strip-based assays as means of signal enhancement. The proposed
   electrochemical-sensing method offers a valuable alternative to existing
   optical-based monitoring techniques for flow measurement in paper-based
   microfluidic systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We fabricated high-brightness GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs)

   hole, a submicron high-aspect-ratio pillar, and microconvex arrays were
   fabricated on the indium tin oxide (ITO) top electrode of GaN-based LED
   devices. We analyzed the light extraction mechanism for each of the
   three types of patterns by using a finite element method simulation, and
   found that the high-aspect-ratio pillar had a great ability to improve
   light extraction owing to its waveguide effect and prominent scattering
   effect. As a result, the light output power, which was measured in an
   integrating sphere, of the LED device was enhanced by up to 19.6\% when
   the high-aspect-ratio pillar array was formed on the top ITO electrode
   of the device. Further, the electrical properties of none of the
   patterned LED devices fabricated using ZNDR degraded in comparison to
   those of bare LED devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Artificial biofilms establish the role of matrix interactions in
   staphylococcal biofilm assembly and disassembly}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the microstructural and mechanical properties of
   bacterial biofilms can be created through colloidal self-assembly of
   cells and polymers, and thereby link the complex material properties of
   biofilms to well understood colloidal and polymeric behaviors. This
   finding is applied to soften and disassemble staphylococcal biofilms
   through pH changes. Bacterial biofilms are viscoelastic, structured
   communities of cells encapsulated in an extracellular polymeric
   substance (EPS) comprised of polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA.
   Although the identity and abundance of EPS macromolecules are known, how
   these matrix materials interact with themselves and bacterial cells to
   generate biofilm morphology and mechanics is not understood. Here, we
   find that the colloidal self-assembly of Staphylococcus epidermidis
   RP62A cells and polysaccharides into viscoelastic biofilms is driven by
   thermodynamic phase instability of EPS. pH conditions that induce phase
   instability of chitosan produce artificial S. epidermidis biofilms whose
   mechanics match natural S. epidermidis biofilms. Furthermore, pH-induced
   solubilization of the matrix triggers disassembly in both artificial and
   natural S. epidermidis biofilms. This pH-induced disassembly occurs in
   biofilms formed by five additional staphylococcal strains, including
   three clinical isolates. Our findings suggest that colloidal
   self-assembly of cells and matrix polymers produces biofilm
   viscoelasticity and that biofilm control strategies can exploit this
   mechanism.}},

   dorsal cochlear nucleus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{The cochlear nucleus (CN) is the first site of multisensory integration
   in the ascending auditory pathway. The principal output neurons of the
   dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), fusiform cells, receive somatosensory
   information relayed by the CN granule cells from the trigeminal and
   dorsal column pathways. Integration of somatosensory and auditory inputs
   results in long-term enhancement or suppression in a
   stimulus-timing-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that
   stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be induced in DCN
   fusiform cells using paired auditory and transcutaneous electrical
   stimulation of the face and neck to activate trigeminal and dorsal
   column pathways to the CN, respectively. Long-lasting changes in
   fusiform cell firing rates persisted for up to 2 h after this bimodal
   stimulation, and followed Hebbian or anti-Hebbian rules, depending on
   tone duration, but not somatosensory stimulation location: 50 ms paired
   tones evoked predominantly Hebbian, while 10 ms paired tones evoked
   predominantly anti-Hebbian plasticity. The tone-duration-dependent STDP
   was strongly correlated with first inter-spike intervals, implicating
   intrinsic cellular properties as determinants of STDP. This study
   demonstrates that transcutaneous stimulation with precise auditory
   somatosensory timing parameters can non-invasively induce fusiform cell
   long-term modulation, which could be harnessed in the future to moderate
   tinnitus-related hyperactivity in DCN.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a novel frequency division multiplexing scheme which
   can generate a signal whose worst-case peak-to-average power ratio
   (PAPR) is tunable by an input parameter; they call this scheme tunable
   PAPR frequency division multiplexing (TP-FDM). Special cases of TP-FDM
   are orthogonal FDM (OFDM) and single carrier (SC) modulation. Unlike
   several other proposed PAPR reduction schemes, TP-FDM requires no
   per-symbol side information to be sent from transmitter to receiver.
   TP-FDM has overall computational requirements almost the same as OFDM.
   The author's study of the symbol error rate (SER) of TP-FDM in a
   Rayleigh fading channel shows that higher PAPR signals give a better SER
   performance. Thus, instead of choosing either of the extremes, OFDM and
   SC modulation, as is currently done in some cellular systems, one can
   tune the PAPR with TP-FDM to the maximum suitable for the transmitter
   and receiver device electronics, so as to minimise SER. They compare and
   contrast TP-FDM with transform precoded OFDM methods in terms of SER and
   PAPR. They also extend TP-FDM to a multi-user scenario.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{471}},

Abstract = {{We consider the effect of differing coefficients of static and dynamic
   friction coefficients on the behaviour of contacts involving microslip.
   The classic solutions of Cattaneo and Mindlin are unchanged if the
   transition in coefficients is abrupt, but if it occurs over some small
   slip distance, the solution has some mathematical similarities with
   those governing the normal tractions in adhesive contact problems. In
   particular, if the transition to dynamic slip occurs over a sufficiently
   small area, we can identify a `JKR' approximation, where the transition
   region is condensed to a line. A local singularity in shear traction is
   then predicted, with a stress-intensity factor that is proportional to
   the square root of the local contact pressure and to a certain integral
   of the friction coefficient-slip distance relation. We can also define
   an equivalent of the `small-scale yielding' criterion, which enables us
   to assess when the singular solution provides a good approximation. One
   consequence of the results is that the static coefficient of friction
   determined from force measurements in experiments is significantly
   smaller than the value that holds at the microscale.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of Li/O-2 batteries is thought to be limited by charge
   transport through the solid Li2O2 discharge product. Prior studies
   suggest that electron tunneling is the main transport mechanism through
   thin, compact Li2O2 deposits. The present study employs a new continuum
   transport model to explore an alternative scenario, in which charge
   transport is mediated by polaron hopping. Unlike earlier models, which
   assume a uniform carrier concentration or local electroneutrality, the
   possibility of nonuniform space charge is accounted for at the
   Li2O2/electrolyte and Li2O2/electrode interfaces, providing a more
   realistic picture of transport in Li2O2 films. The temperature and
   current-density dependences of the discharge curves predicted by the
   model are in good agreement with flat-electrode experiments over a wide
   range of rates, supporting the hypothesis that polaron hopping
   contributes significantly to charge transport. Exercising the model
   suggests that this mechanism could explain the observed enhancement in
   cell performance at elevated temperature and that performance could be
   further improved by tuning the interfacial orientation of Li2O2
   crystallites.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate dipolar donor materials mixed with a C-70 acceptor in an
   organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell. Dipolar donors that have
   donor-acceptor-acceptor (d-a-a') structure result in high conductivity
   pathways due to close coupling between neighboring molecules in the
   mixed films. We analyze the charge transfer properties of the dipolar
   donor:C-70 mixtures and corresponding neat donors using a combination of
   time-resolved electroluminescence from intermolecular polaron pair
   states and conductive tip atomic force microscopy, from which we infer
   that dimers of the d-a-a' donors tend to form a continuous network of
   nanocrystalline clusters within the blends. Additional insights are
   provided by quantum-mechanical calculations of hole transfer coupling
   and hopping rates between donor molecules using nearest-neighbor donor
   packing motifs taken from crystal structural data. The approximation
   using only nearest-neighbor interactions leads to good agreement between
   donor hole hopping rates and the conductive properties of the donor:C-70
   blends. This represents a significant simplification from requiring
   details of the nano- and mesoscale morphologies of thin films to
   estimate their electronic characteristics. Using these dipolar donors,
   we obtain a maximum power conversion efficiency of 9.6 +/- 0.5\% under 1
   sun, AM1.5G simulated illumination for an OPV comprised of an active
   layer containing a dipolar donor mixed with C-70.}},

Abstract = {{Nd0.6Fe2Co2Sb12 Sn-x(x) (0 <= x <= 0.6 nominal) skutterudite compounds
   were synthesized by traditional heat treatment method. Sn substitution
   on Sb (24g) site was verified by X-ray powder diffraction, energy
   dispersive spectrometry, and Raman spectroscopy. It was determined that
   substituting Sb with Sn increases the Nd filling fraction. Along with
   the in situ nanoinclusions introduced by Sn, the thermoelectric behavior
   of Sn in Nd0.6Fe2Co2Sb12 Sn-x(x) differs from those seen in CoSb3.
   Despite the increase of electrical resistivity, the enhanced Seebeck
   coefficient and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity resulted in a
   30\% improvement of ZT for Nd0.6Fe2Co2Sb11.6Sn0.4 compared with that of
   Sn-free sample. We hope our work can complement the knowledge of
   pnicogen-substituted p-type skutterudite family and demonstrate the ways
   to improve their properties through compositional modification as well
   as in situ formation of nanoinclusions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic jet printing (e-jet printing) is a growing high
   resolution (<20 mu m) printing technology. It is cost effective for
   small scale and highly customized feature production and it is
   compatible with a large range of materials. Conventional e-jet is
   generally restricted to surfaces with high flatness, therefore limiting
   the application of e-jet in research and industry. This paper will
   present an airflow assisted e-jet printhead that incorporates the use of
   airflow within the printhead to direct electrohydrodynamically generated
   ink droplets onto non-conductive and tilted surfaces. The printhead runs
   in open loop yet achieves consistent printing performance across large
   changes in standoff height (800 mu m) between the printhead and printing
   surface. The printhead is able to print <20 mu m droplets, which
   surpasses traditional inkjet technology. In conclusion, this printhead
   design has the potential to enable e-jet printing to be applied in
   unprecedented application areas. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical work has led to an asymptotically derived expression
   for reconstructing the neutron flux from lattice functions and
   multigroup diffusion solutions. The leading-order asymptotic term is the
   standard expression for flux reconstruction, i.e., it is the product of
   a shape function, obtained through a lattice calculation, and the
   multigroup diffusion solution. The first-order asymptotic correction
   term is significant only where the gradient of the diffusion solution is
   not small. Inclusion of this first-order correction term can
   significantly improve the accuracy of the reconstructed flux. One may
   define discontinuity factors (DFs) to make certain angular moments of
   the reconstructed flux continuous across interfaces between assemblies
   in 1-D. Indeed, the standard assembly discontinuity factors make the
   zeroth moment (scalar flux) of the reconstructed flux continuous. The
   inclusion of the correction term in the flux reconstruction provides an
   additional degree of freedom that can be used to make two angular
   moments of the reconstructed flux continuous across interfaces by using
   current DFs in addition to flux DFs. Numerical results demonstrate that
   using flux and current DFs together can be more accurate than using only
   flux DFs, and that making the second angular moment continuous can be
   more accurate than making the zeroth moment continuous.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study fiber laser arrays coupled in a spatially

   particular, we examine the passive phasing dynamics, the efficiency of
   coherent combination, and the dependence of the system's behavior on
   nonlinearities in the fibers. For an array containing a small number of
   elements, we find that the fibers achieve a co-phased state within two
   round trips after a perturbation. Steady-state results agree with the
   previous work. We also find that the Kerr nonlinearity decreases the
   combining efficiency as determined from the on-axis intensity in the

Abstract = {{Fibroblasts play an important role in the wound-healing process by
   generating extracellular matrix (ECM) and undergoing differentiation
   into myofibroblasts, but these cells can also be involved in pathologic
   remodeling of tissue. Nascent ECM provides a substrate for
   re-epithelialization to occur, restoring damaged tissue to a functional
   state. Dysregulation of this process can result in fibrosis-stiffening
   and scarring of the tissue. Current treatments cannot halt or reverse
   this process. The molecular mechanisms underlying fibrotic dysregulation
   are poorly understood, providing an untapped pool of potential
   therapeutic targets. Transforming growth factor- ( and adhesion
   signaling are involved in inducing fibroblast differentiation into
   -smooth muscle actin () expressing myofibroblasts, while prostaglandin (
   has been shown to antagonize signaling; however, the temporal and
   mechanistic details of this relationship have not yet been fully
   characterized. We measured , a marker of fibroblast to myofibroblast
   differentiation, as a function of: receptor-ligand complex
   internalization, binding, and adhesion signaling and developed a
   mathematical model capturing the molecular mechanisms of fibroblast
   differentiation. Using our model, we predict the following: Periodic
   dosing with temporarily renders fibroblasts incapable of differentiation
   and refractory to additional stimulation; conversely, periodic dosing
   with in the presence of induces a reduced signal response that can be
   further inhibited by the addition of more . Controlled fibroblast
   differentiation is necessary for effective wound healing; however,
   excessive accumulation of -expressing myofibroblasts can result in
   fibrosis. Homeostasis of in our model requires a balance of positive and
   negative regulatory signals. Sensitivity analysis predicts that
   availability, availability, and the rate of receptor recycling each
   highly influence the rates of production. With this model, we are able
   to demonstrate that regulation of both and signaling levels is essential

Title = {{Relationship between coupling and the controllability Grammian in

Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{36-45}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Design of smart products requires optimization of both the physical
   device, or artifact, and its controller. While some components of
   coupling can be computed a priori, the existence and strength of
   coupling between these problems over the entire Pareto frontier
   currently cannot be computed until they are solved. If coupling is
   expected to be present, then the problem is often solved as a
   simultaneous, or all-in-one, optimization. This solution process is more
   difficult, computationally intensive, and operationally inconvenient
   than a sequential solution method. Consequently, knowing in advance
   whether coupling is weak or nonexistent is useful.
   In this paper, a general formulation for the control problem is given,
   which includes components for the speed of response, accuracy of the
   response, and control effort. While this general formulation does not
   permit a priori determination of coupling, the existence and strength of
   coupling can be determined for several special cases, which represent
   common and important control problems. Controllability is a property of
   the uncontrolled system and does not depend on the controller design.
   These relationships between coupling and controllability can be utilized
   in problem formulation, choice of solution method, and development of
   Control Proxy Functions (CPFs) for each of these problem types. The
   concepts developed are demonstrated via design of a positioning gantry
   and a MEMS actuator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanodroplet-mediated histotripsy (NMH) is a targeted ultrasound ablation
   technique combining histotripsy with nanodroplets that can be
   selectively delivered to tumor cells for targeted tumor ablation. In a
   previous study, it was reported that by use of extremely short,
   high-pressure pulses, histotripsy cavitation bubbles were generated in
   regions containing nanodroplets at significantly lower pressure (similar
   to 10.8 MPa) than without nanodroplets (similar to 28 MPa) at 500 kHz.
   Furthermore, it was hypothesized that lower frequency would improve the
   effectiveness of NMH by increasing the size of the focal region,
   increasing bubble expansion, and decreasing the cavitation threshold. In
   this study, we investigated the effects of ultrasound frequency (345
   kHz, 500 kHz, 1.5 MHz, and 3 MHz) on NMH. First, the NMH cavitation
   threshold was measured in tissue phantoms with and without nanodroplets,
   with results indicating that the NMH threshold was significantly below
   the histotripsy intrinsic threshold at all frequencies. Results also
   indicated that the NMH threshold decreased at lower frequency, ranging
   from 7.4 MPa at 345 kHz to 13.2 MPa at 3 MHz. In the second part of this
   study, the effects of frequency on NMH bubble expansion were
   investigated, with results indicating larger expansion at lower
   frequency, even at a lower pressure. In the final part of this study,
   the ability of perfluoropentane-encapsulated nanodroplets to act as
   sustainable cavitation nuclei over multiple pulses was investigated,
   with results indicating that the nanodroplets are destroyed by the
   cavitation process and only function as cavitation nuclei for the first
   few pulses, with this effect being most pronounced at higher
   frequencies. Overall, the results of this study support our hypothesis
   that using a lower frequency will improve the effectiveness of NMH by
   increasing the size of the focal region, increasing bubble expansion and
   decreasing the cavitation threshold. (E-mail: zhenx@umich.edu) (C) 2015

Abstract = {{When histotripsy pulses shorter than 2 cycles are applied, the formation
   of a dense bubble cloud relies only on the applied peak negative
   pressure (p-) exceeding the ``intrinsic threshold'' of the medium
   (absolute value of 26-30 MPa in most soft tissues). It has been found
   that a sub-threshold high-frequency probe pulse (3 MHz) can be enabled
   by a sub-threshold low-frequency pump pulse (500 kHz) where the sum
   exceeds the intrinsic threshold, thus generating lesion-producing dense
   bubble clouds ({''}dual-beam histotripsy''). Here, the feasibility of
   using an imaging transducer to provide the high-frequency probe pulse in
   the dual-beam histotripsy approach is investigated. More specifically,
   an ATL L7-4 imaging transducer (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA, USA),
   pulsed by a V-1 Data Acquisition System (Verasonics, Redmond, WA, USA),
   was used to generate the high-frequency probe pulses. The low-frequency
   pump pulses were generated by a 20-element 345-kHz array transducer,
   driven by a custom high-voltage pulser. These dual-beam histotripsy
   pulses were applied to red blood cell tissue-mimicking phantoms at a
   pulse repetition frequency of 1 Hz, and optical imaging was used to
   visualize bubble clouds and lesions generated in the red blood cell
   phantoms. The results indicated that dense bubble clouds (and resulting
   lesions) were generated when the p- of the sub-threshold pump and probe
   pulses combined constructively to exceed the intrinsic threshold. The
   average size of the smallest reproducible lesions using the imaging
   probe pulse enabled by the sub-threshold pump pulse was 0.7 x 1.7 mm,
   whereas that using the supra-threshold pump pulse alone was 1.4 x 3.7
   mm. When the imaging transducer was steered laterally, bubble clouds and
   lesions were steered correspondingly until the combined p- no longer
   exceeded the intrinsic threshold. These results were also validated with
   ex vivo porcine liver experiments. Using an imaging transducer for
   dual-beam histotripsy can have two advantages: (i) lesion steering can
   be achieved using the steering of the imaging transducer (implemented
   with the beamformer of the accompanying programmable ultrasound system),
   and (ii) treatment can be simultaneously monitored when the imaging
   transducer is used in conjunction with an ultrasound imaging system.

Abstract = {{Tail-biting codes are efficient for short data packets by eliminating
   the rate loss in conventional known-tail codes. The existing
   maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding algorithms, such as the Viterbi
   heuristic ML decoder (VH ML decoder) and the trap detection-based ML
   decoder (TD-ML decoder), have to visit each state of the tail-biting
   trellis at least once. The decoding efficiency of these decoding
   algorithms can be improved further. In this paper, we propose an ML
   decoder for tail-biting trellises with bounded searches (BSs). We first
   perform a unidirectional bounded searching algorithm to estimate the
   lower bound of path metric of tail-biting paths on each sub-tail-biting
   trellis and exclude impossible candidates of starting states. In the
   second phase, a bidirectional searching algorithm is applied to find the
   ML tail-biting (MLTB) path on the survivor sub-tail-biting trellises.
   The proposed algorithm exhibits lower decoding complexity floor than
   other existing algorithms on tail-biting trellis. Simulation results for
   the (24, 12, 8) Golay codes and E-b/N-0 = 5 dB show that, for the
   proposed ML decoder, the average number of visited states per decoded
   bit is less than 2, whereas the average number of visited states per
   decoded bit is more than 12 for the VH ML decoder.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with many types of malignancy commonly harbor quiescent
   disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow. These cells frequently resist
   chemotherapy and may persist for years before proliferating as recurrent
   metastases. To test for compounds that eliminate quiescent cancer cells,
   we established a new 384-well 3D spheroid model in which small numbers
   of cancer cells reversibly arrest in G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle when
   cultured with bone marrow stromal cells. Using dual-color
   bioluminescence imaging to selectively quantify viability of cancer and
   stromal cells in the same spheroid, we identified single compounds and
   combination treatments that preferentially eliminated quiescent breast
   cancer cells but not stromal cells. A treatment combination effective
   against malignant cells in spheroids also eliminated breast cancer cells
   from bone marrow in a mouse xenograft model. This research establishes a
   novel screening platform for therapies that selectively target quiescent
   tumor cells, facilitating identification of new drugs to prevent

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{344-356}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces a reduced-order method to study the parametric
   excitations and lock-in of flexible hydrofoils caused by unsteady
   two-phase (cavitating) flow. The reduced-order method is based on a
   1-DOF structural model coupled with a van der Pol wake oscillator with
   empirically derived relations for the variation in lift, cavity-length,
   and cavity-shedding frequency as a function of a non-dimensional
   cavitation parameter. The results are compared with several available
   data from both numerical simulations and experimental measurements. The
   frequency content of both the predicted and measured vibrations
   suggested that, in addition to the primary cavity-shedding frequency and
   the hydrofoil natural frequencies, unsteady two-phase flows may excite
   additional modulated frequencies due to time-varying fluid-added mass
   effects. The results show that these frequency modulations might cause
   the flexible hydrofoil to undergo higher-order resonances, as well as
   parametric resonances. While the maximum deformations for the primary
   and higher-order resonances were observed to damp out, parametric
   resonances might persist even with realistic fluid damping coefficients
   (4-12\%). It was observed that with higher effective foil flexibility,
   the cavity-shedding frequencies may be significantly modified from the
   rigid foil trends, and may instead lock-in with the system natural
   frequencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coherent backscatter enhancement (CBE) is a multiple scattering
   phenomenon that can lead to a doubling of the backscattered field
   intensity from a random aggregation of scatterers. It may be useful for
   remote sensing of scatterer aggregations, such as fish schools. This
   paper presents simulations of acoustic CBE from randomly placed
   omnidirectional point scatterers based on Foldy's field equations. The
   simulations are verified and validated through comparisons with Bragg
   scattering and Foldy's effective-medium theory, assessments of acoustic
   energy conservation, and comparisons with prior optical and acoustical
   CBE results. To make CBE comparisons with prior optics results, a CBE
   coherence function was postulated to account for resolution differences
   between the optics and simulation studies. For the higher-resolution
   optics studies, the postulated coherence function yields a CBE of 1.68,
   which matches optical CBE measurements. For the lower-resolution
   simulations, the same coherence function yields a CBE of 1.034, which
   agrees with appropriately extrapolated CBE simulation results, 1.030 +/-
   0.005. Assuming comparable resolution, the acoustics experiment and
   simulations both produce a CBE of approximately 1.5. The CBE peak is
   found to increase approximately monotonically with (k(2)sigma(s))(1/4)
   (ks)(-1), where k is the wave number, s is the average spacing between
   scatterers, and sigma(s) is a scatterer's cross section. (C) 2015

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{The Brillouin flow is the prevalent flow in crossed-field devices. We
   systematically study its stability in the conventional, planar, and
   inverted magnetron geometry. To investigate the intrinsic negative mass
   effect in Brillouin flow, we consider electrostatic modes in a
   nonrelativistic, smooth bore magnetron. We found that the Brillouin flow
   in the inverted magnetron is more unstable than that in a planar
   magnetron, which in turn is more unstable than that in the conventional
   magnetron. Thus, oscillations in the inverted magnetron may startup
   faster than the conventional magnetron. This result is consistent with
   simulations, and with the negative mass property in the inverted
   magnetron configuration. Inclusion of relativistic effects and
   electromagnetic effects does not qualitatively change these conclusions.

Abstract = {{Understanding transport of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and other
   nanocarriers within tissues is essential for biomedical imaging and drug
   delivery using these carriers. Compared to traditional cell cultures in
   animal studies, three-dimensional tissue replicas approach the
   complexity of the actual organs and enable high temporal and spatial
   resolution of the carrier permeation. We investigated diffusional
   transport of CNTs in highly uniform spheroids of hepatocellular
   carcinoma and found that apparent diffusion coefficients of CNTs in
   these tissue replicas are anomalously high and comparable to diffusion
   rates of similarly charged molecules with molecular weights 10000x
   lower. Moreover, diffusivity of CNTs in tissues is enhanced after
   functionalization with transforming growth factor fit This unexpected
   trend contradicts predictions of the Stokes Einstein equation and
   previously obtained empirical dependences of diffusivity on molecular
   mass for permeants in gas, liquid, solid or gel. It is attributed to the
   planar diffusion (gliding) of CNTs along cellular membranes reducing
   effective dimensionality of diffusional space. These findings indicate
   that nanotubes and potentially similar nanostructures are capable of
   fast and deep permeation into the tissue, which is often difficult to
   realize with anticancer agents.}},

Abstract = {{We showed enhanced single photon emission via exciton plasmon coupling

   12.8 +/- 1.10. The exciton plasmon coupling was enhanced by matching the
   exciton energy to the localized surface plasmon resonance. Due to the
   sensitivity of the plasmonic enhancement to dot-to-dot variations,
   measurements were performed on the same dot at different stages of the
   sample processing, enabled by the use of a novel site-controlled InGaN
   QD structure. This was then repeated over a large number of dots and
   compared between different metal materials to investigate the nature of
   the coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomously healing materials that utilize thiol-ene polymerization
   initiated by an environmentally borne reaction stimulus are demonstrated
   by puncturing trilayered panels, fabricated by sandwiching thiol-ene-
   trialkylborane resin formulations between solid polymer panels, with
   high velocity projectiles; as the reactive liquid layer flows into the
   entrance hole, contact with atmospheric oxygen initiates polymerization,
   converting the liquid into a solid plug. Using infrared spectroscopy, we
   find that formulated resins polymerize rapidly, forming a solid polymer
   within seconds of atmospheric contact. During high-velocity ballistics
   experiments, additional evidence for rapid polymerization is provided by
   high-speed video, demonstrating the immediate viscosity increase when
   the thiol-ene- trialkylborane resins contact atmospheric oxygen, and
   thermal imaging, where surface temperature measurements reveal the
   thiol-ene reaction exotherm, confirming polymerization begins
   immediately upon oxygen exposure. While other approaches for materials
   self-repair have utilized similar liquid-to-solid transitions, our
   approach permits the development of materials capable of sealing a

Abstract = {{Activated carbon (AC) is a promising sorbent for adsorption removal of
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) because of its cost
   effectiveness. The desorption kinetics of two-ring PAHs, naphthalene and
   acenaphthene, over bituminous-coal-based (AC(WY)) and
   coconut-shell-based (AC(NT)) activated carbons were investigated. The
   desorption kinetics were studied over the temperature range of 400-800 K
   at different heating rates (8-20 K/min) using thermogravimetric analysis
   techniques. The activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and kinetic
   model for each sorbate sorbent pair were determined by applying
   analytical methods to the non-isothermal data. The Johnson-Mehl-Avrami
   (JMA) rate equation, g(alpha) = {[}-ln(1 - alpha)](n) (in integral form,
   where alpha is fractional completion), following the nucleation and
   growth model, was found to best describe the PAN desorption from both
   sorbents. Strong molecular sieving effects were found to influence both
   adsorption capacity and desorption rates. AC(WY), with less micropore
   (<0.7 nm) volume and more larger pores (0.7-2 nm) compared to AC(NT),
   favors PAN adsorption and desorption rates, leading to different values
   of the kinetic exponent (n) and other kinetic parameters. Likewise, the
   sieving effects favor adsorption and desorption of naphthalene (kinetic
   diameter of 0.62 nm) over acenaphthene (kinetic diameter of 0.66 nm) for
   both carbons.}},

Abstract = {{Thallium-bromide (TlBr) is currently under investigation as an
   alternative room-temperature semiconductor gamma-ray spectrometer due to
   its favorable material properties (large bandgap, high atomic numbers,
   and high density). Previous work has shown that 5 mm thick pixelated
   TlBr detectors can achieve sub-1\% FWHM energy resolution at 662 keV for
   single-pixel events. These results are limited to -20 degrees C
   operation where detector performance is stable. During the first one to
   five days of applied bias at -20 degrees C, many TlBr detectors undergo
   a conditioning phase, where the energy resolution improves and the
   depth-dependent electron drift velocity stabilizes. In this work, the
   spectroscopic performance, drift velocity, and freed electron
   concentrations of multiple 5 mm thick pixelated TlBr detectors are
   monitored throughout the conditioning phase. Additionally, conditioning
   is performed twice on the same detector at different times to show that

Abstract = {{CXCR4 is a cell membrane receptor that is overexpressed in
   triple-negative breast cancers and implicated in growth and metastasis
   of this disease. Using electrohydrodynamic cojetting, we prepared
   multicompartmental drug delivery carriers for CXCR4 targeting. The
   particles are comprised of a novel poly(lactide-co-glycolide) derivative
   that allows for straightforward immobilization of
   1,1'{[}1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)This{[}1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca
   ne] (Plerixafor), a small molecule with affinity for CXCR4. Targeted
   nanocarriers are selectively taken up by CXCR4-expressing cells and
   effectively block CXCR4 signaling. This study suggests that CXCR4 may be
   an effective target for nanocarrier-based therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of molecules to adopt more than One unique crystalline
   structure, polymorphism, is :a phenomenon of considerable scientific
   interest because it challenges the notion that molecules arrange
   themselves exclusively in the thermodynamically most stable crystal
   form. The factors influencing this behavior are manifold and have defied
   simple prediction. To illustrate an approach to elucidating these
   factors, the solid-state behavior of a series of molecules that are
   derivatives of tolfenamic acid (TA), a pentamorphic system, was
   explored. In analogy to the manner in which drugs are discovered through
   structure activity relationships and the identification of a
   pharmacophore, we test here the notion that when a collective ensemble
   structural motifs, a ``polymorphophore,{''} is incorporated into A
   molecule it renders the compound polymorphic. The structure polymorphism
   relationship in six TA analogues, both commercial and newly synthesized,
   was undertaken with the intention of systematically understanding the
   factors that influence the polymorphism in the fenamic acid class
   through a combined computational a, well as experimental approach.
   Ultimately, such studies may be used to experimentally derive the
   propensity for polymorphic behavior of a given molecular motif and
   perhaps provide a pathway to engineer molecular compounds with
   controlled properties in the solid state.}},

Abstract = {{Fast and repetitive switching in high-power circuits is a challenging
   task where the ultimate solutions still have to be found. We proposed a
   new approach. Supercritical fluids (SCFs) combine favorable properties
   of liquids - insulation strength, thermal behavior, and gases - self
   healing, high fluidity, and absence of vapor bubbles. That's why we
   start investigating the subject of plasma switches in SC media. First
   results indicate excellent switch recovery and very high insulation
   strength. We present the design of a SCF insulated switch (SC switch).
   Breakdown strength of the SCF is investigated and found to be high in
   comparison with most of the solid insulating media. The dielectric
   recovery inside the SC N-2 switch is tested under a repetitive 30 kV,
   200 ns pulse voltage at repetition rate up to 5 kHz. The recovery
   breakdown voltage across the SC switch achieves 80 \% within 200 mu s.
   The current interruption capability of SC N-2 is investigated
   experimentally in a synthetic circuit generating a high-frequency arc of
   several hundreds of amperes and a transient recovery voltage of hundreds
   of volts. The results show that a SC N-2 switch with fixed electrodes
   and an inter-electrode distance of mm range can successfully interrupt
   this current at approximately 2 ms after arc initiation.}},

Abstract = {{The national demand for kidney transplantation far outweighs the supply
   of kidney organs. Currently, a patient's ability to receive a kidney
   transplant varies depending on where he or she seeks transplantation.
   This reality is in direct conflict with a federal mandate from the
   Department of Health and Human Services. We analyze current kidney
   allocation and develop an alternative kidney sharing strategy using a
   multiperiod linear optimization model, KSHARE. KSHARE aims to improve
   geographic equity in kidney transplantation while also respecting
   transplant system constraints and priorities. KSHARE is tested against
   actual 2000-2009 kidney allocation using Organ Procurement and
   Transplant Network data. Geographic equity is represented by minimizing
   the range in kidney transplant rates around local areas of the country.
   In 2009, less than 25\% of standard criteria donor kidneys were
   allocated beyond the local area of procurement, and Donor Service Area
   kidney transplantation rates varied from 3.0\% to 30.0\%, for an overall
   range of 27.0\%. Given optimal sharing of kidneys within 600 miles of
   procurement for 2000-2009, kidney transplant rates vary from 5.0\% to
   12.5\% around the country for an overall kidney transplant range of
   7.5\%. Nationally sharing kidneys optimally between local areas only
   further decreases the transplant rate range by 1.7\%. Enhancing the
   practice of sharing kidneys by the KSHARE model may increase geographic
   equity in kidney transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of various cellulose polymer derivatives, including
   methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC),
   sodium-carboxymethylcellulose (sodium-CMC), and
   cationic-hydroxyethylcellulose (cationic-HEC), for use as an excipient
   to enhance drug delivery in nasal spray formulations was investigated.
   Three main parameters for evaluating the polymers in nasal drug delivery
   applications include rheology, ciliary beat frequency (CBF), and
   permeation across nasal tissue. Reversible thermally induced viscosity
   enhancement was observed at near nasal physiological temperature when
   cellulose derivatives were combined with an additional excipient,
   poly(vinyl caprolactam)-poly(vinyl acetate)-poly(ethylene glycol) graft
   copolymer (PVCL-PVA-PEG). Cationic-HEC was shown to enhance acyclovir
   permeation across the nasal mucosa. None of the tested cellulosic
   polymers caused any adverse effects on porcine nasal tissues and cells,
   as assessed by alterations in CBF. Upon an increase in polymer
   concentration, a reduction in CBF was observed when ciliated cells were
   immersed in the polymer solution, and this decrease returned to baseline
   when the polymer was removed. While each cellulose derivative exhibited
   unique advantages for nasal drug delivery applications, none stood out
   on their own to improve more than one of the performance characteristics
   examined. Hence, these data may be useful for the development of new
   cellulose derivatives in nasal drug formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The sarcomere of muscle is composed of tens of thousands of myosin
   motors that self-assemble into thick filaments and interact with
   surrounding actin-based thin filaments in a dense, near-crystalline
   hexagonal lattice(1). Together, these actin-myosin interactions enable
   large-scale movement and force generation, two primary attributes of
   muscle. Research on isolated fibres has provided considerable insight
   into the collective properties of muscle, but how actin-myosin
   interactions are coordinated in an ensemble remains poorly
   understood(2). Here, we show that artificial myosin filaments,
   engineered using a DNA nanotube scaffold, provide precise control over
   motor number, type and spacing. Using both dimeric myosin V- and myosin
   VI-labelled nanotubes, we find that neither myosin density nor spacing
   has a significant effect on the gliding speed of actin filaments. This
   observation supports a simple model of myosin ensembles as energy
   reservoirs that buffer individual stochastic events to bring about
   smooth, continuous motion. Furthermore, gliding speed increases with
   cross-bridge compliance, but is limited by Brownian effects. As a first
   step to reconstituting muscle motility, we demonstrate human

Abstract = {{Motivation: Modeling regulatory networks using expression data observed
   in a differentiation process may help identify context-specific
   interactions. The outcome of the current algorithms highly depends on
   the quality and quantity of a single time-course dataset, and the
   performance may be compromised for datasets with a limited number of
   samples.
   Results: In this work, we report a multi-layer graphical model that is
   capable of leveraging many publicly available time-course datasets, as
   well as a cell lineage-specific data with small sample size, to model
   regulatory networks specific to a differentiation process. First, a
   collection of network inference methods are used to predict the
   regulatory relationships in individual public datasets. Then, the
   inferred directional relationships are weighted and integrated together
   by evaluating against the cell lineage-specific dataset. To test the
   accuracy of this algorithm, we collected a time-course RNA-Seq dataset
   during human erythropoiesis to infer regulatory relationships specific
   to this differentiation process. The resulting erythroid-specific
   regulatory network reveals novel regulatory relationships activated in
   erythropoiesis, which were further validated by genome-wide TR4 binding
   studies using ChIP-seq. These erythropoiesis-specific regulatory
   relationships were not identifiable by single dataset-based methods or
   context-independent integrations. Analysis of the predicted targets
   reveals that they are all closely associated with hematopoietic lineage
   differentiation.}},

   telescoping manipulator is also investigated. It is shown that several
   passive input-output maps exist. In particular, by a suitable
   redefinition of the inputs and outputs, a modified tip-based control is
   made possible. The model is validated through numerical simulation, and
   the tip-based control is compared with joint-based control. Simulation
   results show that tip-based control has better closed-loop performance

Abstract = {{This paper presents algorithms to compute the generalized distance
   between two separated or penetrating compact convex sets, which is
   defined as the minimum or maximum scale factor of a given gauge set such
   that the scaled gauge set intersects or is contained in the Minkowski
   difference of the two sets. The traditional Euclidean distance is a
   special case where the origin-centered unit ball is used as the gauge
   set. While the generalized distance was proposed almost a decade ago,
   the only practical method for its computation has been general-purpose
   numerical optimization, which is computationally expensive. In contrast,
   our geometry-based algorithms are efficient and guarantee globally
   optimal solutions. Important applications of the algorithms in robotics
   include collision detection and grasp planning. The algorithm for
   computing the penetration distance also provides an accurate and
   efficient approach to flatness error evaluation, which is a fundamental
   problem in manufacturing. We demonstrate that our algorithms possess

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel design strategy for the capacitor voltage
   control of a Z-source inverter (ZSI) to overcome the complexity and
   control performance degradation involved with the conventional
   small-signal model-based controls. In the proposed approach, the
   Z-network capacitor voltage of the ZSI is controlled through the average
   capacitor current over a switching period, and thus, the dynamics of the
   Z-network capacitor voltage can be easily controlled. To make this
   happen, the average capacitor current model is derived based on an
   important finding that the average capacitor current can be indirectly
   controlled through the average Z-network inductor current. For the inner
   Z-network inductor current control, the average voltage model of the
   inductor is developed to control the average inductor voltage directly
   via the shoot-through duty ratio of the ZSI. In this way, the current
   control dynamics can be linearised over an entire operating range and
   the desired bandwidth of each controller can be simply obtained using
   only Z-network parameters without a gain tuning process unlike the
   small-signal model-based controls. Thus, the proposed method can
   simplify the design process while producing an excellent control
   performance. The simulation and experimental results verify that the
   transient responses exactly coincide with the desired design goal.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Quadriceps strength and activation deficits after anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) injury or surgery are typically evaluated at joint
   positions that are biomechanically advantageous to the quadriceps
   muscle. However, the effect of knee joint position and the associated
   changes in muscle length on strength and activation is currently unknown
   in this population. Here, we examined the effect of knee angle on
   quadriceps strength, activation, and electrically evoked torque in
   individuals with ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, we evaluated whether
   knee angle mediated the relationship between quadriceps weakness and
   functional performance after ACL reconstruction. Knee strength and
   activation were tested bilaterally at 90 degrees and 45 degrees of knee
   flexion in 11 subjects with ACL reconstruction using an interpolated
   triplet technique. The magnitude of electrically evoked torque at rest
   was used to quantify peripheral muscle contractile property changes, and
   the single-leg hop for distance test was used to evaluate functional
   performance. The results indicated that although quadriceps strength
   deficits were similar between knee angles, voluntary activation deficits
   were significantly higher in the reconstructed leg at 45 degrees of knee
   flexion. On the contrary, the side-to-side evoked torque at rest ratio
   {[}i.e., (reconstructed/nonreconstructed) X 100] was significantly lower
   at 90 degrees than at 45 degrees of knee flexion. The association
   between quadriceps strength and functional performance was stronger at
   45 degrees of knee flexion. The results provide novel evidence that
   quadriceps activation is selectively affected at 45 degrees of knee

Abstract = {{We present novel micropumps and valves actuated by osmotic flow for
   point-of-care (POC) applications. Although there has been significant
   progress in the development of microfluidic flowcontrol components, such
   as fluidic switches, diodes, and resonators, the flow needs to be
   ultimately supplied by bulky off-chip active components. These off-chip
   components cannot be easily miniaturized integrated micropumps that
   utilize electrostatic, piezoelectric, or electroosmotic actuation
   require high operational voltages, limiting their applications. Other
   novel approaches, such as magnetic actuation and liquid metal pumping,
   are also limited by their nonstandard processes and biocompatibility. In
   this paper, we report two active components, control valves and fluid
   pumps, actuated by osmotic mechanism, allowing completely stand-alone
   integrated microfluidic systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first attempt to realize control valves by osmosis. The valve can
   maintain robust sealing up to 125 kPa of back pressure. The fabricated
   osmotic pump is capable of pumping at >30 mu L/min, which is higher than
   that of previous works by an order of magnitude. To demonstrate the
   feasibility of manipulating biofluids, white blood cells suspended in
   serum were driven and filtered by osmotic actuation. The experimental
   results verified the potential use of osmotic actuation for POC
   disposable microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{A time-domain body exact strip theory is developed to predict
   maneuvering of a vessel in a seaway. A frame following the instantaneous

   perturbation potentials. A boundary integral technique is used for
   solving the Laplace equation. Linearized free surface boundary
   conditions are used for stability and computational efficiency, and
   exact body boundary conditions are used to capture nonlinear effects. A
   nonlinear rigid body equation of motion solver is coupled to the
   hydrodynamic model to predict ship responses. Results are presented for
   the turning circle maneuver of the containership S-175 in calm water and
   in the presence of regular waves. The results are compared with

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Because there can be no delay in providing identification
   wristbands to newborns, some hospitals assign newborns temporary first
   names such as Babyboy or Babygirl. These nondistinct naming conventions
   result in a large number of patients with similar identifiers in NICUs.
   To determine the level of risk associated with nondistinct naming
   conventions, we performed an intervention study to evaluate if assigning
   distinct first names at birth would result in a reduction in
   wrong-patient errors.
   METHODS: We conducted a 2-year before/after implementation study to
   examine the effect of a distinct naming convention that incorporates the
   mother's first name into the newborn's first name (eg, Wendysgirl) on
   the incidence of wrong-patient errors. We used the Retract-and-Reorder
   (RAR) tool, an established, automated tool for detecting the outcome of
   wrong-patient electronic orders. The RAR tool identifies orders placed
   on a patient that are retracted within 10 minutes and then placed by the
   same clinician on a different patient within the next 10 minutes.
   RESULTS: The reduction in RAR events post-versus preintervention was
   36.3\%. After accounting for clusters of orders within order sessions,
   the odds ratio of an RAR event post-versus preintervention was 0.64
   (95\% confidence interval: 0.42-0.97).
   CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that nondistinct naming
   conventions are associated with an increased risk of wrong-patient
   errors and that this risk can be mitigated by changing to a more
   distinct naming convention.}},

Abstract = {{Oversaturated intersection control is a long-standing problem in traffic
   science and engineering. The problem becomes even harder when we
   consider a system of oversaturated intersections. Most of the research
   works in this area are off-line studies that require fully knowledge of
   origin-destination demand, which would be difficult to obtain in
   reality. Although several on-line feedback control methods are proposed,
   they only aim at preventing queue spillover, not able to minimize
   vehicular delay time. Moreover, these on-line control strategies are not
   theoretically evaluated how optimal (or sub-optimal) they are. We
   propose in this paper a quasi-optimal decentralized QUEUE-based feedback
   (abbreviated as QUEUE) control strategy for a system of oversaturated
   intersections. The QUEUE strategy is applied cycle-by-cycle based on
   measurement of current queue sizes, but its overall result is able to
   approximate the optimal one derived from off-line studies. Details of
   the feedback control laws for upstream and downstream intersections, in
   the queueing period and the queue dissipation period, are discussed.
   Superior to the existing feedback control strategies, the upper bounds
   of sub-optimality of the QUEUE strategy generating from demand
   fluctuation and coupling of intersections are specified quantitatively.
   It is also theoretically proved that the queue measurement error or
   demand estimation error would not be amplified by the QUEUE strategy.
   Numerical examples show that the QUEUE strategy performs very well and
   is robust to errors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an ultra-low-power oscillator designed for wake-up
   timers in compact wireless sensors. In a conventional relaxation
   oscillator, a capacitor periodically resets to a fixed voltage using a
   continuous comparator, thereby generating an output clock. The reset is
   triggered by a continuous comparator and thus the clock period is
   dependent on the delay of the continuous comparator which therefore
   needs to be fast compared to the period, making this approach power
   hungry. To avoid the power penalty of a fast continuous comparator, a
   constant charge subtraction scheme is proposed in this paper. As a
   constant amount of charge is subtracted for each cycle, rather than
   discharging/charging the capacitor to a fixed voltage, the clock period
   becomes independent of comparator delay. Therefore, the high power
   continuous comparator can be replaced with a coarse clocked comparator,
   facilitating low-power time tracking. For precise wake-up signal
   generation, an accurate continuous comparator is only enabled for one
   clock period at the end of the specified wakeup time. A wake-up timer
   using the proposed scheme is fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process. The
   timer consumes 5.8 nW at room temperature with temperature stability of
   45 ppm/degrees C (-10 degrees C to 90 degrees C) and line sensitivity of
   1\%/V (1.2 V to 2.2 V).}},

Abstract = {{We develop a method for integrating and coordinating two groups of
   actuators, each with a non-modifiable unconstrained state-feedback
   controller. The coordination strategy enforces constraints and minimizes
   the usage of one of the actuator groups, which is ``expensive{''}, due
   to operating costs or undesired side effects. By using the maximum
   constraint admissible set for each controller in closed-loop with the
   plant, the coordination scheme modulates the action of the assigned
   controllers and minimizes the usage of the expensive actuators. The
   proposed control strategy enforces constraints, stabilizes the system,
   and uses the expensive actuators for finite time and only to avoid
   constraint violation.}},
