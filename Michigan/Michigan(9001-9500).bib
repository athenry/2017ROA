Title = {{Mapping of CO2 at high spatiotemporal resolution using satellite
   observations: Global distributions from OCO-2}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Satellite observations of CO2 offer new opportunities to improve our
   understanding of the global carbon cycle. Using such observations to
   infer global maps of atmospheric CO2 and their associated uncertainties
   can provide key information about the distribution and dynamic behavior
   of CO2, through comparison to atmospheric CO2 distributions predicted
   from biospheric, oceanic, or fossil fuel flux emissions estimates
   coupled with atmospheric transport models. Ideally, these maps should be
   at temporal resolutions that are short enough to represent and capture
   the synoptic dynamics of atmospheric CO2. This study presents a
   geostatistical method that accomplishes this goal. The method can
   extract information about the spatial covariance structure of the CO2
   field from the available CO2 retrievals, yields full coverage (Level 3)
   maps at high spatial resolutions, and provides estimates of the
   uncertainties associated with these maps. The method does not require
   information about CO2 fluxes or atmospheric transport, such that the
   Level 3 maps are informed entirely by available retrievals. The approach
   is assessed by investigating its performance using synthetic OCO-2 data
   generated from the PCTM/GEOS-4/CASA-GFED model, for time periods ranging
   from 1 to 16 days and a target spatial resolution of 1 degrees latitude
   x 1.25 degrees longitude. Results show that global CO2 fields from OCO-2
   observations can be predicted well at surprisingly high temporal
   resolutions. Even one- day Level 3 maps reproduce the large- scale
   features of the atmospheric CO2 distribution, and yield realistic
   uncertainty bounds. Temporal resolutions of two to four days result in
   the best performance for a wide range of investigated scenarios,
   providing maps at an order of magnitude higher temporal resolution
   relative to the monthly or seasonal Level 3 maps typically reported in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a nonlinear mathematical model is developed based on
   the physiology of the cochlea of the guinea pig. The three-dimensional
   intracochlear fluid dynamics are coupled to a micromechanical model of
   the organ of Corti and to electrical potentials in the cochlear ducts
   and outer hair cells (OHC). OHC somatic electromotility is modeled by
   linearized piezoelectric relations whereas the OHC hair-bundle
   mechanoelectrical transduction current is modeled as a nonlinear
   function of the hair-bundle deflection. The steady-state response of the
   cochlea to a single tone is simulated in the frequency domain using an
   alternating frequency time scheme. Compressive nonlinearity, harmonic
   distortion, and DC shift on the basilar membrane (BM), tectorial
   membrane (TM), and OHC potentials are predicted using a single set of
   parameters. The predictions of the model are verified by comparing
   simulations to available in vivo experimental data for basal cochlear
   mechanics. In particular, the model predicts more amplification on the
   reticular lamina (RL) side of the cochlear partition than on the BM,
   which replicates recent measurements. Moreover, small harmonic
   distortion and DC shifts are predicted on the BM, whereas more
   significant harmonic distortion and DC shifts are predicted in the RL
   and TM displacements and in the OHC potentials.}},

   dielectric-barrier discharges: sputtering of lipid-like surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{The application of atmospheric pressure plasmas to human tissue has been
   shown to have therapeutic effects for wound healing and in treatment of
   skin diseases. These effects are attributed to production of UV photon
   fluxes, electric fields and beneficial radicals which intersect with
   biological reaction chains, and to energetic ions bombarding the
   surface. In this paper we report on results from a computational
   investigation of the ion energy and angular distributions (IEADs) in a
   dielectric-barrier discharge sustained in air incident directly on cell
   membranes for small dry and wet wounds in human skin. We found that ion
   energies in excess of 20-30 eV can be delivered onto cell membranes of
   dry wounds, and up to 60 eV onto the liquid interface of the wet wound.
   The details of the IEADs depend on the orientation of the cell membrane
   and on the relative location of the plasma streamer to the wound. Using
   results from a molecular dynamics simulation of ion sputter
   probabilities of typical lipid-like material, we show that prolonged
   exposure of the cell membrane to such IEADs can produce significant
   carbon removal.}},

Title = {{Properties of resistant cells generated from lung cancer cell lines
   treated with EGFR inhibitors}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays an
   important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and therapeutics
   targeted against EGFR have been effective in treating a subset of
   patients bearing somatic EFGR mutations. However, the cancer eventually
   progresses during treatment with EGFR inhibitors, even in the patients
   who respond to these drugs initially. Recent studies have identified
   that the acquisition of resistance in approximately 50\% of cases is due
   to generation of a secondary mutation (T790M) in the EGFR kinase domain.
   In about 20\% of the cases, resistance is associated with the
   amplification of MET kinase. In the remaining 30-40\% of the cases, the
   mechanism underpinning the therapeutic resistance is unknown.
   Methods: An erlotinib resistant subline (H1650-ER1) was generated upon
   continuous exposure of NSCLC cell line NCI-H1650 to erlotinib. Cancer
   stem cell like traits including expression of stem cell markers,
   enhanced ability to self-renew and differentiate, and increased
   tumorigenicity in vitro were assessed in erlotinib resistant H1650-ER1
   cells.
   Results: The erlotinib resistant subline contained a population of cells
   with properties similar to cancer stem cells. These cells were found to
   be less sensitive towards erlotinib treatment as measured by cell
   proliferation and generation of tumor spheres in the presence of
   erlotinib.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in cases of NSCLC accompanied by
   mutant EGFR, treatment targeting inhibition of EGFR kinase activity in
   differentiated cancer cells may generate a population of cancer cells
   with stem cell properties.}},

Abstract = {{A transition from cavity-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW) to
   rectangular waveguide using a short-circuited pin in conjunction with
   resonant sections of coplanar waveguide (CPW) and reduced height
   waveguide segments is presented. The proposed transition is designed
   with prismatic features in order to ease the fabrication process. An
   equivalent circuit model is developed to facilitate the design procedure
   and full-wave analysis is used to optimise the design. As an example a
   transition operating at Ka-band is designed and shown to have insertion
   loss of less than 1 dB and reflection below - 10 dB over 9\% of
   bandwidth for a back-to-back structure. To further validate the results
   a prototype transition at Ka-band for a standard WR-28 rectangular
   waveguide was fabricated and tested. The measured S-parameters of the
   prototype show a very good agreement with the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the oxygen vacancy (F center) in MgO has been aggravated by
   the fact that the positively charged and the neutral vacancy (F+ and
   F-0, respectively) absorb at practically identical energies. Here we
   apply many-body perturbation theory in the G(0)W(0) approximation and
   the Bethe-Salpeter approach to calculate the optical absorption and
   emission spectrum of the oxygen vacancy in all three charge states. We
   observe unprecedented agreement between the calculated and the
   experimental optical absorption spectra for the F-0 and F+ center. Our
   calculations reveal that not only the absorption but also the emission
   spectra of different charge states peak at nearly the same energy, which
   leads to a reinterpretation of the F center's optical properties.}},

Abstract = {{The tensor-structured methods developed recently for the accurate
   calculation of the Hattree and the non-local exchange operators have
   been applied successfully to the ab initio numerical solution of the
   Hartree-Fock equation for some molecules. In the present work, we show
   that the rank-structured representation can be gainfully applied to the
   accurate approximation of the electron density of large Aluminium
   clusters. We consider the Tucker-type decomposition of the electron
   density of certain Aluminium clusters originating from finite element
   calculations in the framework of the orbital-free density functional
   theory. Numerical investigations of the Tucker approximation of the
   corresponding electron density reveal the exponential decay of the
   approximation error with respect to the Tucker rank. The resulting
   low-rank tensor representation reduces dramatically the storage needs
   and the computational complexity of the consequent tensor operations on
   the electron density. As main result, the rank of the Tucker
   approximation for the accurate representation of the electron density is
   small and only weakly dependent on the system size for the systems
   studied here. This shows good promise for resolving the electronic
   structure of materials using tensor-structured techniques. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{We propose a closed form formulation for the impedance of the

   thin dielectric layer, the surface waves on both interfaces are strongly
   coupled resulting in an almost linear dependence of the impedance of the
   plasmonic transmission line on the thickness of the insulator layer. On
   the other hand, for very thick insulator layer, the impedance does not
   vary with the insulator layer thickness due to the
   weak-coupling/decoupling of the surface waves on each metal-insulator
   interface. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed formulation
   using two test scenarios, namely, almost zero reflection in T-junction
   and reflection from line discontinuity in the design of Bragg
   reflectors, where we compare our formulation against previously

Abstract = {{Contaminant removal from drinking water sources under reducing
   conditions conducive for the growth of denitrifying, arsenate reducing,
   and sulfate reducing microbes using a fixed-bed bioreactor may require
   oxygen-free gas (e.g., N-2 gas) during backwashing. However, the use of
   air-assisted backwashing has practical advantages, including simpler
   operation, improved safety, and lower cost. A study was conducted to
   evaluate whether replacing N-2 gas with air during backwashing would
   impact performance in a nitrate and arsenic removing anaerobic
   bioreactor system that consisted of two biologically active carbon
   reactors in series. Gas-assisted backwashing, comprised of 2 min of gas
   injection to fluidize the bed and dislodge biomass and solid phase
   products, was performed in the first reactor (reactor A) every two days.
   The second reactor (reactor B) was subjected to N-2 gas-assisted
   backwashing every 3-4 months. Complete removal of 50 mg/L NO3- was
   achieved in reactor A before and after the switch from N-2-assisted
   backwashing (NAB) to air-assisted backwashing (AAB). Substantial sulfate
   removal was achieved with both backwashing strategies. Prolonged
   practice of AAB (more than two months), however, diminished sulfate
   reduction in reactor B somewhat. Arsenic removal in reactor A was
   impacted slightly by long-term use of AAB, but arsenic removals achieved
   by the entire system during NAB and AAB periods were not significantly
   different (p > 0.05) and arsenic concentrations were reduced from
   approximately 200 mu g/L to below 20 mu g/L. These results indicate that
   AAB can be implemented in anaerobic nitrate and arsenic removal systems.

Abstract = {{Results of high throughput experiments can be challenging to interpret.
   Current approaches have relied on bulk processing the set of expression
   levels, in conjunction with easily obtained external evidence, such as
   co-occurrence. While such techniques can be used to reason
   probabilistically, they are not designed to shed light on what any
   individual gene, or a network of genes acting together, may be doing.
   Our belief is that today we have the information extraction ability and
   the computational power to perform more sophisticated analyses that
   consider the individual situation of each gene. The use of such
   techniques should lead to qualitatively superior results.
   The specific aim of this project is to develop computational techniques
   to generate a small number of biologically meaningful hypotheses based
   on observed results from high throughput microarray experiments, gene
   sequences, and next-generation sequences. Through the use of relevant
   known biomedical knowledge, as represented in published literature and
   public databases, we can generate meaningful hypotheses that will aide
   biologists to interpret their experimental data.
   We are currently developing novel approaches that exploit the rich
   information encapsulated in biological pathway graphs. Our methods
   perform a thorough and rigorous analysis of biological pathways, using
   complex factors such as the topology of the pathway graph and the
   frequency in which genes appear on different pathways, to provide more
   meaningful hypotheses to describe the biological phenomena captured by
   high throughput experiments, when compared to other existing methods
   that only consider partial information captured by biological pathways.}},

Abstract = {{We redevelop a theoretical model that, in conjunction with atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), can be used as a noninvasive method for determination
   of the elastic modulus of a polymer nanodroplet residing on a flat,
   rigid substrate. The model is a continuum theory that combines surface
   and elasticity theories for prediction of the droplet's elastic modulus,
   given experimental measurement of its adsorbed height. Utilization of
   AFM-measured heights for relevant droplets reported in the literature
   and from our own experiments illustrated the following: the significance
   of both surface and elasticity effects in determining a polymer
   droplet's spreading behavior; the extent of a continuum theory's
   validity as one approaches the nanoscale; and a droplet size effect on
   the elastic modulus.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an arrangement of bistable composites combined with
   piezoelectrics for broadband energy harvesting of ambient vibrations.
   These non-linear devices have improved power generation over
   conventional resonant systems and can be designed to occupy smaller

   based on optimization of bistable composites that enables improved
   electrical power generation by discovering the optimal configurations
   for harvesting based on the statics of the device. The optimal device
   aspect ratio, thickness, stacking sequence, and piezoelectric area are
   considered. Increased electrical output is found for geometries and

Abstract = {{A polycrystalline Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film was deposited on fused quartz by
   co-evaporation. The selected thickness was similar to 100 nm to avoid
   artifacts in its optical properties caused by thicker as-grown films.
   The composition and phase of the film were checked with x-ray
   fluorescence, Raman shift spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron
   microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. An improved
   spectroscopic ellipsometry methodology with two-side measurement
   geometries was applied to extract the complex dielectric function
   epsilon = epsilon(1) + i epsilon(2) of the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film between
   0.73 and 6.5 eV. Five critical points were observed, at 1.32
   (fundamental band gap), 2.92, 3.92, 4.96, and 5.62 eV, respectively. The
   epsilon spectra are in reasonable agreement with those from theoretical

Abstract = {{Nuclear accidents that lead to melting of a reactor core create
   heterogeneous materials containing hundreds of radionuclides, many with
   short half-lives. The long-lived fission products and transuranium
   elements within damaged fuel remain a concern for millennia. Currently,
   accurate fundamental models for the prediction of release rates of
   radionuclides from fuel, especially in contact with water, after an
   accident remain limited. Relatively little is known about fuel corrosion
   and radionuclide release under the extreme chemical, radiation, and
   thermal conditions during and subsequent to a nuclear accident. We
   review the current understanding of nuclear fuel interactions with the
   environment, including studies over the relatively narrow range of
   geochemical, hydrological, and radiation environments relevant to
   geological repository performance, and discuss priorities for research
   needed to develop future predictive models.}},

Abstract = {{The correlation between the molecular design of a conjugated
   polyelectrolyte (CPE) and its aggregated structure and the emissive
   properties in water is systematically investigated by means of UVvis
   spectrometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning/transmission
   electron microscopy. Five different and rationally designed CPEs having
   carboxylic acid side chains are synthesized. All five conjugated
   polyelectrolytes are seemingly completely soluble in water in visual
   observation. However, their quantum yields are dramatically different,
   changing from 0.45 to 51.4\%. Morphological analysis by electron
   microscopy combined with fluorescence spectrophotometry reveals that the
   CPEs form self-assembled aggregates at the nanoscale depending on the
   nature of their side chains. The feature of the self-assembled
   aggregates directly determines the emissive property of the CPEs. The
   nature and the length of the spacer between the carboxylic acid group
   and the CPE backbone have a strong influence on the quantum yield of the
   CPEs. Our study demonstrates that bulky and hydrophilic side chains and
   spacers are required to achieve complete water-solubility and high
   quantum yield of CPEs in water, providing an important molecular design
   principle to develop functional CPEs.}},

Abstract = {{The redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33 protects organisms against oxidative
   stress that leads to protein unfolding. Activation of Hsp33 is triggered
   by the oxidative unfolding of its own redox-sensor domain, making Hsp33
   a member of a recently discovered class of chaperones that require
   partial unfolding for full chaperone activity. Here we address the
   long-standing question of how chaperones recognize client proteins. We
   show that Hsp33 uses its own intrinsically disordered regions to
   discriminate between unfolded and partially structured folding
   intermediates. Binding to secondary structure elements in client
   proteins stabilizes Hsp33's intrinsically disordered regions, and this
   stabilization appears to mediate Hsp33's high affinity for structured
   folding intermediates. Return to nonstress conditions reduces Hsp33's
   disulfide bonds, which then significantly destabilizes the bound client
   proteins and in doing so converts them into less-structured,
   folding-competent client proteins of ATP-dependent foldases. We propose
   a model in which energy-independent chaperones use internal
   order-to-disorder transitions to control substrate binding and release.}},

   This size was chosen since it was representative of typical red blood
   cells. The experimental results and numerical calculations match each

Abstract = {{We study the problem of (re) designing the regional network by which
   cadaveric livers are allocated. Whereas prior research focused mainly on
   maximizing a measure of efficiency of the network that was based on
   aggregate patient survival, we explicitly account for the trade-off
   between efficiency and a measure of geographical equity in the
   allocation process. To this end, we extend earlier optimization models
   to incorporate both objectives and develop an exact branch-and-price
   approach to solve this problem, generalizing a solution approach studied
   for the case where only efficiency is taken into account. In addition,
   we propose an effective solution algorithm that approximates the
   (generally nonconcave) frontier of Pareto-efficient solutions with
   respect to the two objectives by simultaneously generating and
   successively improving upper and lower bounds on this frontier. We
   implement and test our approach on observed data and show that solutions
   significantly dominating the current configuration in both efficiency
   and equity can be found. Of course, other subjective criteria are needed
   to choose among the different Pareto-efficient candidate solutions.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The preponderance of research toward improving embryo development in
   vitro has focused on manipulation of the chemical soluble environment,
   including altering basic salt composition, energy substrate
   concentration, amino acid make-up, and the effect of various growth
   factors or addition or subtraction of other supplements. In contrast,
   relatively little work has been done examining the physical requirements
   of preimplantation embryos and the role culture platforms or devices can
   play in influencing embryo development within the laboratory. The goal
   of this review is not to reevaluate the soluble composition of past and
   current embryo culture media, but rather to consider how other
   controlled and precise factors such as time, space, mechanical
   interactions, gradient diffusions, cell movement, and surface
   interactions might influence embryo development. Novel culture platforms
   are being developed as a result of interdisciplinary collaborations
   between biologists and biomedical, material, chemical, and mechanical
   engineers. These approaches are looking beyond the soluble media
   composition and examining issues such as media volume and embryo
   spacing. Furthermore, methods that permit precise and regulated dynamic
   embryo culture with fluid flow and embryo movement are now available,
   and novel culture surfaces are being developed and tested. While several
   factors remain to be investigated to optimize the efficiency of embryo
   production, manipulation of the embryo culture microenvironment through
   novel devices and platforms may offer a pathway toward improving embryo
   development within the laboratory of the future.}},

Abstract = {{The design of microarrays is currently based on studies focusing on DNA
   hybridization reaction in bulk solution. However, the presence of a
   surface to which the probe strand is attached can make the
   solution-based approximations invalid, resulting in sub-optimum
   hybridization conditions. To determine the effect of surfaces on DNA
   duplex formation, the authors studied the dependence of DNA melting
   temperature (Tm) on target concentration. An automated system was
   developed to capture the melting profiles of a 25-mer perfect-match
   probetarget pair initially hybridized at 23 degrees C. Target
   concentrations ranged from 0.0165 to 15 nM with different probe amounts
   (0.030.82 pmol on a surface area of 1018 angstrom 2), a constant probe
   density (5 x 1012 molecules/cm2) and spacer length (15 dT). The authors
   found that Tm for duplexes anchored to a surface is lower than
   in-solution, and this difference increases with increasing target
   concentration. In a representative set, a target concentration increase
   from 0.5 to 15 nM with 0.82 pmol of probe on the surface resulted in a
   Tm decrease of 6 degrees C when compared with a 4 degrees C increase in
   solution. At very low target concentrations, a multi-melting process was
   observed in low temperature domains of the curves. This was attributed
   to the presence of truncated or mismatch probes. (c) 2012 American

Abstract = {{A novel high-gain low-profile miniaturized antenna with omnidirectional
   vertically polarized radiation, similar to a short dipole is presented.
   The proposed design focus is on increasing the gain and improving the
   polarization purity of the radiated field in the horizontal plane. The
   gain and polarization improvement are achieved by isolating the feed
   structure from a miniaturized resonant radiating structure composed of
   an in-plane capacitor and a structurally embedded transformer. The
   antenna topology is developed, based on circuit model and through
   full-wave simulations the equivalence is established. The equivalent
   circuit model assists in the initial design, and then minor
   modifications are required to achieve the desired frequency of
   operation. The initial topology of the proposed antenna, the so-called
   Inductively Coupled Capacitively Loaded Monopole Antenna (ICCLMA),
   consists of two metal layers, a feeding pin and a shorting pin. The
   performance of the proposed antenna is compared to that of an ordinary
   inverted F antenna and a more recent low profile vertically polarized
   antenna (LMMMA) {[}1]. It is shown that the gain of ICCLMA is 9 dB and 4
   dB higher than that of the conventional inverted-F antenna and the
   LMMMA, respectively. To simplify the fabrication process a modified
   single-layer ICCLMA topology is presented and optimized. Finally, a
   design procedure to further reduce the lateral dimension of ICCLMA is
   presented. A procedure for accurate measurement of antennas with small
   ground planes is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{We present a variation of the electric-field volume integral equation

   S-parameter measurements. The kernel of the standard VIE is a dyadic
   Green's function that can relate fields in the object domain to observed
   scattered fields outside the object domain. Here, we derive a kernel we
   call a vector Green's function that gives, instead of observed fields,
   observed S-parameter measurements that would be obtained in a bistatic
   antenna setup. This formulation directly links the object properties to
   microwave measurements in a way that is useful to many microwave
   applications. This derivation uses an antenna model based on the
   source-scattering matrix formulation. We show how this vector Green's
   function can be obtained from simulation and validate this model with

Abstract = {{There are two approaches that can be used to model the large strain
   mechanical response of material systems in which elastic fibers are
   embedded in an elastic matrix. In the first approach, a fiber reinforced
   material undergoing large deformation is homogenized in the sense that
   it is assumed to act as an equivalent single material that is
   transversely isotropic and hyperelastic. Both constituents then share a
   common reference configuration, which is typically assumed to be a
   natural or stress-free configuration for the equivalent single material.
   The stress depends on a single deformation gradient defined with respect
   to the natural configuration.
   In the second approach, the fiber/matrix system is treated as a mixture,
   with the matrix and the fibrous constituents having their own reference
   configurations and material symmetries. The total stress depends on the
   deformation gradients and material symmetries for both constituents,
   defined with respect to their reference configurations.
   Under appropriate assumptions, the constitutive theory developed using
   mixture theory can coincide with the constitutive theory assuming an
   equivalent single material that is transversely isotropic and
   hyperelastic. This paper explores the connection between the two
   approaches by considering the various reference configurations and
   material symmetries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a multidisciplinary design-optimization approach is
   developed that integrates wing aerostructural design with
   control-system-design to reduce the critical structural stresses through
   load alleviation. The equations of motion are derived for a flexible
   aircraft and used to perform time-domain aeroservoelastic analysis. The
   aerostructural model couples a beam element structural model of the wing
   spar with a vortex-lattice model of the wing aerodynamics. The objective
   of the design-optimization problem is to maximize the endurance of a
   high-altitude long-endurance aircraft by varying wing planform
   parameters, structural sizing, and control gains simultaneously.
   Structural stress and steady-state control-error constraints are
   enforced for two dynamic flight conditions: a gust response and an
   altitude-change maneuver. The design-optimization results show that the
   aircraft that is optimized with the load-alleviation control system has
   an endurance that is 21.7\% higher than the aircraft that is optimized
   without the control system.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments have been performed on a nominal 100 ns rise time,
   MegaAmpere (MA)-class linear transformer driver to explore the
   magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability in planar geometry. Plasma
   loads consisted of ablated 400 nm-thick, 1 cm-wide aluminum foils
   located between two parallel-plate return-current electrodes. Plasma
   acceleration was adjusted by offsetting the position of the foil
   (cathode) between the anode plates. Diagnostics included double-pulse,
   sub-ns laser shadowgraphy, and machine current B-dot loops. Experimental
   growth rates for MRT on both sides of the ablated aluminum plasma slab
   were comparable for centered-foils. The MRT growth rate was fastest (98
   ns e-folding time) for the foil-offset case where there was a larger
   magnetic field to accelerate the plasma. Other cases showed slower
   growth rates with e-folding times of about similar to 106 ns. An
   interpretation of the experimental data in terms of an analytic MRT
   model is attempted. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Electronic systems on a chip increasingly suffer from component
   variation, voltage noise, thermal hotspots, and other subtle physical
   phenomena. Systems with reconfigurability have unique opportunities for
   adapting to such effects. Required, however, are low-cost, fine-grained
   methods for sensing physical parameters. This article presents powerful,
   novel approaches to online sensing, including methods for designing
   compact reconfigurable sensors, low-cost threshold detection, and
   several enhanced measurement procedures. Together, the approaches help
   enable systems to autonomously uncover a wealth of physical information.
   A highly efficient counter and improved ring oscillator are introduced,
   enabling an entire sensor node in just 8 Virtex-5 LUTs. We describe how
   variations can be measured in delay, temperature, switching-induced IR
   drop, and leakage-induced IR drop. We demonstrate the proposed approach
   with an experimental system based on a Virtex-5, instrumented with over
   100 sensors at an overhead of only 1.3\%. Results from thermally
   controlled experiments provide some surprising insights and illustrate
   the utility of the approach. Online sensing can help open the door to
   physically adaptive computing, including fine-grained power,

Abstract = {{This paper represents a new technique for equalization of phase
   velocities in coupled microstrip lines using Omega-shaped particles. In
   the first step, the initial idea is investigated by considering a
   homogenized model for the substrates, and the structure is analyzed
   using a developed numerical code. This analysis provides an overview in
   finding the proper orientation of the particles as well as examining the
   pseudochirality effect. It is demonstrated that placing the omega
   particles in a specific orientation inside the substrate leads to a
   remarkable increase in the phase velocity of odd modes and can provide
   the phase velocities equalization. In the second step, the proposed
   structure is simulated with few numbers of particles. The results
   confirm the considered effective medium for the substrate and the
   presented physical explanations. The dispersive characteristics of Omega
   particles found to be valuable in proposing a simple and yet efficient
   method for designing coupled line filters. This procedure is based on
   finding the dimensions of a conventional filter with a narrower
   bandwidth than the desired one. In order to validate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method, a third order Chebychev filter is designed on
   FR4 substrate and a suppression level higher than 60 dB is achieved.
   Finally, the proposed structure is fabricated and it is observed that
   the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulated data.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel consumption of traditional ground vehicles is significantly

   servo-loop control design of a Pulse-and-Gliding (PnG) strategy to
   minimize fuel consumption in automated car following. A switching-based
   framework is proposed for real-time implementation. The corresponding
   controller was synthesized for ideal conditions and subsequently
   enhanced to compensate for practical factors such as powertrain
   dynamics, speed variations, and plant uncertainties. Simulations in both
   uniform and naturalistic traffic flows demonstrate that, compared with a
   linear quadratic (LQ)-based benchmark controller, the PnG controller
   improves fuel economy up to 20\%. The significant fuel saving is
   achieved while maintaining precise range bounds so that the negative
   impact on safety/traffic flow is contained. The developed algorithm can
   potentially be embedded in adaptive cruise control systems to achieve

Abstract = {{The exact closed-form solution for freely vibrating annular thick plates
   is presented on the basis of the Reddy's higher-order shear deformation
   plate theory. Several combinations of classical boundary conditions
   including, free, soft simply supported, hard simply supported and
   clamped, are applied at the inner and outer edges of annular plates.
   Hamiltonian and minimum potential energy principles are employed to
   derive the equations of dynamic equilibrium and natural boundary
   conditions of the plate. To validate the accuracy and effectiveness of
   the present formulation, direct comparisons are made between our results
   and those from the literature. In parametric studies, the first eight
   natural frequencies of annular plates with different combinations of
   boundary conditions are tabulated for various values of the inner-outer
   radius ratios and thickness-radius ratios. A set of three-dimensional
   vibration mode shapes along with their corresponding contour plots are
   presented to illustrate transverse displacements of annular thick
   plates. Since the results of the present exact solution are the closest
   to those of exact three-dimensional elasticity solution, they can serve
   as a reliable benchmark for checking the accuracy of future numerical
   and analytical solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Unified analytical solution for dynamic elastic buckling of beams for
   various boundary conditions and loading rates}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-69}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The problem of dynamic elastic buckling of Euler-Bernoulli beams
   subjected to axial loads is studied analytically. The dynamic axial
   loading is accomplished by a constant displacement rate of one end of
   the beam with respect to the other. The axial loading rates are
   considered slow enough to obviate the need to account for axial wave
   propagation effects. The dynamics of the beam is formulated in the modal
   domain considering the lowest static buckling mode. The dynamic
   stability of the beam is investigated as a response problem assuming an
   initial deformed geometry in terms of an eccentricity favouring the mode
   shape. The governing partial differential equation is condensed into a
   unified ordinary differential equation for various boundary conditions
   using a single dimensionless parameter in terms of beam geometry,
   material properties, loading rate, and appropriate coefficients
   corresponding to different boundary conditions. The results obtained for
   the dynamic response of beams for various values of the dimensionless
   parameter and initial eccentricity suggest that the solutions can be
   combined into a single unified analytical expression for the dynamic
   buckling load. It is shown that the corresponding dynamic response
   curves can also be collapsed into a single curve using the dimensionless
   peak load and the associated time parameter. The accuracy of the unified
   analytical expression for dynamic buckling is verified against exact
   solution of the ordinary differential equation considering three
   problems in terms of dimensional quantities for different boundary
   conditions and loading rates. Further the validity of the single mode
   dynamic buckling formulation is examined by comparing the results
   obtained for various boundary conditions with the numerical results from
   the dynamic response of a large number of degree of freedom finite
   element model of the beam without any restriction on the deformation
   mode shape. This unified solution has potential application in optimum
   design for dynamic collapse of truss type structures subjected to
   dynamic loads. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic vaporization dynamics of a superheated dodecafluoropentane
   (DDFP) microdroplet inside a microtube and the resulting bubble
   evolution is investigated in the present work. This work is motivated by
   a developmental gas embolotherapy technique that is intended to treat
   cancers by infarcting tumors using gas bubbles. A combined theoretical
   and computational approach is utilized and compared with the experiments
   to understand the evolution process and to estimate the resulting stress
   distribution associated with vaporization event. The transient bubble
   growth is first studied by ultra-high speed imaging and then theoretical
   and computational modeling is used to predict the entire bubble
   evolution process. The evolution process consists of three regimes: an
   initial linear rapid spherical growth followed by a linear compressed
   oval shaped growth and finally a slow asymptotic nonlinear spherical
   bubble growth. Although the droplets are small compared to the tube
   diameter, the bubble evolution is influenced by the tube wall. The final
   bubble radius is found to scale linearly with the initial droplet radius
   and is approximately five times the initial droplet radius. A short
   pressure pulse with amplitude almost twice as that of ambient conditions
   is observed. The width of this pressure pulse increases with increasing
   droplet size whereas the amplitude is weakly dependent. Although the
   rise in shear stress along the tube wall is found to be under peak
   physiological limits, the shear stress amplitude is found to be more
   prominently influenced by the initial droplet size. The role of viscous
   dissipation along the tube wall and ambient bulk fluid pressure is found
   to be significant in bubble evolution dynamics. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Multilayer and single layer GaSb/GaAs(001) quantum dot structures were
   grown on an Sb-terminated (2 x 8) surface reconstruction and compared to
   those grown on an As-terminated (2 x 4) surface reconstruction. Uncapped
   quantum dots grown on the (2 x 8) surface were approximately 25\%
   smaller in diameter and had a larger width/height aspect ratio. Quantum
   dots grown on both surfaces were defect free at the quantum dot/spacer
   layer interface. The dots did not appear to be fully compact when imaged
   by transmission electron microscopy, which may be due to dissolution
   and/or quantum ring formation. The quantum dot photoluminescence peak
   for dots grown on the (2 x 8) surface was brighter but at the same
   energy as that of dots grown on the (2 x 4) surface. This was likely the
   result of a higher areal density of dots on the (2 x 8) surface and a
   lower tendency for them to intermix during capping, resulting in dots of
   similar size for both samples after capping. Quantum dots grown on the
   (2 x 8) surface also displayed greater morphological stability when
   quenched in the absence of Sb. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

   memories}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale resistive switching devices, sometimes termed memristors, have
   recently generated significant interest for memory, logic and
   neuromorphic applications. Resistive switching effects in
   dielectric-based devices are normally assumed to be caused by conducting
   filament formation across the electrodes, but the nature of the
   filaments and their growth dynamics remain controversial. Here we report
   direct transmission electron microscopy imaging, and structural and
   compositional analysis of the nanoscale conducting filaments. Through
   systematic ex-situ and in-situ transmission electron microscopy studies
   on devices under different programming conditions, we found that the
   filament growth can be dominated by cation transport in the dielectric
   film. Unexpectedly, two different growth modes were observed for the
   first time in materials with different microstructures. Regardless of
   the growth direction, the narrowest region of the filament was found to
   be near the dielectric/inert-electrode interface in these devices,
   suggesting that this region deserves particular attention for continued
   device optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with organ failure often suffer from increased morbidity and
   decreased quality of life. Current strategies of treating organ failure
   have limitations, including shortage of donor organs, low efficiency of
   grafts, and immunological problems. Tissue engineering emerged about two
   decades ago as a strategy to restore organ function with a living,
   functional engineered substitute. However, the ability to engineer a
   functional organ is limited by a limited understanding of the
   interactions between materials and cells that are required to yield
   functional tissue equivalents. Polymeric materials are one of the most
   promising classes of materials for use in tissue engineering, due to
   their biodegradability, flexibility in processing and property design,
   and the potential to use polymer properties to control cell function.
   Stem cells offer potential in tissue engineering because of their unique
   capacity to self-renew and differentiate into neurogenic, osteogenic,
   chondrogenic, and myogenic lineages under appropriate stimuli from
   extracellular components. This review examines recent advances in stem
   cell-polymer interactions for tissue regeneration, specifically
   highlighting control of polymer properties to direct adhesion,
   proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells, and how biomaterials
   can be designed to provide some of the stimuli to cells that the natural
   extracellular matrix does. (Part C) 96:63-81, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Tracks created by fission events in ceramics are randomly-oriented,
   linear radiation-damage regions about 10 to 25 pm in length but only
   several nm in diameter. In the absence of a method to observe the entire
   length of a latent, unetched track, the details of the structure and the
   process of the thermal-annealing of tracks have remained elusive,
   despite their importance to fission track thermochronology and radiation
   damage studies in nuclear materials. Here, we have used a novel sample
   preparation technique, together with advanced transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), to successfully image the entire length and in situ
   thermal annealing of latent tracks created by 80 MeV Xe ions implanted
   in apatite. Track annealing significantly increases as the track
   diameter decreases along the ion trajectory from an initial diameter of
   8.9 nm to similar to 1.5 nm at the end of the track (total track length
   similar to 8.1 mu m). For the first time, the initial, rapid reduction
   in etched length during isothermal annealing can be essentially
   explained by the rapid annealing of the sections of the track with
   smaller diameters, as observed directly by TEM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Space charge effects reduce electron emission by altering the surface
   barrier via two effects: increasing the barrier height (Schottky factor)
   and width to electron emission by lowering the surface field and
   changing the magnitude of the dipole associated with electron density
   variation. A one-dimensional emission model using a transit time
   argument to account for charge in the anode-cathode (AK) gap and an
   analytical model of the dipole is used to approximate the effects of
   each factor on the current density. The transit time model is compared
   to the experimental data of Longo {[}J. Appl. Phys. 94, 6966 (2003)] for
   thermal emission. Changes in the dipole contribution are primarily
   associated with tunneling and therefore field emission. The transit time
   plus dipole modification is compared to the experimental data of Barbour
   et al. {[}Phys. Rev. 92, 45 (1953)] for field emission. The model's
   application to thermal-field, and photoemission in general is discussed,
   with the former corresponding to continuous current limit and the latter
   to a pulsed current limit of the model. (C) 2012 American Institute of

   to an arterial segment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{575-586}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomer membranes are one of the most promising transducers
   for developing soft large strain sensors. In this article, we describe
   the sensor response for a potential biomedical application. It is widely
   accepted that diseased arteries at various stages have a unique
   constitutive response. This means that ideally the output of an in situ
   artery sensor would have distinct profiles corresponding to various
   stages of unhealthiness. An in situ sensor can potentially allow access
   to information about the mechanical state of the artery that is not
   currently available. Furthermore, the potential to combine the functions
   of providing structural support (stent) and monitoring the mechanical
   state (sensor) is appealing. Traditional sensors such as strain gages
   and piezoelectric sensors are stiff and fail at low strains (<1\%),
   whereas some dielectric elastomers are viable at strains up to and even
   surpassing 100\%. Investigating the electromechanical response of a
   deformable tube sensor sandwiched between a pulsating pressure source
   and a nonlinear elastic distensible thick wall has not been attempted
   before now. The successful development of a multiphysics model that
   correlates the electrical output of a pulsatile membrane sensor to its
   state of strain would be a significant breakthrough in medical
   diagnostics. The artery is described using a structural model for a
   tubular membrane reinforced with two families of initially crimped
   fibers subjected to a pulsating pressure profile. In this article, the
   fundamental mechanics associated with electromechanical coupling during
   dynamic finite deformations of dielectric elastomers is derived. A
   continuum model for the dynamic response of tubular dielectric elastomer
   membranes configured for sensing is presented. The pressure profile
   leads to a nonlinear response of the artery sensor due to the nonlinear
   deformation behavior of the arterial wall. At pressures above 13 kPa,
   the artery undergoes infinitesimal deformation, which leads to very
   small changes in the sensor signal. In this range, fabricating thinner
   sensors and synthesizing hybrid polymers with higher dielectric
   constants can enhance the sensitivity.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cadmium sulfide (CdS) films are used in solar cells, sensors and
   microelectronics. A variety of techniques, such as vapor based
   techniques, wet chemical methods and spray pyrolysis are frequently
   employed to develop adherent CdS films. In the present study, rapid
   deposition of CdS thin films via plasma spray route using a solution
   precursor was investigated, for the first time. Solution precursor
   comprising cadmium chloride, thiourea and distilled water was fed into a
   DC plasma jet via an axial atomizer to create ultrafine droplets for
   instantaneous and accelerated thermal decomposition in the plasma plume.
   The resulting molten/semi-molten ultrafine/nanoparticles of CdS
   eventually propel toward the substrate to form continuous CdS films. The
   chemistry of the solution precursor was found to be critical in plasma
   pyrolysis to control the stoichiometry and composition of the films.
   X-ray diffraction studies confirmed hexagonal alpha-CdS structure.
   Surface morphology and microstructures were investigated to compare with
   other synthesis techniques in terms of process mechanism and structural
   features. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed
   nanostructures in the atomized particulates. Optical measurements
   indicated a decreasing transmittance in the visible light with
   increasing the film thickness and band gap was calculated to be similar
   to 2.5 eV. The electrical resistivity of the films (0.243 +/- 0.188 x
   10(5) Omega cm) was comparable with the literature values. These
   nanostructured polycrystalline CdS films could be useful in sensing and
   solar applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   validation with laboratory experiments}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An eddy viscosity model to describe energy dissipation in
   two-dimensional breaking waves in deep water is implemented in a
   numerical model for the evolution of nonlinear surface waves and
   evaluated with experimental results. In the experiments, to develop a
   reliable eddy viscosity model, breaking waves are generated by both
   energy focusing and modulated wave groups. Local wave parameters prior
   to and following breaking are defined and then determined. Significant
   correlations between the pre-breaking and post-breaking parameters are
   identified and adopted in the eddy viscosity model. The numerical model
   detects automatically wave breaking onset based on local surface slope,
   determines pre-breaking local wave parameters, predicts post-breaking
   time and length scales, and estimates eddy viscosity to dissipate energy
   in wave breaking events. Numerical simulations with the model are
   performed and compared to the experiments. It is found that the model
   predicts well the total energy dissipation due to breaking waves. In
   addition, the computed surface elevations after wave breaking agree
   reasonably well with the measurements for the energy focusing (plunging)
   wave groups. However, for breaking wave groups due to modulational
   instability (plunging and spilling), a relatively large discrepancy
   between the surface elevation predictions and the experimental
   measurements is observed, in particular, at the downstream wave probe
   locations. This is possibly due to wave reflection and
   three-dimensionality in the experiments. To further validate the eddy
   viscosity model, the evolution of highly nonlinear irregular waves is
   studied numerically and the numerical solutions are compared with
   additional independent laboratory experiments for long-crested irregular
   waves. It is shown that the numerical model is capable of predicting the
   wave evolution subsequent to wave breaking. (C) 2012 American Institute

   estimate of 3-15\% for Western populations. Although it is increasingly
   acknowledged that central nervous system mechanisms contribute to pain
   amplification and chronicity in TMDs, further research is needed to
   unravel neural correlates that might abet the development of chronic
   pain.
   Objective.-The insular cortex (IC) and cingulate cortex (CC) are both
   critically involved in the experience of pain. The current study sought
   specifically to investigate IC-CC functional connectivity inTMD patients
   and healthy controls (HCs), both during resting state and during the
   application of a painful stimulus.
   Methods.-Eight patients with TMD, and 8 age-and sex-matched HCs were
   enrolled in the present study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
   data during resting state and during the performance of a pressure pain
   stimulus to the temple were acquired. Predefined seed regions were
   placed in the IC (anterior and posterior insular cortices) and the
   extracted signal was correlated with brain activity throughout the whole
   brain. Specifically, we were interested whether TMD patients and HCs
   would show differences in IC-CC connectivity, both during resting state
   and during the application of a painful stimulus to the face.
   Results.-As a main finding, functional connectivity analyses revealed an
   increased functional connectivity between the left anterior IC and
   pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) inTMD patients, during both
   resting state and applied pressure pain. Within the patient group, there
   was a negative correlation between the anterior IC-ACC connectivity and
   clinical pain intensity as measured by a visual analog scale.
   Conclusions.-Since the pregenual region of the ACC is critically
   involved in antinociception, we hypothesize that an increase in anterior
   IC-ACC connectivity is indicative of an adaptation of the pain
   modulatory system early in the chronification process.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical image reconstruction using penalized weighted least-squares
   (PWLS) criteria can improve image-quality in X-ray computed tomography
   (CT). However, the huge dynamic range of the statistical weights leads
   to a highly shift-variant inverse problem making it difficult to
   precondition and accelerate existing iterative algorithms that attack
   the statistical model directly. We propose to alleviate the problem by
   using a variable-splitting scheme that separates the shift-variant and
   ({''}nearly{''}) invariant components of the statistical data model and
   also decouples the regularization term. This leads to an equivalent
   constrained problem that we tackle using the classical
   method-of-multipliers framework with alternating minimization. The
   specific form of our splitting yields an alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with an inner-step involving a ``nearly{''}
   shift-invariant linear system that is suitable for FFT-based
   preconditioning using cone-type filters. The proposed method can
   efficiently handle a variety of convex regularization criteria including
   smooth edge-preserving regularizers and non-smooth sparsity-promoting
   ones based on the l(1)-norm and total variation. Numerical experiments
   with synthetic and real in vivo human data illustrate that cone-filter
   preconditioners accelerate the proposed ADMM resulting in fast
   convergence of ADMM compared to conventional (nonlinear conjugate
   gradient, ordered subsets) and state-of-the-art (MFISTA, split-Bregman)
   algorithms that are applicable for CT.}},

Abstract = {{Using Brownian dynamics simulations, without excluded volume and
   hydrodynamic interactions, on single polymer molecules represented by
   bead-spring models with stiff Fraenkel springs mimicking a single Kuhn
   step, we find multiple nonlinear regimes of deformation in shear flows
   that are controlled by the Peclet number (Pe), which is the shear rate
   times the relaxation time of a Kuhn step. We observe that, for all chain
   lengths investigated, the average stretch in the flow direction
   initially increases with increasing Pe, followed by saturation in chain
   stretch, as observed in previous studies. At even higher Pe, the stretch
   begins to decrease with increasing shear rate, in accordance with
   similar simulations of Sendner and Netz, Eur. Phys. J. E 30, 75-81
   (2009). At these rates, the trajectories reveal ``premature{''}
   recoiling of the chain before attaining a fully extended state during
   the phase of the ``tumbling orbit{''} in which the chain is stretching.
   An increasing stretch at even higher Pe is characterized by peculiar
   orientation ``locking{''} effects that may be sensitive to modeling
   details. We also show that the stretch predictions of coarse-grained
   springs agree well with those of the fine-grained chains until high
   shear rates are reached, where the flow perturbs the individual springs
   from equilibrium. (C) 2012 The Society of Rheology. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{How can an agent bootstrap up from a low-level representation to
   autonomously learn high-level states and actions using only
   domain-general knowledge? In this paper, we assume that the learning
   agent has a set of continuous variables describing the environment.
   There exist methods for learning models of the environment, and there
   also exist methods for planning. However, for autonomous learning, these
   methods have been used almost exclusively in discrete environments. We
   propose attacking the problem of learning high-level states and actions
   in continuous environments by using a qualitative representation to
   bridge the gap between continuous and discrete variable representations.
   In this approach, the agent begins with a broad discretization and
   initially can only tell if the value of each variable is increasing,
   decreasing, or remaining steady. The agent then simultaneously learns a
   qualitative representation (discretization) and a set of predictive
   models of the environment. These models are converted into plans to
   perform actions. The agent then uses those learned actions to explore
   the environment. The method is evaluated using a simulated robot with
   realistic physics. The robot is sitting at a table that contains a block
   and other distractor objects that are out of reach. The agent
   autonomously explores the environment without being given a task. After
   learning, the agent is given various tasks to determine if it learned
   the necessary states and actions to complete them. The results show that
   the agent was able to use this method to autonomously learn to perform
   the tasks.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated a clinical ``go/no-go{''} reaction time test (recognition
   RTclin) that is portable and does not require a computer, and used it to
   quantify the effect of age on recognition RTclin test scores. Fifty-two
   healthy adults 19-83 years old completed simple and recognition RT,
   testing. Simple RTclin was measured as the elapsed time from initial
   release of a suspended vertical shaft by the examiner until its arrest
   by participant pinch grip. Recognition RTclin was similar except that a
   light on the apparatus randomly illuminated in 50\% of the trials to
   signal the participant to arrest the device. To help interpret the lach
   results, we partitioned them into premovement time (PMT) and movement
   time (MT) using an optoelectronic camera system that is not ordinarily
   part of the RTclin test. Recognition RTclin, scores were significantly
   slower than simple RTclin scores, with 71\% of the prolongation
   attributable to Pm-r. While simple RTclin test scores correlated with
   age, recognition RTclin scores did not. A strong negative association
   between recognition RTclin accuracy and age was found. Recognition
   RTclin is feasible to measure in healthy adults and appears to represent
   a portable, computer-independent measure of cognitive processing speed
   and inhibitory capacity. Potential applications include assessment of
   brain injury, dementing illness, medication side effects, fall risk, and

Abstract = {{Following a brief history and definition, this paper focuses on the
   evolution, mostly over the past five decades, of ferrocement and thin
   cement-based composites which are defined here as having less than about
   50 mm in thickness. Although conventional reinforcements for these
   products are steel wire meshes or metal lath, new forms of
   reinforcements have emerged over the years with the objective of
   improving performance and minimizing total product cost. They include:
   (1) fiber reinforced polymeric (FRP) reinforcements (or textiles or
   fabrics) which use high performance fibers, such as carbon, Kevlar,
   Spectra and the like, (2) new steel unidirectional reinforcing mats made
   with extremely high strengths wires or strands, (3) 3D textiles or
   fabrics using polymeric fibers, (4) 3D textiles using combination of
   polymeric fibers and steel, and (5) reinforcement using shape-memory
   materials to induce self-stressing. Over the same period, the cement
   matrix has evolved enormously in its compressive strength and durability
   properties in the hardened state, and flow ability and ease of casting
   in the fresh state leading to new qualifications such as high strength
   or high performance, ultra high strength or ultra high performance,
   self-consolidating and self-compacting, etc. Adding fibers or
   micro-fibers to the cement matrix of ferrocement adds another dimension
   to the resulting composite as well as potential for improved
   performance. After describing the limits so far achieved using the above
   materials, the paper presents the current challenges and sets the limits
   to exceed in future developments.}},

Abstract = {{Chemokine CXCL12 (CXC chemokine ligand 12) signalling through CXCR (CXC
   chemokine receptor) 4 and CXCR7 has essential functions in development
   and underlies diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis and
   autoimmunity. Chemokines may form homodimers that regulate receptor
   binding and signalling, but previous studies with synthetic CXCL12 have
   produced conflicting evidence for homodimerization. We used
   bioluminescence imaging with GL (Gaussiu luciferase) fusions to
   investigate dimerization of CXCL12 secreted from mammalian cells. Using
   column chromatography and GL complementation, we established that CXCL12
   was secreted from mammalian cells as both monomers and dimers. Secreted
   CXCL12 also formed homodimers in the extracellular space. Monomeric
   CXCL12 preferentially activated CXCR4 signalling through G(alpha i) and
   Akt, whereas dimeric CXCL12 more effectively promoted recruitment of
   beta-arrestin 2 to CXCR4 and chemotaxis of CXCR4-expressing breast
   cancer cells. We also showed that CXCR7 preferentially sequestered
   monomeric CXCL12 from the extracellular space and had minimal effects on
   dimeric CXCL12 in cell-based assays and an orthotopic tumour xenograft
   model of human breast cancer. These studies establish that CXCL12
   secreted from mammalian cells forms homodimers under physiological
   conditions. Since monomeric and dimeric CXCL12 have distinct effects on
   cell signalling and function, our results have important implications
   for ongoing efforts to target CXCL12 pathways for therapy.}},

Title = {{Improved fiber distribution and mechanical properties of engineered
   cementitious composites by adjusting the mixing sequence}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{342-348}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) is a class of ultra ductile
   fiber reinforced cementitious composites, characterized by high
   ductility and tight crack width control. The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
   fiber with a diameter 39 mu m and a length of 6-12 mm is often used.
   Unlike plain concrete and normal fiber reinforced concrete. ECC shows a
   strain-hardening behavior under tensile load. Apart from the mix design,
   the fiber distribution is another crucial factor for the mechanical
   properties of ECC, especially the ductility. In order to obtain a good
   fiber distribution, the plastic viscosity of the ECC mortar before
   adding fibers needs to be controlled, for example, by adjusting
   water-to-powder ratio or chemical admixtures. However, such adjustments
   have some limitations and may result in poor mechanical properties of
   ECC. This research explores an innovative approach to improve the fiber
   distribution by adjusting the mixing sequence. With the standard mixing
   sequence, fibers are added after all solid and liquid materials are
   mixed. The undesirable plastic viscosity before the fiber addition may
   cause poor fiber distribution and results in poor hardened properties.
   With the adjusted mixing sequence, the mix of solid materials with the
   liquid material is divided into two steps and the addition of fibers is
   between the two steps. In this paper, the influence of different water
   mixing sequences is investigated by comparing the experimental results
   of the uniaxial tensile test and the fiber distribution analysis.
   Compared with the standard mixing sequence, the adjusted mixing sequence
   increases the tensile strain capacity and ultimate tensile strength of
   ECC and improves the fiber distribution. This concept is further applied
   in the development of ECC with high volume of sand. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Limited neural input results in muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease
   because of a reduction in the density of muscle innervation, the rate of
   neuromuscular junction activation or the efficiency of synaptic
   transmission(1). We developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin
   activator, CK-2017357, as a means to increase muscle strength by
   amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise
   diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease. Binding selectively to
   the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium
   release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium. As a
   consequence, the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts
   leftwards, as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle
   pair, so that CK-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in
   situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates. Notably, we show that
   sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves
   muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of
   single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease
   myasthenia gravis. Troponin activation may provide a new therapeutic
   approach to improve physical activity in diseases where neuromuscular
   function is compromised.}},

Title = {{Coupled modeling of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes including
   overland and channel flow}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{104-126}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A coupling framework between a hydrologic model and a hydrodynamic model
   has been developed. The resultant coupled model, tRIBS-OFM, considers
   spatially-distributed, physically-based hydrologic processes over the
   land-surface and subsurface by using the TIN (Triangulated Irregular
   Network)-Based Real Time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS); the
   hydrodynamic component is the overland flow model (OFM), which solves
   the two-dimensional Saint-Venant (shallow-water) equations using Roe's
   approximate Riemann solver on an unstructured grid. The original OFM
   formulation targeted hydraulic applications and did not provide an
   accurate solution for partially-submerged mesh cells. Modifications of
   the hydrodynamic model are presented here that affect the calculation of
   flux, bottom slope, and friction slope terms of the Saint-Venant
   formulation by applying a new method of reconstruction of variables. The
   proposed method significantly enhances the accuracy of hydrologic
   applications by resolving the typical numerical artifacts associated
   with low precipitation and runoff production rates. Several comparisons
   with analytical solutions, observed data, and other numerical models
   have been carried out for different domain geometries and various flow
   conditions. Two applications to a synthetic domain and a real-world
   basin, the Peacheater Creek watershed (64 km(2)) located near Christie,
   OK, USA, are also presented to demonstrate the scalability of the
   model's application and its robust performance. Various physically-based
   metrics of watershed simulation are illustrated, such as the runoff
   production occurrences and rates, streamflow, flow depth, velocity, etc.
   The coupled model makes feasible a range of real-world problems that
   models based on the kinematic or inertia-free approximations cannot
   simulate accurately. These include microtopographic flow disturbances
   due to vegetation and obstacles, backwater effects, and
   converging-diverging flow characteristics. The coupled model thus
   provides more comprehensive simulation capabilities that are not
   affected by assumptions regarding the reproduced flow regime. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Current thoracic artificial lungs (TALs) possess blood flow impedances
   greater than the natural lungs, resulting in abnormal pulmonary
   hemodynamics when implanted. This study sought to reduce TAL impedance

   models with inlet and outlet expansion and contraction angles, theta, of
   15A degrees, 45A degrees, and 90A degrees. Pulsatile blood flow was
   simulated for flow rates of 2-6 L/min, heart rates of 80 and 100
   beats/min, and inlet pulsatilities of 3.75 and 2. Pressure and flow data
   were used to calculate the zeroth and first harmonic impedance moduli, Z
   (0) and Z (1), respectively. The 45A degrees and 90A degrees models were
   also tested in vitro under similar conditions. CFD results indicate Z
   (0) increases as stroke volume and theta increase. At 4 L/min, 100
   beats/min, and a pulsatility of 3.75, Z (0) was 0.47, 0.61, and 0.79
   mmHg/(L/min) for the 15A degrees, 45A degrees, and 90A degrees devices,
   respectively. Velocity band and vector plots also indicate better flow
   patterns in the 45A degrees device. At the same conditions, in vitro Z
   (0) were 0.69 +/- A 0.13 and 0.79 +/- A 0.10 mmHg/(L/min), respectively,
   for the 45A degrees and 90A degrees models. These Z (0) are 65\% smaller
   than previous TAL designs. In vitro, Z (1) increased with flow rate but
   was small and unlikely to significantly affect hemodynamics. The optimal
   design for flow patterns and low impedance was the 45A degrees model.}},

Title = {{Increased susceptibility to microdamage in Brtl/+ mouse model for
   osteogenesis imperfecta}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{784-791}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease of collagen or
   collagen-related proteins that adversely impacts bone mass and fracture
   resistance. Little is known regarding the role that microdamage plays in
   OI and whether or not OI bone is more prone to damage accumulation than
   bone with unaffected collagen. The Brtl/+ mouse is a heterozygous model
   for OI which contains a Gly349Cys substitution in one COL1A1 allele, and
   demonstrates a low ductility phenotype. At 8 weeks of age. Brtl/+
   demonstrates an increase in osteoclast number, which mimics the
   upregulated bone turnover often found in OI patients. We hypothesize
   that upregulated osteoclast activity in Brtl/+ is due, in part, to
   increased remodeling associated with microdamage repair. In the present
   study, we used Brtl/+ to investigate the susceptibility of OI bone to
   microdamage. The mouse ulnar loading model was used to induce
   microdamage and to test the hypothesis that Brtl/+ is more susceptible
   to damage accumulation than age-matched wild type (WT) counterparts.
   Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) was used to investigate the
   fracture toughness properties of both Brtl/+ and WT bones to determine
   if there is any correlation with toughness and the degree of
   microdamage.
   Results show that Brtl/+ ulnae subject to normal cage activity
   demonstrate an inherently larger amount of microdamage than WT controls.
   Following axial compressive loading, Brtl/+ ulnae are more prone to
   damage than WT counterparts despite demonstrating a greater resistance
   to whole-bone deformation. Fracture toughness results demonstrate that
   Brtl/+ specimens, despite not exhibiting a significant difference,
   display a trend toward lower fracture toughness values than their WT
   counterparts. Correlations show that microdamage levels tend to increase
   as fracture toughness decreases. Together, these findings may have
   strong clinical implications for explaining increased fragility and
   remodeling activity in OI patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   neural development are only beginning to be understood. Evidence from
   frogs, mice and zebrafish suggests that MIF has a major role as a
   neurotrophin in the early development of sensory systems, including the
   auditory system. Here we show that the zebrafish mif pathway is required
   for both sensory hair cell (HC) and sensory neuronal cell survival in
   the ear, for HC differentiation, semicircular canal formation,
   statoacoustic ganglion (SAG) development, and lateral line HC
   differentiation. This is consistent with our findings that MIF is
   expressed in the developing mammalian and avian auditory systems and
   promotes mouse and chick SAG neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival,
   demonstrating key instructional roles for MIF in vertebrate otic
   development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a mechanism that under an off-normal incident ion beam,
   ordered nanodroplets may emerge spontaneously from a flat solid surface
   and line-up into chains perpendicular to the beam direction, forming a
   highly ordered hexagonal pattern. This behavior is in contrast to the
   general belief that an off-normal bombardment produces surface ripples,
   while the formation of dots requires either normal bombardment or
   off-normal bombardment with simultaneous sample rotation. The
   self-assembled nanodroplets reveal a mechanism different from the usual
   sputtering process. We propose a continuum theory which shows that the
   balance of mass flux plays an important role for the hexagonal pattern
   formation while the shadow effect causes the droplets to align into
   chains. The simulations suggest that the fundamental mechanism may be
   applicable to other systems, which may lead to an effective approach for
   nanofabrication. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cochlear implants provide hearing by electrically stimulating the
   auditory nerve. Implant function can be hindered by device design
   variables, including electrode size and electrode-to-nerve distance, and
   cochlear environment variables, including the degeneration of the
   auditory nerve following hair cell loss. We have developed a
   dual-component cochlear implant coating to improve both the electrical
   function of the implant and the biological stability of the inner ear,
   thereby facilitating the long-term perception of sound through a
   cochlear implant. This coating is a combination of an
   arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-functionalized alginate hydrogel
   and the conducting polymer poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).
   Both in vitro and in vivo assays on the effects of these electrode
   coatings demonstrated improvements in device performance. We found that
   the coating reduced electrode impedance, improved charge delivery, and
   locally released significant levels of a trophic factor into cochlear
   fluids. This coating is non-cytotoxic, clinically relevant, and has the
   potential to significantly improve the cochlear implant user's
   experience. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{217}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{273-285}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{While asymmetries in upper limb force matching have been observed, the
   mechanisms underlying asymmetry in the sense of effort have not been
   conceptualized. The aim of this study was to investigate asymmetries in
   the perception and reproduction of grasp force. Forty-two young adults,
   22 right-handed (RH) and 20 left-handed (LH), were, respectively,
   divided into three groups according to differences between their right
   and left-hand strength (left stronger than right, right stronger than
   left and right \& left equivalent). A reference force, representing 20\%
   of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) produced by the right or left
   hand, was matched with same hand (Ipsilateral Remembered-IR) or opposite
   (Contralateral Remembered-CR) hand. The matching relative error was 92\%
   (for RH) and 46\% (for LH) greater in the CR than IR condition.
   Asymmetries in matching were significant for RH participants only in the
   CR condition and were dependent on right/left differences in hand
   strength as shown by the constant error (CE). For this RH population,
   right-hand overshoot of the left-hand reference and left-hand undershoot
   of the right-hand reference were significant when the right hand was
   stronger than the left. Asymmetry remained significant when CE was
   normalized (\%MVC). Asymmetry was reduced when the strength of each hand
   was equivalent or when the left hand was stronger than the right. These
   findings suggest that effort perception is asymmetric in RH but not in
   LH individuals. The hand x strength interaction indicates that asymmetry
   in force matching is a consequence of both a difference in the
   respective cortical representations and motor components, which confer a
   different ``gain{''} (input-output relationship) to each system. The
   similarity with position sense asymmetry suggests that the gain concept
   may be generalized to describe some functional/performance differences
   between the two hand/hemisphere systems. The more symmetrical
   performance of the LH than RH group underlines that context specific
   influence of handedness, hemisphere dominance and hemispheric
   interactions modulate performance symmetries/asymmetries.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND The value of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify
   the exit site of postinfarction ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been
   questioned. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of a
   computerized algorithm for identifying a VT exit site on the basis of
   the 12-lead ECG.
   METHODS AND RESULTS In 34 postinfarction patients, pace mapping was
   performed from within scar tissue. A computerized algorithm that used a
   supervised learning method (support vector machine) received the
   digitized pace-map morphologies combined with the pacing sites as
   training data. No other information (ie, infarct localization, bundle
   branch block morphology, axis, or R-wave pattern) was used in the
   algorithm. The training data were validated in 58 VTs in 33 patients.
   The sizes of 10 different anatomic sections within the heart were
   determined by using the pace maps as the determining factor. Accuracy
   was found to be 69\% for pace maps, and when 2 adjacent regions were
   combined, accuracy improved to 88\%. Validation of the data in 33
   patients showed an accuracy of 71\% for localizing a VT exit site to 1
   of the 10 regions within the left ventricle. If combined with the best
   adjacent region, accuracy improved to 88\%. The median anatomic size of
   each section was 21 cm(2). The median spatial resolution of the 12-lead
   ECG pattern of the pace maps for a particular region was 15 cm2.
   CONCLUSION The 12-lead ECG of postinfarction VT contains localizing
   information that enables determination of a region of interest in the
   10-20 cm(2) range for more than 70\% of VT exit sites in a given sector.}},

   Ten women with anterior predominant prolapse and ten with normal support
   underwent pelvic MR imaging. 3-D models of the anterior vaginal wall
   (AVW) were generated to determine locations of the lateral AVW margin,
   vaginal width, and apical position.
   The lateral AVW margin was farther from its normal position in cases
   than controls throughout most of the vaginal length, most pronounced
   midvagina (effect sizes, 2.2-2.8). Vaginal widths differed in the
   midvagina with an effect size of 1.0. Strong correlations between apical
   and paravaginal support were evident in mid- and upper vagina (r =

   Changes in lateral AVW location were considerably greater than changes
   in vaginal width in cases vs controls, both in number of sites affected

Abstract = {{Aims: Optimization of full-scale, biological perchlorate treatment
   processes for drinking water would benefit from knowledge of the
   location and quantity of perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB) and
   expression of perchlorate-related genes in bioreactors. The aim of this
   study was to quantify perchlorate removal and perchlorate-related genes
   (pcrA and cld) and their transcripts in bioreactors and to determine
   whether these genes or transcripts could serve as useful biomarkers for
   perchlorate treatment processes.
   Methods and Results: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeting pcrA and
   cld were applied to two pilot-scale, fixed-bed bioreactors treating
   perchlorate-contaminated groundwater. pcrA and cld genes per microgram
   of DNA were two- to threefold higher and three-to fourfold higher,
   respectively, in the bioreactor showing superior perchlorate-removal
   performance. In a laboratory-scale bioreactor, quantities of pcrA and
   cld genes and transcripts were compared under two distinct performance
   conditions (c. 60 and 20\% perchlorate removal) for a 5-min empty bed
   contact time. cld genes per microgram of DNA were approximately
   threefold higher and cld transcripts per microgram of RNA were
   approximately sixfold higher under the higher perchlorate-removal
   condition. No differences in pcrA genes or transcripts per microgram of
   DNA or RNA, respectively, were detected between the c. 60 and 20\%
   perchlorate-removal conditions, possibly because these assays did not
   accurately quantify pcrA genes and transcripts in the mixed culture
   present.
   Conclusions: Quantities of cld genes and transcripts per microgram of
   DNA and RNA, respectively, were found to be higher when perchlorate
   removal was higher. However, quantities of pcrA and cld genes or
   transcripts were not found to directly correlate with
   perchlorate-removal rates.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: To our knowledge, this study
   represents the first application of qPCR assays to quantify
   perchlorate-related genes and transcripts in continuous-flow
   bioreactors. The results indicate that cld gene and transcript
   quantities can provide insights regarding the quantity, location and
   gene expression of PRB in bioreactors.}},

Abstract = {{Single crystals of a nickel-base superalloy were directionally
   solidified (DS) over a range of cooling rates to evaluate the benefits
   of a new high thermal gradient solidification process. Solidification
   experiments were conducted on cylindrical bars with a
   liquid-metal-enhanced cooling process. This higher gradient casting
   process was evaluated for the degree of structure refinement,
   microstructural variability, and porosity distributions. Cylindrical
   bars of 1.6-cm diameter were solidified at rates between 8.4 and 21.2
   mm/min using a tin-based, liquid metal cooling (LMC) technique and at a
   rate of 3.4 mm/min with a conventional Bridgman process. The LMC process
   produced a refined microstructure with average primary dendrite arm
   spacing (PDAS) and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) values as low
   as 164 and 25 mu m, respectively, for the bar geometry evaluated. An
   optimum intermediate withdrawal velocity of 12.7 mm/min produced up to a
   50 and 60 pct refinement in PDAS and SDAS, respectively. Further
   increases in withdrawal velocity produced smaller SDAS and pore sizes,
   but undesirable grain boundaries and excessive secondary dendrite arm
   growth. Voronoi tessellation methods were used to examine the extremes
   of the dendrite arm spacings in comparison to the average measurements,
   the packing of dendrites, and the correlation of porosity size and
   location with the dendrite structure. A simple expression for prediction
   of the maximum pore size is developed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We previously showed that skim milk powder (SMP) prevents
   weight gain more so than casein or whey alone. Dairy foods and changes
   in body mass can affect bone architecture; therefore, our objective was
   to examine the effect of dairy proteins on bone structure in the tibia
   of dietary-induced obese rats.
   Methods: Twelve-week-old diet-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats were
   randomized to one of six diets that varied in protein source (casein,
   whey, or SMP), Ca level (0.67\% or 2.4\%), and energy density
   (high-fat/high-sucrose {[}HFHS], or normal energy density {[}NE]). After
   8 wk, body composition was assessed via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
   and trabecular and cortical bone parameters of the tibia were assessed
   using micro-computed tomography and mixed model analysis.
   Results: Rats fed SMP with 2.4\% calcium had significantly lower body
   mass and fat mass than all other groups. The ratio of bone volume to
   total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher when the HFHS diet was
   supplemented with SMP and 2.4\% calcium compared with whey (+66.7\%) or
   casein (+32.6\%). The HMS diet group had 49.3\% greater BV/TV compared
   with the NE groups. Increasing the amount of calcium resulted in a
   significant increase in BV/TV (188.9\%) in the HFHS diet groups but not
   in the NE groups.
   Conclusion: The intake of skim milk powder supplemented with calcium
   enhances trabecular bone architecture in obese rats consuming HFHS diet
   to a greater extent than with either casein or whey protein alone.
   Bioactive ingredients in complete dairy may contribute to these effects.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the character of the normal form map in the neighbourhood
   of a grazing orbit is investigated for four possible configurations of
   soft impacting systems. It is shown that, if the spring in the impacting
   surface is relaxed, the impacting side of the map has a power of 3/2,
   but if the spring is pre-stressed the map has a square root singularity.
   The singularity appears only in the trace of the Jacobian matrix and not
   in the determinant. Under all conditions, the determinant of the
   Jacobian matrix varies continuously across the grazing condition.
   However, if the impacting surface has a damper, the determinant
   decreases exponentially with increasing penetration.
   It is found that the system behaviour is greatly dependent upon a
   parameter m, given by 2 omega(0)/omega(forcing), and that the
   singularity disappears for integer values of m. Thus, if the parameters
   are chosen to obtain an integer value of to, one can expect no abrupt
   change in behaviour as the system passes through the grazing condition
   from a non-impacting mode to an impacting mode with increasing
   excitation amplitude. The above result has been tested on an
   experimental rig, which showed a persistence of a period-1 orbit across
   the grazing condition for integer values of m, but an abrupt transition
   to a chaotic orbit or a high-period orbit for non-integer values of m.
   Finally, through simulation, it is shown that the condition for
   vanishing singularity is not a discrete point in the parameter space.
   This property is valid over a neighbourhood in the parameter space,
   which shrinks for larger values of the stiffness ratio k(2)/k(1). (C)

Abstract = {{Previous investigations show that soot particle volume fraction and
   number density were significantly reduced by exhaust gas recirculation
   (EGR) diluents CO2 and H2O. However, these investigations were often
   convoluted by their experimental flame configurations and primarily
   focused on soot volume fraction rather than soot inception. To isolate
   the effects on soot inception and the corresponding chemistry, the
   current study measured the reactivity of CO2 (up to 9.5\% volume
   fraction) for both C2H2 (1.00\% volume fraction) and CH4 (1.85\% volume
   fraction) fuels in homogeneous mixtures. Computed effect of H2O on these
   and other fuels are also presented. Experiments were performed at high
   temperature (1640 K and 1770 K) and high equivalence ratios (Phi = 55
   and 75) to understand the effect of CO2 on polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH) and formation of nascent soot particles with
   negligible oxygen influence. Experimental results show that CO2 enhanced
   the soot inception rate when added to C2H2 but had an undetectable
   affect on CH4. Gas chromatography confirmed that CO2 increases CO mole
   fraction and reduces C2H2 fuel concentration. Chemical kinetic
   simulations showed that the C2H2 was being converted to soot precursors.
   CO2 enhanced the soot inception rate for C2H2 by producing OH radicals.
   Images of nascent soot particles produced in the presence of CO2 were
   used to determine the size of PAH molecules in the particles and
   particle morphology. Both attributes were similar to particles formed
   without CO2. CO2 had little impact on the long reaction pathway from CH4
   to PAH molecules because H and CH3 radicals propagated these reactions
   more readily than OH radicals. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Measurements are reported of the heat release profiles, the flame
   lengths, flame structure and other properties of a reacting
   jet-in-cross-flow (JICF) for two fuels. The air was heated to a static
   temperature of 1390 K, which is above the autoignition temperature, and
   the air velocity was 468 m/s, which is much larger than values that were
   considered previously. Aerodynamic strain rates are so large that the
   flame was expected to fall into either the ``distributed reaction{''},
   ``thickened flamelet{''}, or ``shredded flamelet{''} regimes.
   Fluorescence images of CH, OH and formaldehyde identified the flame
   structure. The jet-incross-flow is a unit physics problem that occurs in
   turbojets and scramjets. While scaling relations are known for the
   non-reacting case, more information about the reacting case is needed,
   especially when autoignition and strain rates become important. Three
   regions were identified. In the liftoff region autoignition reactions
   occur which create a strong formaldehyde PLIF signal. However, flames
   and heat release do not occur in the liftoff region since CH and CH{*}
   signals were negligible. The second region is the lifted flame base,
   which has the character of a premixed flame, as evidenced by a very
   rapid rise in the heat release rate as indicated by the CH{*} and OH{*}
   signals. The third region contains a turbulent non-premixed flame and
   the CH images indicate the presence of thickened and shredded flamelets.
   The 2-3 mm thickness of each CH layer is more than 10 times the laminar
   flamelet thickness. In the third region the heat release rate decays
   slowly downstream, which is typical of a non-premixed flame. Because
   both upstream autoignition and downstream thickened flamelets were
   observed, we classify this combustion to be an ``autoignition-assisted
   flame{''}. Flame lengths increase linearly with fuel mass flow rate,
   indicating that mixing is controlled by the air velocity rather than the
   fuel velocity. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ultimate success of in vivo organ formation utilizing ex vivo
   expanded starter tissues relies heavily upon the level of
   vascularization provided by either endogenous or artificial induction of
   angiogenic or vasculogenic events. To facilitate proangiogenic outcomes
   and promote tissue growth, an elastomeric scaffold previously shown to
   be instrumental in the urinary bladder regenerative process was modified
   to release proangiogenic growth factors. Carboxylic acid groups on
   poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) films (POCfs) were modified with heparan
   sulfate creating a heparan binding POCf (HBPOCf). Release of
   proangiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
   fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and insulin-like growth factor 1
   (IGF-1) from HBPOCfs demonstrated an approximate threefold increase over
   controls during a 30-day time course in vitro. Atomic force microscopy
   demonstrated significant topological differences between films.
   Subcutaneous implantation of POCf alone, HBPOCf, POCf-VEGF, and
   HBPOCf-VEGF within the dorsa of nude rats yielded increased vascular
   growth in HBPOCf-VEGF constructs. Vessel quantification studies revealed
   that POCfs alone contained 41.1 +/- 4.1 vessels/mm2, while HBPOCf,
   POCf-VEGF, and HBPOCF-VEGF contained 41.7 +/- 2.6, 76.3 +/- 9.4, and
   167.72 +/- 15.3 vessels/mm2, respectively. Presence of increased vessel
   growth was demonstrated by CD31 and vWF immunostaining in HBPOCf-VEGF
   implanted areas. Data demonstrate that elastomeric POCfs can be
   chemically modified and possess the ability to promote angiogenesis in
   vivo. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A, 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) and ultra-high performance fiber
   reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) were introduced in the mid 1990s. Special
   treatment, such as heat curing, pressure and/or extensive vibration, is
   often required in order to achieve compressive strengths in excess of
   150 MPa (22 ksi). This study focuses on the development of UHP-FRCs
   without any special treatment and utilizing materials that are
   commercially available on the US market. Enhanced performance was
   accomplished by optimizing the packing density of the cementitious
   matrix, using very high strength steel fibers, tailoring the geometry of
   the fibers and optimizing the matrix-fiber interface properties. It is
   shown that addition of 1.5\% deformed fibers by volume results in a
   direct tensile strength of 13 MPa, which is 60\% higher than comparable
   UHP-FRC with smooth steel fibers, and a tensile strain at peak stress of
   0.6\%, which is about three times that for UHP-FRC with smooth fibers.
   Compressive strength up to 292 MPa (42 ksi), tensile strength up to 37
   MPa (5.4 ksi) and strain at peak stress up to 1.1\% were also attained
   28 days after casting by using up to 8\% volume fraction of high
   strength steel fibers and infiltrating them with the UHPC matrix.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{28-40}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{A mathematically advanced method for improving the fidelity of cost
   estimation for an engineering system is presented. In this method
   historical cost records can be expanded either through the use of local
   metamodels or by using an engineering build-up model. In either case,
   the expanded data set is analyzed using principal component analysis
   (PCA) in order to identify the physical parameters, and the principal
   components (PCs) which demonstrate the highest correlation to the cost.
   A set of predictor variables, composed of the physical parameters and of
   the multipliers of the principal components which demonstrate the
   highest correlation to the cost, is developed. This new set of predictor
   variables is regressed, using the Kriging method, thus creating a cost
   estimation model with a high level of predictive capability and
   fidelity. The new methodology is used for analyzing a set of cost data
   available in the literature, and the new cost model is compared to
   results from a neural network based analysis and to a cost regression
   model. Further, a case study addressing the fabrication of a submarine
   pressure hull is developed in order to illustrate the new method. The
   results from the final regression model are presented and compared to
   results from other cost regression methods. The technical

Abstract = {{Large-scale deployment of IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) with a high
   density of access points (APs) has become commonplace due mainly to its
   potential for numerous benefits, such as ubiquitous service coverage,
   seamless handover, and improved link quality. However, the increased AP
   density can induce significant channel contention among neighboring
   cells, thus causing severe performance degradation and throughput
   imbalance between cells. There have been a plethora of research efforts
   to improve the WLAN performance, but most of them focused only on single
   WLAN environments without accounting for inter-cell contention. The de
   facto QoS-provisioning mechanism for WLANs, i.e., the Enhanced
   Distributed Channel Access (EDCA), is no exception to this. The EDCA
   focuses only on inter-flow priority distinction and has not considered
   the effect of inter-cell contention which significantly restricts its
   efficiency. This paper presents an enhanced QoS provisioning framework
   that takes into account inter-cell level differentiation as well as
   inter-flow level priority, which may be viewed as extension of QoS
   provisioning from a single-WLAN domain to a multi-WLAN domain. We also
   propose an architecture for managing multi-AP systems in which a central
   controller regulates the wireless channel occupancy of APs by adaptively
   configuring the cell-level QoS parameters. Our extensive simulation
   results show that the proposed inter-AP cooperative QoS scheme overcomes
   the limit of legacy 802.11e and provides a high level of fairness in
   large-scale densely-deployed WLANs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Shear Stress Modulation of IL-1 beta-Induced E-Selectin Expression in
   Human Endothelial Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endothelial cells (ECs) are continuously exposed to
   hemodynamic forces imparted by blood flow. While it is known that
   endothelial behavior can be influenced by cytokine activation or fluid
   shear, the combined effects of these two independent agonists have yet
   to be fully elucidated.
   Methodology: We investigated EC response to long-term inflammatory cues
   under physiologically relevant shear conditions via E-selectin
   expression where monolayers of human umbilical vein ECs were
   simultaneously exposed to laminar fluid shear and interleukin-1 beta
   (shear-cytokine activation) in a parallel plate flow chamber.
   Results and Conclusion: Naive ECs exposed to shear-cytokine activation
   display significantly higher E-selectin expression for up to 24 hr
   relative to ECs activated in static (static-cytokine). Peak E-selectin
   expression occurred after 8-12 hr of continuous shear-cytokine
   activation contrary to the commonly observed 4-6 hr peak expression in
   ECs exposed to static-cytokine activation. Cells with some history of
   high shear conditioning exhibited either high or muted E-selectin
   expression depending on the durations of the shear pre-conditioning and
   the ensuing shear-cytokine activation. Overall, the presented data
   suggest that a high laminar shear enhances acute EC response to
   interleukin-1 beta in naive or shear-conditioned ECs as may be found in
   the pathological setting of ischemia/reperfusion injury while conferring
   rapid E-selectin downregulation to protect against chronic inflammation.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Work as an Indirect Measure of Subjective Costs Influencing
   Human Movement}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{To descend a flight of stairs, would you rather walk or fall? Falling
   seems to have some obvious disadvantages such as the risk of pain or
   injury. But the preferred strategy of walking also entails a cost for
   the use of active muscles to perform negative work. The amount and
   distribution of work a person chooses to perform may, therefore, reflect
   a subjective valuation of the trade-offs between active muscle effort
   and other costs, such as pain. Here we use a simple jump landing
   experiment to quantify the work humans prefer to perform to dissipate
   the energy of landing. We found that healthy normal subjects (N = 8)
   preferred a strategy that involved performing 37\% more negative work
   than minimally necessary (P<0.001) across a range of landing heights.
   This then required additional positive work to return to standing rest
   posture, highlighting the cost of this preference. Subjects were also
   able to modulate the amount of landing work, and its distribution
   between active and passive tissues. When instructed to land softly, they
   performed 76\% more work than necessary (P<0.001), with a higher
   proportion from active muscles (89\% vs. 84\%, P<0.001). Stiff-legged
   landings, performed by one subject for demonstration, exhibited close to
   the minimum of work, with more of it performed passively through soft
   tissue deformations (at least 30\% in stiff landings vs. 16\%
   preferred). During jump landings, humans appear not to minimize muscle
   work, but instead choose to perform a consistent amount of extra work,
   presumably to avoid other subjective costs. The degree to which work is
   not minimized may indirectly quantify the relative valuation of costs
   that are otherwise difficult to measure.}},

Abstract = {{Platinum group metals (PGMs) are used in numerous catalyst applications,
   including conversion of engine exhaust gases and hydrocarbon reforming.
   Reducing the loading of PGMs without diminishing the overall catalyst
   activity is a major challenge. Fundamental studies of PGMs under
   reactive conditions can assist the design/synthesis of
   ``nanoengineered{''} catalysts, tunable and optimized for cost,
   stability, and performance. In the present study, the oxidation and
   reduction behavior of a Pd-6.4 at. \% Rh alloy is investigated following
   treatment at 873 K for various exposure times using atom-probe
   tomography. For short oxidation times (10 mm), an oxide layer with PdO
   stoichiometry grows on the surface. As the oxidation time increases, two
   phases with stoichiometries of (Rh1Pd1)O-2 and (Pd2O) evolve. When the
   alloy is subsequently reduced in hydrogen, a nanoscale dispersion of
   Rh-rich metallic regions remains. This provides a route for the
   synthesis of multifunctional catalysts with different nanosurface
   regions in close proximity to one another.}},

Abstract = {{Organic vapor jet printing (OVJP) is a high-resolution mask and
   solvent-free organic thin film deposition and patterning technique. In
   this work, we analyze factors that affect the material deposition rate
   and the dynamics of gas flow through an OVJP print head consisting of an
   array of micron-sized nozzles. Scaling laws governing carrier gas flow
   dynamics through a system of microchannels and nozzles are developed.
   From these laws, we predict the deposition rate and doping ratio of
   organic material as a function of carrier gas flow. The analysis is
   applied to an experimental print head, and is compared to results
   obtained via a more complex, direct simulation Monte Carlo model. The
   print head is used to grow efficient green phosphorescent organic light
   emitting diodes having an external quantum efficiency and luminance
   comparable to analogous devices grown by vacuum thermal evaporation. (C)

Abstract = {{During attempts to produce novel two-dimensional cocrystals by
   coadsorbing components in a binary mixture, the formation of a
   metastable form was observed in analogy to the phenomenon of
   additive-induced polymorph formation reported in three-dimensional
   crystallization. Mechanistic in-sights into this phenomenon were gained
   through the use of scanning tunneling microscopy and several
   adsorbate/additive combinations. One additive plays a critical role in
   forming a disordered assembly through a process that is primarily
   kinetic whereas another additive thermodynamically stabilized an
   intermediate form, resulting in interrupting a phase transformation to a
   more stable form. These additive effects elucidate one of the potential
   pathways to kinetically isolate a metastable polymorph formed during
   cocrystallization in three-dimensional crystallization.}},

Abstract = {{Development of a Pb-free Sn nanosolder paste with an initial melting
   temperature near or below the melting temperature of eutectic Sn-Pb
   solder (183 degrees C) has been investigated using the size-dependent
   melting behavior of small particles. Three to five nanometer Sn
   nanoparticles were fabricated by sonochemical reduction and observed to
   melt at temperatures near or below 183 degrees C. Prototype nanosolder
   pastes were produced by combining the nanoparticles with flux and were
   characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in terms of
   their melting, solidification, coalescence, and metal particle loading
   properties. The results indicate that, although target melting
   temperatures were achieved, nanoparticle coalescence was limited by low
   volume loading of the metal, due in part to the capping layer (an
   organic layer adsorbed on the metal surface during chemical synthesis).

Volume = {{514}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the effects of TiCl3 on desorption kinetics,
   absorption/desorption reversibility, and related phase transformation
   processes in LiBH4/CaH2/TiCl3 hydrogen storage system was studied
   systematically by varying its concentration (x = 0, 0.05, 0.15 and
   0.25). The results show that LiCl forms during ball milling of
   6LiBH(4)/CaH2/xTiCl(3) and that as temperature increases, o-LiBH4
   transforms into h-LiBH4, into which LiCl incorporates, forming solid
   solution of LiBH4 center dot LiCl, which melts above 280 degrees C.
   Molten LiBH4 center dot LiCl is more viscous than molten LiBH4,
   preventing the clustering of LiBH4 and the accompanied agglomeration of
   CaH2, and thus preserving the nano-sized phase arrangement formed during
   ball milling. Above 350 degrees C, the molten solution LiBH4 center dot
   LiCl further reacts with CaH2, precipitating LiCl. The main hydrogen
   desorption reaction is between molten LiBH4 center dot LiCl and CaH2 and
   not between molten LiBH4 and CaH2. This alters the hydrogen reaction
   thermodynamics and lowers the hydrogen desorption temperature. In
   addition, the solid-liquid nano-sized phase arrangement in the
   nano-composites improves the hydrogen reaction kinetics. The reversible
   incorporation/precipitation of LiCl at the hydrogen reaction temperature
   and during temperature cycling makes the 6LiBH(4)/CaH2/0.25TiCl(3)
   nano-composite a fully reversible hydrogen storage material. These four
   states of LiCl in LiBH4/CaH2/TiCl3 system, i.e. ``formed-solid
   solution-molten solution-precipitation{''}, are reported for the first
   time and the detailed study of this system is beneficial to further
   improve hydrogen storage property of complex hydrides. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   These cross sections are compared to the predictions of the first Born
   (PWBA+OBKN) and ECUSAR ionization theories, which were evaluated in a
   novel manner for the C+q and O+q energies and charge states of the data
   and converted to x-ray production cross sections with atomic parameters

   shells. Individual groups of M-shell transitions are also compared to
   the two ionization theories. The ECUSAR theory is shown to describe the

   Polymorphs from First Principles Calculations}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{The influence of crystal structure and relative stability on the
   electrochemical properties of Li2FeSiO4 polymorphs as cathode materials
   for Li-ion batteries is investigated. Six Li2FeSiO4 forms related to the
   crystal structure of Li3PO4 have been considered: three known polymorphs
   crystallizing in layered structures (with space groups P2(1), Pmnb, and
   Pmn2(1)) and three forms reported for other LiMSiO4 materials
   crystallizing in three-dimensional (3D) frameworks (with space groups
   Pmn2(1), Pbn2(1), and P2(1)/n). While Li2FeSiO4 polymorphs are very
   close in energy, their energies begin to differ substantially upon
   removal of Li, rendering those with lower electrostatic energy more
   stable. The change in relative stability of polymorphs upon delithiation
   results in a driving force for a phase transformation of the exiting
   two-dimensional (2D)-Li2FeSiO4 polymorphs to a more stable structure
   having a 3D network of {[}SiO4] and {[}FeO4] tetrahedra. The resulting
   phase exhibits a voltage plateau that is predicted to be 0.3 V below
   that of the original phase for the first electron process
   (Li2FeSiO4/LiFeSiO4 couple). The calculated voltage capacity curves for
   the first and second cycles of Li2FeSiO4 at room temperature, assuming
   transformation to the new polymorph occurs after the first cycle, are in
   excellent agreement with experiments. Independently of the polymorphs,
   removal of the second lithium ion occurs at too high of a voltage (above
   4.7 V) and is accompanied by major structural rearrangements, precluding
   the utilization of any of the unmodified Li2FeSiO4 polymorph derived
   from Li3PO4 as high specific capacity material.}},

Abstract = {{Flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a toroidal duct of square
   cross-section is analysed. The flow is driven by the azimuthal Lorentz
   force resulting from the interaction between the radial electric
   currents created by the difference of electric potential maintained
   between the cylinder walls and the strong magnetic field imposed in the
   axial direction. The flow geometry and the value of the Hartmann number
   correspond to the experiment of Moresco \& Alboussiere (J. Fluid Mech.,
   vol. 504, 2004, pp. 167-181). The purpose of the analysis is to reveal
   the flow features at Reynolds numbers below the threshold of transition
   to turbulence in Hartmann layers. We find that the flow experiences a
   complex evolution. The laminar base flow experiences the first
   instability at the Reynolds number significantly smaller than that of
   the threshold. The instability is axisymmetric and oscillatory.
   Turbulence appears at a slightly higher Reynolds number. Right up to the
   Hartmann layer instability, the turbulence remains localized in a layer
   near the outer cylinder wall. It is demonstrated that the turbulence may
   affect the transition in the Hartmann layers via unsteady forcing of the
   outer flow.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: In their current laboratory-based form, existing
   vibrotactile sensory augmentation technologies that provide cues of body
   motion are impractical for home-based rehabilitation use due to their
   size, weight, complexity, calibration procedures, cost, and fragility.
   Methods: We have designed and developed a cell phone based vibrotactile
   feedback system for potential use in balance rehabilitation training in
   clinical and home environments. It comprises an iPhone with an embedded
   triaxial linear accelerometer, custom software to estimate body tilt, a
   ``tactor bud{''} accessory that plugs into the headphone jack to provide
   vibrotactile cues of body tilt, and a battery. Five young healthy
   subjects (24 +/- 2.8 yrs, 3 females and 2 males) and four subjects with
   vestibular deficits (42.25 +/- 13.5 yrs, 2 females and 2 males)
   participated in a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the effectiveness
   of the system. Healthy subjects used the system with eyes closed during
   Romberg, semi-tandem Romberg, and tandem Romberg stances. Subjects with
   vestibular deficits used the system with both eyes-open and eyes-closed
   conditions during semi-tandem Romberg stance. Vibrotactile feedback was
   provided when the subject exceeded either an anterior-posterior (A/P) or
   a medial-lateral (M/L) body tilt threshold. Subjects were instructed to
   move away from the vibration.
   Results: The system was capable of providing real-time vibrotactile cues
   that informed corrective postural responses. When feedback was
   available, both healthy subjects and those with vestibular deficits
   significantly reduced their A/P or M/L RMS sway (depending on the
   direction of feedback), had significantly smaller elliptical area fits
   to their sway trajectory, spent a significantly greater mean percentage
   time within the no feedback zone, and showed a significantly greater A/P
   or M/L mean power frequency.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the real-time feedback provided by
   this system can be used to reduce body sway. Its advantages over more
   complex laboratory-based and commercial balance training systems in
   terms of cost, size, weight, functionality, flexibility, and
   accessibility make it a good candidate for further home-based balance
   training evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid nanostructured materials can exhibit different properties than
   their constituent components, and can enable decoupled engineering of
   energy conversion and transport functions. Novel means of building
   hybrid assemblies of crystalline C60 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are
   presented, wherein aligned CNT films direct the crystallization and
   orientation of C60 rods from solution. In these hybrid films, the C60
   rods are oriented parallel to the direction of the CNTs throughout the
   thickness of the film. High-resolution imaging shows that the crystals
   incorporate CNTs during growth, yet grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction
   (GIXD) shows that the crystal structure of the C60 rods is not perturbed
   by the CNTs. Growth kinetics of the C60 rods are enhanced 8-fold on CNTs
   compared to bare Si, emphasizing the importance of the aligned, porous
   morphology of the CNT films as well as the selective surface
   interactions between C60 and CNTs. Finally, it is shown how hybrid
   C60CNT films can be integrated electrically and employed as UV detectors
   with a high CNTs can induce rapid, directional crystallization of
   molecules from +/-solution may have broader implications to the science
   and applications of crystal growth, such as for inorganic nanocrystals,
   proteins, and synthetic polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular environment impacts a myriad of cellular functions by
   providing signals that can modulate cell phenotype and function.
   Physical cues such as topography, roughness, gradients, and elasticity
   are of particular importance. Thus, synthetic substrates can be
   potentially useful tools for exploring the influence of the
   aforementioned physical properties on cellular function. Many micro- and
   nanofabrication processes have been employed to control substrate
   characteristics in both 2D and 3D environments. This review highlights
   strategies for modulating the physical properties of surfaces, the
   influence of these changes on cell responses, and the promise and
   limitations of these surfaces in in-vitro settings. While both hard and
   soft materials are discussed, emphasis is placed on soft substrates.
   Moreover, methods for creating synthetic substrates for cell studies,
   substrate properties, and impact of substrate properties on cell
   behavior are the main focus of this review.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Electron-beam lithography (EBL) was used to define an aminosilane
   nanopatterned surface in order to electrostatically self-assemble gold
   nanoparticles (Au NPs). The chemically modified nanopatterned surfaces
   were immersed into a Au NP solution to allow the Au NPs to
   self-assemble. Equilibrium self-assembly was achieved in only 20 min.
   The number of Au NPs that self-assembled on an aminosilane dot was
   controlled by manipulating the diameters of both the Au NPs and the
   dots. Adding salt to the Au NP solution enabled the Au NPs to
   self-assemble in greater numbers on the same sized dot. However, the
   preparation of the Au NP solution containing salt was sensitive to
   spikes in the salt concentration. These spikes led to aggregation of the
   Au NPs and non-specific deposition of Au NPs on the substrate. The Au NP
   patterned surfaces were immersed in a sodium hydroxide solution in order
   to lift-off the patterned Au NPs, but no lift-off was observed without
   adequate physical agitation. The van der Waals forces are too strong to
   allow for lift-off despite the absence of electrostatic forces.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop an improved model representation of the
   biomechanics of the levator muscles during the second stage of labor and
   to use a sensitivity analysis to explore the pathomechanics of levator
   muscle injury.
   Methods: A subject-specific finite element model of human pelvic floor
   and fetal head was developed based on in vivo MRI data of a fetal head
   and maternal pelvis. An anisotropic visco-hyperelastic constitutive
   model employed material parameters estimated from biaxial tests on
   pelvic floor tissues. Boundary conditions reflected both anatomic
   constraints and the curve of Carus. A short second stage of labor,
   scaled to 10 min, was then simulated using a single expulsive push made
   in the absence of levator co-contraction.
   Results: Large levator stresses occurred near the levator hiatus
   reaching 9 MPa at the pubovisceral muscle enthesis. The dominant
   principal stresses were located at, and aligned with, the edge of the
   hiatus. Muscle stretch bordering the levator hiatus was inhomogeneous:
   the average levator stretch was 3.55 with a high of 4.64 at the
   pubovisceral muscle enthesis. Decreasing perineal body stiffness by
   40\%, 50\%, and 60\% led to reductions in the maximum principal stretch
   ratio at the pubovisceral muscle enthesis of 8\%, 13\%, and 18\%,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: The pubovisceral muscle enthesis and the muscle near the
   perineal body are the regions of greatest strain thereby placing them at
   highest risk for stretch-related injury. Decreasing perineal body tissue
   stiffness significantly reduced tissue stress and strain, and therefore
   injury risk, in those regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the ability to functionalize octahedral
   silsesquioxanes with different photoactive ligands, and thereby tune
   their optical properties, suggest that these molecules may serve as
   potential building blocks of light-harvesting, photovoltaic, and
   photonic devices. In this paper we report extensive ab initio
   calculations of the excitation energies underlying the absorption
   spectra of these systems. The calculations are based on density
   functional theory for the ground electronic state and time-dependent
   density functional theory for the excited electronic states. The ability
   of the commonly used B3LYP functional to reproduce the experimentally
   observed absorption excitation energies is compared to that of recently
   developed range-separated hybrid functionals. The importance of pairing
   the range-separated hybrid functionals with basis sets that include
   diffuse and polarization basis functions is demonstrated in the case of
   vinyl-functionalized silsesquioxanes. Absorptive excitation energies are
   then calculated and compared with experiment for octahedral
   silsesquioxanes fiinctionalized with larger ligands. The tunability of
   optical properties is demonstrated by considering the effect on the
   excitation energies of functionalizing the ligands with
   electron-donating or -withdrawing groups.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Prolonged Standing on Touch Sensitivity Threshold of the
   Foot: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-122}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effect of prolonged standing on touch
   sensitivity of the foot.
   Design: An observational study with replications.
   Setting: University laboratory.
   Participants: Ten healthy college students (5 men and 5 women), with a
   mean +/- SD age of 23.5 +/- 4.1 years and body mass of 67.4 +/- 12.6 kg.
   Methods: Semmes-Weinstein monofilament tests were administered to 12
   locations on the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the foot before and
   after 4 hours of standing. These locations were formed into several
   groupings (toes, metatarsal heads, midfoot, heel, all plantar sites, all
   dorsal sites), and paired t-tests were used to test for significant
   changes in sensitivity threshold after standing.
   Main Outcome Measurement: The difference between sensitivity thresholds
   measured before and after standing for different locations on the foot.
   Results: The average of all sensitivity thresholds on the plantar
   surface of the foot decreased (indicating increased sensitivity) from
   0.56 to 0.36 g (P < .01) after 4 hours of prolonged standing. This
   change in threshold equated to a difference of 1 Semmes-Weinstein
   monofilament level. Changes in the sensitivity threshold of the dorsal
   aspect of the foot were not significant.
   Conclusions: Analysis of the results suggests that the plantar foot has
   greater sensitivity to touch after prolonged standing. These findings
   may be useful for identifying potential unintended bias in clinical
   touch sensitivity testing. Future research is necessary to understand
   the underlying mechanisms for this sensitivity change and to determine
   the onset and recovery times for sensitivity changes.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-16}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We propose a novel framework for multimodal video indexing and retrieval
   using shrinkage optimized directed information assessment (SODA) as
   similarity measure. The directed information (DI) is a variant of the
   classical mutual information which attempts to capture the direction of
   information flow that videos naturally possess. It is applied directly
   to the empirical probability distributions of both audio-visual features
   over successive frames. We utilize RASTA-PLP features for audio feature
   representation and SIFT features for visual feature representation. We
   compute the joint probability density functions of audio and visual
   features in order to fuse features from different modalities. With SODA,
   we further estimate the DI in a manner that is suitable for high
   dimensional features p and small sample size n (large p small n) between
   pairs of video-audio modalities. We demonstrate the superiority of the
   SODA approach in video indexing, retrieval, and activity recognition as
   compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as hidden Markov models
   (HMM), support vector machine (SVM), cross-media indexing space (CMIS),
   and other noncausal divergence measures such as mutual information (MI).
   We also demonstrate the success of SODA in audio and video localization
   and indexing/retrieval of data with missaligned modalities.}},

   of load cases, for two example geometries, viz. a Hertzian contact and a
   contact having a central flat face and rounded edges. The results are
   useful both in determining the damping properties of the contact and in
   assessing the localisation of surface damage which may give rise to

Abstract = {{Gastrointestinal cancers are heterogeneous and can overexpress several
   protein targets that can be imaged simultaneously on endoscopy using
   multiple molecular probes. We aim to demonstrate a multispectral
   scanning fiber endoscope for wide-field fluorescence detection of
   colonic dysplasia. Excitation at 440, 532, and 635 nm is delivered into
   a single spiral scanning fiber, and fluorescence is collected by a ring
   of light-collecting optical fibers placed around the instrument
   periphery. Specific-binding peptides are selected with phage display
   technology using the CPC;Apc mouse model of spontaneous colonic
   dysplasia. Validation of peptide specificity is performed on flow
   cytometry and in vivo endoscopy. The peptides KCCFPAQ, AKPGYLS, and
   LTTHYKL are selected and labeled with
   7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid (DEAC),
   5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), and CF633, respectively. Separate
   droplets of KCCFPAQ-DEAC, AKPGYLS-TAMRA, and LTTHYKL-CF633 are
   distinguished at concentrations of 100 and 1 M. Separate application of
   the fluorescent-labeled peptides demonstrate specific binding to colonic
   adenomas. The average target/background ratios are 1.71 +/- 0.19 and
   1.67 +/- 0.12 for KCCFPAQ-DEAC and AKPGYLS-TAMRA, respectively.
   Administration of these two peptides together results in distinct
   binding patterns in the blue and green channels. Specific binding of two
   or more peptides can be distinguished in vivo using a novel
   multispectral endoscope to localize colonic dysplasia on real-time
   wide-field imaging. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Near-infrared confocal microendoscopy is a promising technique for deep
   in vivo imaging of tissues and can generate high-resolution
   cross-sectional images at the micron-scale. We demonstrate the use of a
   dual-axis confocal (DAC) near-infrared fluorescence microendoscope with
   a 5.5-mm outer diameter for obtaining clinical images of human
   colorectal mucosa. High-speed two-dimensional en face scanning was
   achieved through a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner while a
   micromotor was used for adjusting the axial focus. In vivo images of
   human patients are collected at 5 frames/sec with a field of view of 362
   x 212 mu m(2) and a maximum imaging depth of 140 mu m. During routine
   endoscopy, indocyanine green (ICG) was topically applied a nonspecific
   optical contrasting agent to regions of the human colon. The DAC
   microendoscope was then used to obtain micro-anatomic images of the
   mucosa by detecting near-infrared fluorescence from ICG. These results
   suggest that DAC microendoscopy may have utility for visualizing the
   anatomical and, perhaps, functional changes associated with colorectal
   pathology for the early detection of colorectal cancer. (C) 2012 Society

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates extremely miniaturized bandpass filters based on
   asymmetric coupled lines and equal reactance. By reactively loading
   asymmetric coupled lines while the first and the last inverters are
   eliminated, the proposed method overcomes the limitation of previous
   methods to achieve extreme miniaturization. Furthermore, the utilization
   of asymmetric coupled lines allows the method to miniaturize a filter
   with equal reactance, which provides a great advantage of low-cost
   fabrication. A complete set of design equations for an arbitrary number
   of filter order is provided for both shunt-capacitive and
   series-inductive loading methods. Experimental results for various
   miniaturized filters at 0.9 GHz are provided. An unprecedented
   miniaturization rate of more than 91\% is demonstrated for a third-order
   parallel coupled-line filter.}},

Abstract = {{A range of material systems exist in which nanoscale ionic transport and
   redox reactions provide the essential mechanisms for memristive
   switching. One class relies on mobile cations, which are easily created
   by electrochemical oxidation of the corresponding electrode metal,
   transported in the insulating layer, and reduced at the inert
   counterelectrode. These devices are termed electrochemical metallization
   (ECM) memories, also called conductive bridge random access memories.
   The memristive characteristics of the ECM cells provide opportunities
   for circuit design and computational concepts that go beyond those in
   traditional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.
   Passive memory arrays open up paths toward ultradense and 3D stackable
   memory and logic gate arrays. Furthermore, the multivalued conductance
   characteristics allow for potential exploitation of the cells as
   synapses in neuromorphic circuits in future energy efficient
   high-performance computer architectures. Despite exciting results
   obtained in recent years, many challenges have to be met before these
   physical effects can be turned into competitive industrial technology.
   Here, we briefly review the basic working principle, the different
   possible and potential material combinations, and the fundamental
   electrochemical processes in ECM cells and their implications for device
   operations. The prospects of ECM-based resistive random access memory as
   an emerging memory technology are also reviewed in terms of switching
   speed and scalability.}},

Abstract = {{Effective thermal integration could enable the use of compact fuel
   processors with PEM fuel cell-based power systems. These systems have
   potential for deployment in distributed, stationary electricity
   generation using natural gas. This paper describes a concept wherein the
   latent heat of vaporization of H2O is used to control the axial
   temperature gradient of a fuel processor consisting of an autothermal
   reformer (ATR) with water gas shift (WGS) and preferential oxidation
   (PROX) reactors to manage the CO exhaust concentration. A prototype was
   experimentally evaluated using methane fuel over a range of external
   heat addition and thermal inputs. The experiments confirmed that the
   axial temperature profile of the fuel processor can be controlled by
   managing only the vapor fraction of the premixed reactant stream. The
   optimal temperature profile is shown to result in high thermal
   efficiency and a CO concentration less than 40 ppm at the exit of the
   PROX reactor. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to explore the dynamic characteristics
   of a multicellular fluidic flexible matrix composite ((FMC)-M-2)
   structure. (FMC)-M-2 is a novel composite idea inspired by the fibrillar
   organizations of plant cell walls. Previous work on (FMC)-M-2 has mostly
   focused on single cell studies and on its static or quasi-static
   characteristics. The (FMC)-M-2 dynamic characteristics with interaction
   between cells through a flow circuit have not yet been investigated.
   When under external load, a network of (FMC)-M-2 cells with different
   fiber angles will generate pressure gradient and induce internal fluid
   flows. Therefore, the working fluids and flow port can be
   selected/designed for new types of functionality. An analytical model,
   incorporating the flow port characteristics with the cell structural
   dynamics, is developed and analyzed. Experimental investigations are
   also performed. It is shown that a dual (FMC)-M-2 cellular structure can
   be used as a vibration absorber and as an enhanced actuator with higher
   actuation authority compared to a single (FMC)-M-2 cell in a designated
   frequency band. These features are studied in correlation to the various
   system parameters, such as the fiber composite parameters, flow port
   parameters, and working fluid effective bulk modulus.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1771-1783}},

Abstract = {{Precipitate shapes in nickel-base superalloys vary substantially with
   alloy composition, partitioning of elements to the disordered gamma
   matrix and the ordered gamma prime precipitates and the degree of
   coarsening during elevated temperature exposures. These shapes, which
   vary from spherical to cuboidal to rod-like, have typically not been
   quantified in Ni-base alloys containing relatively high gamma' volume
   fractions, in spite of their importance to mechanical properties.
   Precipitate shapes in a series of new platinum group metal
   (PGM)-containing Ni-base alloys have been quantified by their
   two-dimensional moment invariants. Precipitate morphologies were
   characterized in a total of 17 PGM-containing alloys in the solution
   treated and aged condition. The average gamma' volume fraction was
   measured as 0.60, typical of highly creep resistant Ni-base alloys. PGM
   additions resulted in an unusually large range of precipitate shapes.
   Precipitate morphologies were quantitatively analyzed using a shape
   parameter derived from the absolute moment invariant. For the
   compositions examined, the shape parameter reaches a maximum value at a
   precipitate matrix misfit magnitude of 0.4\%. A large set of commercial
   single crystals exhibits the same range in shape parameter values around
   this misfit magnitude, suggesting that favorable high temperature
   properties are correlated with an optimum precipitate shape. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The magnetized liner inertial fusion concept {[}S. A. Slutz et al.,
   Phys. Plasmas 17, 056303 (2010)] consists of a cylindrical metal liner
   enclosing a preheated plasma that is embedded in an axial magnetic
   field. Because of its diffusion into the liner, the pulsed azimuthal
   magnetic field may exhibit a strong magnetic shear within the liner,
   offering the interesting possibility of shear stabilization of the
   magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability. Here, we use the ideal MHD
   model to study this effect of magnetic shear in a finite slab. It is
   found that magnetic shear reduces the MRT growth rate in general. The
   feedthrough factor is virtually independent of magnetic shear. In the
   limit of infinite magnetic shear, all MRT modes are stable if b(u) > 1,
   where b(u) is the ratio of the perturbed magnetic tension in the liner's
   interior region to the acceleration during implosion. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Reuse of GaAs substrates for epitaxial lift-off by employing protection
   layers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate repeated use of GaAs wafers for multiple growths by
   employing lattice-matched epitaxial protection layers to preserve the
   wafer surface in its original condition following their etch removal
   after growth. The protection layers provide a regrowth surface that
   eliminates the need for repolishing prior to subsequent growth. Between
   growths, the protection layers are removed by wet chemical etching. The
   resulting surface quality is examined using atomic force microscope and
   energy dispersive spectrometry. We show that the surface roughness,
   chemical composition, morphology, and electronic properties of the GaAs
   surface after protection-layer removal are comparable to that of the
   original substrate surface. We show that p-n junction GaAs solar cells
   grown on original and reused wafers have nearly identical performance
   with power conversion efficiencies of similar to 23\%, under simulated 1
   sun illumination, AM1.5 G. The high power conversion efficiency of GaAs
   solar cells combined with reduced costs associated with multiple parent
   wafer reuses promise cost competitiveness with incumbent solar cell
   technologies. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Increased volumetric hydrogen uptake of MOF-5 by powder densification}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{2723-2727}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The metal-organic framework MOF-5 has attracted significant attention
   due to its ability to store large quantities of H-2 by mass, up to 10
   wt\% absolute at 70 bar and 77 K. On the other hand, since MOF-5 is
   typically obtained as a bulk powder, it exhibits a low volumetric
   density and poor thermal conductivity-both of which are undesirable
   characteristics for a hydrogen storage material. Here we explore the
   extent to which powder densification can overcome these deficiencies, as
   well as characterize the impact of densification on crystallinity, pore
   volume, surface area, and crush strength. MOF-5 powder was processed
   into cylindrical tablets with densities up to 1.6 g/cm(3) by mechanical
   compaction. We find that optimal hydrogen storage properties are
   achieved for rho similar to 0.5 g/cm(3), yielding a 350\% increase in
   volumetric H-2 density with only a modest 15\% reduction in gravimetric
   H-2 excess in comparison to the powder. Higher densities result in
   larger reductions in gravimetric excess. Total pore volume and surface
   area decrease commensurately with the gravimetric capacity, and are
   linked to an incipient amorphization transformation. Nevertheless, a
   large fraction of MOF-5 crystallinity remains intact in densities up to
   0.75 g/cm(3), as confirmed from powder XRD. Predictably, the radial
   crush strength of the pellets is enhanced by densification, increasing
   by a factor of 4.3 between a density of 0.4 g/cm(3) and 0.6 g/cm(3).
   Thermal conductivity increases slightly with tablet density, but remains
   below the single crystal value. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Tumor cells do not develop in isolation, but co-evolve with stromal
   cells and tumor-associated immune cells in a tumor microenvironment
   mediated by an array of soluble factors, forming a complex intercellular
   signaling network. Herein, we report an unbiased, generic model to
   integrate prior biochemical data and the constructed brain tumor
   microenvironment in silico as characterized by an intercellular
   signaling network comprising 5 types of cells, 15 cytokines, and 69
   signaling pathways. The results show that glioma develops through three
   distinct phases: pre-tumor, rapid expansion, and saturation. We designed
   a microglia depletion therapy and observed significant benefit for
   virtual patients treated at the early stages but strikingly no
   therapeutic efficacy at all when therapy was given at a slightly later
   stage. Cytokine combination therapy exhibits more focused and enhanced
   therapeutic response even when microglia depletion therapy already
   fails. It was further revealed that the optimal combination depends on
   the molecular profile of individual patients, suggesting the need for
   patient stratification and personalized treatment. These results,
   obtained solely by observing the in silico dynamics of the glioma
   microenvironment with no fitting to experimental/clinical data, reflect
   many characteristics of human glioma development and imply new venues

Abstract = {{In a structural system with piezoelectric actuators, the damping effect
   can be achieved by properly switching the voltage on the actuators.
   Semi-active synchronized switch damping (SSD) approaches are typical
   switched-voltage control methods, which have recently been a topic of
   active research. In this study, the energy conversion of a SSD control
   system with an arbitrary switching frequency is investigated
   theoretically and validated numerically. First the general expression of
   the switched voltage on the piezoelectric actuator is derived. The
   results show that maximum voltage magnitude is obtained on the
   piezoelectric actuator when piezoelectric is switched at every odd
   number of displacement extrema. Next the average converted energy per
   vibration cycle is derived for an arbitrary switching frequency. The
   results show that the efficiency of energy conversion is reduced
   drastically even if the switching frequency is slightly deviated from
   the optimal frequency. Finally numerical simulation and experiments were
   carried out to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the feasibility of biopsy needle tract cauterization
   and cauterization monitoring using an embedded array of piezoceramic
   microheaters. Circular heaters of lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5A), with
   200 mu m diameter and 70-80 mu m thickness, are fabricated using a batch
   mode micro ultrasonic machining process. These are then assembled into
   cavities in the walls of 20-gauge stainless steel needles and sealed
   with epoxy. Experiments are performed by inserting the proposed biopsy
   needle into porcine tissue samples. The needle surface exceeds the
   minimum target temperature rise of 33A degrees C for either radial or
   thickness mode vibrations. The corresponding input power levels are 236
   mW and 325 mW, respectively. The tissue cauterization extends 1-1.25 mm
   beyond the perimeter of the needle and is uniform in all directions.
   After cauterization, the fundamental anti-resonance frequency and the
   corresponding impedance magnitude of the PZT heater decrease by 4.1\%
   and 42.6\%, respectively, thereby providing a method to monitor the
   extent of tissue cauterization. A sensing interface circuit capable of
   measuring the resonance frequency shift of the PZT elements is built and
   tested using discrete integrated circuit components. The circuit detects
   the resonance frequency shift from 8.22 MHz to 7.96 MHz of the PZT
   elements when the biopsy needle is inserted into wax medium. An
   interface circuit for actuation of the PZT elements for tissue
   cauterization is also described.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{131-143}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by two-phase microfluidics and by the clinical applications of
   air embolism and a developmental gas embolotherapy technique,
   experimental and theoretical models of microbubble transport in
   pulsatile flow are presented. The one-dimensional time-dependent
   theoretical model is developed from an unsteady Bernoulli equation that
   has been modified to include viscous and unsteady effects. Results of
   both experiments and theory show that roll angle (the angle the plane of
   the bifurcating network makes with the horizontal) is an important
   contributor to bubble splitting ratio at each bifurcation within the
   bifurcating network. When compared to corresponding constant flow,
   pulsatile flow was shown to produce insignificant changes to the overall
   splitting ratio of the bubble despite the order one Womersley numbers,
   suggesting that bubble splitting through the vasculature could be
   modeled adequately with a more modest constant flow model. However,
   bubble lodging was affected by the flow pulsatility, and the effects of
   pulsatile flow were evident in the dependence of splitting ratio of
   bubble length. The ability of bubbles to remain lodged after reaching a
   steady state in the bifurcations is promising for the effectiveness of
   gas embolotherapy to occlude blood flow to tumors, and indicates the
   importance of understanding where lodging will occur in air embolism.
   The ability to accurately predict the bubble dynamics in unsteady flow
   within a bifurcating network is demonstrated and suggests the potential
   for bubbles in microfluidics devices to encode information in both
   steady and unsteady aspects of their dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosensors based on the unique electronic properties of nanotubes and
   nanowires offer high sensitivity and have the potential to revolutionize
   the field of Point-of-Care (POC) medical diagnosis. The direct current
   (dc) detection of a wide array of organic and inorganic molecules has
   been demonstrated on these devices. However, sensing mechanism based on
   measuring changes in dc conductance fails at high background salt
   concentrations, where the sensitivity of the devices suffers from the
   ionic screening due to mobile ions present in the solution. Here, we
   successfully demonstrate that the fundamental ionic screening effect can
   be mitigated by operating single-walled carbon nanotube field effect
   transistor as a high-frequency biosensor. The nonlinear mixing between
   the alternating current excitation field and the molecular dipole field
   can generate mixing current sensitive to the surface-bound biomolecules.
   Electrical detection of monolayer streptavidin binding to biotin in 100
   mM buffer solution is achieved at a frequency beyond 1 MHz. Theoretical
   modeling confirms improved sensitivity at high frequency through
   mitigation of the ionic screening effect. The results should promise a
   new biosensing platform for POC detection, where biosensors functioning
   directly in physiologically relevant condition are desired.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel modeling methodology for the nonlinear vibration
   analysis of multistage bladed-disk systems with small blade-to-blade
   mistuning and a cracked blade is proposed. The modeling strategy is
   based on an efficient stagewise reduced-order modeling method based on
   cyclic symmetry analysis and component mode synthesis. Reduced-order
   models are constructed for individual stages and assembled by projecting
   the motion of the interface of the neighboring stages onto a set of
   harmonic shape functions. The analysis procedure allows the stages to
   have different numbers of blades and mismatched computational grids on
   the interfaces of the neighboring stages. Furthermore, the modeling
   framework is independent of the modeling method for each stage, which
   enables the use of various existing modeling methods of single stages.
   Moreover, nonlinearity can also be included in the multistage
   computations, as long as the nonlinearity can be modeled for a single
   stage. To demonstrate the capability of the modeling procedure, the
   nonlinear effect of crack opening and closing is considered, in
   conjunction with the effects of small mistuning. The accuracy and
   efficiency of the proposed methods are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Deviations to the cyclic symmetry of turbomachinery blisks are common
   due to manufacturing, general wear, or foreign object damage. These
   deviations, called mistuning, can lead to dramatically increased forced
   responses of a few of the blades. The high computational cost associated
   with predictions for mistuned blisks has led to the development of
   various reduced-order modeling techniques. This paper introduces a new
   reduced-order modeling approach for both large and small mistuning. This
   approach makes use of a pristine-rogue-interface modal expansion
   (PRIME). The PRIME basis is a new basis composed of modes computed only
   from cyclic symmetry analyses. By strategically projecting a finite
   element model from the physical space onto the new basis, it is possible
   to accurately and efficiently model large mistuning. In addition, the
   new method can account for both large and small mistuning
   simultaneously, using an extension of the component mode mistuning
   approach. The methodology requires only sector-level calculations and
   therefore can be applied to highly refined, realistic models of
   industrial size.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{One of the most damaging environmental conditions to concrete structure
   is cyclic freezing and thawing. This paper discusses the influence of
   the high volumes of fly ash (FA) and micro poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA)
   fibers on the cyclic freeze-thaw resistance and microstructure of the
   Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC). ECC mixtures with two
   different FA-cement (FA/C) ratios (1.2 and 2.2 by weight), and at
   constant water-cementitious materials (fly ash and cement) ratio of 0.27
   are prepared. To compare the behavior of ECC with ECC matrix, all of the
   preceding properties are also investigated for ECC matrix mixtures of
   same composition without PVA fiber. For frost resistance, mixtures are
   exposed to the freeze and thaw cycles up to 300 cycles in accordance
   with ASTM C666, Procedure A. Experimental tests consist of measuring the
   residual mechanical properties (flexural strength, mid-span beam
   deflection and flexural stress - deflection curve), ultrasonic pulse
   velocity and mass loss. The roles of PVA fibers and FA are discussed
   through the analysis of microstructure and fiber-matrix interactions as
   function of frost exposure. The microstructural characterization by
   measuring pore size distributions is examined before and after exposure
   to frost deterioration by using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The
   air-void characteristics of mixtures are also studied using linear
   transverse method. Test results confirm that both ECC mixtures with high
   volumes of FA remain durable, and show a tensile strain capacity of more
   than 2\% even after 300 freezing and thawing cycles. On the other hand,
   before completing 300 freezing and thawing cycles, matrix (ECC without
   fiber) specimens have severely deteriorated, requiring removal from the
   freezethaw machine. Therefore, results indicate that the addition of
   micro PVA fiber to the ECC matrix substantially improved the frost
   resistance. The results of freeze-thaw tests also indicated that the
   reduction of residual physical and mechanical properties with increasing
   number of freeze-thaw cycles is relatively more for ECC mixture with
   FA/C ratio of 2.2 than for ECC mixture with FA/C ratio of 1.2. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and

   LBSs, albeit useful and convenient, pose a serious threat to users'

   via their queries for location-based information. How to protect users'
   privacy against potentially compromised LBS providers is of vital
   importance to the well being of the LBS ecosystem, given that the LBS
   market can expand and prosper only if users feel comfortable about using
   LBSs. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the existing
   schemes for protecting LBS users' privacy. We first introduce potential
   privacy threats to LBS users, followed by a discussion on privacy
   metrics. We then classify the protection schemes according to their
   architectural properties (i.e., server-based or mobile-device-based) and
   privacy metrics (e.g., k-anonymity or location entropy). Finally, we
   discuss several promising directions for future research into LBS users'
   privacy protection.}},

Abstract = {{Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein that has also been found to function
   as a proangiogenic signaling molecule. Improvements in antiangiogenic
   therapy can be engendered by metronomic dosing. Thus, we hypothesized
   that BH3-mimetic drugs that antagonize Bcl-2 family proteins may exert a
   greater efficacy when dosed metronomically. To examine this hypothesis,
   we employed AT101, an orally available and well-tolerated BH3-mimetic
   drug that has been established as effective. In a mouse xenograft model
   of human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that includes a humanized
   vasculature, we explored the effects of docetaxel in combination with
   either daily (metronomic) or weekly (bolus) doses of AT101. In addition,
   we explored the effect of single or combination therapy on angiogenesis
   and survival of endothelial or SCC cells in vitro. Metronomic AT101
   therapy increased mouse survival, decreased tumor mitotic index, and
   decreased tumor microvessel density, compared with bolus therapy.
   Therapeutic potentiation was achieved by similar overall drug exposure
   and without altering systemic toxicities. Combinations of AT101 and
   docetaxel produced additive toxicity in both endothelial and SCC tumor
   cells. Notably, subapoptotic concentrations of AT101 potently inhibited
   the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells. Taken together, our
   findings unveil the efficacious benefits that can be achieved by
   metronomic delivery of BH3-mimetic drugs, in particular suggesting that
   SCC patients with might benefit from low-dose continuous administration
   of these drugs. Cancer Res; 72(3); 716-25. (C) 2011 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Two 20 mm x 20 mm x 15 mm pixelated CZT detectors made by eV-Products
   were characterized using the new H3D Application Specific Integrated
   Circuits (ASIC) readout system developed by the Instrumentation Division
   at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The ASIC is capable of reading out
   energy and timing signals from 121 anode pixels and the planar cathode
   electrode of one CZT detector simultaneously. The system has a measured
   electronic noise of similar to 2.2 keV FWHM with a dynamic range from 20
   keV to 3.0 MeV. The two detectors achieved energy resolution of 0.48\%
   FWHM and 0.60\% FWHM, respectively, at 662 keV for single-pixel events
   from the entire 6.0 cm(3) detection volume at room temperature with an
   un-collimated Cs-137 source. The average (mu tau)(e) of both detectors
   were measured to be >10(-2) cm(2)/V. The detection efficiency of the two
   detectors was evaluated at several different energies up to 1.3 MeV by
   comparing with simulated data. It was found that the total counts agree
   well between the measured data and the simulated data over the studied
   energy range. However, the measured photopeak counts were 10-15\% lower
   than simulated photopeak counts at high gamma-ray energies. The analysis
   shows that the loss of photopeak efficiency is likely due to the charge
   loss from peripheral pixels to the boundary of detectors.}},

Title = {{Endoscopic Assessment and Prediction of Prostate Urethral Disintegration
   After Histotripsy Treatment in a Canine Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Histotripsy is a nonthermal focused ultrasound
   technology that uses acoustic cavitation to homogenize tissue. Previous
   research has demonstrated that the prostatic urethra is more resistant
   to histotripsy effects than prostate parenchyma, a finding that may
   complicate the creation of transurethral resection of the prostate-like
   treatment cavities. The purpose of this study was to characterize the
   endoscopic appearance of the prostatic urethra during and after
   histotripsy treatment and to identify features that are predictive of
   urethral disintegration.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-five histotripsy treatments were delivered
   in a transverse plane traversing the prostatic urethra in 17 canine
   subjects (1-3/prostate >= 1 cm apart). Real-time endoscopy was performed
   in the first four subjects to characterize development of acute urethral
   treatment effect (UTE). Serial postprocedure endoscopy was performed in
   all subjects to assess subsequent evolution of UTE.
   Results: Endoscopy during histotripsy was feasible with observation of
   intraurethral cavitation, allowing characterization of the real-time
   progression of UTE from normal to frank urethral disintegration. While
   acute urethral fragmentation occurred in 3/35 (8.6\%) treatments, frank
   urethral disintegration developed in 24/35 (68.5\%) within 14 days of
   treatment. Treating until the appearance of hemostatic pale gray shaggy
   urothelium was the best predictor of achieving urethral fragmentation
   within 14 days of treatment with positive and negative predictive values
   of 0.91 and 0.89, respectively.
   Conclusion: Endoscopic assessment of the urethra may be a useful adjunct
   to prostatic histotripsy to help guide therapy to ensure urethral
   disintegration, allowing drainage of the homogenized adenoma and
   effective tissue debulking.}},

Abstract = {{The current state of the art in the analysis of a control rod ejection
   event in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) relies on homogenization
   methods in which the assembly-averaged power from a whole-core nodal
   neutronics simulator is used with some type of flux reconstruction to
   estimate the individual fuel rod power. Recently, there has been
   interest in taking advantage of methods that do not require
   homogenization, such as the DeCART code, to perform time-dependent
   neutron transport calculations. These calculations could provide not
   only more accurate pin power results but also intrapin power information
   during the transient. The work described in this paper is the analysis
   of a PWR control rod ejection transient using the nodal core simulator
   PARCS, which employs homogenization methods, and the method of
   characteristics (MOC) code DeCART, which treats the explicit geometry.
   Higher-fidelity methods such as those used by DeCART have the potential
   to quantify the homogenization and modeling errors inherent in the
   lower-order methods. The methods used in PARCS and DeCART are briefly
   described as well as the approach to generate the temperature feedback
   for the rod ejection event. The results are compared and discussed. For
   the considered transient scenario, PARCS and DeCART are in generally
   good agreement for the predicted global and local powers as well as for
   the temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Metabolomics is a rapidly evolving field that holds promise
   to provide insights into genotype-phenotype relationships in cancers,
   diabetes and other complex diseases. One of the major informatics
   challenges is providing tools that link metabolite data with other types
   of high-throughput molecular data (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics),
   and incorporate prior knowledge of pathways and molecular interactions.
   Results: We describe a new, substantially redesigned version of our tool
   Metscape that allows users to enter experimental data for metabolites,
   genes and pathways and display them in the context of relevant metabolic
   networks. Metscape 2 uses an internal relational database that
   integrates data from KEGG and EHMN databases. The new version of the
   tool allows users to identify enriched pathways from expression
   profiling data, build and analyze the networks of genes and metabolites,
   and visualize changes in the gene/metabolite data. We demonstrate the
   applications of Metscape to annotate molecular pathways for human and
   mouse metabolites implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute
   lung injury, for the analysis of gene expression and metabolite data
   from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and for identification of the
   candidate metabolites involved in cancer and inflammation.

Abstract = {{The present study describes the biophysical characterization of

   varying ligand valency. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to determine the
   binding activity for riboflavin binding, protein (RfBP) in a cell free
   solution. The ITC data shows dendrimer conjugates have K-D values of >=
   465 nM on a riboflavin basis, an affinity similar to 93-fold lower than
   that of free riboflavin. The N-3 series showed greater binding affinity
   in comparison with the N-10 series. Notably, the affinity is inversely
   correlated with ligand valency. These findings are also corroborated by
   DSC where greater protein-conjugate stability is achieved with the N-3

   continuously adjusted to accommodate changes in process dynamics and
   disturbances, is investigated, including simulation-based robustness
   analysis of the adaptation law and a consideration of constrained
   estimation in the recursive least squares algorithm to address practical
   implementation issues. The performance of the MRAC process controller
   designed through simulation is experimentally validated. Good tracking
   of the reference process variable (i.e., punch force), and significant
   part quality improvement in the presence of disturbances, is achieved.

Abstract = {{We present a wireless and power-free, optomechanical, implantable
   microsensor that can potentially be used to accurately monitor
   intracranial pressure (ICP) over long periods of time. The developed
   microsensor vertically integrates a glass mini-lens with a
   two-wavelength quantum dot (QD) micropillar that is
   photolithographically patterned on an ICP-exposed silicon nitride
   membrane. The operation principle is based on a novel optomechanical
   transduction scheme that converts ICP changes into changes in the
   intensity ratio of the two-wavelength, near-infrared fluorescent light
   emitted from the QDs. The microsensor is micro-fabricated using silicon
   bulk micromachining, and it operates at an ICP clinically relevant
   pressure dynamic range (0-40 mmHg). The microsensor has a maximum error
   of less than 15\% throughout its dynamic range, and it is extremely
   photostable. We believe that the proposed microsensor will open up a new
   direction not only in ICP monitoring but in other pressure-related

Abstract = {{A comprehensive parametric study is presented on the vibration and the
   energy harvesting performance of a low-frequency zigzag energy
   harvester. The zigzag microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) vibrational
   energy harvesters have low natural frequencies which match the
   low-frequency range of ambient vibrations. The harvesters can,
   therefore, be designed to resonate with ambient excitation. The power
   produced by energy harvesters at resonance is orders of magnitude larger
   than off resonance power. The paper aims at providing an easy-to-use,
   comprehensive tool for designing the harvesters for different
   applications. The two key characteristics of the vibrational energy
   harvesters are their resonance frequency and their power transfer
   function. We formulate both vibrations and power production of the
   zigzag MEMS harvesters in nondimensional equations. The paper advances
   the state of the art in MEMS energy harvesting research area by
   identifying the dimensionless parameters governing mechanical vibrations
   and energy generation. We also investigate how the resonant frequency
   and the maximum power vary with each of the corresponding dimensionless
   parameters. The graphs summarize the parametric studies and provide
   sufficient tools for design of zigzag harvesters. The natural
   frequencies are related to six dimensionless variables, and the power
   transfer functions depend on 12 dimensionless parameters. {[}2010-0298]}},

Abstract = {{A microfabricated fluidic chip for sorting red blood cells (RBCs) by
   size has been designed, fabricated and tested. The performance of the
   chip has been compared against a flow cytometer using samples from
   identical populations of cells, and statistically significant (p <
   0.0005) differences in the measured cell size distributions were
   observed. The measurement paradigm reported here differs from previously
   demonstrated devices such as microfabricated Coulter counters or flow
   cytometers, in that the analysis is inherently parallel and is thus
   suitable for high throughput, point-of-care analysis. This study is
   empirical and semi-quantitative. However, important features of RBC
   trapping are characterized and indications for improved device design
   are described.}},

Title = {{Endothelial cell Bcl-2 and lymph node metastasis in patients with oral

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Loco-regional spread of disease causes high morbidity and is
   associated with the poor prognosis of malignant oral tumors. Better
   understanding of mechanisms underlying the establishment of lymph node
   metastasis is necessary for the development of more effective therapies
   for patients with oral cancer. The aims of this work were to evaluate a
   possible correlation between endothelial cell Bcl-2 and lymph node
   metastasis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and to
   study signaling pathways that regulate Bcl-2 expression in lymphatic
   endothelial cells.
   METHODS: Endothelial cells were selectively retrieved from
   paraffin-embedded tissue sections of primary human OSCC from patients
   with or without lymph node metastasis by laser capture microdissection.
   RT-PCR was used to evaluate Bcl-2 expression in tumor-associated
   endothelial cells and in tumor cells. In vitro, mechanistic studies were
   performed to examine the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF)-C on the expression of Bcl-2 in primary human lymphatic
   endothelial cells.
   RESULTS: We observed that Bcl-2 expression is upregulated in the
   endothelial cells of human oral tumors with lymph node metastasis as
   compared to endothelial cells from stage-matched tumors without
   metastasis. VEGF-C induced Bcl-2 expression in lymphatic endothelial
   cells via VEGFR-3 and PI3k / Akt signaling. Notably, OSCC cells express
   VEGF-C and induce Bcl-2 in lymphatic endothelial cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this work unveiled a mechanism for the
   induction of Bcl-2 in lymphatic endothelial cells and suggested that
   endothelial cell Bcl-2 contributes to lymph node metastasis in patients
   with oral squamous cell carcinoma. J Oral Pathol Med (2012) 41: 124-130}},

Abstract = {{Photochemistry provides a unique mechanism that enables the active
   control of drug release in cancer-targeting drug delivery. This study
   investigates the light-mediated release of methotrexate, an anticancer
   drug, using a photocleavable linker strategy based on o-nitrobenzyl
   protection. We evaluated two types of the o-nitrobenzyl-linked
   methotrexate for the drug release study and further extended the study
   to a fifth-generation poly(amidoamine) dendrimer carrier covalently
   conjugated with methotrexate via the onitrobenzyl linker. We performed
   the drug release studies by using a combination of three standard
   analytical methods that include UV/vis spectrometry, (1)H NMR
   spectroscopy, and anal. HPLC. This article reports that methotrexate is
   released by the photochemical mechanism in an actively controlled
   manner. The rate of the drug release varies in response to multiple
   control parameters, including linker design, light wavelength, exposure
   time, and the pH of the medium where the drug release occurs. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Traditional integrated circuit (IC) design flows optimize clock networks
   before signal-net routing are limited by the quality of register
   placement. Existing publications also reflect this bias and focus mostly
   on clock routing. The few known techniques for register placement
   exhibit significant limitations and do not account for recent progress
   in large-scale placement and obstacle-aware clock-network synthesis. In
   this paper, we integrate clock network synthesis within global placement
   by optimizing register locations. We propose: 1) obstacle-aware virtual
   clock-tree synthesis; 2) arboreal clock-net contraction force with
   virtual-node insertion, which can handle multiple clock domains and
   gated clocks; and 3) an obstacle-avoidance force (OAF). Our work is
   validated on large benchmarks with numerous macroblocks. Experimental
   results indicate that our software implementation, called Lopper, prunes
   clock-tree branches to reduce their length by 30.0\%-36.6\% and average
   total dynamic power consumption by 6.8\%-11.6\% versus conventional
   wirelength-driven approaches. SPICE-driven simulations show that our
   methods improve robustness of clock trees.}},

   imperative for heterogeneous 3-D ICs where memory, logic, analog, and

   sources on the drilling hole bottom surface (HBS) and hole wall surface
   (HWS) are first determined by the inverse heat transfer method. A 3-D
   heat carrier consisting of shell elements to carry the HWS heat flux and
   solid elements to carry the HBS heat flux has been developed to conduct
   the heat to the workpiece during the drilling simulation. A
   thermal-elastic coupled FEA was applied to calculate the workpiece
   thermal distortion based on the temperature distribution. The concept of
   the heat carrier was validated by comparing the temperature calculation
   with an existing 2-D advection model. The 3-D thermal distortion was
   validated experimentally on an aluminum workpiece with four deep-holes
   drilled sequentially. The measured distortion on the reference point was
   61 mu m, which matches within uncertainty the FEA predicted distortion

   process. The modeling is based on the theory that the material removal
   process in EDM is composed of two consecutive phases: the plasma heating
   phase in which intensive thermal energy density is applied locally to
   melt the work-material and the bubble collapsing phase in which the
   fluidic impact expels the molten material. A mathematical heat source
   model with Gaussian distributed heat flux and time variant heating area
   is applied in the plasma heating phase. Standard modules of a commercial
   computational fluid dynamics software, fluent, are adapted to model the
   crater formation in EDM. The material melting is simulated using
   transient heat transfer analysis and an enthalpy balance method. The
   volume of fraction (VOF) method is used to tackle the multiphase
   interactions in the processes of bubble compression and collapsing and
   molten material splashing and resolidification. Crater and debris
   geometries are attained from the model simulation and validation
   experiments are conducted to compare the crater morphology. The
   simulation and experiment results at different discharge conditions show
   good agreement on crater diameter suggest that the model is able to
   describe the mechanism of EDM crater formation. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Two novel techniques are proposed to enhance the bifurcation morphing
   method as applied to cantilever-based sensors. First, nonlinear feedback
   excitations with added time delay are employed to minimize the
   sensitivity of the sensors to small variations in the unavoidable time

   the sensors. This approach significantly reduces the time required to
   obtain bifurcation diagrams. Both techniques are demonstrated
   experimentally in detecting mass variations of a test cantilever beam.
   This cantilever-based sensor operating based on the bifurcation morphing

Abstract = {{The interaction of intense lasers with solid matter generates a hot
   plasma state that is well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck
   equation. Accurate and efficient modeling of the physics in these
   scenarios is highly pertinent, because it relates to experimental
   campaigns to produce energy by inertial confinement fusion on facilities
   such as the National Ignition Facility. Calculations involving the
   Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation are computationally intensive, but are
   crucial to proper understanding of a wide variety of physical effects
   and instabilities in inertial fusion plasmas. In this topical review, we
   will introduce the background physics related to Vlasov-Fokker-Planck
   simulation, and then proceed to describe results from numerical
   simulation of inertial fusion plasma in a pedagogical manner by
   discussing some key numerical algorithm developments that enabled the
   research to take place. A qualitative comparison of the techniques is
   also given. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing demand for high energy density in Li-ion batteries has fueled
   intensive efforts for the search of high specific capacity anode
   materials to replace the carbon anodes. Among transition metal oxides,
   nanostructured Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) was found to be one of the better
   anode materials for Li-ion batteries. However, the processing routes
   employed so far have been able to produce different kinds of
   nanostructured Co3O4 powders, which then require further processing to
   obtain battery electrodes. Here, we propose a single step and industrial
   scale solution precursor plasma technique to develop nanostructured,
   porous and flexible Co3O4 electrodes directly on current collectors. In
   this process, an aqueous solution precursor comprising of cobalt acetate
   is fed into a plasma plume to form nanostructured Co3O4 particles, which
   are then deposited on a current collector. These electrodes are binder
   and carbon free, and their microstructures revealed nano particulate
   structure with porosity. Phase, crystallinity and microstructures of the
   Co3O4 films were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Differential
   scanning calorimetry-Thermogravimetry (DSC-TGA). Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Electrochemical characterization indicated an average cell voltage of
   similar to 1.0-1.25 V against Li electrode with specific discharge
   capacities close to the theoretical value (similar to 890 mAhr g(-1)).

   implemented in a ground rupture experiment with a scaled-down concrete
   pipeline. The behavior of the pipeline, including the failure modes and
   damage inflicted to the pipe segments, was monitored during the test.
   Two modes of failure were identified in the test: (1) compression
   associated with telescoping-type deformation and (2) bending at the
   pipeline joints closest to the fault plane. Consequently, future
   research toward advancing sensing technology for concrete pipelines will
   likely focus on the behavior of the joints. (C) 2012 American Society of

Abstract = {{The pursuit of innovative ship designs, the use of new materials, and
   the increasingly demanding performance requirements dictate a broadly
   focused thrust for addressing noise and vibration issues during the
   design process. This expanded technical view also requires that the
   types of tools used for these assessments can provide results within a
   short enough time to affect the design cycle. Recently, an Energy Finite
   Element Analysis (EFEA) formulation has been developed for computing the
   vibration and the associated radiated noise of complex vehicles at
   frequencies where conventional finite element methods are no longer
   efficient. In this paper the main theoretical aspects of the EFEA are
   presented first. Next, a substructuring capability is described where
   large computational models, typical of naval applications, can be
   subdivided into separate domains for pursuing a compartmentalized
   solution and achieving further improvements in computational efficiency.
   Finally, validation case studies are presented with correlation between
   computations and scaled model testing.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic mechanical input is believed to play a critical role in the
   development of functional musculoskeletal tissues. To study this
   phenomenon, cyclic uniaxial mechanical stretch was applied to engineered
   ligaments using a custom-built bioreactor and the effects of different
   stretch frequency, amplitude, and duration were determined. Stretch
   acutely increased the phosphorylation of p38 (3.5 +/- 0.74-fold), S6K1
   (3.9 +/- 0.19- fold), and ERK1/2 (2.45 +/- 0.32-fold). The
   phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was dependent on time, rather than on
   frequency or amplitude, within these constructs. ERK1/2 phosphorylation
   was similar following stretch at frequencies from 0.1 to 1Hz and
   amplitudes from 2.5\% to 15\%, whereas phosphorylation reached maximal
   levels at 10 min of stretch and returned toward basal within 60 min of
   stretch. Following a single 10-min bout of cyclic stretch, the cells
   remained refractory to a second stretch for up to 6 h. Using the
   phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as a guide, the optimum stretch paradigm was
   hypothesized to be 10 min of stretch at 2.5\% of resting length repeated
   every 6 h. Consistent with this hypothesis, 7 days of stretch using this
   optimized intermittent stretch program increased the collagen content of
   the grafts more than a continuous stretch program (CTL = 3.1\% +/-
   0.44\%; CONT=4.8\% +/- 0.30\%; and INT = 5.9\% +/- 0.56\%). These
   results suggest that short infrequent bouts of loading are optimal for
   improving engineered tendon and ligament physiology.}},

Title = {{The role of the methyl ester moiety in biodiesel combustion: A kinetic
   modeling comparison of methyl butanoate and n-butane}},

Abstract = {{Growth of the biodiesel industry has motivated increased study of the
   combustion characteristics of its constituent molecules and building
   combustion modeling capability. Understanding how these characteristics
   differ between bio-derived and conventional diesel fuels can help in
   evaluating biodiesel performance. A kinetic modeling comparison of
   methyl butanoate and n-butane, its corresponding alkane, contrasted the
   combustion of methyl esters and normal alkanes, towards understanding
   the effect of the methyl ester moiety. Utilizing a combined n-heptane
   and methyl butanoate kinetic mechanism in shock tube simulations, the
   results predicted no region of negative temperature coefficient (NTC)
   behavior for methyl butanoate, compared to a well defined NTC region for
   n-butane. We observed that oxidation pathways associated with the methyl
   ester moiety inhibited NTC behavior, through increased production of
   hydroperoxy radicals (HO(2)) instead of hydroxyl radicals (OH). In
   addition, we compared the evolution of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
   ethylene and acetylene. The early formation of CO and CO(2), directly
   from methyl butanoate, revealed unique reaction pathways that also
   influenced a reduction in soot precursor formation. Overall, these
   results will help to understand how combustion processes change with the
   inclusion of oxygenated fuels, which will inform the study and design of
   combustion technologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the formation and evolution of irradiation-induced
   nanorod (NR) growth through a comparison of focused-ion-beam irradiation
   of InSb wafers and InSb/GaAs heterostructures. Above a critical ion
   dose, cone-shaped NRs capped with In islands form on both InSb surfaces.
   For InSb wafers, the NR base diameter increases with ion energy. In the
   case of InSb/GaAs heterostructures, as the milled depth approaches the
   InSb/GaAs interface, the cone-shaped NRs transition to capless NRs with
   a truncated cone shape. These results suggest a growth mechanism in
   which both the NR cap and body are supplied by redeposition of atoms
   sputtered from InSb. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Regiospecific Plasmonic Assemblies for in Situ Raman Spectroscopy in
   Live Cells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1699-1709}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Multiple properties of plasmonic assemblies are determined by their
   geometrical organization. While high degree of complexity was achieved
   for plasmonic superstructures based on nanoparticles (NPs), little is
   known about the stable and structurally reproducible plasmonic
   assemblies made up from geometrically diverse plasmonic building blocks.
   Among other possibilities, they open the door for the preparation of
   regiospecific isomers of nanoscale assemblies significant both from a
   fundamental point of view and optical applications. Here, we present a
   synthetic method for complex assemblies from NPs and nanorods (NRs)
   based on selective modification of NRs with DNA oligomers. Three types
   of assemblies denoted as End, Side, and Satellite isomers that display
   distinct elements of regiospecificity were prepared with the yield
   exceeding 85\%. Multiple experimental methods independently verify
   various structural features, uniformity, and stability of the prepared
   assemblies. The presence of interparticle gaps with finely controlled
   geometrical parameters and inherently small size comparable with those
   of cellular organelles fomented their study as intracellular probes.
   Against initial expectations, SERS intensity for End, Side, and
   Satellite isomers was found to be dependent primarily on the number Of
   the NPs in the superstructures rationalized with the help of electrical
   field simulations. Incubation of the label-free NP-NR assemblies with
   HeLa cells indicated sufficient field enhancement to detect structural
   lipids of mitochondria and potentially small metabolites. This provided
   the first proof-of-concept data for the possibility of real-time probing
   of the local organelle environment in live cells. Further studies should
   include structural optimization of the assemblies for multitarget
   monitoring of metabolic activity and further increase in complexity for
   applications in transformative optics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Glassy polymers show ``strain hardening{''}: at constant extensional
   load, their flow first accelerates, then arrests. Recent experiments
   have found this to be accompanied by a striking and unexplained dip in
   the segmental relaxation time. Here we explain such behavior by
   combining a minimal model of flow-induced liquefaction of a glass with a
   description of the stress carried by strained polymers, creating a
   nonfactorable interplay between aging and strain-induced rejuvenation.
   Under constant load, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong
   flow that creates polymer-borne stress. This slows the deformation
   enough for the segmental modes to revitrify, causing strain hardening.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{With powerful genetics and a translucent cuticle, the Drosophila larva
   is an ideal model system for live imaging studies of neuronal cell
   biology and function. Here, we present an easy-to-use approach for high
   resolution live imaging in Drosophila using microfluidic chips. Two
   different designs allow for non-invasive and chemical-free
   immobilization of 3rd instar larvae over short (up to 1 hour) and long
   (up to 10 hours) time periods. We utilized these `larva chips' to
   characterize several subcellular responses to axotomy which occur over a
   range of time scales in intact, unanaesthetized animals. These include
   waves of calcium which are induced within seconds of axotomy, and the
   intracellular transport of vesicles whose rate and flux within axons
   changes dramatically within 3 hours of axotomy. Axonal transport halts
   throughout the entire distal stump, but increases in the proximal stump.
   These responses precede the degeneration of the distal stump and
   regenerative sprouting of the proximal stump, which is initiated after a
   7 hour period of dormancy and is associated with a dramatic increase in
   F-actin dynamics. In addition to allowing for the study of axonal
   regeneration in vivo, the larva chips can be utilized for a wide variety
   of in vivo imaging applications in Drosophila.}},

Abstract = {{A photonic molecule semiconductor microdisk laser consisting of three
   vertically coupled disks of 1.4 mu m in diameter is fabricated and
   optically pumped. Clear mode splitting arising from the strong vertical
   optical coupling is observed and confirmed by the coupled mode theory.
   The inter-coupling strength similar to 0.40 THz of optical modes between
   adjacent disks is calculated and agrees well with the experiment.
   Moreover the multiple stacked microdisk laser has a large spontaneous
   emission factor (beta similar to 0.72) by fitting the L-L curves and
   provides some potential functional devices in cavity quantum
   electrodynamics systems and highly-dense photonic integrated circuits.

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of 40 surfaces of
   lithium peroxide (Li2O2) and lithium oxide (Li2O) were characterized
   using first-principles calculations. As these compounds constitute
   potential discharge products in Li-oxygen batteries, their surface
   properties are expected to play a key role in understanding
   electrochemical behavior in these systems. Stable surfaces were
   identified by comparing 23 distinct Li2O2 surfaces and 17 unique Li2O
   surfaces; crystallite areal fractions were determined through
   application of the Wulff construction. Accounting for the oxygen
   overbinding error in density functional theory results in the
   identification of several new Li2O2 oxygen-rich \{0001\} and \{1 (1)
   over bar 00\} terminations that are more stable than those previously
   reported. Although oxygen-rich facets predominate in Li2O2, in Li2O
   stoichiometric surfaces are preferred, consistent with prior studies.
   Surprisingly, surface-state analyses reveal that the stable surfaces of
   Li2O2 are half-metallic, despite the fact that Li2O2 is a bulk
   insulator. Surface oxygens in these facets are ferromagnetic with
   magnetic moments ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 mu(B), In contrast, the stable
   surfaces of Li2O are insulating and nonmagnetic. The distinct surface
   properties of these compounds may explain observations of
   electrochemical reversibility for systems in which Li2O2 is the
   discharge product and the irreversibility of systems that discharge to
   Li2O. Moreover, the presence of conductive surface pathways in Li2O2
   could offset capacity limitations expected to arise from limited
   electron transport through the bulk.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a single intraperitoneal injection of erythropoietin
   (EPO) loaded oligochitosan nanoparticles (epo-NPs) (average diameter 266
   nm) was investigated as a treatment for periventricular leukomalacia
   (PVL). Nanoparticles were fabricated using a gelation technology
   process. PVL rats models were prepared to examine the therapeutic
   efficacy of epo-NPs and analyze the mechanism by which epo-NPs protect
   white matter. The metabolization of epo-NPs in the liver was also
   investigated. The pathology and behavioral data show that this single
   injection of a low quantity of epo-NPs had an excellent therapeutic
   effect on the rat model of PVL. The EPO release curve in phosphate
   buffered saline solution was a good fit with the zero-order kinetics
   distribution and was maintained at around 25\% in 48 h. In vivo
   experiments demonstrated that 50 IU/kg epo-NPs had the same effect as a
   5000 IU/kg direct injection of free EPO. Nanoparticles prolonged the
   time course of EPO metabolization in the liver and the stable release of
   EPO from the nanoparticles kept the plasma concentration of EPO at
   around 100 IU/ml during the 8-12 h post-injection. Therefore, we suggest
   that oligochitosan based nanoparticles are an effective vehicle for drug
   delivery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents microfluidic devices that autonomously convert two
   constant flow inputs into an alternating oscillatory flow output. We
   accomplish this hardware embedded self-control programming using
   normally closed membrane valves that have an inlet, an outlet, and a
   membrane-pressurization chamber connected to a third terminal.
   Adjustment of threshold opening pressures in these 3-terminal flow
   switching valves enabled adjustment of oscillation periods to between 57
   and 360 s with duty cycles of 0.2-0.5. These values are in relatively
   good agreement with theoretical values, providing the way for rational
   design of an even wider range of different waveform oscillations. We
   also demonstrate the ability to use these oscillators to perform
   temporally patterned delivery of chemicals to living cells. The device
   only needs a syringe pump, thus removing the use of complex, expensive
   external actuators. These tunable waveform microfluidic oscillators are
   envisioned to facilitate cell-based studies that require temporal
   stimulation.}},

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{We develop a versatile, self-referenced composite Fabry-Perot (FP)
   sensor and the corresponding detection scheme for rapid and precise
   measurement of vapors. The composite FP vapor sensor is formed by
   etching two juxtaposed micron-deep wells, with a precisely controlled
   offset in depth, on a silicon wafer. The wells are then coated with a
   vapor sensitive polymer and the reflected light from each well is
   detected by a CMOS imager. Due to its self-referenced nature, the
   composite FP sensor is able to extract the change in thickness and
   refractive index of the polymer layer upon exposure to analyte vapors,
   thus allowing for accurate vapor quantitation regardless of the polymer
   thickness, refractive index, and light incident angle and wavelength.
   Theoretical analysis is first performed to elucidate the underlying
   detection principle, followed by experimental demonstration at two
   different incident angles showing rapid and consistent measurement of
   the polymer changes when the polymer is exposed to three different
   analytes at various concentrations. The vapor detection limit is found
   to be on the order of a few pico-grams (similar to 100 ppb) (C)2012

Abstract = {{We propose a new scanhead design for combined ultrasound

   microring for acoustic detection. No conventional piezoelectric device
   is needed, and the cost of the design makes it suitable for one-time,
   disposable use. Furthermore, a single laser pulse is employed to
   generate both US and PA signals. A subband imaging method can be applied
   to the receiver to enhance the contrast between the US and PA signals.
   Phantom data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. (C)2012

   coating on copper alloy substrate was investigated for high pressure die

   was coated on cylindrical copper alloy core material both directly as
   well as using 316 stainless steel as a buffer layer to evaluate and
   compare their thermal fatigue properties. Two types of cracks at the
   surface of both coatings were observed and investigated. The network of
   small and shallow cracks on the surface was the result of thermal stress
   while the large catastrophic cracks were believed to be the consequence
   of thermal stress coupled with the thermal expansion mismatch between
   the H13 tool steel coating and copper alloy core materials. The H13 tool
   steel, coated with 316 stainless steel showed much less number of cracks
   compared to the directly coated H13 tool steel indicating superior
   thermal fatigue resistance. Moreover the first layer of the directly
   coated H13 tool steel showed vulnerable behavior under high temperature

Abstract = {{Flow boiling heat transfer under microgravity conditions can be extended
   and enhanced by means of using porous stacks, or capillary columns,
   arranged on top of a flat heated surface. Under these conditions, body
   forces are negligible to remove the generated vapor away from the hot
   surface, which eventually hinders liquid from reaching it. It is
   possible to increase the critical heat flux (CHF) by having porous
   stacks symmetrically arranged on this surface; which draws the liquid
   phase towards it by means of capillary forces. Various flow regimes in
   the capillary enhanced surface flow boiling can be identified. These
   include: the regime where the liquid is supplied between the columns,
   the regime where the liquid flow is controlled by liquid capturing and
   the viscous drag-capillarity in the columns, and the critical heat flux.
   For the theoretical model, the expression for the interfacial lift-off
   model critical heat flux was interpreted based on customizable
   parameters instead of those imposed by the physics of the flow. This
   study indicates a potential improvement in CHF by having an inter-column
   spacing smaller than the critical wavelength for a plain surface. There
   is also a potential benefit of having the wetting contact to wavelength
   ratio to be larger than the constant of 0.2 found in experimental
   studies. The CHF regime can occur by a limitation of the stacks to have
   access to the liquid phase, as it happens when they are completely
   submerged in a vapor phase, or by reaching the maximum capillary
   pressure drop in the stack (as per the Darcy-Ergun momentum equation),
   or by reaching an entrainment limit of the vapor flow passed the
   capillary columns. Therefore the critical heat flux can also be extended
   as long as the capillary columns protrude over the vapor layer and their
   viscous capillary and entrainment limits are not reached. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide adsorption properties of a series of templated carbon
   adsorbents with high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas (1361-3840
   m(2)/g) and with/without nitrogen doping (6-7 wt \% N) were
   systematically studied. Two linear relationships between CO2 adsorption
   capacities and surface areas of nitrogen-doped/undoped nanostructured
   templated carbons were first established. The doped nitrogen was present
   in the forms of pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic/pyridonic nitrogen,
   quaternary nitrogen, and an oxidized form of nitrogen. The interaction
   energies with CO2, as approximated by the isosteric heats of adsorption,
   were increased from 30 kJ/mol on the undoped carbon to 50 kJ/mol on the
   N-doped carbon as a result of these nitrogen sites. The increased
   interactions led to an enhancement in CO2 adsorption capacity by a
   factor of 2, while N-2 uptake was not enhanced. The optimized N-doped
   templated carbon, N-TC-EMC, possessed remarkable CO2 capacity (4 mmol/g
   at 1 atm and 298 K) and selectivity (CO2/N-2 at 1 atm = 14). Postdoping
   ammonia treatment was found beneficial to CO2 adsorption. CO2
   performance of N-doped carbon under wet condition and conditions
   relevant to flue gas, rates of adsorption, and regeneration requirement,
   which are important for practical applications, were also investigated.
   The results showed that N-doped templated carbon exhibited all
   prerequisite attributes for CO2 capture and storage applications: high
   CO2 capacity and CO2/N-2 selectivity, fast and reversible adsorption,
   thermal and moisture stabilities, and ease in CO2 desorption.}},

Abstract = {{Recent efforts have been made to develop high-capacity complex hydride
   composites by combining alanates and amides. The hydrogen storage
   mechanisms in those composites are not unambiguously clarified because
   of chemical reactions during the sample preparation process. In this
   Article, we have studied the effects of sample preparation conditions on
   the phase stability of a mixture of 3Mg(NH2)(2)-2Li(3)AlH(6) and
   identified that unlike high-energy ball-milling light mixing generates a
   physical mixture of the reactants without decomposition. Subsequently,
   the hydrogen storage properties, the desorption pathway, and the
   reversible reaction mechanism of the composite were investigated through
   a combination of kinetic measurements and phase and microstructure
   analyses. The results reveal that the first step of hydrogen release
   (initiated at 170 degrees C) involves decomposition of Li3AlH6 to LiH
   and Al. The second step of hydrogen release occurs as the temperature
   increases (to 230 degrees C) when Mg(NH2)(2) reacts with LiH to form
   Li2Mg(NH)(2). If desorption of the 3Mg(NH2)(2)-2Li(3)AlH(6) mixture is
   limited to a temperature of 400 degrees C, then the reversible reaction
   takes place between Li2Mg(NH)(2) (plus H-2) and LiH and Mg(NH2)(2). We
   find that the Al generated from the first hydrogen release step does not
   participate in the reversible hydrogen storage process and instead
   inhibits mass transfer that results in higher desorption temperatures
   (and low desorption rates) and lowers the overall reversible capacity
   (2.7 wt \%) as compared with the neat reaction (i.e., similar to 4.3 wt
   \% without the presence of Al).}},

Abstract = {{Sonoporation is the membrane disruption generated by ultrasound and has
   been exploited as a non-viral strategy for drug and gene delivery.
   Acoustic cavitation of microbubbles has been recognized to play an
   important role in sonoporation. However, due to the lack of adequate
   techniques for precise control of cavitation activities and real-time
   assessment of the resulting sub-micron process of sonoporation, limited
   knowledge has been available regarding the detail processes and
   correlation of cavitation with membrane disruption at the single cell
   level. In the current study, we developed a combined approach including
   optical, acoustical, and electrophysiological techniques to enable
   synchronized manipulation, imaging, and measurement of cavitation of
   single bubbles and the resulting cell membrane disruption in real-time.
   Using a self-focused femtosecond laser and high frequency ultrasound
   (7.44 MHz) pulses, a single microbubble was generated and positioned at
   a desired distance from the membrane of a Xenopus oocyte. Cavitation of
   the bubble was achieved by applying a low frequency (1.5 MHz) ultrasound
   pulse (duration 13.3 or 40 mu s) to induce bubble collapse. Disruption
   of the cell membrane was assessed by the increase in the transmembrane
   current (TMC) of the cell under voltage clamp. Simultaneous high-speed
   bright field imaging of cavitation and measurements of the TMC were
   obtained to correlate the ultrasound-generated bubble activities with
   the cell membrane poration. The change in membrane permeability was
   directly associated with the formation of a sub-micrometer pore from a
   local membrane rupture generated by bubble collapse or bubble
   compression depending on ultrasound amplitude and duration. The impact
   of the bubble collapse on membrane permeation decreased rapidly with
   increasing distance (D) between the bubble (diameter d) and the cell
   membrane. The effective range of cavitation impact on membrane poration
   was determined to be D/d = 0.75. The maximum mean radius of the pores
   was estimated from the measured TMC to be 0.106 +/- 0.032 mu m (n=70)
   for acoustic pressure of 1.5 MPa (duration 13.3 mu s), and increased to
   0.171 +/- 0.030 mu m (n = 125) for acoustic pressure of 1.7 MPa and to
   0.182 +/- 0.052 mu m (n = 112) for a pulse duration of 40 mu s (1.5
   MPa). These results from controlled cell membrane permeation by
   cavitation of single bubbles revealed insights and key factors affecting
   sonoporation at the single cell level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve injuries resulting from trauma or disease often
   necessitate surgical intervention. Although the gold standard for such
   repairs uses nerve autografts, alternatives that do not require invasive
   harvesting of autologous nerve tissues are currently being designed and
   evaluated. We previously established the use of scaffoldless engineered
   neural conduits (ENCs) fabricated from primary cells as one such
   alternative in sciatic nerve repair in rats {[}Baltich et al. (2010) In
   Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim 46(5):438-444]. The present study establishes
   protocols for fabricating neural conduits from adipose-derived stem
   cells (ASCs) differentiated to either a fibroblast or neural lineage and
   co-cultured into a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffoldless tissue-ENC.
   Addition of ascorbic acid-2-phosphate and fibroblast growth factor
   (FGF)-2 to the medium induced and differentiated ASCs to a fibroblast
   lineage in more than 90\% of the cell population, as confirmed by
   collagen I expression. ASC-differentiated fibroblasts formed monolayers,
   delaminated, and formed 3-D conduits. Neurospheres were formed by
   culturing ASCs on non-adherent surfaces in serum-free neurobasal medium
   with the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and FGF-2. The
   addition of 10 ng EGF and 10 ng FGF-2 produced larger and more numerous
   neurospheres than treatments of lower EGF and FGF-2 concentrations.
   Subsequent differentiation to glial-like cells was confirmed by the
   expression of S100. ASC-derived fibroblast monolayers and neurospheres
   were co-cultured to fabricate a 3-D scaffoldless tissue-ENC. Their
   nerve-like structure and incorporation of glial-like cells, which would
   associate with regenerating axons, may make these novel, stem
   cell-derived neural conduits an efficacious technology for repairing
   critical gaps following peripheral nerve injury. (C) 2011 IBRO.

   directly that Au nanoparticles, which were originally fully embedded in

Title = {{Porphyrins Fused with Unactivated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{143-159}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{A systematic study of the preparation of porphyrins with extended
   conjugation by meso,beta-fusion with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) is reported. The meso-positions of 5,15-unsubstituted porphyrins
   were readily functionalized with PAHs. Ring fusion using standard Scholl
   reaction conditions (FeCl3, dichloromethane) occurs for
   perylene-substituted porphyrins to give a porphyrin beta,meso annulated
   with perylene rings (0.7:1 ratio of syn and anti isomers). The
   naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene derivatives do not react under Scholl
   conditions but are fused using thermal cyclodehydrogenation at high
   temperatures, giving mixtures of syn and anti isomers of the
   meso,beta-fused porphyrins. For pyrenyl-substituted porphyrins, a
   thermal method gives synthetically acceptable yields (>30\%). Absorption
   spectra of the fused porphyrins undergo a progressive bathochromic shift
   in a series of naphthyl (lambda(max) = 730 nm), coronenyl (lambda(max) =
   780 nm), pyrenyl (lambda(max) = 815 nm), and perylenyl (lambda(max) =
   900 nm) annulated porphyrins. Despite being conjugated with
   unsubstituted fused PAHs, the beta,meso-fused porphyrins are more
   soluble and processable than the parent nonfused precursors.
   Pyrenyl-fused porphyrins exhibit strong fluorescence in the
   near-infrared (NIR) spectral region, with a progressive improvement in
   luminescent efficiency (up to 13\% with lambda(max) = 829 nm) with
   increasing degree of fusion. Fused pyrenyl-porphyrins have been used as
   broadband absorption donor materials in photovoltaic cells, leading to
   devices that show comparatively high photovoltaic efficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{As stated in the Office of the Secretary of Defense's Unmanned Aircraft
   Systems Roadmap 2005-2030, reconnaissance is the number one priority
   mission for Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) of all sizes. During
   reconnaissance missions, classification of objects of interest (e.g, as
   friend or foe) is key to mission performance. Classification is based on
   information collection, and it has generally been assumed that the more
   information collected, the better the classification decision. Although
   this is a correct general trend, a recent study has shown it does not
   hold in all cases. This paper focuses on presenting methods to plan
   paths for unmanned vehicles that optimize classification decisions (as
   opposed to the amount of information collected). We consider an unmanned
   vehicle (agent) classifying an object of interest in a given area. The
   agent plans its path to collect the information most relevant to
   optimizing its classification performance, based on the maximum
   likelihood ratio. In addition, a classification performance measure for
   multiple measurements is analytically derived.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a remote estimation problem with an energy-harvesting sensor
   and a remote estimator. The sensor harvests energy from its environment
   (say, for example, through a solar cell) and uses this energy for the
   purpose of communicating with the estimator. Due to the randomness of
   energy available for communication, we need to find a communication
   scheduling strategy for the sensor. The estimator relies on messages
   communicated by the sensor to produce real-time estimates of the
   sensor's observations. We consider the problem of finding a
   communication scheduling strategy for the sensor and an estimation
   strategy for the estimator that jointly minimize an expected sum of
   communication and distortion costs over a finite time horizon. We find a
   dynamic programming characterization of optimal strategies. Under some
   symmetry assumptions on source statistics and the distortion metric, we
   show that an optimal communication strategy is a threshold based one and
   that the optimal estimate is always the most recently received sensor

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce the problem of dynamic pricing of power for
   smart-grid networks. We consider a network utility maximization (NUM)
   framework in a deterministic setting with a single provider, multiple
   users and a finite horizon. The provider produces power or buys power in
   a (deterministic) spot market, and determines a dynamic price to charge
   the users. The users then adjust their demand in response to the
   time-varying prices. This is typically categorized as the problem of
   demand response, and we study a progression of related models by
   focusing on the characterization of the structure of the optimal dynamic
   prices in the Smart Grid and the optimal demand and supply under various
   interaction with a spot market.}},

Abstract = {{In a teaching lab focused on embedded control, students create and
   interact with virtual environments using a haptic interface. Coupling
   physical (in particular physiological) environments to virtual
   environments gives rise to many interesting phenomena, one of which is
   the appearance of dissipativity in the coupled dynamics, the source of
   which is difficult to identify. Simple harmonic oscillators without
   damping exhibit damped behavior and diminished peak amplitudes when
   students excite them with their best manual approximations of step
   inputs. Motivated in part by our desire to develop teaching materials,
   we seek a simple human user model that describes the observed phenomena.
   We have found that a second order spring-mass-damper model describes the
   source impedance with which a human user is able to impose a position
   input on the haptic device, and that this impedance model can be
   incorporated into a model of the user's neuromotor intent by placing the
   spring as a series elastic element with a motion source. We use simple
   models to describe smooth inputs generated by the user's neuromotor
   system, and these are expressed as displacements of the motion source.
   We use the same haptic device to conduct system identification
   experiments using frequency domain techniques to estimate the driving
   point impedance of the human hand, and have recently incorporated these
   experiments into lab exercises.}},

   pendulum, a serial connection of n rigid links connected by spherical
   joints, that is attached to a rigid cart. The cart can translate in a
   horizontal plane acted on by a horizontal control force while the chain
   pendulum can undergo complex motion in 3D due to gravity. The
   configuration of the system is in (S-2)(n) x R-2. We examine the rich
   structure of the uncontrolled system dynamics: the equilibria of the
   system correspond to any one of 2(n) different chain pendulum
   configurations and any cart location. A linearization about each
   equilibrium, and the corresponding controllability criterion is
   provided. We also show that any equilibrium can be asymptotically
   stabilized by using a proportional-derivative type controller, and we
   provide a few numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Reversibility of dynamical processes arises in many physical dynamical
   systems. For example, lossless Newtonian and Hamiltonian mechanical
   systems exhibit trajectories that can be obtained by time going forward
   and backward, providing an example of time symmetry that arises in
   natural sciences. Another example of such time symmetry is the
   phenomenon known as Poincare recurrence wherein the dynamical system
   exhibits trajectories that return infinitely often to neighborhoods of
   their initial conditions. In this paper, we study output reversibility
   in linear dynamical systems, that is, the backward recoverability of the
   system output while time is going forward. Specifically, we provide
   necessary and sufficient conditions for output reversibility in terms of
   the spectrum of the system dynamics. In addition, we provide sufficient
   conditions for the absence of output reversibility. Furthermore, we
   establish that no system trajectory can retrace its time history
   backwards with time going forward which is also natural in light of the
   uniqueness of solutions to linear dynamical systems. Finally, we draw
   connections between output reversibility and Poincare recurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional system identification uses measurements of the inputs, but
   when these measurements are not available, alternative methods, such as
   blind identification, output-only identification, or operational modal
   analysis, must be used. Yet another method is sensor-to-sensor
   identification (S2SID), which estimates pseudo transfer functions whose
   inputs are outputs of the original system. A special case of S2SID is
   transmissibility identification. Since S2SID depends on cancellation of
   the input, this approach does not extend to nonlinear systems. However,
   in the present paper we show that, for the case of a two-output
   Hammerstein system, the least-squares estimate of the PTF is consistent,
   that is, asymptotically correct, despite the presence of the
   nonlinearities.}},

   reference governor complexity for systems with states decomposable into
   ``slow{''} and ``fast{''} states. The reference governor design is based
   on the reduced order model for ``slow{''} states, where constraints are
   tightened to ensure that the contribution of fast states does not cause
   constraint violation. The first of two examples demonstrates that a
   reference governor based on just two states can handle the surge
   constraint for a turbocharged downsized gasoline described by five
   dynamic states. The second example demonstrates that the tip deflection
   limits in an infinite-dimensional model of a flexible Euler-Bernoulli
   free-free beam can be handled based on just two modal coordinates.}},

   norm bounds of Kalman gain and the innovations covariance matrix in the

   transfer function and the true one, is derived with a given confidence

Abstract = {{Model-based control design for reducing the cyclic variability (CV) in
   lean autoignition combustion is presented. The design is based on a
   recently proposed control-oriented model that captures the experimental
   observations of CV. The model is extended here to include the effect of
   the fuel injection timing, which is an effective way of influencing the
   combustion phasing. This model is only stable for certain amounts of
   residual gas. For high amounts, runaway behavior occurs where the
   combustion phasing occurs increasingly earlier. For low amounts, a
   cascade of period-doubling bifurcations occurs leading to chaotic
   behavior. This complex dynamics is further complicated with significant
   levels of noise, which creates a challenging control problem. With the
   aim at controllers feasible for on-board implementation, a proportional
   controller and a reduced-order state feedback controller are designed,
   with feedback from the combustion phasing. The controllers are evaluated
   by simulations and the results show that the CV can be significantly
   reduced, in an operating point of engine speed and load, for a wide
   range of residual gas fractions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the speed control of a spark ignition engine with an open
   torque converter during vehicle deceleration. In these conditions, the
   torque transmitted from the engine to the wheels through the torque
   converter, and the corresponding torque load on the engine, is related
   to the torque converter speed ratio, the ratio between the turbine speed
   and the engine/impeller speed. The engine speed controller needs to
   effectively coordinate airflow and spark timing and to enforce
   constraints including engine stall avoidance, misfire avoidance, and
   desired actuator operating ranges. We formulate a model of the relevant
   powertrain dynamics, and propose a parametrization that removes a
   multiplicative nonlinearity, hence enabling the application of linear
   quadratic model predictive control (MPC). The MPC controller is
   synthesized as a piecewise affine state feedback and evaluated in
   simulations and in an experimental vehicle showing good performance in
   reference tracking and settling time, which translates in smooth and
   more consistent deceleration profiles and potential for fuel economy
   improvements.}},

Abstract = {{While learning frameworks, such as iterative learning control (ILC),
   offer excellent performance improvements for systems that execute a task
   repetitively; algorithm constraints have often limited the effectiveness
   of this approach for applications with non-repetitive system dynamics or
   trajectories. Systems with slowly varying parameters often be have like
   time-invariant systems for long periods. However, at a certain point,
   the drift state will shift enough to impact system performance and
   render the learned control input invalid. For these systems, the
   learning process must be reinitiated, leading to production losses in
   terms of time, money, and part fidelity while the learning controller
   reoptimizes the input signal. This paper presents a novel learning
   control strategy that utilizes an interpolated input signal derived from
   a library of converged signals to reinitiate the learning process for
   new drift states. In this manner, the controller uses training from a
   few critical states to inform the optimized initial inputs that span the
   space of the drift state. The proposed ILC framework is presented here,
   along with simulation results that illustrate savings in the convergence
   rate without a loss of performance.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zero dynamics extends the Byrnes-Isidori notion of zero dynamics
   to a class of hybrid models called systems with impulse effects.
   Specifically, given a smooth submanifold that is contained in the zero
   set of an output function and is invariant under both the continuous
   flow of the system with impulse effects as well as its reset map, the
   restriction dynamics is called the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results
   on the stabilization of periodic orbits of the hybrid zero dynamics have
   relied on input-output linearization of the transverse variables. The
   principal result of this paper shows how control Lyapunov functions can
   be used to exponentially stabilize periodic orbits of the hybrid zero
   dynamics, thereby significantly extending the class of stabilizing
   controllers. An illustration of this result on a model of a bipedal

Abstract = {{Histotripsy uses high intensity, mu s-long ultrasound pulses to control
   cavitating bubble clouds for tissue fractionation. Ultrasound techniques
   exist to monitor this fractionation progress but due to acoustic
   interference from the histotripsy pulses and the presence of the
   hyper-echoic bubble cloud at the therapy focus, treatment must be halted
   for their application. This paper develops color Doppler as a real-time
   acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)-based feedback during
   histotripsy. This technique uses histotripsy pulses to apply ARFI and
   color Doppler to detect the ARFI-induced motion of the residual
   histotripsy bubbles in the increasingly softer tissue resulting from
   histotripsy fractionation. Various histotripsy treatments (0.75-1.25
   MHz, 3-10 cycles, 50-100 Hz PRF) were applied to ex vivo tissue, with
   synchronized color Doppler acquisitions providing an estimate of the
   mean velocity of the focal region displacement in response to the
   histotripsy pulse using a 5 MHz linear array on a Verasonics imaging
   system. Depending on the specific Doppler parameters used, clear
   increasing or decreasing trends in mean velocity were observed as the
   treatment progressed. This study developed a real-time
   elastography-based feedback for histotripsy tissue fractionation and
   demonstrated its feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the fastest growing cancers
   worldwide. Histotripsy is a non-invasive ablation method that
   fractionates soft tissue through the control of acoustic cavitation. In
   this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using histotripsy for
   non-invasive liver ablation. Fourteen similar to 1cm(3) lesions were
   created in the livers of eight pigs through the intact chest in vivo
   without using aberration correction. Complete fractionation of liver
   parenchyma was observed with <500 mu m sharp boundaries. In addition,
   two larger volumes of 18 cm(3) and 60 cm(3) were generated within 60
   minutes. Histotripsy liver fractionation was self-limited at the
   boundaries of critical structures including the gallbladder and major
   vessels. The liver surrounding major vessels was completely fractionated
   while the vessels remained intact. This work demonstrates that
   histotripsy is capable of non-invasively fractionating liver tissue
   while preserving critical anatomical structures within the liver.
   Results suggest histotripsy has potential for the non-invasive ablation
   of liver tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Lymph node dissection is a widely used surgical procedure to treat and
   stage metastatic lymph nodes but has substantial side effects, such as
   lymphedema. Histotripsy is a noninvasive ultrasonic therapy that creates
   well-demarcated tissue fractionation using high-pressure and short
   acoustic shockwave pulses. This study investigates the possibility using
   of histotripsy to ablate lymph nodes noninvasively. Experiments were
   performed on 6 mixed breed healthy pigs, 11 - 12 weeks old and weighing
   31 - 43 kg. Their superficial inguinal lymph nodes were treated in vivo
   with 5- or 10-cycle histotripsy pulses generated by focused, 1MHz
   therapy transducers, delivered at 50Hz pulse repetition frequency and
   peak rarefaction pressure above 21MPa. The treatment was guided by
   ultrasound imaging probes (either ATL CL15-7 or ATL L12-5) with a
   commercial ultrasound imaging system, HDI 5000. In one selected case,
   contrast-specific ultrasound was performed after perimammary injection
   of Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) to localize the lymph nodes.
   Anatomical landmarks were then used to identify the same nodes for
   targeted therapy. The histological results show that, after histotripsy
   treatment, only the targeted lymph nodes were affected and they had
   demarcated foci of necrosis with minimal damage to the adjacent and
   intervening tissue. This in vivo acute study demonstrates the capability
   of histotripsy to noninvasively generate tissue fractionation within
   targeted lymph nodes, suggesting that histotripsy has the potential in
   noninvasive lymph node ablation.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of cavitation activity has been identified as a crucial
   component for SWL stone subdivision. However, its exact role in the
   comminution process remains somewhat weakly defined, in part due to the
   fact that it is difficult to isolate the cavitational component from
   shock waves. In this study, we further explored the importance of
   cavitation in SWL stone comminution through the use of histotripsy
   ultrasound therapy. Histotripsy was utilized to target cystine-mimicking
   model stones with controlled cavitation at strategic time points in the
   SWL comminution process. Ten model stones were sonicated in-vitro with
   each of five different treatment schemes: A. SWL with histotripsy
   interleaved; B. SWL followed by histotripsy; C. Histotripsy followed by
   SWL; D. SWL-only; E. Histotripsy-only. Following sonication, debris was
   collected and sieved. It was found that the combination of histotripsy
   and SWL (A, B, and C) produced a higher degree of comminution than
   either modality in isolation. When histotripsy controlled cavitation was
   applied following SWL (B), the increase in exposed stone surface area
   afforded by shock wave stone subdivision led to enhanced cavitation
   erosion. When histotripsy controlled cavitation was applied prior to SWL
   (C), it is likely that stone surface defects induced by cavitation
   erosion provided sights for crack nucleation and accelerated shock wave
   stone subdivision. Both these effects are likely at play in the
   interleaved therapy (A), although shielding of shock waves by remnant
   histotripsy microbubble nuclei may have limited the efficacy of this
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced, dual-particle, imaging system is being developed for
   standoff, passive detection of special nuclear material. This system
   consists of three planes of detectors and will be capable of imaging
   photons and fast neutrons simultaneously. The first two planes of the
   system consist of EJ-309 liquid scintillators, while the third plane
   consists of NaI detectors. The EJ-309 detectors have excellent pulse
   shape discrimination capabilities, which allows the imaging system to
   distinguish incident photons from neutrons. Preliminary investigations
   of the dual-particle imager focused primarily on the use of
   simple-backprojection methods for image reconstruction. However, efforts
   have been made toward implementing the use of a maximum-likelihood
   expectation-maximization algorithm for image reconstruction.
   MCNPX-PoliMi has been used to simulate system response matrices for the
   dual-particle imager. Results have been promising for image
   reconstruction using measurement-specific system response matrices.
   However, field use requires the ability to detect and locate unknown
   sources in unknown shielding configurations. This has resulted in the
   development of an algorithm capable of generating a measurement-specific
   system response matrix on the fly.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate discrimination of neutrons and gamma rays is critical for
   organic scintillation detectors, especially for detection systems where
   minimal false-alarm rates are paramount (nuclear non-proliferation).
   Poor pulse shape discrimination (PSD) necessitates long measurement
   times, and may also cause inaccurate characterization of emitted
   neutrons, leading to source misidentification. Digital,
   data-acquisition, measurement systems using a charge-integration PSD
   method are commonly used for particle classification. A 2-D,
   charge-integration PSD method tends to be reasonably accurate, although
   the separation is typically poor at lower energies (below similar to
   500-keV neutron energy deposited). The charge-integration method
   originated in analog systems; however, with digital measurement systems
   there is no need to restrict to only two features (for instance, tail
   and total integrals) of the pulse. Instead, a classifier may be a much
   more complex function of the measured pulse. In this work, we apply a
   machine-learning methodology; namely, the support vector machine (SVM),
   to determine a PSD classifier. We show that the SVM method leads to
   improved detection performance with respect to the charge-integration
   method. We also apply a recently developed methodology that gives more
   accurate performance estimates by accounting for the fact that the
   training data needed for the SVM are `contaminated'.}},

Abstract = {{A method for simulating the cosmic-ray-induced neutron background at
   ground level has been developed. This method was used to obtain the
   expected pulse height distributions, net neutron rates, and angular
   distribution using EJ-309 liquid scintillators, and has been validated
   using outdoor measurements. The simulations were carried out using the
   Monte Carlo transport code MCNPX-PoliMi combined with the source
   subroutine CRY. The absolute count rates for neutrons were then obtained
   from the simulations using an empirical scaling formula from literature.
   Preliminary measurements of the angular distribution of background
   neutrons were done using a collimated EJ-309 liquid scintillator,
   showing fair agreement with simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and characterization of special nuclear material (SNM) is
   of significant importance for nonproliferation applications. For neutron
   energies <1 eV, fission is the dominating interaction process of all
   possible neutron-nucleus interactions, hence thermal neutron induced
   fission is one of the techniques that can be utilized for the
   characterization of the SNM. Prompt and delayed neutrons and gamma-rays
   are emitted per fission event. These multiplicities can be modeled using
   Monte Carlo techniques. However, the modeling of multiplicity
   distributions of prompt fission neutrons and gamma-rays is dependent not
   only upon statistical models but also upon tracking fission neutrons and
   gamma-rays on an event-by-event basis. Both Geant4 and MCNPX-PoliMi are
   capable of simulating particles on an event-by-event basis. In Geant4,
   the neutron and gamma-ray multiplicity distributions are computed using
   a customized fission library developed by the Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory (LLNL). The neutron and gamma-ray multiplicity
   distributions are also computed with MCNPX-PoliMi, which is a modified
   version of MCNP code. Simulations show that there is very good agreement
   in neutron multiplicities generated with these codes. Furthermore,
   various fission models can be simulated in these respective Monte Carlo
   codes.}},

Abstract = {{The MCNP-PoliMi code is an enhanced version of the MCNP4c code developed
   in 2003 to simulate the detector response from correlated neutron and
   gamma-ray measurements. In 2012 the -PoliMi modifications were
   incorporated into version 2.7.0 of the MCNPX code. This allows the user
   to use all of the -PoliMi enhancements in conj unction with the advanced
   features of the MCNPX code. The MCNPX-PoliMi code has the ability to
   generate a source file containing the reaction data of all photonuclear
   reactions occurring in the target material. In addition, a variance
   reduction option has been implemented whereby the user can read the
   photonuclear source file multiple times. MCNPX-PoliMi also contains
   experimentally based models of delayed-neutron emission from
   photofission reactions. The results presented in the full paper will
   provide a demonstration of the features of the MCNPX-PoliMi code for
   active-interrogation scenarios of interest. In particular, the response
   from uranium will be compared to that of common benign materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, non-local means (NLM) methods for both image denoising and
   inverse problems have shown promising results in image processing and
   medical imaging. Moreover, some researchers have also shown that using
   additional information with low noise and/or high resolution for these
   problems can improve the image quality further. We investigated several
   NLM methods including NLM filters and NLM regularizers with and without
   CT side information for I-131 SPECT image reconstruction. We compared
   two different ways to incorporate CT side information in the NLM
   filtering methods. We also propose a new way of incorporating side
   information in the NLM reconstruction method. XCAT simulation results
   with two uniform tumors (72 cc, 11 cc) show that the NLM filtering
   method with CT side information decreased the root mean square error
   (RMSE) up to 18.6\% as compared to unregularized method. Our proposed
   NLM-based regularizers in iterative image reconstructions with CT side
   information also yielded up to 29.2\% better RMSE and up to 18.1\%
   better recovery coefficient than unregularized reconstruction.}},

   candidate material for room-temperature semiconductor detector
   applications. Indefinite stability of TlBr detectors may be achieved by
   operating at -20 degrees C. However, at room temperature, the duration
   of stability for TlBr detectors is currently limited due to the
   polarization process. While the restriction in operating temperature
   does not inhibit its practical use, the polarization phenomenon at room

Abstract = {{In a pixelated 3-D position sensitive CdZnTe gamma-ray imaging detector,
   2-pixel side-neighbor events make up about 50 percent of 2-pixel events.
   These side-neighbor events can originate from either Compton scattering
   or charge sharing. Distinguishing between these two categories of events
   will be of interest for advanced data processing, such as event
   classification or improvement for Compton imaging efficiency. A
   digitizer UM\_VAD ASIC developed in collaboration with Gamma-Medica
   IDEAS has been used for pixelated 3-D position sensitive CdZnTe
   detectors. Because this ASIC digitizes pulse waveforms outputted by the
   preamplifier, it has achieved better depth separation uncertainty, about
   0.3mm compared to 1mm FWHM from the GMI VAS 2.3/TAT4 ASIC. It is also
   possible to use the signals from the pixels neighboring the collecting
   pixel to determine the sub-pixel position of an electron cloud
   interaction. This work focuses on the development of a method to
   distinguish between 2-pixel side-neighbor events caused by Compton
   scattering and those caused by charge-sharing. The sub-pixel position
   information is used in addition to the depth separation of the two
   interactions to provide better discrimination capability. The
   experimental results and the algorithm have been verified through Geant4
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the optimization of the purge cycle for dead-ended
   anode (DEA) operation of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell.
   Controling the purge interval at given operating conditions can optimize
   the fuel cell efficiency and hydrogen loss during the purge. For this
   optimization, a model capturing the liquid water and nitrogen
   accumulation in the anode and the purge flow behavior is presented. A
   target range of purge interval is then defined based on the minimal
   purge time that removes the plug of liquid and nitrogen in the channel
   end and the maximum purge interval beyond which hydrogen is wasted since
   hydrogen molar fraction all along the channel has been restored to one.
   If the purge is sufficiently long that all of the accumulated water and
   nitrogen are removed then the power output in the subsequent cycle
   (galvanostatic operation) would be highest, compared with incomplete
   purges which do not fully restore hydrogen concentration in the anode.
   Such purge schedule, however, is associated with certain amount of
   hydrogen loss. Therefore, there is a trade-off between hydrogen loss and
   power output, and a corresponding purge interval that produces the
   largest efficiency. The optimum purge intervals for different cycle
   durations are identified. The calculated DEA efficiencies are compared
   with flow-through (FT) operation. The analysis and model-based
   optimization methodology presented in this paper can be used for
   optimizing DEA operation of PEMFC with minimum experimentation and
   development time.}},

Abstract = {{The Joint High Speed Sea lift segmented model (Model 5663) tests
   performed in 2007, in the Maneuvering and Seakeeping Basin at the Naval
   Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, were designed to provide a
   large data set for validation of numerical simulations. Model 5663 is a
   segmented structural ship model that has scaled longitudinal bending and
   torsional stiffness. The scaled stiffness is obtained by building a
   backspline into the model that accounts for the bending stiffness and
   cutting the shell in several places, segmenting it to isolate the
   stiffness to the backspline. The alternative way to obtain structural
   loads would be to build a model with scaled plates and stiffeners;
   however, this would be very difficult and expensive. The backspline
   allows the stiffness to be scaled properly while using reasonable
   materials and simple construction. The hull segments of the model are
   connected with silicone to maintain a watertight connection. The model
   is self propelled and steered during data collection. The test matrix
   spans a wide set of wave conditions, including regular and irregular
   seas, with heading angles spanning the possible range. A wide range of
   speeds are also included, with Froude numbers ranging from 0 to 0.43.
   This test matrix, which includes about 2000 runs, allows for validation
   of codes from still water test, through operational conditions, to
   extreme design load determination. Different aspects of the data have
   been studied, but much is still left to be considered. An aspect of the
   model tests that has not previously been considered in detail is the
   hydroelastic response of the vessel. Hydroelastic phenomena are a subset
   of fluid-structure interaction problems where the elasticity of the
   structure is important. The vibrational characteristics of the model are
   determined. The main phenomena of interest are springing and whipping,
   and an analysis of the springing response and the whipping response in
   head seas is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of waves on floating bodies are of great importance to the
   naval architect. In addition to the first order responses to the waves,
   second order slowly varying forces play a vital role in various
   scenarios. In this research, a fast and robust method for simulating the
   drifting of a vessel in a seaway has been developed based on a
   body-exact strip theory method (cf. Bandyk (2009)). The problem is
   solved directly in the time domain by setting up a boundary value
   problem for the perturbation potentials. A boundary integral method is
   used for solving the Laplace equation. The forces are computed by direct
   pressure integration. Body accelerations and velocities are computed by
   using a nonlinear 6-DOF Euler equation of motion solver. Free motion
   drift simulations have been carried out for long times, on the order of
   hundreds of wave periods for the Wig ley-I hull and the containership
   S-175. The long time simulations establish the stability and robustness
   of the numerical scheme. The results also show the effectiveness of the
   methodology to capture slowly varying 2nd order forces in addition to
   the wave frequency responses.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation methods can be used for meeting both the new stealth
   initiatives for surface ship silencing, and the stringent limits on
   acceptable hull vibration. Additionally, interior noise concerns must be
   considered due to habitability and operational readiness. The pursuit of
   innovative ship designs, utilization of new materials, and the
   increasingly demanding performance requirements, dictate a more broadly
   focused thrust for addressing noise and vibration issues due to multiple
   sources of excitation during the design process. This expanded technical
   view also requires that the types of tools utilized for these
   assessments also improve and that they can provide results within a
   short enough time that can affect the design cycle. An Energy Finite
   Element Analysis (EFEA) formulation has been developed for computing
   efficiently the vibration of complex vehicles and the associated
   radiated noise at frequencies beyond the limits of conventional finite
   element methods. In this paper, the main theoretical aspects of the EFEA
   will be presented first. Results are presented for two 1/8th scale
   structures representing an advanced double hull design and a
   conventional hull design of a surface ship. Results for the structural
   vibration induced on the outer bottom part of the structures are
   compared to available test data.}},

Abstract = {{A novel methodology to detect the presence of a crack and to predict the
   nonlinear forced response of mistuned turbine engine rotors with a
   cracked blade and mistuning is developed. The combined effects of the
   crack and mistuning are modeled, First, a hybrid-interface method based
   on component mode synthesis is employed to develop reduced order models
   (ROMs) of the tuned system with a cracked blade. Constraint modes are
   added to model the displacements due to the intermittent contact between
   the crack surfaces. The degrees of freedom (DOFs) on the crack surfaces
   are retained as active DOFs so that the physical forces due to the
   contact/interaction (in the three-dimensional space) can be accurately
   modeled. Next, the presence of mistuning in the tuned system with a
   cracked blade is modeled. Component mode mistuning is used to account
   for mistuning present in the un-cracked blades while the cracked blade
   is considered as a reference (with no mistuning). Next, the resulting
   (reduced order) nonlinear equations of motion are solved by applying an
   alternating frequency/time-domain method. Using these efficient ROMs in
   a forced response analysis, it is found that the new modeling approach
   provides significant computational cost savings, while ensuring good
   accuracy relative to full-order finite element analyses. Furthermore,
   the effects of the cracked blade on the mistuned system are
   investigated, and used to detect statistically the presence of a crack
   and to identify which blade of a full bladed disk is cracked. In
   particular, it is shown that cracks can be distinguished from mistuning.}},

Abstract = {{Some shafting systems, such as those in certain types of rotorcraft, are
   mounted on flexible foundations. Since the foundation can deform, shaft
   segments are joined by flexible couplings to accommodate motion. Many of
   these couplings are non-constant velocity, meaning there is a difference
   in angular velocity between the input and output of the coupling, and
   this difference can lead to large motion in the shaft system. In this
   paper, a model is developed which allows the misalignment angle between
   the input and output shafts to vary dynamically with time, and this
   kinematic relationship creates a nonlinearity in the system. Through
   nonlinear analysis and accompanying simulation, this research explores
   some interesting and potentially harmful phenomena which occur at
   secondary resonances of such a shaft system. At particular shaft
   operating speeds, the shaft system may experience internal resonance,
   large and rapid amplitude growth, or chaotic motion, all of which can
   lead to destructive large amplitude vibration. This paper also shows
   that applying appropriate damping is an effective strategy for
   mitigating these effects.}},

Abstract = {{The road-monitoring community is considering alternatives to the
   International Roughness Index (IRI) that are based on the Golden-Car
   model, but perform the simulation at a speed other than standard value
   of 80 km/ h. Many state and federal highway agencies apply pay
   adjustments to new road and road resurfacing contracts based on the IRI,
   but expect significantly higher prevailing travel speeds on very smooth
   limited-access roads. Inertial profilers also continue to propagate as a
   tool for monitoring pavement conditions on lower-speed roads, where the
   posted speed limit or the prevailing traffic speed may be much lower
   than 80 km/h. The broad application of the IRI to higher and lower-speed
   roads has created interest by practitioners in the issue of Golden-Car
   model simulation speed. Changing the simulated forward speed causes
   predictable changes in the frequency response of the Golden-Car model:
   the temporal frequency response changes very little, but the spatial
   frequency response shifts in proportion to speed. However, the
   quantitative effect on the resulting index values and their relationship
   to other relevant responses, such as tire load variations and passenger
   acceleration, are less obvious. This paper explores the potential
   consequences of changes to the Golden-Car model simulation speed,
   including changes to the output roughness values and meaning of the
   roughness scale and roughness threshold values. Most of the discussion
   relies on numerical and theoretical analysis, with some sample
   measurements provided for elucidation.}},

Abstract = {{In order to implement the accurate path tracking control for the
   backing-up tractor-trailer system with off-axle hitching, a new control
   framework relying on mixed logical dynamics (MLD) hybrid modeling and
   model predictive control (MPC) method is presented in this paper. At
   first, a MLD hybrid model is proposed to describe the open-loop
   kinematic of the tractor-trailer system. For the resulting MLD model, an
   extended cost function defined as a quadratic form is addressed, in
   which the steering angle of the tractor, as well as two errors combining
   the position and the orientation of the trailer are considered. To
   minimize the tracking error of the trailer, and smooth the steering
   angle behavior of the tractor, an equivalent linear quadratic tracking
   problem is presented. Then, a receding horizon finite-time optimal
   controller is designed, by employing multi-parametric mixed-integer
   quadratic programming (mp-MIQP) technique. Finally, the controller
   performance is evaluated through simulation, and achieves closed-loop
   system asymptotical stability, accurate tracking performance and
   constraint fulfillment properties, even under the case of non-smooth
   tracking reference path.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear electromagnetic energy harvester is presented which can
   generate power from translational vibrations in two directions and
   rotational excitations. Commonly, vibrational energy harvesters are
   designed to generate power from only translational ambient oscillations
   in a specific direction. The assumption of uni-axial ambient vibrations
   is too idealistic. Not only the direction of the base excitations
   typically change in time but also the rotational excitations are as
   common in oscillating machinery as the translational vibrations. The
   proposed energy harvester is inspired by the Automatic Generating System
   in Seiko watches. The moving element is a magnetic pendulum. When the
   pendulum moves in response to the base excitations the magnetic tip
   passes over electromagnetic coils, positioned in a circular array in the
   stator. The relative motion of the tip magnet and the coil generates
   electricity. The paper presents an analytical representative model for
   the energy harvesting system. The dynamics and energy generation of the
   energy harvester in response to four different excitation configurations
   are studied. It is demonstrated that in response to large excitations
   the system commonly undergoes period doubling bifurcations and
   occasionally undergoes chaos. The study paves the way to optimal design
   of the hybrid rotary translational energy harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a mechanism to grow a large superlattice of phase domains
   from a continuum homogenous binary film by sequential activation of
   self-assembly. Self-assembly was initiated in a small mobile region,
   where atoms could diffuse, to form a seed pattern, Then the mobile
   region was shifted gradually. This process led to the formation of a
   long-rang ordered superlattice, regardless whether the seed was perfect
   or not. The pattern quickly improved to a perfect superlattice along
   with the sequential activation. We found that the scanning velocity can
   effectively control the domain pattern when the system is in a bistable
   state, which refers to a window of average concentration where two
   different superlattices can both stabilize. We demonstrated two schemes
   for large-scale high speed fabrication: alternation between scanning
   directions, using the superlattice created in each previous step as a
   large seed; and two dimensional growth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the theoretical analysis used to design of a
   multistage peristaltic vacuum micro pump, comprising of two parts.
   First, three different designs for a 16 stage micropump to achieve a
   vacuum of 250 ton are investigated. One design produces an equal
   pressure distribution across each stage at steady state. A second design
   has equal volume ratio across each stage. The third design is a
   combination of the other two. The transient behavior of these designs is
   analyzed using a reduced order model. In the first two designs when the
   pressure difference across the pump is low most pumping occurs across
   the first few stages, while for the third design the load is almost
   equally distributed across all stages. The opposite is observed when the
   pressure difference across the pump is high. In the second part of the
   paper, the reduced order model is further developed to account for the
   effects of electrostatic actuation and membrane dynamics. A non-linear
   model is proposed for the motion of the membrane and used to study the
   steady state performance and resonance of a multistage vacuum micro pump
   as a function of input voltage. It is found that near the acoustic
   frequency, a lower voltage is required to produce a greater flow.}},

Abstract = {{The topology optimization method is extended for the optimization of
   geometrically nonlinear, time-dependent multibody dynamics systems
   undergoing nonlinear responses. In particular, this paper focuses on
   sensitivity analysis methods for topology optimization of general
   multibody dynamics systems, which include large displacements and
   rotations and dynamic loading. The generalized-alpha method is employed
   to solve the multibody dynamics system equations of motion. The
   developed time integration incorporated sensitivity analysis method is
   based on a linear approximation of two consecutive time steps, such that
   the generalized-alpha method is only applied once in the time
   integration of the equations of motion. This approach significantly
   reduces the computational costs associated with sensitivity analysis. To
   show the effectiveness of the developed procedures, topology
   optimization of a ground structure embedded in a planar multibody
   dynamics system under dynamic loading is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Random field is a generalization of a stochastic field, of which
   randomness can be characterized as a function of spatial variables.
   Examples of the random field can often be found as a geometry, material,
   and process variation in engineering products and processes. It has been
   widely acknowledged that consideration of the random field is quite
   significant to accurately predict variability in system performances.
   However, current approaches for characterizing the random field can only
   be applied to the situation with sufficient random field data sets and
   are not suitable to most engineering problems where the data sets are
   insufficient. The contribution of this paper is to model the random
   field based on the insufficient data sets such that sufficient data sets
   can be simulated or generated according to the random field modeling.
   Therefore, available random field characterization approaches and
   probability analysis methods can be used for probability analysis and
   design of many engineering problems with the lack of random field data
   sets. The proposed random field modeling is composed of two technical
   components including: 1) a Bayesian updating approach using the Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for modeling the random field based on
   available random field data sets; and 2) a Bayesian Copula dependence
   modeling approach for modeling statistical dependence of random field
   realizations at different measurement locations. Three examples
   including a mathematical problem, a heat generation problem of the
   Lithium-ion battery, and a refrigerator assembly problem are used to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a Multi-Level System design (MLS) algorithm is presented
   and utilized for a wind turbine system analysis. The MLS guides the
   decision making process for designing a complex system where many
   alternatives and many mutually competing objectives and disciplines need
   to be considered and evaluated. Mathematical relationships between the
   design variables and the multiple discipline performance objectives are
   developed adaptively as the various design considerations are evaluated
   and as the design is being evolved. These relationships are employed for
   rewarding performance improvement during the decision making process by
   allocating more resources and influence to the disciplines which exhibit
   the improvement. Simulation tools developed by the National Renewable
   Energy Laboratory (NREL) are employed in the wind turbine design
   analysis. The Cost Of Energy (COE) comprises the overall system level
   objective, while performance improvements at two technical design
   disciplines are pursued at the same time. The optimal design of the
   blade geometry for maximum Annual Energy Production (AEP), and the
   structural design of the blade for minimum bending moment at the root of
   the blade comprise the two technical design disciplines. Scalar
   metamodels are developed for linking the design variables with the
   performance metrics associated with the design of the blade geometry.
   Main characteristics of the wind turbine, namely, the rotor diameter,
   the rotational speed, the maximum rated power, the hub height, the
   structural characteristics of the blade, and the geometric
   characteristics of the blade (distribution of thickness, twist angle,
   and chord) are employed as design variables for the overall design
   analysis. The optimization results and the physical insight which can be
   gained through a sensitivity analysis for the optimal configuration are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Solar tower with heliostat mirrors is an established technology for
   utility-scale solar energy harvesting. The setup has several advantages
   such as the capability to reach high temperature, modularity and ease of
   maintenance of the heliostats, containment of the high temperature zone,
   as well as overall low cost per harvested energy. Downscaling to medium
   and small scale applications is a desirable goal in order to attract
   more users of the technology. However, the downscaling often does not
   turn out economically feasible while using flat mirror heliostats, which
   are the norm in utility-scale systems. This is mainly due to the need to
   preserve the number (typically several hundred) of mirrors in order to
   maintain the solar concentration ratio. Use of parabolic mirrors instead
   can significantly reduce the required number of mirrors for smaller
   scale systems, but comes with new challenges. Unlike flat mirrors, the
   effective focal length of parabolic mirrors changes with the incidence
   angle causing undesirable variations in the concentration ratio and/or
   flux distribution at the receiver. To overcome this issue, we propose
   adjustment of the aim targets of the heliostat mirrors. Instead of
   aiming at the center of the receiver, aim targets are set as design
   variables and optimized to reduce undesirable peaks in the flux
   distribution. A special implementation of genetic algorithm is developed
   and applied to a case study of a nominal 10kW solar concentrator.
   Results of the study show significant improvement in flux distribution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework for identification of the global optimum
   of Kriging models. The framework is based on a branch and bound scheme
   for sub-division of the search space into hypercubes while constructing
   convex under-estimators of the Kriging models. The convex
   under-estimators, which are a key development in this paper, provide a
   relaxation of the original problem. The relaxed problem has two key
   features: i) convex optimization algorithms such as sequential quadratic
   programming (SQP) are guaranteed to find the global optimum of the
   relaxed problem, and ii) objective value of the relaxed problem is a
   lower bound on the best attainable solution within a hypercube for the
   original (Kriging model) problem. The convex under-estimators improve in
   accuracy as the size of a hypercube gets smaller via the branching
   search. Termination of a hypercube branch is done when either: i)
   solution of the relaxed problem within the hypercube is no better than
   current best solution of the original problem, or ii) best solution of
   the original problem and that of the relaxed problem are within
   tolerance limits. To assess the significance of the proposed framework,
   comparison studies against genetic algorithm (GA) are conducted using
   Kriging models that approximate standard nonlinear test functions, as
   well as application problems of water desalination and vehicle
   crashworthiness. Results of the studies show the proposed framework
   deterministically providing a solution within tolerance limits from the
   global optimum, while GA is observed to not reliably discover the best
   solutions in problems with larger number of design variables.}},

Abstract = {{Complex and computationally intensive modeling and simulation of
   real-world engineering systems can include a large number of design
   variables in the optimization of such systems. Consequently, it is
   desirable to conduct variable screening to identify significant or
   active variables so that a simpler; more efficient, yet accurate
   optimization process can be achieved. This paper proposes a variable
   screening method based on a Kriging model with Restricted Maximum
   Likelihood criterion. The Kriging metamodeling method is more reliable
   for highly non-linear systems than the traditional response surface
   method, and the Restricted Maximum Likelihood criterion makes the
   variable screening process more efficient. In this work, three different
   sampling methods,namely, Latin Hypercube, Improved Distributed Hypercube
   and D-optimally selected Latin Hypercube sampling methods, are compared
   when used with the proposed variable screening method. The new variable
   screening method is evaluated using a standard benchmark nonlinear
   numerical example that employs 20 factors. The variable screening method
   then is applied to a gunner restrain system design problem. Starting
   with a set of eight of the most important gunner's joints variables in a
   wide open property space, the Improved Hypercube space filling sampling
   technique is used to screen the joints variables and the variable
   screening method based on the Kriging method with the restricted maximum
   likelihood criterion is used to determine the most important joints
   properties for gunner's performance.}},

   absorption with polymerization of a free radical polymerizable monomer.
   It can be used to fabricate a variety of micro-devices including

   A critical aspect of two-photon polymerization is the resolution of the
   process. This paper derives an expression for the voxel (volume element)
   size produced during two-photon polymerization. The model assumes a
   Gaussian beam and the effects of beam power; lens parameters, and resin
   polymerization threshold are investigated. A sensitivity analysis is

Abstract = {{Due to the growing need for sustainable manufacturing processes, machine
   tool designers are constantly looking for ways to reduce unwanted
   structural vibrations without having to increase the mass/inertia of
   moving components, which in turn increases the energy consumption and
   cost of the machines. Recent research has shown that, due to the
   coupling introduced by the nut, the torque applied to ball screw drives
   by the motor causes undesirable lateral (bending) vibrations of the
   screw, which adversely affects the fatigue life and positioning accuracy
   of ball screw drives. By analyzing the stiffness matrix connecting the
   screw to the nut, this paper shows that the helix angle of the screw and
   the entry/exit angles of the balls have the most influence on the degree
   of coupling between motor torque and lateral vibrations of the screw.
   Consequently, by carefully selecting the helix angle of the screw
   together with the entry/exit angles of the balls, the undesirable
   lateral vibrations of the screw can be minimized, without having to
   increase the diameter (i.e. stiffness/inertia) of the ball screw. The
   merits and limitations of the proposed method are demonstrated using
   simulations on a single-axis ball screw driven machine.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a period-review production and preventive
   maintenance (PM) scheduling problem for manufacturing systems subject to
   uncertain demand in a finite-horizon. We consider multiple levels of PM
   which provide the. system with flexibility of choosing various types of
   PM to be adaptive to the throughput target. A model with PM flexibility
   is proposed to simultaneously determine optimal production quantity and
   PM level for a single-product manufacturing system. A real option
   analysis (ROA) is applied to quantify the benefit of PM flexibility so
   that it can be considered in a cost function. The optimal strategy for a
   joint maintenance and production system that maximizes the overall
   expected profit of the system is obtained by a stochastic dynamic
   programming approach. Results are supported by numerical examples and
   show the comparison between the proposed PM-flexible model and the
   conventional PM planning model with single and fixed PM type. Managerial
   insights are provided on making adaptive PM and production decisions by
   trading off revenue and costs of corrective actions in different

Abstract = {{This paper develops a face milling planning method to reduce surface
   height variation based on the high definition metrology (HDM). HDM
   provides high-lateral resolution data over an area up to 300x300 mm(2).
   The measurement results on production engine head surfaces reveal a
   strong correlation between the surface height and the effective material
   removal rate (eMRR) along the cutting path. Such a correlation can be
   explained by a cutting force model which verifies that the surface
   variation is attributed to the axial cutting force variations, and the
   axial force is proportional to the eMRR. This paper proposes a machining
   algorithm that minimizes eMRR to reduce the cutting force variation by
   altering the feed rate and cutter path, thereby reducing the surface
   height variation. The varying feed approach can eliminate one surface
   pattern in the case study without significantly changing the cycle time.
   The optimized cutter path results in 25\% reduction in zone flatness on
   the other surface pattern. This improvement demonstrates the potential
   of the eMRR based approach in attaining cost-effective high-precision
   machining. The method may also be extended to a wide range of face
   milling applications.}},

   limited instead to switching commands at discrete time instants to
   control micro-actuator motion, it may be advantageous to coordinate
   operating periods of any voltage conversion circuitry with actuators. A
   sample scenario of a traditional boost converter driving a thin-film
   piezoelectric micro-robotic appendage along a trajectory is considered
   through simulation studies. Some ranges of target motion accuracy are

Abstract = {{Research on dynamics of micro devices indicates that contact forces are
   complex in a micro-scale environment. Previous work tried to identify;
   how small-scale forces numerically affect a walking micro system, using
   a similar structure to a micro-robot leg and a simple analytical model
   for system dynamics. This paper extends that work by focusing on further
   experimental testing and simulation studies on a prototype micro-robot.
   Evaluation of experimental data indicates that characteristics of the
   ground, such as material properties and static charge on the surface
   should be also considered in understanding foot-terrain interaction.
   This leads to modifications to the former foot-terrain interaction
   algorithm. The refined analytical model is validated through
   experimental comparison.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are equipped with sizable batteries to
   replace fossil fuel with electric energy. The electric grid may be
   stressed when a large number of PEVs charge their batteries, especially
   during peak hours. This paper presents a PEV charging control algorithm,
   which achieves balance between the system-level objective (valley
   filling) and individual-level objective (full battery charging). In
   addition, grid frequency regulation is achieved through a two-level
   control algorithm, which ensures robustness and reduces reliance on
   conventional ancillary services. This two-level control algorithm is
   scalable because it is designed for decentralized implementation. In
   other words, the algorithm works with indefinite numbers of PEVs as long
   as the load is within the grid capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a single
   pre-transmission electric motor (the P2 configuration) has a challenging
   drivability issue during engine-starts because the motor must
   simultaneously provide the propulsion torque demand and start the
   engine. The goal of this study is to present a design process to achieve
   optimal balance between these two conflicting goals. We first develop a
   control-oriented HEV powertrain model to accurately predict the engine,
   clutch, and vehicle dynamics. Assuming that the clutch torque can be
   accurately estimated and perfectly cancelled, an optimal engine-start
   control problem is formulated to minimize engine-start time while
   accurately supplying the driver torque demand simultaneously. This
   nonlinear constrained optimal control problem is solved numerically
   using Dynamic Programming (DP). DP results show that a proper constant
   clutch pressure level, which leads to constant torque disturbance that
   is easy to cancel out using the motor, can achieve near-optimal
   performance. Furthermore, the DP control policy is found to be
   time-invariant, and thus can be directly implemented in the form of a
   full state feedback controller}},

Abstract = {{The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), a major stabilizer of the knee, is
   commonly injured. Because of its intrinsic poor healing ability, a torn
   ACL is usually reconstructed by a graft. We developed a multi-phasic, or
   bone-ligament-bone, tissue-engineered construct for ACL grafts using
   bone marrow stromal cells and sheep as a model system. After 6 months in
   vivo, the constructs increased in cross section and exhibited a
   well-organized microstructure, native bone integration, a functional
   enthesis, vascularization, innervation, increased collagen content, and
   structural alignment. The constructs increased in stiffness to 52\% of
   the tangent modulus and 95\% of the geometric stiffness of native ACL.
   The viscoelastic response of the explants was virtually
   indistinguishable from that of adult ACL. These results suggest that our
   constructs after implantation can obtain physiologically relevant
   structural and functional characteristics comparable to those of adult
   ACL. They present a viable option for ACL replacement.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing need for lightweight structures in Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicle (UAV) applications raise issues involving gust alleviation. Here
   we examine the gust alleviation problem using a self-sensing,
   self-charging, and self-actuating structure. The basic idea is that the
   wing itself is able to harvest and store energy from the normal
   vibrations during flight along with any available sunlight. If the wing
   experiences any strong, unexpected wind gust, it will sense the
   increased vibration levels and provide vibration control to maintain its
   stability.
   In this paper, a multifunctional wing spar is designed, which integrates
   a flexible solar cell array, piezoceramic wafers, a thin film battery
   and an electronics module into a composite structure. This
   multifunctional wing spar therefore carries on the functions of energy
   harvesting and storage, as well as the functions of gust alleviation via
   piezoelectric materials. The piezoceramic wafers act as sensors,
   actuators, and harvesters. The global modulus and stiffness of this
   multifunctional wing spar are estimated using both the rule of mixtures
   and the cross section transformation method. These values are then used
   in an Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam model of the multifunctional spar.
   The first two dominant modes are predicted analytically for the
   distributed parameter model. The finite element method is employed to
   confirm the analytical eigenvalues estimation. Special attention is
   given to the self-contained gust alleviation with the goal of using
   harvested energy. The gust signals are generated using a Gaussian white
   noise source n (t) similar to N (0,1) fed into a linear filter, with the
   required intensity, scale lengths, and power spectral density (PSD)
   function for the given flight velocity and height. The Dryden PSD
   function is implemented for atmospheric turbulence modeling. The
   recently developed reduced energy control law is combined with a
   positive strain feedback controller to minimize the actuation energy and
   the dissipated heat energy. Positive feedback operation amplifiers
   (op-amps) and voltage buffer op-amps are implemented for two dominant
   mode gust disturbance controls. This work builds off of our previous
   research in self-charging structures and holds promise for improving UAV
   performance in wind gust alleviation.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloys (SMA), which exhibit the shape memory effect and
   superelasticity, utilize a reversible solid-solid state phase
   transformation to recover large strains. Likewise, honeycomb structures
   under in-plane loading take advantage of deformation kinematics to
   amplify the structure's macroscopic strain. The combination of a sparse
   honeycomb structure made of an SMA material can recover larger
   deformations than would be possible with either conventional metal
   honeycombs or monolithic SMAs. NiTi honeycombs and corrugations of about
   5\% relative density with robust properties were demonstrated recently
   {[}1]. Potential future applications include high performance energy
   absorbers, light-weight deployable devices, and high stroke actuators.
   This numerical study focuses on the design of superelastic SMA hexagonal
   honeycombs under in-plane compression for application to reusable energy
   absorbers. A design study with respect to honeycomb geometric parameters
   was performed to gain a better understanding of the geometric effects on
   energy absorption characteristics. A nonlinear finite element method was
   used to simulate their mechanical response using a hysteretic,
   trilinear, constitutive law to model the superelastic behavior of SMAs.
   Bloch wave analysis was used to evaluate the stability characteristics
   of the honeycomb structure. The corresponding energy absorption
   characteristics, under constraints of local strain limits, structural
   stability and allowable force levels, were evaluated to determine the
   optimum honeycomb geometries. It was found that diamond-like honeycombs,
   with greater height than width, had the best energy absorption
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Few technologies can produce meaningful power from low temperature waste
   heat sources below 250 C, particularly on a per-mass basis. Since the
   1970's energy crisis, NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) and associated
   thermal engines have been considered a viable heat-to-power transducer
   but were not adopted due to previously poor material quality, low
   supply, design complexity, and cost. Decades of subsequent material
   development, research, and commercialization have resulted in the
   availability of consistently high-quality, well-characterized, low cost
   alloys and a renewed interest in SMA as a waste heat energy recovery
   technology.
   The Lightweight Thermal Energy Recovery System (LighTERS) is an ongoing
   ARPA-E funded collaboration between General Motors Company, HRL
   Laboratories, Dynalloy, Inc., and the University of Michigan. In this
   paper we will present initial results from investigations of a closed
   loop SMA thermal engine (a refinement of the Dr. Johnson design) using a
   helical coil element and forced-air heat exchange. This engine generates
   mechanical power by continuously pulling itself through separate hot and
   cold air streams using the shape memory phase transformation to
   alternately expand and contract at frequencies between 0.25 and 2 Hz.
   This work cycle occurs continuously along the length of the coil loop
   and produces steady state power against an external moment. We present
   engine features and the thermal envelope that resulted in devices
   achieving between 0.1 and 0.5 W/g of shape memory alloy material using
   only forced air heat exchangers and room temperature cooling.}},

Abstract = {{Image restoration is a well studied problem and there are several
   proposed methods for deblurring and denoising. Recently, there is
   increasing interest in iterative schemes that employ non-quadratic
   regularizers, especially edge-preserving like Total Variation (TV) and
   sparsity promoting like l(1) regularization. Most methods make
   simplifying assumptions concerning the system model and the most common
   one is the use of a circulant blurring model because it facilitates
   using the FFT. In this work we focus on a more realistic non-circulant
   blurring model and apply existing algorithms for image restoration with
   non-quadratic regularization, tailored to work with our non-circulant
   model.}},

   optimization and control design by implementing the electrode-averaged
   diffusion dynamics and uneven discretization of the particle radius for
   fast computation and accurate prediction of the Lithium intercalation
   dynamics. First, the unevenly discretized dynamics model is constructed
   from the ordinary differential equation (ODE) derived in the
   electrode-averaged battery model. Then, constrained optimization
   problems with multi-objectives are formulated to find the optimal uneven
   discretization. The cost function is evaluated under the wide battery
   operation data sets constructed by Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to
   reduce the total number of cases. The optimally determined unevenly
   discretized model can predict the battery electrochemical dynamics with
   much smaller number of discretization steps compared to the evenly
   discretized electrode-averaged battery model without loss of physical
   interpretation of the diffusion dynamics in the electrode solid
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{When a simulation model for a dynamic system is used in parallel with
   the real physical system adaptation is a very important design feature.
   Model adaptation allows the model to compensate for errors between the
   simulated and real outputs. While parameter tuning and state updates can
   be automated to improve model accuracy, automatically updating the
   structure of a model is generally difficult to do.
   In order to build an automatic structural adaptation scheme we propose a
   semantic architecture for the model definition and use the semantic form
   to design an adaptation law. The semantic structure provides the
   standardization required for an automated algorithm to derive meaning
   from the model definition while allowing model designers to retain some
   generality in the way models are built.
   The semantic modeling approach is presented with an example
   implementation and discussion about its application to wide area
   distributed control systems. The wide area control system we use as
   motivation is a regional electrical power distribution controller.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses dynamic programming to compare the optimal fuel and
   electricity costs associated with two supervisory control strategies
   from the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) literature. One strategy
   blends fuel and electricity for propulsion throughout the useful range
   of battery state of charge (SOC), while the second strategy switches
   from all-electric to blended operation at a predefined SOC threshold
   Both strategies are optimized for a series PHEV powertrain using
   deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) to ensure a fair comparison. The
   DDP algorithm is implemented in a novel manner using a backward-looking
   powertrain model instead of forward-looking models used in previous
   research. The paper's primary conclusion is that there is no significant
   difference in the peiformance of the two control strategies for the
   series PHEV considered This result contrasts sharply with previous
   results for parallel and power-split PHEVs, and is examined for
   different relative fuel and electricity prices and trip lengths.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the use of model predictive control (MPG) for a microgrid
   with plug-in vehicles. A predictive model is developed based on a hub
   model of the microgrid, and the control is optimized for minimum
   generator fuel usage. A variety of horizons and levels of prediction
   error are used in the optimization. A new method to model expected load
   and error is presented based on radial basis functions. Results show
   that for a given prediction horizon, as the level of prediction error
   increases, the amount of fuel used increases. Results also show that in
   some cases there is little benefit in extending the prediction horizon.
   While an extended prediction horizon does result in increased use of
   battery storage, this does not necessarily produce significant decreases
   in fuel usage. This result is analyzed and explained in terms of battery
   charging and discharging limitations.}},

Abstract = {{A Physics-based mean value model that predicts engine combustion, heat
   transfer, gas exchange, and friction loss has been developed. The model
   is developed starting from the thermodynamic principles of an ideal gas
   standard limited pressure cycle concept. The idealized assumptions that
   are typically used in a limited pressure cycle concept are relieved to
   enhance the fidelity of the model by introducing variables that account
   for the in-cylinder heat transfer and the combustion characteristics
   that change under varying EGR rate as well as the engine speed and load
   while minimal number of empirical correlations are used to ensure the
   compactness and flexibility of the physics-based mean value model. The
   model is calibrated and validated with the simulation results from a
   detailed GT-Power(R) engine model previously calibrated with
   experimental results from a Ford 6.7 liter Diesel engine. The comparison
   shows good agreement between the results from the mean value model and
   the GT-Power(R) model. The mean value model developed in this study is a
   flexible simulation tool that provides excellent computational
   efficiency without sacrificing critical physical details of the Diesel
   combustion process required by the control design development.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we use a realistic energy consumption model for wireless
   networks to analyze the energy and bandwidth performance of wireless
   networks with transmit power control. Transmit power affects the
   performance at the physical layer. When the transmit power increases,
   the capacity at the physical layer increases accordingly, which reduces
   the energy consumption and increases throughput. Transmit power also
   affects the performance of the medium access control (MAC) layer. When
   the transmit power of nodes increases, contention for channel access
   increases, which leads to more energy consumption and lower throughput.
   An energy consumption model that is linked with the bandwidth
   performance analysis is crucial for understanding the performance of
   wireless networks. We propose a simple energy consumption model and
   analyze the energy-throughput tradeoff of distributed wireless network
   considering both the physical layer and the MAC layer. We show that

   first analyze the direct communication outage probability, and based on
   that, analyze the opportunistic relay network's outage probability. For
   an opportunistic relay selection protocol, we consider max-max relay
   selection (MMRS), where two relays are involved in the relaying: one for
   the source data reception and the other for transmission to the
   destination. As a relay selection method, we suggest dual-timer relay
   selection (DTRS), which reduces channel estimation overhead and solves
   the full-buffer problem of a reception relay and the empty-buffer
   problem of a transmission relay in the MMRS protocol. Along with the
   DTRS protocol, we further investigate the optimal relay selection period
   for maximizing the throughput while avoiding selection overhead.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an experimental study on the energy harvesting
   potential of large arrays containing up to 112 flexible piezoelectric
   structures. The ultimate goal is to estimate power output of an array
   given structural and fluid properties along with flow velocity and array
   configuration. While the work presented here will focus primarily on
   experimental details, a brief discussion of the modeling approach will
   also be included. This paper provides results of three case studies,
   each performed with a different array configuration. Unlike previous
   work, trends in the average power output vs. mean flow velocity show
   that the presence of a bluff body placed upstream of the array has
   little effect on total power output. It will be shown that a phenomenon
   known as honami will occur in the array at a predictable flow velocity
   which will cause the array elements to undergo persistent large
   amplitude vibration. This paper presents the first study found in
   literature to take advantage of this excitation mechanism for energy
   harvesting. It will be shown that a resonant state of vibration will
   remain in a given array for a large range of velocities, and is
   unaffected by large-scale turbulence upstream of the array. These
   dynamic characteristics make large arrays of flexible piezoelectric

Abstract = {{Dead-ended anode (DEA) operation of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC)
   can simplify the fuel cell auxiliary and reduce system cost, however
   durability and lifetime in this operating mode requires further study.
   In this work, we investigate the electrode and membrane degradations of
   one 50 cm(2) active area fuel cell under DEA operation using a
   combination of post-mortem evaluation and in-situ performance evaluation
   protocol. We experimentally identify multiple degradation patterns using
   a cell which we have previously modeled and experimentally verified the
   spatio-temporal patterns associated with the anode water flooding and
   nitrogen blanketing. The change in cell voltage and internal resistance
   during operation and ex situ Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images
   of aged electrode/membrane are analysed to determine and characterize
   the degradation of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Chemical
   degradations including carbon corrosion in the Catalyst layer and
   membrane decomposition are found after operating the cell with a DEA.
   Mechanical degradations including membrane delamination are also
   observed. Unique features of DEA operation including fuel
   starvation/nitrogen blanketing in the anode and uneven local
   water/current distribution, are considered as culprits for degradation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a theoretical analysis of dynamic
   valve timing on the performance of a multistage peristaltic vacuum.
   micropump. Prior work has shown that for optimum steady state
   performance a fixed valve timing which depends on the operating pressure
   can be found. However, the use of a fixed valve timing could hinder
   performance for transient operation when the pump is evacuating a fixed
   volume. At the beginning of the transient the pump operates at low
   pressure difference and a large flow rate would be desirable. As the
   pump reaches high vacuum the pressure difference is large and the flow
   rate is necessarily small. Astle and coworkers(1-3) have shown using a
   reduced order model that for steady state operation short valve open
   time results in lower inlet pressure and flow-rate and conversely. Here
   we extend the model of Astle and coworkers to include transient
   operation, multiple coupled stages and non-ideal leaky valves, and show
   that dynamic valve timing (DVT) reduces the transient duration by 30\%
   compared to high vacuum pressure valve timing. The results also show a
   significant reduction in resonant frequency of the pump at low
   pressures, and quantify the effect of valve leakage.}},

Abstract = {{A novel reduced order modeling methodology to capture blade-to-blade
   variability in damping in blisks is presented. This new approach
   generalizes the concept of component mode mistuning (CMM) which was
   developed to capture stiffness and mass mistuning (and did not include
   variability in damping amongst the blades). This work focuses on
   modeling large variability in damping. Such variability is significant
   in many applications, and particularly important for modeling damping
   coatings. The damping in each of the blades is assumed to be structural
   at the blade level. However; variability in the damping coefficients of
   the blades means that the damping is not structural at the system
   (entire blisk) level. Similar to the CMM based studies, structural
   damping is used to capture the damping effects due to the mechanical
   energy dissipation caused by internal friction within the blade
   material. The steady state harmonic responses of the blades are obtained
   using the novel reduced order modeling methodology, and are validated by
   comparison with simulation results obtained using a full order model in
   ANSYS. The effects of damping mistuning are studied statistically
   through Monte-Carlo simulations. For this purpose, the blisk model is
   subjected to multiple travelling wave excitations. The uncertainty in
   the various mechanisms responsible for dissipation of energy and the
   uncontrollability of these dissipation mechanisms makes it difficult to
   assign a reliable value for the loss factor of each blade. Hence large
   variations (up to +/- 80\%) in the structural damping coefficients of
   the blades are simulated.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of research has been conducted on the effects of small
   random variations in structural properties, known as mistuning, in
   single stage bladed disks. Due to the inherent randomness of mistuning
   and the large dimensionality of the models of industrial bladed disks, a
   reduced order modeling approach is required to understand the effects of
   mistuning on a particular bladed disk design. Component mode mistuning
   (CMM) is an efficient compact reduced order modeling method that was
   developed to handle this challenge in single stage bladed disks. In
   general, there are multiple stages in bladed disk assemblies, and it has
   been demonstrated that for certain frequency ranges accurate modeling of
   the entire bladed disk assembly is required because multi-stage modes
   exist. In this work, a statistical characterization of structural
   mistuning in multi-stage bladed disks is carried out. The results were
   obtained using CMM combined with a multi-stage modeling approach
   previously developed. In addition to the statistical characterization, a
   new efficient classification method is detailed for characterizing the
   properties of a mode. Also, the effects of structural mistuning on the
   characterization of the mode is explored.}},

Abstract = {{Preoperative models to assess surgical mortality are important clinical
   tools in determining optimal patient care. The traditional approach to
   develop these models has been primarily centralized, i.e., it uses
   surgical case records aggregated across multiple hospitals. While this
   approach of pooling greatly increases the data size, the resulting
   models fail to reflect individual variations across hospitals in terms
   of patients and the delivery of care. We hypothesize that this process
   can be improved through adapting the multi-hospital data model to an
   individual hospital. This approach simultaneously leverages the large
   multi-hospital data and the patient-and-case mix at individual
   hospitals. We explore transfer learning to refine surgical models for
   individual hospitals in the framework of support vector machine by using
   data from both the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and a
   single hospital. Our results show that transferring models trained on
   multi-hospital data to an individual hospital significantly improves
   discrimination for surgical mortality at the individual provider level.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are smart materials which
   function as soft sensors and actuators. When a small DC voltage (1-5 V)
   is applied to an IPMC in a cantilever configuration, ion and solvent
   transport through the thickness of the polymer membrane causes the
   transducer to bend towards the anode. For device development and use in
   engineering applications, actuation is often described at a higher level
   in terms of an electromechanical coupling between the ionic charge
   distribution and the stresses developed in the IPMC. In this work we
   derive a set of relationships describing the coupling response by
   starting with basic considerations of polymer microstructure and local
   interactions during actuation. A micromechanical modeling framework is
   employed in order to account for the material microstructure. Using a
   generalized expression for electrostatic cluster pressure which takes
   into account clusters recombining to form larger cluster upon expansion,
   we define an effective local stiffness which varies with both solvent
   uptake and charge density in the boundary layers. An equilibrium
   relationship between solvent uptake and charge density is determined by
   considering the free energy of the homogenized polymer as the sum of
   elastic, electrostatic, and chemical components. Stress developed in the
   boundary layers is then calculated from changes in local stiffness and
   solvent uptake with respect to charge density. The resulting
   relationship for electromechanical coupling is found to be in good
   agreement with previous empirical models, thus serving as a model
   validation and demonstrating why certain forms for electromechanical
   coupling can be used to explain a variety of experimental observations.
   Specifically, we see that stress developed in the boundary layers is
   well described as a quadratic polynomial in charge density due to the
   form of the electrostatic cluster pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering practice moves towards user-centred product design. Without
   effective computer-aided design tools, relying only on subjective
   guidelines in design and user testing in prototyping has made usability
   design expensive and time-consuming. This paper explores how modern
   cognitive modelling (CogM) can systematically address the challenges
   facing engineering usability design. A CogM-aided design paradigm is
   investigated for the different requirements of conceptual and detailed
   design stages, its procedural framework, and its special training and
   design modes. As the proof of concept, cognitive models are used in
   conjunction with empirical experiments to evaluate a set of graphical
   user interfaces (GUIs) designs. A group of human subjects test different
   settings of three design variables for several information-retrieval
   tasks with these GUIs. Then cognitive models, using the adaptive control
   of thought-rational/perceptual-motor cognitive architecture and built
   with distinct visual search strategies commonly employed by users,
   simulate the same operations. It is shown that CogM has the potential to
   assist practical decision-making in engineering design. And cognitive
   models can pinpoint possible cognitive challenges when human users deal
   with product interfaces in order to seek better usability. This study is
   the first step towards integrating computational CogM tools for
   practical usability design.}},

Abstract = {{Bone Age (BA) determination using radiological images of left hands and
   wrists is important in pediatric endocrinology to correctly assess
   growth and pubertal maturation. In this paper, we propose a fully
   automated Greulich and Pyle Atlas (GP) bone age determination system
   using feature extraction and machine learning classifiers. The original
   contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) We use commercially
   available morphing tools to create a modified GP atlas that has images
   regularly spaced at three month intervals, (ii) We propose a novel
   Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based feature extractor to create a
   feature vector. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to
   extract features from the images then apply SVD to compose the feature
   vectors. Then, we train a Neural Network classifier using the generated
   feature vectors. Our preliminary results show that, even with a small
   number of training data sets, we obtain promising results. Future
   direction is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite evidence that human wayfinders consider directions involving
   landmarks or topological descriptions easier to follow, the majority of
   commerical direction-planning services and GPS navigation units plan
   routes based on metrically or temporally shortest paths, ignoring this
   potentially valuable information. We propose a method for generating
   directions that maximizes the probability of a human arriving at the
   correct destination, taking into account a model of their ability to
   follow topological, metrical, and landmark-based directions. We discuss
   optimization techniques for employing these models and present a method,
   DART, for extracting model-improved sets of directions in a tractable
   amount of time. DART employs particle simulation techniques to maximize
   the probability that the modeled wayfinder will successfully reach their
   destination. Our synthetic evaluation shows that DART produces
   improvements in arrival rates over existing methods and illustrates how
   DART's directions reflect properties of the wayfinder model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel mutual information (MI) based algorithm for
   automatic registration of unstructured 3D point clouds comprised of
   co-registered 3D lidar and camera imagery. The proposed method provides
   a robust and principled framework for fusing the complementary
   information obtained from these two different sensing modalities.
   High-dimensional features are extracted from a training set of textured
   point clouds (scans) and hierarchical k-means clustering is used to
   quantize these features into a set of codewords. Using this codebook,
   any new scan can be represented as a collection of codewords. Under the
   correct rigid-body transformation aligning two overlapping scans, the MI
   between the codewords present in the scans is maximized. We apply a
   James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator to estimate the true MI from the
   marginal and joint histograms of the codewords extracted from the scans.
   Experimental results using scans obtained by a vehicle equipped with a
   3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera are used to validate the
   robustness of the proposed algorithm over a wide range of initial
   conditions. We also show that the proposed method works well with 3D
   data alone.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental challenges in robotics is data-association:
   determining which sensor observations correspond to the same physical
   object. A common approach is to consider groups of observations
   simultaneously: a constellation of observations can be significantly
   less ambiguous than the observations considered individually. The Joint
   Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) test is the gold standard method
   for these data association problems. But its computational complexity
   and its sensitivity to non-linearities limit its practical usefulness.
   We propose the Incremental Posterior Joint Compatibility (IPJC) test.
   While equivalent to JCBB on linear problems, it is significantly more
   accurate on non-linear problems. When used for feature-cloud matching
   (an important special case), IPJC is also dramatically faster than JCBB.
   We demonstrate the advantages of IPJC over JCBB and other commonly-used
   methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.}},

Abstract = {{When calibrating a camera, the radial component of lens distortion is
   the dominant source of image distortion. To model this lens distortion,
   camera models incorporate a radial distortion model that conforms to a
   certain parametric form. In practice however, multiple parametric forms
   can be used to model distortion for a given lens. Ideally, one would
   choose the best suited parametric form using a model selection
   procedure.
   In this work, we propose the use of Gaussian Process regression to model
   lens distortion. With the use of a squared exponential covariance
   function, a Gaussian Process (GP) can describe the space of smooth
   distortion functions; kernel hyper-parameter selection in this space
   then analogous to performing explicit model selection between possible
   parametric models.
   Our evaluation shows that this Gaussian Process formulation of lens
   distortion performs on par with parametric distortion models.}},

Abstract = {{State of the art methods for state estimation and perception make use of
   least-squares optimization methods to perform efficient inference on
   noisy sensor data. Much of this efficiency is achieved by using sparse
   matrix factorization methods. The sparsity structure of the underlying
   matrix factorization which makes these optimization methods tractable is
   highly dependent on the choice of variable reordering; but there has
   been no systematic evaluation of reordering methods in the SLAM
   community.
   In this paper we evaluate the performance of various reordering
   techniques on benchmark SLAM data sets and provide definitive
   recommendations based on our results. We also compare these state of the
   art algorithms against our simple and easy to implement algorithm which
   achieves comparable performance. Finally, we provide empirical evidence
   that few gains remain with respect to variants of minimum degree
   ordering.}},

Abstract = {{Complex controlled motions, soft human interaction, and minimal moving
   mass all drive the need for soft robots using fluid filled fiber
   reinforced elastomer enclosures (FREEs). While a narrow class of FREEs
   known as McKibben's actuators have been extensively studied, there is a
   wide unexplored class with complex sets of motion patterns. Combining
   these actuators in parallel can yield versatile motion patterns
   resulting in a large overall workspace. Mobility of individual actuators
   is enforced by inextensibility of fibers and incompressibility of
   fluids, which in turn drives the net attainable motions. In this paper,
   we map the mobility of individual FREE actuators to all possible
   resultant motions that a combination of three sets of actuators arranged
   in a triangular configuration would undergo. This understanding has
   resulted in a preliminary design tool that determines individual FREE
   topologies for a required set of motion patterns. Five case studies that
   result from this methodology are prototyped and tested for comparison of
   the predicted and obtained motion directions.}},

   is a continual, incremental process that transforms current
   environmental-structure hypotheses into children hypotheses describing
   the same environment in more detail. Since our method only relies on
   simple geometric and probabilistic inferences, our method runs in
   real-time, and it avoids the need of extensive prior training and the
   Manhattan-world assumption, which makes it practical and efficient for a
   navigating robot. Experimental results on a collection of indoor videos
   suggests that our method is capable of modeling various structures of

   Here, we propose a strategy for robot navigation in a structured,

   We propose the model predictive equilibrium point control (MPEPC)
   framework, in which the ideas of time-optimality and equilibrium point
   control are combined in order to generate solutions quickly and
   responsively.
   Our approach depends on a carefully designed compact parameterization of
   a rich set of closed-loop trajectories, and the use of expected values
   in cost definitions. This allows us to formulate local navigation as a
   continuous, low-dimensional, and unconstrained optimization problem,
   which is easy to solve. We present navigation examples generated from

   topological map hypothesis online, while still guaranteeing the correct
   map can always be found. Our algorithm annotates each leaf of the tree
   with a posterior probability. When a new place is encountered, we expand
   hypotheses based on their posterior probability, which means only the
   most probable hypotheses are expanded. By focusing on the most probable
   hypotheses, we dramatically reduce the number of hypotheses evaluated
   allowing real-time operation. Additionally, our approach never prunes
   consistent hypotheses from the tree, which means the correct hypothesis
   always exists within the tree.}},

Abstract = {{We present new bounds on the locality of several classical symmetry
   breaking tasks in distributed networks. A sampling of the results
   include
   1) A randomized algorithm for computing a maximal matching (MM) in O(log
   Delta+(log log n)(4)) rounds, where Delta is the maximum degree. This
   improves a 25-year old randomized algorithm of Israeli and Itai that
   takes O(log n) rounds and is provably optimal for all log Delta in the
   range {[}(log log n)(4), root logn].
   2) A randomized maximal independent set (MIS) algorithm requiring O(log
   Delta root log n) rounds, for all Delta, and only 2(O(root log log n))
   rounds when Delta = poly(logn). These improve on the 25-year old O(log
   n)-round randomized MIS algorithms of Luby and Alon, Babai, and Itai
   when log Delta << root log n.
   3) A randomized (Delta + 1)-coloring algorithm requiring O(log Delta +
   2(O(root log log n))) rounds, improving on an algorithm of Schneider and
   Wattenhofer that takes O(log Delta+root log n) rounds. This result
   implies that an O(Delta)-coloring can be computed in 2(O(root log log
   n)) rounds for all., improving on Kothapalli et al.'s O(root log
   n)-round algorithm.
   We also introduce a new technique for reducing symmetry breaking
   problems on low arboricity graphs to low degree graphs. Corollaries of
   this reduction include MM and MIS algorithms for low arboricity graphs
   (e. g., planar graphs and graphs that exclude any fixed minor) requiring
   O(root log n) and O(log(2/3) n) rounds w.h.p., respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Nonbinary LDPC codes have shown superior performance, but decoding
   nonbinary codes is complex, incurring a long latency and a much degraded

   processing node by prefetching and relaxing redundancy control. The
   processing nodes are jointly designed for an optimal pipeline schedule.
   This low-latency, high-throughput architecture is applied to a class of
   high-performance (2, d(c))-regular nonbinary LDPC codes constructed
   based on their binary images. A conflict-free memory is proposed to
   resolve data hazards caused by the non-structured nature of these codes.
   A complete (2, 4)-regular, (960, 480) GF(64) nonbinary LDPC decoder is
   demonstrated on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. The decoder delivers an
   excellent error-correcting performance at a 9.76 Mb/s coded throughput,

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency and computational reliability are two key concerns
   associated with modern computations that involve computational resource
   sharing and highly uncertain job arrivals from various sources
   (customers). In 2010, large-scale data center operations consume around
   2\% of the total energy use in the US. Meanwhile, the development of
   cloud computing in the IT industry possesses great potential for
   lowering energy consumption by partitioning and scheduling job requests
   among multiple computational servers. In this paper, we formulate
   stochastic integer programming models to minimize energy consumption of
   cloud computing servers over finite time periods, while maintaining a
   pre-specified quality of service (QoS) level for satisfying uncertain
   computational requests. The models dynamically monitor and predict
   customer requests for each period, and proactively switch servers on/off
   according to estimated customer requests. QoS levels are maintained by
   either enforcing zero unsatisfied requests, or imposing a joint chance
   constraint to bound possible failures in a backlogging model. When
   uncertain requests follow continuous distributions, we employ the
   Sampling Average Approximation for generating scenario-based requests.
   Such an approach transforms the original probabilistic model into
   deterministic mixed-integer linear programs. We further demonstrate
   computational results of all models by testing instances with different
   parameter combinations, and investigate how backlogging, unit penalty
   cost and QoS levels influence computational performances and optimal
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in real-time multiprocessor scheduling has been rekindled as
   multi-core chips are increasingly used for embedded real-time systems.
   While tasks may be preemptive or non-preemptive (due to their
   transactional operations), deadline guarantees are usually made only for
   those task sets in each of which all tasks are preemptive or
   non-preemptive, not a mixture thereof, i.e., all or nothing. In this
   paper, we develop a schedulability analysis framework that guarantees
   the timing requirements of a given task set in which a task can be
   either preemptive or non-preemptive. As an example, we apply this
   framework to the prioritization policy of EDF (Earliest Deadline First),
   yielding schedulability tests of mpn-EDF (Mixed
   Preemptive/Non-preemptive EDF), which is a generalization of both fp-EDF
   (fully-preemptive EDF) and np-EDF (non-preemptive EDF). In addition to
   their deadline guarantees for any task set that is composed of a mixture
   of preemptive and non-preemptive tasks, the tests outperform the
   existing schedulability tests of np-EDF (a special case of mpn-EDF) by
   up to 109.1\%. Using these tests, we also improve schedulability by
   disallowing preemptions of some preemptive tasks. For this, we develop
   an algorithm that optimally disallows preemption of a preemptive task
   under a certain assumption, and demonstrate via simulation that the
   algorithm discovers up to 30.9\% additional task sets that are
   schedulable with the proposed scheduling scheme, but not with fp-EDF or
   np-EDF.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) processes data in the form of long
   pseudo-random bit-streams denoting probabilities. Its key advantages are
   simple computational elements and high soft-error tolerance. Recent
   technology developments have revealed important new SC applications such
   as image processing and LDPC decoding. Despite its long history, SC
   still lacks a comprehensive design methodology; existing methods tend to
   be ad hoc and limited to a few arithmetic functions. We demonstrate a
   fundamental relation between stochastic circuits and spectral
   transforms. Based on this, we propose a transform approach to the
   analysis and synthesis of SC circuits. We illustrate the approach for a
   variety of basic combinational SC design problems, and show that the
   area cost associated with stochastic number generation can be
   significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo (MC) simulation plays a key role in EDA as the gold standard
   against which heuristics are measured. It is also an important
   stand-alone technique for statistics-based tasks like power estimation
   and reliability analysis. Accurate simulation requires large sample sets
   and long runtimes, which can be hard to achieve with conventional MC. We
   propose an approach called Reduced-Ordered Monte Carlo (ROMC), which
   improves simulation efficiency, while still producing accurate results.
   ROMC takes advantage of the (partial) redundancy inherent in digital
   signals. It prioritizes input signals based on their observability at
   the outputs, and combines inputs based on a compatibility property that
   enables them to share samples. Experimental results are presented which
   demonstrate that the ROMC methodology can decrease simulation runtime by
   several orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The paradigm of logical computation on stochastic bit streams has
   several key advantages compared to deterministic computation based on
   binary radix, including error-tolerance and low hardware area cost.
   Prior research has shown that sequential logic operating on stochastic
   bit streams can compute non-polynomial functions, such as the tanh
   function, with less energy than conventional implementations. However,
   the functions that can be computed in this way are quite limited. For
   example, high order polynomials and non-polynomial functions cannot be
   computed using prior approaches. This paper proposes a new finite-state
   machine (FSM) topology for complex arithmetic computation on stochastic
   bit streams. It describes a general methodology for synthesizing such
   FSMs. Experimental results show that these FSM-based implementations are
   more tolerant of soft errors and less costly in terms of the area-time
   product that conventional implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have emerged as a favorable solution to provide
   higher bandwidth interconnects for large chip multiprocessors (CMPs). In
   order to enhance the interconnect's performance, the NoC is often
   designed to include complex components and advanced features. Along with
   the increase in complexity and size, ensuring the functional correctness
   of the NoC can be particularly challenging This challenge pervades the
   entire verification effort, and particular lypost-silicon validation,
   due to the lack of observability of the networks complex internal
   operation.
   We propose a post-silicon validation platform that enhances
   observability of network activity by periodically taking snapshots of
   the packets in flight. Each node's local cache is configured to store
   the snapshot logs in a temporary space allocated for post-silicon
   validation and released at deployment. Each snapshot log is periodically
   and locally analyzed by a software algorithm, running on the processor's
   core, in order to detect functional errors. If an error is detected, the
   snapshot logs are aggregated and additional debug data is extracted.
   This includes an overview of the traffic in the network at the time
   surrounding the manifestation of the error, as well as a partial
   reconstruction of the routes followed by the packets in flight. In our
   experiments, we found that this approach allows us to detect several
   types of functional errors, as well as observe over 50\% of the
   network's traffic on average and reconstruct at least half of each of
   their routes through the network.}},

Abstract = {{3D-IC integration and its implied resource optimization, a particularly
   critical resource is deadspace - regions between floorplan blocks.
   Deadspace is required for through-silicon via (TSV) planning and other
   related design tasks, but the effective use of this limited and
   highly-contested resource requires effort. While most previous work
   focuses on a single design issue at a time, we propose a lightweight
   multiobjective deadspace-optimization methodology that simultaneously
   optimizes interconnect, IR-drop, clock-tree size and maximal
   temperature. This methodology repeatedly re-evaluates design quality
   during early chip planning and uses resulting information to guide
   further optimization. Experimental results indicate that constructing an
   appropriate deadspace distribution improves design tradeoffs and is
   effective in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of inherently variable wind generation into weak grids,
   particularly sub-transmission networks that are characterized by low X/R
   ratios, affects bus voltages, regulating devices and line flows. The
   meshed structure of these networks adds to the complexity, especially
   when wind generation is distributed across multiple nodes. This paper
   considers a range of techniques for analyzing the impact of wind
   variability on weak grids. Sensitivity analysis, based on the power-flow
   Jacobian, is used to highlight the sections of the system that are most
   severely affected by wind-power variations. A continuation power flow is
   used to determine parameter changes that reduce the impact of wind-power
   variability. It is also used to explore interactions between multiple
   wind-farms. Two optimization problems have been formulated to identify
   line segments that are most vulnerable to congestion as wind-power
   varies. The DC optimization is computationally more efficient, whereas
   the AC sensitivity-based optimization provides greater accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in vehicle onboard computers and vehicle-to-vehicle
   communications technology allow automatic control of vehicles and the
   organization of vehicles into platoons with short intraplatoon
   distances. One of the major issues with platoon control is latency in
   wireless communications. Latency has a negative impact on safety and
   disrupts the stability of platoons. A decentralized longitudinal
   platoon-controlling mechanism that uses a model predictive control
   approach to control vehicles safely, even in harsh communications
   environments, is proposed. The sensitivity of this method was analyzed
   to derive the conditions for this method to work safely. A simulation
   test bed for this control method was implemented to test effectiveness
   and safety under two communications latency settings. The results showed
   that the model predictive control method could safely control the
   platoon even in harsh communications environments.}},

Abstract = {{Following work on designing optimal rewards for single agents, we define
   a multiagent optimal rewards problem (ORP) in common-payoff (or team)
   settings. This new problem solves for individual agent reward functions
   that guide agents to better overall team performance relative to teams
   in which all agents guide their behavior with the same given team-reward
   function. We present a multiagent architecture in which each agent
   learns good reward functions from experience using a gradient-based
   algorithm in addition to performing the usual task of planning good
   policies (except in this case with respect to the learned rather than
   the given reward function). Multiagency introduces the challenge of
   nonstationarity: because the agents learn simultaneously, each agent's
   learning problem is nonstationary and interdependent on the other
   agents. We demonstrate on two simple domains that the proposed
   architecture outperforms the conventional approach in which all the
   agents use the same given team-reward function (even when accounting for
   the resource overhead of the reward learning); that the learning
   algorithm performs stably despite the nonstationarity; and that learning
   individual reward functions can lead to better specialization of roles
   than is possible with shared reward, whether learned or given.}},

   In this work, we develop a combined radar scattering model of vegetation
   and multilayered soil structure to represent realistic soils with
   multiple layers of various textures, depths, and moisture contents. A
   multilayered soil scattering model based on first order small
   perturbation method (SPM) is integrated {[}1] to account for direct
   ground scattering. Furthermore, the coherent interaction between the
   vegetation and layered ground is included using a recently developed
   model based on the Kirchhoff approximation {[}2].}},

Abstract = {{Several magnetic resonance (MR) parallel imaging techniques require
   explicit estimates of the receive coil sensitivity profiles. These
   estimates must be accurate over both the object and its surrounding
   regions to avoid generating artifacts in the reconstructed images.
   Statistical estimation methods provide robust sensitivity estimates but
   can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an augmented
   Lagrangian (AL) based method that estimates the coil sensitivity by
   minimizing a quadratic cost function. This method reformulates the
   finite differencing matrix to allow for exact alternating minimization
   steps. We also explore a variation of our algorithm that involves
   intermediate updating of the Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate that
   our proposed algorithm converges in half the time of the traditional
   conjugate gradient method with a circulant preconditioner (PCG) on a
   real data set.}},

   pick-place using a general-purposed micromanipulator and a micropipette.
   The micromanipulation system uses computer vision and motion control
   approaches to accurately pick up a single cell, transfer it to a desired
   substrate/location, and deposit it at a specified location. A
   traditional glass micropipette having a diameter larger than the cell is
   used to aspirate a whole cell into the micropipette for pick-place. This
   protocol is designed to manipulate and position single cells within a
   variety of microenvironments. The system is broadly applicable to any
   type of substrate and can manipulate multiple cell types in an end-user
   customizable manner. The presented protocol is for aspirating and
   transferring single cells after trypsinization. Additional steps are
   required for pick-place cells in their adherent state, such as local
   trypsinization or mechanical cutting. The tool for pick-place of cells
   can be useful as a stand-alone or bolstering technology for single-cell

Abstract = {{To meet increasingly stringent emission regulations modern internal
   combustion engines require highly accurate control of the air-to-fuel
   ratio. The performance of the conventional air-to-fuel ratio feedback
   loop is limited by the combustion delay between fuel injection and
   engine exhaust, and by the transport delay for the exhaust gas to
   propagate to the air-to-fuel ratio sensor location. The combined delay
   is variable, since it depends on engine speed and airflow. Drivability,
   fuel economy and emission requirements result in constraints on the
   deviations of the air-to-fuel ratio, stored oxygen in the three-way
   catalyst, and fuel injection. This paper proposes an approach for
   air-to-fuel ratio control based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The
   approach systematically handles both variable time delays and
   pointwise-in-time constraints. A delay-free model is considered first,
   which takes into account the dynamic relations between the injected fuel
   and the air-to-fuel ratio and the dynamics of the oxygen stored in the
   catalyst. For the delay-free model, the explicit MPC law is computed.
   Delay compensation is obtained by estimating the delay online from
   engine operating conditions, and feeding the MPC law with the state
   predicted ahead over the time interval of the estimated delay. The
   predicted state is computed by combining measurement filtering with
   forward iterations of the nonlinear dynamic equations of the model. The
   achieved performance in tracking the air-to-fuel ratio and the oxygen
   storage setpoints while enforcing the constraints is demonstrated in
   simulation using real data profiles.}},

   responses in the absence of instructions. Four healthy young adults
   maintained an upright, erect posture with their eyes closed in two
   different stance conditions: normal and Romberg stance. Six vibrotactile
   transducers (tactors) were placed on the skin over the right and left
   external oblique, internal oblique, and erector spinae muscles. Either a
   combination of vibration at two locations or all locations around the
   torso was applied for 5 s during each experimental trial. Regardless of
   stance condition, vibration applied concurrently over the right and left
   internal oblique muscle locations and the right and left erector spinae
   muscle locations induced a postural shift in the anterior and posterior
   directions, respectively. For these two stimulation conditions, the
   root-mean-square of sway in the anterior-posterior direction was
   significantly greater during vibration than before or after stimulation.
   However, simultaneous activation of all tactors, a combination of right
   internal oblique and right erector spinae locations, and a combination
   of left internal oblique and left erector spinae locations did not
   produce significant directional postural shifts or increases in sway,
   regardless of the stance condition. These findings suggest that stimuli
   combinations contribute to a vector summation of individual postural
   responses described in our previous work and that they could be
   leveraged in balance-related applications of sensory augmentation
   vibrotactile displays.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the bandwidth (throughput) and energy
   efficiency considering both the physical layer and the medium access
   control (MAC) layer in multi-hop relay wireless networks. For a given
   distance between the source and the destination, as the number of relays
   increases the overhead necessary to operate the MAC protocol increases.
   However, the energy needed for a given throughput decreases when the
   distance between relays decreases. Thus there is an optimal number of
   relays that optimizes both the throughput and the energy efficiency. We
   analyze how the number of relays used between the source and the
   destination affects the throughput and the energy consumption. The
   energy-throughput relationship incorporating both the physical layer and
   the MAC layer was considered in the analysis and optimization of the
   number of relays. Based on the analysis we provide general criteria for
   the optimal number of relays.}},

Abstract = {{Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) represents one of several first-line
   therapies for the treatment of stones located in the kidneys and
   ureters. Additional applications for shock wave therapy are also under
   exploration, including non-urinary calculi, orthopedics, and
   neovascularization. Except for the elimination of a large water bath in
   which the treatment is performed, current procedures remain largely
   unchanged, with one of the original commercial devices (the Dornier HM3)
   still considered a gold standard for comparison. To accelerate research
   in this area, Coleman, et al. published an experimental electrohydraulic
   shock wave generator capable of simulating the acoustic field generated
   by the HM3. We propose a further update of this system, replacing the
   triggered spark gap with an optically triggered solid state switch. The
   new system has better reliability, a wider operating range, and reduced
   timing jitter allowing synchronization with additional acoustic sources
   under exploration for improving efficacy and reducing injury. Originally
   designed for exciting electrohydraulic spark electrodes, the system can
   also be adapted for driving piezoelectric and electromagnetic sources.}},

Abstract = {{The design and initial testing of an ultrasound system capable of
   targeting and treating breast cancer noninvasively is presented; this
   system can be used either in the prone position, thus compatible with
   MRI localization and microwave-assisted treatment, or in the
   mammographic geometry for improved localization. Two half-shell
   transducers with holes in the centers for 2D imaging arrays allow
   placement close to the chest wall around, or on either side of, the
   breast. To drive the pair of 149 element arrays, we are building and
   programming circuitry to output radiofrequency (RF) tone bursts at 1.5
   MHz. The low frequency may allow aperture sharing with microwave
   antennas and yet is high enough for acoustic droplet vaporization at 4
   MPa peak rarefactional pressure for pulse trains of 2 s at 1\% duty
   factor and far less for CW exposures. Five Altera DE1 development boards
   individually output RF tone bursts through 64 programmable channels
   each. A MATLAB-based, graphical user interface controls the system.
   Acoustic output tests at low pressures on a few array elements and
   electrical characterization of all elements suggest the necessary
   pressures can be achieved with either half of the full 0.7 f-number
   array using inexpensive amplifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Effective real-time HIFU lesion detection is important for expanded use

   of cardiac arrhythmia). The goal of this study was to investigate rapid,
   high-frequency M-mode ultrasound imaging for monitoring spatiotemporal
   changes in tissue during HIFU application. The HIFU application (4.33
   MHz, 1000 Hz PRF, 50\% duty cycle, 1 s exposure, 6100 W/cm(2)) was
   perpendicularly applied to porcine cardiac tissue with a high-frequency
   imaging system (Visualsonics Vevo 770, 55 MHz, 4.5 mm focal distance)
   confocally aligned. Radiofrequency (RF) M-mode data (1 kHz PRF, 4 s x 7
   mm) was acquired before, during, and after HIFU treatment. Gross lesions
   were compared with M-mode data to correlate lesion and cavity formation.
   Integrated backscatter, echo-decorrelation parameters, and their
   cumulative extrema over time were analyzed for automatically identifying
   lesion width and bubble formation. Cumulative maximum integrated
   backscatter showed the best results for identifying the final lesion
   width, and a criterion based on line-to-line decorrelation was proposed
   for identification of transient bubble activity.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is a non-invasive, pulsed ultrasound technology where
   controlled cavitation is used to homogenize targeted tissue. We sought
   to assess the possibility that histotripsy may increase metastatic
   spread of tumor by quantifying the number of lung metastasis apparent
   after histotripsy treatment of aggressive renal VX-2 tumor compared to
   non-treated controls. VX-2 tumor was implanted in the left kidneys of 28
   New Zealand White rabbits. Twenty rabbits were treated with histotripsy
   (day 13 after implantation) while 8 served as controls. All rabbits
   underwent left nephrectomy (day 14) and then were euthanized (day 19).
   This study was powered to detect a doubling in metastatic rate.
   Homogenized tumor was seen in all treated nephrectomy specimens.
   Whole-mount, coronal lung sections were viewed to calculate number and
   density of metastases. Viable tumor was present in all 28 lungs
   examined. Histology confirmed fractionation of tumor in all treatment
   rabbits. There was not a statistical difference in total lung metastases
   (88.7 vs. 72.5; p=0.29) or metastatic density (8.9 vs. 7.0 mets/cm2;
   p=0.22) between treated and control rabbits. Further investigation is
   planned to validate these results in the VX-2 model and to assess
   metastatic rates in less aggressive tumors treated with histotripsy.}},

Abstract = {{Scattering of time-harmonic fields by chiral objects can be modeled by a
   second kind boundary integral equation, similar to Muller's equation for
   scattering by nonchiral penetrable objects. In this contribution, a
   mixed discretization scheme for the chiral Muller equation is introduced
   using both Rao-Wilton- Glisson and Buffa-Christiansen funtions. It is
   shown that this mixed discretization yields more accurate solutions than
   classical discretizations, and that they can be computed in a limited
   number of iterations using Krylov type solvers.}},

Abstract = {{We report a leaky radial waveguide that can generate propagating Bessel
   beams by supporting an azimuthally invariant leaky-wave mode. The normal
   electric-field component of the mode is a truncated, zeroth-order Bessel
   function. Design relations for the radial waveguide are provided based
   on a vector field approach in contrast to previous scalar-based
   approaches. Electric field measurements and their respective Fourier
   transforms validate the operation of the prototype as a Bessel-beam
   launcher. In particular, the Fourier transform of the measured electric
   field exhibits a ring in the spectral domain at the operating frequency,
   as expected for Bessel beams. The proposed structure can be used for
   generating arbitrary zeroth-order propagating Bessel beams at microwave
   or millimeter-wave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach based on reactive loading of a
   resonant structure to achieve ultra-wideband operation for a low-profile
   omnidirectional antenna. The use of the proposed reactive elements
   generates new resonances in lower frequency band than the original
   antenna resonant frequency. The key feature of the reactive load design
   pertains to its frequency response so that while the input impedance of
   the reactive load is seen as `infinite' at the original resonant
   frequency, it is seen as `capacitive' at newly generated resonant
   frequency. Proper combination of these resonant frequencies and their
   harmonics leads to a very wide bandwidth operation. A circuit model for
   the reactive load is first proposed and the realization of its
   electromagnetic model is followed. To implement the proposed method to
   antenna design, a lambda/2 resonant folded monopole antenna exhibiting
   wider bandwidth than a lambda/4 resonant monopole antenna is chosen. It
   is discussed that 10dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of the antennas with
   the proposed reactive loads can be 45\% and omnidirectional radiation
   pattern with vertical polarization be obtained in the operating
   frequency band.}},

Abstract = {{A new concept for implementation of a miniaturized high-gain and
   low-power radio repeater is presented in this paper. The proposed micro
   repeater has a simple RF architecture and can route multiple channels
   simultaneously. The repeater is composed of low-profile planar
   miniaturized antennas with vertically polarized radiation pattern,
   low-power high-gain amplifier chain, and a ring hybrid coupler as a feed
   network for the transmit antenna pair. By designing the radio repeater
   structure in symmetric manner and feeding the transmit antenna pair
   out-of-phase, a null-plane is created in which the receive antenna feed
   is placed. This way the mutual coupling between the transmit and receive

Abstract = {{An efficient surrogate modelling technique that supports the genetic
   algorithm (GA)-based optimization of electromagnetic (EM) devices is
   presented. The proposed method leverages high dimensional model
   representation (HDMR) expansions, which approximate observables or
   objective functions as series of iteratively constructed component
   functions involving only the most strongly interacting design variables.
   The contributions that feature in HDMR expansions are approximated via a
   multi-element probabilistic collocation (MEPC) method. The proposed
   method is capable of generating surrogate models of rapidly varying
   observables or objective functions that involve a large number of design
   parameters. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are
   demonstrated via its application to the placement of stacked patch
   antennas in a linear array.}},

Abstract = {{System provisioning is the problem of determining the number of
   resources required to accomplish a complicated system level task, e. g.
   tracking or discriminating between N targets. This is a central problem
   in multi-target tracking with synthetic aperture radars where the number
   of targets can easily exceed the available resources. This paper treats
   the following conservative sensor provisioning problem: dynamically
   assign R platforms to process N moving targets in a way that guarantees
   that the radar maintains track on all targets. We propose a solution to
   this problem that guarantees a prescribed level of system performance,
   e. g., multiple target detection and position uncertainty levels,
   regardless of the scenario. The operational context of the paper is
   computational provisioning in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that
   dynamically assigns different computers to tracking different targets.}},

   where a vehicle is to perpetually visit customers within a given area.
   In this work there is no sense of horizon or days as in classic PVRP.
   Instead, it is assumed that each customer has a rate at which it must be
   visited for the vehicle to satisfy its mission. The vehicle's fuel
   limitations are taken into account and fuel depots with a fixed fuel
   price are included. The problem of finding paths that satisfy the
   locations' revisit rates and minimize the total cost of fuel is treated.
   An algorithm that provides solutions to this problem under given
   constraints is presented. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection

   process. Due to extreme resolution requirements compared to print media,
   the burden of software and hardware tools on the throughput also needs
   to be carefully determined. Moreover, the effect of web wander and
   variations in web speed need to accurately be determined in the design
   of the system hardware and software. Realization of successful metrology
   and instrumentation by overcoming the challenges for the development of
   a roll-to-roll manufacturing system for flexible electronic systems
   opens limitless possibilities for the deployment of high performance
   flexible electronic components in a variety of applications including
   communication, sensing, medicine, agriculture, energy, lighting etc.}},

Title = {{A Two-Step Approach to Uncertainty Quantification of Core Simulators}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{For the multiple sources of error introduced into the standard
   computational regime for simulating reactor cores, rigorous uncertainty
   analysis methods are available primarily to quantify the effects of
   cross section uncertainties. Two methods for propagating cross section
   uncertainties through core simulators are the XSUSA statistical approach
   and the ``two-step{''} method. The XSUSA approach, which is based on the
   SUSA code package, is fundamentally a stochastic sampling method.
   Alternatively, the two-step method utilizes generalized perturbation
   theory in the first step and stochastic sampling in the second step. The
   consistency of these two methods in quantifying uncertainties in the
   multiplication factor and in the core power distribution was examined in
   the framework of phase I-3 of the OECD Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling
   benchmark. With the Three Mile Island Unit 1 core as a base model for
   analysis, the XSUSA and two-step methods were applied with certain
   limitations, and the results were compared to those produced by other
   stochastic sampling-based codes. Based on the uncertainty analysis
   results, conclusions were drawn as to the method that is currently more
   viable for computing uncertainties in burnup and transient calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Realistic duty cycles are critical for design and assessment of hybrid
   propulsion systems, in particular, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The
   analysis of the PHEV impact requires a large amount of data about daily
   missions for ensuring realism in predicted temporal loads on the grid.
   This paper presents two approaches for the reduction of the
   computational effort while assessing the large scale PHEV impact on the
   grid, namely 1) ``response surface modelling{''} approach; and 2)
   ``daily driving schedule modelling{''} approach. The response surface
   modelling approach replaces the time-consuming vehicle simulations by
   response surfaces constructed off-line with the consideration of the
   real-world driving. The daily driving modelling approach establishes a
   correlation between departure and arrival times, and it predicts
   representative driving patterns with a significantly reduced number of
   simulation cases. In both cases, representative synthetic driving cycles
   are used to capture the naturalistic driving characteristics for a given
   trip length. The proposed approaches enable construction of 24-hour
   missions, assessments of charging requirements at the time of
   plugging-in, and temporal distributions of the load on the grid with
   high computational efficiency.}},

   position sensing often greatly exceed the power needed to generate
   motion. This paper explores the implications of sampling rate and
   amplifier noise density selection on performance of a system
   identification algorithm using a capacitive sensing circuit. Specific
   performance objectives are to minimize or limit convergence rate and
   power consumption to identify dynamics of a rotary micro-stage. A
   rearrangement of the conventional recursive least-squares identification
   algorithm is performed to make operating cost an explicit function of
   sensor design parameters. It is observed that there is a strong
   dependence of convergence rate and error on sampling rate, while energy
   dependence is driven by error that may be tolerated in final identified

   Control (MPC) with dynamically reconfigurable constraints. Previous
   results for maneuvers confined to the orbital plane are extended to
   three dimensional maneuvers with three dimensional Line-of-Sight (LoS)
   constraint handling. The MPC controller is designed to prescribe Delta
   upsilon impulsive velocity changes rather than piecewise constant thrust
   profiles. The ability to transition between MPC guidance in the
   spacecraft rendezvous phase and MPC guidance in the spacecraft docking
   phase, with requirements, constraints, and sampling rates specific to
   each phase, is demonstrated. Bandwidth constraints of the spacecraft
   attitude control system and exhaust plume direction constraints are also
   addressed. The MPC controller is validated on the full nonlinear model
   of spacecraft orbital motion and augmented with an Extended Kalman
   Filter (EKF) to estimate spacecraft states based on relative angles and
   relative range measurements.}},

   vehicles (PEVs). In particular, uncoordinated overnight charging is
   expected to be problematic, as the corresponding aggregated power demand
   exceeds the capacity of most distribution substation transformers. In
   this paper, a dynamical model of PEVs served by a single
   temperature-constrained substation transformer is presented and a
   centralized scheduling scheme is formulated to coordinate charging of a
   heterogeneous PEV fleet. We employ the dual-ascent method to derive an
   iterative, incentive-based and non-centralized implementation of the PEV
   charging algorithm, which is optimal upon convergence. Then, the
   distributed open-loop problem is embedded in a predictive control scheme
   to introduce robustness against disturbances. Simulations of an
   overnight charging scenario illustrate the effectiveness of the
   so-obtained incentive-based coordinated PEV control scheme in terms of
   performance and enforcing the transformer's thermal constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Gas Turbine (GT) hybrid systems have
   been widely studied in recent years as a promising alternative power
   sources for various applications. The fundamental concept of this system
   is combining a GT with the SOFC system to recuperate the energy left in
   the SOFC exhaust, thereby improving the overall system efficiency.
   However, because of the coupling dynamics between SOFC and GT, the
   system is susceptible to shutdown in the case of an abrupt load change.
   This work investigates the use of the Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT) to
   address this shutdown problem and improve the transient system
   performance. A model of a 60-kW class SOFC/GT hybrid system is developed
   for the study. Based on the insights learned from the open-loop
   analysis, a feedback design is proposed for VGT control, analysis of
   transient dynamics for the closed-loop is performed, and simulation
   results demonstrating the performance are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature monitoring is a critical issue for lithium ion batteries.
   Since only the surface temperature of the battery can be measured, a
   thermal model is needed to estimate the core temperature, which can be
   higher and hence more critical. In this paper, an on-line parameter
   identification scheme is designed for a cylindrical lithium ion battery
   thermal model, by which the parameters of the thermal model can be
   identified automatically. An adaptive observer is designed based on the
   on-line parameterization methodology and the closed loop architecture. A
   linear battery thermal model is explored first, where the internal
   resistance is assumed to be constant. The methodology is later extended
   to address temperature dependent internal resistance with non-uniform
   forgetting factors. The capability of the methodology to track the long
   term variation of the internal resistance is beneficial for battery
   health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Input reconstruction is a process where the inputs to a system are
   estimated using the measured system output, and possibly some modeling
   information from the system model. One way to achieve this goal is to
   invert the system model and cascade delays to guarantee that the inverse
   is proper. A standing issue in input reconstruction lies in the
   inversion of nonminimum-phase systems, since the inverse model is
   unstable. We consider two methods for achieving input reconstruction
   despite the presence of nonminimum-phase zeros. First, we develop an
   open-loop partial inversion of the system model using a finite number of
   frequency points, where the partial inverse is a finite impulse response
   model and therefore is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable. Second,
   we examine a closed-loop approach that uses an infinite impulse response
   model. We demonstrate both methods on several illustrative examples.}},

   filtering error system obtained from augmenting the original LPV system

   to guarantee the system stability and a prescribed level of the induced
   energy-to-energy gain (or H-infinity norm) from the disturbance input to
   the estimation error. To this end, we employ the concept of lifting to
   derive an equivalent discrete-time LPV system. The discretizing method
   using the lifting approach is such that it would preserve the H-infinity
   norm. The viability of the proposed design method to cope with variable
   sampling rates will be shown through numerical examples, where reliable

Abstract = {{This paper describes the process of creating a
   computationally-inexpensive yet relatively accurate atmospheric
   environment model for use in stochastic optimal control problems for
   glider flight management. In such problems, estimates of transition
   probabilities between flight in updrafts, downdrafts and thermals of
   varying strength are needed. This work proposes an atmospheric
   environment model that predicts updraft and downdraft strengths in a
   given region and, when combined with existing glider flight data,
   estimates thermal locations and strengths. The resultant predictions can
   be utilized to compute the desired transition probabilities. A simple
   approach currently employed in flight simulator games is adapted for
   updraft and downdraft modeling. The method is empirical and requires the
   computation of a linear factor. Interestingly, when validated against
   actual flight data, this technique is 92.4 percent accurate on average.
   This paper also shows that the location and intensity of thermals can be
   deduced from flight data by utilizing updraft and downdraft predictions.
   The work then illustrates the modeling process for a sample
   topographical area, and utilizes the model to solve a stochastic drift
   counteraction optimal control problem where control policies that
   maximize glider flight range are generated.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced manning requirements and other cost reducing measures have
   spurred interest in automation of engineering plants onboard naval
   combat vessels. Furthermore, automation may increase resiliency of
   shipboard engineering plants when compared to the current generation of
   manually configured plants. This paper presents a control algorithm and
   deployment strategy which supervises a ship's chilled water plant to
   control the temperature of thermal loads (e.g., air chillers, electrical
   components). Redundant computation and communication capabilities
   motivates the use of an agent-based controller (ABC) enabled through a
   peer-to-peer wireless network. In the architecture presented, each agent
   sits on one or more digraphs corresponding to the utility generated by
   the fluid exiting the chilled water plant at each discharge point. Each
   digraph is a component of the decentralized model-predictive controller
   (MPC). Performance of the proposed control architecture is tested in
   simulation, and is shown to approach the performance of an effective,
   but computationally exhaustive, centralized MPC.}},

Abstract = {{Air charge estimation is an essential task for gasoline engine control,
   as its performance determines that of the air-fuel-ratio control and
   torque control, thereby dictating the fuel economy and emissions of the
   vehicle. While the problem of air charge estimation has been addressed
   by the automotive and control communities for many years, assuring
   adaptivity and robustness of air charge estimation continues to be a
   challenge, especially as performance requirements become more stringent.
   In this paper, we propose a new air system model based on Support Vector
   Regression (SVR). The model leads to a new parameterization which
   facilitates effective adaptation with simple update laws. Simulation and
   experiment results demonstrate its real-time implementation performance,
   computational efficiency, and calibration simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers an on-line approach to reducing engine fuel
   consumption in a series hybrid electric vehicle operated under power
   smoothing strategy, in which the generator power is slowly varying. An
   optimization algorithm adjusts the engine speed set-point (and other
   engine actuator settings as appropriate) on-line, as the vehicle is
   driven. The actual generator power is estimated, and the battery power
   output is adjusted to ensure that the wheel power and the drivability
   are unaffected. With this approach, operating points on the optimal
   operating line (OOL) can be learned during vehicle driving thus
   compensating for the effects of the engine aging and variability while
   reducing upfront calibration time and effort. In the paper, the control
   approach is defined and an optimization algorithm is examined.
   Simulation results are reported.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a dynamic programming (DP) based framework for
   simultaneously optimizing the charging and power management of a plug-in
   hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). These two optimal control problems
   relate to activities of the PHEV on the electric grid (i.e., charging)
   and on the road (i.e., power management). The proposed framework solves
   these two problems simultaneously in order to avoid the loss of
   optimality resulting from solving them separately. The framework
   furnishes optimal trajectories of the PHEV states and control inputs
   over a 24-hour period. We demonstrate the framework for 24-hour
   scenarios with two driving trips and different power grid generation
   mixes. The results show that addressing the above optimization problems
   simultaneously can elucidate valuable insights for certain combinations
   of daily driving scenarios, grid generation mixes, and optimization
   objectives. For example, in one of the cases considered, the grid
   produces higher CO2 per unit energy between 3AM and 8AM. This causes the
   optimal PHEV state and control input trajectory to refrain from
   completely charging the PHEV's battery in the early morning, and
   judiciously combine electricity and gasoline while driving. The paper's
   main contribution to the literature is a framework that makes it
   possible to evaluate tradeoffs such as this one.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of various battery models we use
   neutron imaging which is a non-destructive in situ measurement technique
   that has been successfully used to track the migration of lithium
   between the anode and cathode electrode layers during battery operation.
   In this work we extend the previous results, acquired during steady
   state conditions, by studying the transient behavior of the lithium
   concentration distribution across the electrode during charging and
   discharging. The thermal neutron beam-line at the National Institute for
   Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research was used to
   measure the Lithium concentration in an operating Lithium Iron Phosphate
   (LFP) pouch cell battery with typical commercial electrodes. A
   stroboscopic imaging technique was developed to generate images with
   longer effective exposure time, increasing the signal to noise ratio and
   enabling measurement of changes in lithium concentration during high
   power transients. The measurement of the solid phase lithium
   concentration distribution across the electrode for high rate (7.5C /
   3C) short duration (20-40s) pulses are compared with the simulated
   distributions from a commercial battery simulation software package
   using the same experimental conditions.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an iterative method for determining control
   trajectories for systems subject to state and control constraints. By
   maximizing in the Lagrange multiplier, or dual variable, as opposed to
   minimizing in the control, or primal variable, consistent updating sets
   are determined to converge upon the optimal solution. The method is
   applied to the control of damping forces in an equipment isolation
   system subjected to constraints imposed by the physical implementation
   of a particular controllable damper. Control trajectories are designed
   to minimize peak total response accelerations when the system is excited
   by a pulse-like acceleration at the base. Potential parameterized
   feedback control laws are deduced from optimal control trajectories for
   different excitation frequencies. Performance metrics are compared
   between the proposed method and a passively damped system for a
   single-degree-of-freedom isolation system.}},

Abstract = {{During combustion mode switches, between homogeneous charge compression
   ignition (HCCI) and spark ignition (SI) combustion, the engine will
   operate at throttled and stoichiometric conditions where high cyclic
   variability (CV) is typically observed. To analyze and eventually model
   the engine behavior at the high CV condition we perform measurements on
   a four-cylinder HCCI engine with negative valve overlap and describe a
   cycle-resolved analysis method that enables the characterization of
   cycle-to-cycle variations at such conditions.
   The dynamic behavior observed is characterized by the recycling of
   thermal and chemical energy between cycles. We quantify the cyclic
   exchange and relate it to the dynamic patterns that emerge from this
   high CV condition. We also clarify the contributions of the spark at
   these conditions, where advancing the spark can significantly reduce the
   variability. It is our conclusion that the dynamic patterns observed can
   be characterized by the cycle-resolved combustion efficiency as it is an
   essential non-linearity in the dynamic evolution.}},

Abstract = {{A control strategy designed to track desired combustion phasing for a
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine during large load
   transitions is presented in this work. Three inputs are controlled,
   namely valve timings, fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing.
   The valve and fuel injection timings are manipulated to track combustion
   phasing using a mid-ranging control strategy. A fuel governor is then
   added on to the compensated system to modify the fuel injection amount
   by enforcing pointwise-in-time actuator constraints.
   The fuel governor is shown to improve the transient response of
   combustion phasing and load during large load transitions, when the
   possibility of future constraint violations exists. The use of the fuel
   governor during large load reductions can prevent engine misfire.
   Moreover, the fuel governor strategy simplifies the overall controller
   design by decoupling the phasing controller from the constraint
   enforcing mechanism. System complexity is reduced by approximating the
   nonlinear fuel governor as a set of linear algebraic expressions. This
   is solved with very little computational overhead and without incurring
   a significant loss in performance, as presented in simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, predictive control of a spark ignition engine equipped
   with an electronic throttle and a variable cam timing actuator is
   considered. The objective is to adjust the throttle angle and the engine
   cam timing in order to reduce the exhaust gas emissions while
   maintaining fast and monotonic transient engine torque response. To this
   end, using a mean-value nonlinear model for the air intake system of the
   engine, a receding horizon control scheme based on a flexible control
   Lyapunov function is developed. The proposed control scheme can adjust
   the throttle plate angle and the cam timing to provide a fast and
   monotonic air flow response into the engine cylinders, while explicitly
   taking into account constraints. Compared to a previous parameter
   governor controller, the simulation results show that the proposed
   solution provides better performance in terms of settling time.
   Moreover, the computational complexity of the algorithm is compatible
   with current electronic control units, despite using a full nonlinear
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on control of aggregate power of an ensemble of
   thermostatically-controlled-loads (TCLs) have been concentrated on
   shifting the temperature set points of each TCL in the population. A
   sudden shift in the set point, however, is known to be associated with
   undesirable power oscillations which require closed-loop control
   strategies to regulate the aggregate power consumption of the
   population. In this article, we propose a new approach which we term as
   a ``safe protocol{''} to implement the shift in temperature set point.
   It is shown analytically and verified numerically that by shifting the
   set point ``safely{''} the aggregate power consumption can be changed to
   a different value within a time frame of the order of a TCL's cycle
   duration and avoid the undesired oscillations seen otherwise in a
   ``sudden{''} shift. We discuss how the excess aggregate energy
   transferred under a safe shift in the set point could potentially
   mitigate the burden due to abnormal energy generation within a short
   time span.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing concerns about energy security and reliability are
   intensifying the military's interest in the microgrid technology. This
   paper focuses on the frequency and voltage regulation part of a case
   study that seeks to design a conceptual military microgrid that has to
   operate completely autonomously. This microgrid comprises a solar panel
   and vehicles as power sources, where the vehicles contain a battery and
   generator, and managing their power setpoints is the control problem of
   interest. The goal is to investigate the validity of assuming the
   battery as a constant voltage source during the control design. To this
   end, the control design is first carried out assuming the battery as a
   constant voltage source. It is then illustrated how critical this
   assumption can be depending on the battery internal resistance. The
   results show that the battery internal resistance can affect both
   frequency and voltage regulation performances, thereby highlighting the
   coupling between the battery characteristics and control design, and the
   need for a control design framework that takes this coupling into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops further the network reference governor, which is a
   predictive algorithm for modifying commands sent to the remote system to
   satisfy state and control constraints. Due to the network communication,
   the governor must account for a delay that can be time-varying and
   unknown. The paper summarizes the results on network reference governor
   theory, and demonstrate its operation on a case study of a attitude
   control of a spacecraft with a very flexible appendage, where the
   commands are transmitted remotely over a network to the spacecraft, and
   hence delayed by a bounded, unknown delay. In this case study, the
   reference governor ensures that the elastic deflections of the appendage
   and the control signal satisfy the imposed limits while the spacecraft
   performs a reorientation maneuver. The paper then presents the novel
   theoretical construction of a less conservative network reference
   governor for the case when the delay is long but only slowly
   time-varying, with known bounds on the rate of change. A spacecraft
   relative motion control example with constraints on thrust and Line Of
   Sight (LoS) cone positioning is considered to illustrate these
   theoretical developments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a methodology, based on stochastic dynamic
   programming, for developing a control policy that prescribes vehicle
   speed to minimize on average a weighted sum of fuel consumption and
   travel time, while travelling along the same route or a set of routes in
   a given geographic area. Given the current road grade, traffic speed and
   vehicle speed, the control policy prescribes an offset in vehicle speed
   relative to current traffic speed, which when added to the predicted
   value of traffic speed, gives a vehicle speed set point for an adaptive
   cruise control system. It is shown that transition probability matrices
   necessary to generate the control policy can be constructed from
   gathered data. A virtual testing environment based on CarSim is used for
   simulations that can effectively handle vehicle following and adaptive
   cruise control scenarios. Comparative fuel savings are shown to depend
   on time of travel (off-peak hours or rush hour) and traffic assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a model-based control design for a solid oxide fuel
   cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) combined cycle system. One-step ahead
   predictive control is formulated to (1) meet the power demand
   effectively, (2) handle the multiple constraints of the hybrid system,
   and (3) minimize the fuel consumption. An SOFC/GT control strategy with
   two sequential optimization loops is proposed. The primary controller is
   designed to achieve the system net power, the targeted fuel utilization,
   and high fuel economy by manipulating the fuel cell current and the
   anode fuel flow rate. The secondary controller minimizes the fuel cell
   temperature variation during transients by adjusting the generator load.
   Simulation results show that the control strategy is capable of
   achieving fast load transitions while maintaining the fuel utilization
   within the feasible range. The one-step ahead prediction control is
   shown to provide the benefits of on-line optimization without incurring
   large computation burden.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the disturbance response for a heterogeneous
   string of harmonic oscillators. We assume the individual controllers can
   communicate with a limited range of neighbors and be tuned
   independently. Motivated by the speed-dependent spacing policy in
   vehicle platooning, we develop an extension of the concept of time
   headway for oscillator systems. Using fundamental limitations theory, we
   derive a lower bound on the peak magnitude response of the transfer
   function that describes how a disturbance applied to the lead oscillator
   propagates along the string to produce a response in the last
   oscillator. We then give sufficient conditions for string instability in
   terms of the separation policy, communication ranges, certain time
   domain performance specifications, and bandwidth limitations.}},

Abstract = {{In applications involving time-varying systems, the state dynamics
   matrix is often not known in advance. To address this problem, this
   paper investigates the effectiveness of a forward-in-time Riccati-based
   control law. This approach is motivated by the fact that the optimal
   state estimator is based on a forward-in-time Riccati-based solution
   that does not require advance knowledge of the system dynamics. In this
   paper we show that a forward-in-time Riccati-based control law
   stabilizes the system if the dynamics of the quasi-dual system are
   asymptotically stable. This property holds if the closed-loop dynamics
   are symmetric, and, for some plants, is achieved by dynamics with
   sufficiently fast time variation. In addition, using a separation
   principal type result, we guarantee closed-loop stability in the case of
   output feedback.}},

Abstract = {{This letter describes the performance characteristics of single-layer
   1-D periodic resonant structures embedded in a metal-backed substrate.
   Such structures are known to behave as an electromagnetic band-gap (EBG)
   layer that can suppress the dominant substrate mode. For short distances
   in thin substrates, it is shown that the dominant TM0odd with a zero
   cutoff frequency can be approximated by a TEM wave inside and in the
   vicinity of the thin substrate. The propagation of this TEM wave is then
   modeled by an equivalent transmission-line model. The effect of the
   resonant EBG structure on the wave propagation in the equivalent
   transmission-line model is taken into consideration by modeling the EBG
   structure in terms of an equivalent LC circuit and establishing the
   proper electric and magnetic mutual couplings between the circuit LC and
   the transmission-line model. The performance of the equivalent circuit
   model is compared to the full-wave simulation of the actual structure,
   and a very good agreement is shown.}},

Title = {{Distance-Based Dynamic Pricing Strategy for Managed Toll Lanes}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2283}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Abstract = {{Congestion in highway networks inflicts economic and emotional stress on
   drivers and a considerable cost to society. To mitigate some of these
   effects, managed toll lanes are being designed and built in the United
   States. These managed toll lanes guarantee to drivers that they will be
   able to travel at free-flow speed during peak hours when the general
   lanes are congested. The strategy used to price tolls on managed toll
   lanes has become an important issue; however, few studies have focused
   on dynamic optimal pricing strategies. This paper formulates the pricing
   problem on the basis of a stochastic macroscopic traffic flow. model and
   investigates the methodology used to find a pricing strategy to maximize
   the total expected revenue. A simulation-based numerical algorithm that
   obtains the optimal prices efficiently in real time is proposed. The
   methodology is also applicable and readily adjusted for other objective
   purposes of administrators, such as maximization of total throughput.
   The general pricing model developed in this paper is not limited to one
   specific underlying traffic flow model and is readily adapted to other
   macroscopic traffic models, such as the classical
   Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous theoretical models have been developed to predict the fatigue
   strength reduction factor (also known as fatigue notch factor), an
   important parameter in fatigue life prediction of notched components.
   These models include: the classical average stress method, the fracture
   mechanics method, the stress field intensity method, the strain energy
   method, and the weakest link method. However, most of these methods do
   not incorporate explicit sensitivity to materials microstructure.
   Accordingly, notch sensitivity remains a highly empirical subject in
   spite of significant advances in microstructure-sensitive modeling. This
   paper gives a detailed literature review of these methods and addresses
   their limitations. It also discusses a recently developed probabilistic
   method for microstructure-sensitive fatigue notch factor. The
   probabilistic method provides a very strong physical basis for fatigue
   strength reduction and associated notch sensitivity; thus it can be used
   to determine the effect of notches on reduction of fatigue resistance in
   a way that directly incorporates microstructure. The results obtained
   using the new probabilistic framework and other conventional methods are
   compared with experimental data for notched components. The
   probabilistic framework gives better correlation with experimental
   results for the notch sensitivity and notch size effect than the
   conventional approaches including the Neuber's, the Peterson, and the
   fracture mechanics methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with an alternative approach to density and sensitivity
   filtering based on the solution of the linear heat conduction equation
   which is proposed for eliminating checkerboard patterns and mesh
   dependence in topology optimization problems. In order to guarantee the
   existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution of PDE, Neumann
   boundary conditions are introduced. With the help of the existing
   computational framework of FEM, boundary points have been extended to
   satisfy Neumann boundary conditions, and together with finite difference
   method to solve this initial boundary value. In order to guarantee the
   stability, stability factor is introduced to control the deviation for
   the solution of the finite difference method. Then the filtering
   technique is directly applied to the design variables and the design
   sensitivities, respectively. Especially, different from previous methods
   based on convolution operation, filtering iteration is employed to
   ensure the function to eliminate numerical instability When the value of
   stability factor is changed at setting range, the number of times of
   filtering is manually corresponding set. At last, using different test
   examples in 2D show the advantage and effectiveness of filtering
   iteration of the new filter method in compared with previous filter

Abstract = {{Elastomers are polymers able to undergo large, reversible deformations,
   and their mechanical properties depend on the chemistry of individual
   chains as well as the topology of the crosslinked network. In this work
   we analyze the connection between micro-scale network structure and the
   macroscopic mechanical properties by performing molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations using the Kremer \& Grest bead-spring model. The chain
   length and the density at which crosslinking is performed are varied in
   order to produce systems ranging from cfosslinkdominated to highly
   entangled, and stress-stretch results are obtained via MD in the large
   deformation regime. In analogy with recent work on social,
   technological, and biological networks, we apply mathematical graph
   theory to describe elastomer networks in a multi-scale modeling
   framework. A matrix formulation of crosslinked polymers is presented and
   applied in order to identify the network structure resulting from both
   chemical crosslinks and physical crosslinks (entanglements). We show
   that spectral analysis of the crosslink and chain, entanglement
   adjacency matrices along with the corresponding degree distributions can
   be used to identify and differentiate between the different materials.
   The spectrum of the crosslink adjacency matrix resembles a sparse
   regular graph, and spectrum of the intermolecular chain entanglement
   matrix for the highly entangled systems is shown to resemble a random
   graph; however, deviations are noted which require further study. A
   comparison of the network properties with the stress-stretch response
   demonstrates the influence of both crosslinks and entanglements on the
   large deformation mechanical behavior of an elastomer material.}},

Abstract = {{Automotive cylinder block bulkheads were obtained from two aluminum

   these materials. The fatigue strengths were measured via a staircase
   protocol using cylindrical round bars. These values were similar to
   20-30\% lower than previously measured data where an hour-glass fatigue
   sample geometry was used. A model to predict the fatigue life and
   strength (at a given number of cycles) was developed and revealed that
   the hour-glass geometry had a predisposition to higher fatigue strengths
   due to the lower probability of sampling a casting pore local to the
   region with minimum radius and highest stress. It was concluded that
   previous fatigue data on the bulkhead materials were inflated due to the
   choice in fatigue specimen geometry. More conservative values, which
   better represent the expected material behavior and intrinsic fatigue
   resistance, were obtained using the cylindrical bar geometry.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the fabrication of GaAs thin-film solar cells on plastic
   substrate by combining epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and cold weld bonding. A
   lattice-matched epitaxial protection layer is employed to preserve the
   wafer surface during the ELO process to enable multiple reuses of the
   parent wafer. For the removal of protection layer and contaminants from
   ELO process, we have developed a unique pre-cleaning process.
   Combination of these technologies enables 1) the fabrication of light
   weight, flexible thin-film GaAs solar cells, 2) a transfer process that
   cold-weld bonds the GaAs epi-cell onto an accepting plastic foil
   substrate, and 3) the multiple growths from a single parent substrate
   the requires no destructive mechanical polishing process. The morphology
   and chemistry of the GaAs substrate surface after ELO simulation and
   protection-layer removal are compared to those of the original substrate
   using atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, x-ray
   photoelectron spectrometry and reflection high energy electron
   diffraction. The regrown epitaxial film quality is investigated by
   Hall-effect and photoluminescence measurements, and cross-sectional
   transmission electron microscopy. We show that p-n junction GaAs solar
   cells grown on original and reused wafers have power conversion
   efficiencies of similar to 23\%, under simulated AM1.5G illumination.
   The ability to perform multiple growths from a single parent wafer
   promises to dramatically reduce production costs for high power
   conversion efficiency GaAs solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{The high efficiency predicted for solar cells based on multi-photon
   processes relies on the assumption of optical transitions with
   non-overlapping spectral bands. Spectral overlap reduces the conversion
   efficiency due to energy loss associated with improper usage of higher
   energy photons for lower energy optical transitions. In this study,
   device structures with non-uniform occupation of intermediate electronic
   states are proposed to reduce the dependence of conversion efficiency on
   spectral overlap. Solar cell conversion efficiencies are calculated for
   structures where absorption bands are spatially decoupled due to defined
   occupation of intermediate states. Conversion efficiencies for a two
   section and three section device with spectral overlap of 4 eV are
   determined to be 52.8 \% and 61.5 \%, respectively, and are
   significantly larger than the calculated efficiency of 35.1\% for the
   case of a standard multi-photon cell with uniform half-filled
   intermediate states The spectrally-decoupled device provides a means to
   achieve high theoretical efficiency independent of spectral overlap that
   approaches the detailed balance efficiency limit of 63.2 \% for
   intermediate state devices without spectral overlap and 63.8 \% for
   unconstrained triple-junction tandem cells.}},

Abstract = {{Two misconceptions have been plaguing the electronic design automation
   (EDA) industry for decades: i) EDA solutions scale to larger
   complexities at an insufficient rate to keep pace with improvements in

   developments, the growth of EDA as an industry is bounded by the growth
   of the semiconductor industry.
   With this paper we address these misconceptions and we argue that they
   can both be overcome. To this end, we overview a number of initial
   studies highlighting possible directions that EDA can pursue to (i)
   break off from its traditional ways of scaling solutions and
   applications to larger complexity, that is, by developing better
   heuristics for its complex algorithms. (ii) We also discuss alternative
   domains where EDA technology can be applied, beyond that of silicon
   design, so that the semiconductor industry is no longer the limit of EDA
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a
   wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and
   prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements
   and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (soil moisture
   temporal evolution). In this paper we explore results from the
   compressive sensing (CS) literature and examine their applicability to
   this problem. Our main challenge lies in the selection of two matrices,
   the measurement matrix and a representation basis. The physical
   constraints of our problem make it highly non-trivial to select these
   matrices, so that the latter can sufficient sparsify the underlying
   signal while at the same time be sufficiently incoherent with the
   former, two common pre-conditions for CS techniques to work well. We
   construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil
   moisture evolution. We show that this basis attains very good tradeoff
   between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with
   measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints.
   Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real,
   high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data, and through
   comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results
   demonstrate that our approach is extremely effective in reconstructing
   the soil moisture process with high accuracy and low sampling rate.}},

Abstract = {{This poster presents a distributed reference-free fault detection
   algorithm which is based on local pair-wise verification. We show there
   exist a linear relationship between the output of any pair of sensors if
   the system excitations can be aggregated as a single system input. Using
   this relationship, faulty sensors suffering from sparse spike errors can
   be identified with high accuracy by our algorithm. An appealing feature
   of our method is that existence of reference sensors and knowledge of
   system input are not required. preliminary performance analysis shows
   that the algorithm is scalable, robust and able to detect most of the
   faults exist in the sensors. Communication power is also greatly reduced
   by the distributed nature of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we expose the challenges of interfacing both conventional
   and new systems with an extremely resource constrained platform. We find

   We present a functional 0.4mm x 0.8mm ARM Cortex MO with 3KB of RAM, 24
   GPIOs, and an ultra-low power I2C interface. This chip is part of the
   Michigan Micro Mote (M3) project, which is designed to build a complete

Abstract = {{We study the problem of augmenting battery-powered sensornet trees with
   energy-harvesting leaf nodes. Our results show that leaf nodes that are
   smaller in size than today's typical battery-powered sensors can harvest
   enough energy from ambient sources to acquire and transmit sensor
   readings every minute, even under poor lighting conditions. However,
   achieving this functionality, especially as leaf nodes scale in size,
   requires new platforms, protocols, and programming. Platforms must be
   designed around low-leakage operation, offer a richer power supply
   control interface for system software, and employ an unconventional
   energy storage hierarchy. Protocols must not only be low-power, but they
   must also become low-energy, which affects initial and ongoing
   synchronization, and periodic communications. Systems programming, and
   especially bootup and communications, must become low-latency, by
   eliminating conservative timeouts and startup dependencies, and
   embracing high-concurrency. Applying these principles, we show that
   robust, indoor, perpetual sensing is viable using off-the-shelf
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{Structure from motion (SFM) aims at jointly recovering the structure of
   a scene as a collection of 3D points and estimating the camera poses
   from a number of input images. In this paper we generalize this concept:
   not only do we want to recover 3D points, but also recognize and
   estimate the location of high level semantic scene components such as
   regions and objects in 3D. As a key ingredient for this joint inference
   problem, we seek to model various types of interactions between scene
   components. Such interactions help regularize our solution and obtain
   more accurate results than solving these problems in isolation.
   Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that: 1) our framework
   estimates camera poses more robustly than SFM algorithms that use points
   only; 2) our framework is capable of accurately estimating pose and
   location of objects, regions, and points in the 3D scene; 3) our
   framework recognizes objects and regions more accurately than
   state-of-the-art single image recognition methods.}},

   the technological capacity to perform tasks beyond their intended

   researchers to attempt increasingly challenging tasks on mobile devices

   this work we present a novel multi-frame object detection application
   for the mobile platform that is capable of object localization. Our work
   leverages the hough forest based object detector introduced by Gall et
   al. in {[}10]. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our novel,
   multi-frame generalization of {[}10] notably improves the detection
   performance. We test the performance of the technique in variable
   resolutions, the applicability to several object categories and
   different datasets. We implement the multi-frame detector on a mobile
   platform through a novel client-server framework that presents a sound
   and viable environment for the multi-frame detector. Finally, we study
   implementations of both single and multi-frame object detectors based on
   this client-server framework on a mobile device running the android OS.}},

   identifying their 3D poses; iii) characterizing the geometrical and
   topological properties of the objects in terms of their aspect
   configurations in 3D. We call such characterization an object's aspect
   layout (see Fig. 1). We propose a new model for solving these problems
   in a joint fashion from a single image for object categories. Our model
   is constructed upon a novel framework based on conditional random fields
   with maximal margin parameter estimation. Extensive experiments are
   conducted to evaluate our model's performance in determining object pose
   and layout from images. We achieve superior viewpoint accuracy results

Title = {{Computational modeling of pyrolysis and combustion in a fixed-bed waste

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{949-970}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a three-dimensional
   CFD model that simulates the pyrolysis, combustion and heat transfer
   phenomena in a refuse-derived fuel (RDF) gasifier. Correlations between
   different operation conditions and the waste stack morphology are also
   investigated. Parametric studies are conducted to optimize operating
   conditions to achieve an even stac c surface minimal the local oxidation
   in the waste stack.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a Lagrangian pyrolysis
   submodel which can be applied to determine the local pyrolysis rate and
   porosity field by introducing the local characteristic diameter of the
   waste solid sphere. The flow field is described by a single-phase porous
   flow model using the SIMPLE algorithm with momentum extrapolation. A
   one-step global reaction was adapted for the chemical reactions inside
   the gasifier.
   Findings - Computational results produced three-dimensional distribution
   of the flow field, temperature, species concentration, porosity and the
   morphology of the waste stack under different operation conditions. Some
   parametric studies were conducted to assess the effects of the inlet
   temperature and the feeding rate on the waste stack shape. The results
   demonstrated that the model can properly capture the essential physical
   and chemical processes in the gasifier and thus can be used as a
   predictive simulation tool.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the lack of accurate reaction
   rate information, the computational results have not been directly
   compared against experimental data. Additional refinement and subsequent
   validation against prototype gasifier experiment will be reported in
   future work.
   Originality/value - A full three-dimensional computational model is
   developed for the complex two phase flow based on porous medium
   representation of the solid stack. A Lagrangian pyrolysis model based on
   the characteristic diameter of the solid waste material was proposed to
   describe the pyrolysis rate history. The developed model reproduces
   correct physical and chemical behavior inside gasifier with adequate
   computational efficiency and accuracy.}},

   predict the phase accumulation of THz signals travelling through each
   arm of the MZI with various sample loadings. HFSS simulation is
   performed as verification of the theoretical analysis. It is
   demonstrated that when compared with single-armed SSPP waveguide, the
   MZI structure shows significant shift of the transmission maxima and
   minima when different DNA samples are loaded, as well as remarkably
   elevated qualify factors for the transmission peaks. This structure can
   be potentially used in applications such as tag-free genetic molecular
   sensing. The highly localized E-M field at frequencies close to SSPP
   resonance is shown to be beneficial as it may reduce the sample amount
   needed without affecting the selectivity of the sensing structure}},

Abstract = {{Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an emerging technology that is
   providing the next advance in modeling and systems engineering. MBSE
   uses Systems Modeling Language (SysML) as its modeling language. SysML
   is a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering used to
   specify, analyze, design, optimize, and verify systems.
   An MBSE Challenge project was established to model a hypothetical
   FireSat satellite system to evaluate the suitability of SysML for
   describing space systems. Although much was learned regarding modeling
   of this system, the fictional nature of the FireSat system precluded
   anyone from actually building the satellite. Thus, the practical use of
   the model could not be demonstrated or verified.
   This paper reports on using MBSE and SysML to model a standard CubeSat
   and applying that model to an actual CubeSat mission, the Radio Aurora
   Explorer (RAX) mission, developed by the Michigan Exploration Lab (MXL)
   and SRI International.}},

Title = {{A Transponder-Based, Nonradiative Wireless Power Transfer}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1150-1153}},
Abstract = {{A transponder-based system is proposed for wireless nonradiative power
   transfer. The system consists of three elements: a transmitter, a
   receiving loop, and a transponder at a fixed distance from the
   transmitter. The transmitter and the transponder are made of concentric,
   reactively loaded wire loops. One loop of the transmitter is directly
   fed by a power source, while its remaining loops and those of the
   transponder act as parasitic loops. The reactive impedances of the
   parasitic loops comprising the transmitter and transponder are chosen to
   maximize power transfer from the source to the receiving loop. The
   equivalence of the system with a two-port network is used to derive the
   required reactive impedances. A conjugate impedance match is applied to
   both input and output ports of the equivalent two-port network for
   maximum power transfer. The proposed transponder-based scheme overcomes
   the monotonic decay of efficiency with distance that is seen in
   classical wireless power transfer systems. An improvement in efficiency
   exceeding 50\% is achieved at larger distances when compared to similar
   systems without a transponder.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3D) cell culture in functional scaffolds to mimic the
   cell natural growth state is important for the construction of cell
   based implants in vitro for tissue engineering applications. Herein, we
   report a novel fluffy polypyrrole (PPy) fibrous scaffold (fluffy-PPy
   scaffold) fabricated by means of an improved electrospinning process
   combined with in situ surface polymerization, in which PPy hollow fibers
   are discrete from one another with deep interconnected pores of similar
   to 100 mu m. This unique spatial structure permits the easy entry of
   cells into the fluffy-PPy scaffold with no extra help to achieve
   complicated 3D cell culture methodologies. The cell proliferation and
   morphology of cardiomyocytes (as a model cell) cultured in the
   fluffy-PPy scaffold were tested over a 3 day culture period. Evidence
   was provided that cardiomyocytes entered into the interior of the
   fluffy-PPy scaffold and formed stable cell-fiber constructs, and the
   rate of cell proliferation was higher than that on a traditional
   electrospun PPy fibrous mesh (mesh-PPy scaffold) and tissue culture
   plates (TCP). These results demonstrate that the fluffy-PPy scaffold not
   only achieved 3D cell culture, but also resulted in increased cell
   proliferation. Therefore, we suggest that the fluffy-PPy scaffold may be
   an appropriate choice as a functional scaffold capable of supporting 3D
   cell culture in the field of cardiac tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid, quantitative detection of cell-secreted biomarker proteins with a
   low sample volume holds great promise to advance cellular
   immunophenotyping techniques for personalized diagnosis and treatment of
   infectious diseases. Here we achieved such an assay with the THP-1 human
   acute moncytic leukemia cell line (a model for human monocyte) using a
   highly integrated microfluidic platform incorporating a no-wash
   bead-based chemiluminescence immunodetection scheme. Our microfluidic
   device allowed us to stimulate cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
   which is an endotoxin causing septic shock due to severely pronounced
   immune response of the human body, under a well-controlled on-chip
   environment. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secreted from
   stimulated THP-1 cells was subsequently measured within the device with
   no flushing process required. Our study achieved high-sensitivity
   cellular immunophenotyping with 20-fold fewer cells than current
   cell-stimulation assay. The total assay time was also 7 times shorter
   than that of a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Our strategy of monitoring immune cell functions in situ using a
   microfluidic platform could impact future medical treatments of acute
   infectious diseases and immune disorders by enabling a rapid,
   sample-efficient cellular immunophenotyping analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents wafer sequencing problems considering perceived
   chamber conditions and maintenance activities in a single cluster tool
   through the simulation-based optimization method. We develop
   optimization methods which would lead to the best wafer release policy
   in the chamber tool to maximize the overall yield of the wafers in

   jeopardize wafer yields, chamber maintenance is taken into account for
   the wafer sequence decision-making process. Furthermore, genetic
   algorithm is modified for solving the scheduling problems in this paper.
   As results, it has been shown that job scheduling has to be managed

   maximize overall wafer yield.}},

Abstract = {{There are a variety of imaging modalities that record a sequence of
   measurements where the sensor and/or the objects in the scene aremoving
   and the goal is to reconstruct an image without motion blur. Examples
   include multi-frame super-resolution problems and motion-compensated
   image reconstruction problems in medical imaging. Various methods have
   been proposed for such applications, often in the context of specific
   imaging modalities. However, many such methods can be formulated in a
   common framework and thus solved by the same optimization method. To
   solve the reconstruction problem efficiently, the optimization method
   must be designed carefully.
   This paper proposes a novel approach to solve multi-frame image
   reconstruction problems more efficiently. We use a variable-splitting
   technique to dissociate the original problem into a few simpler problems
   that are then solved individually using an alternating minimization
   method. The proposed method is amenable to preconditioning,
   parallelization, and application of block iterative algorithms to the
   sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate that even with simple
   diagonal or circulant preconditioners, the proposed method converges
   faster than the conjugate gradient (CG) method.}},

   generally used to characterize an acoustic environment. Acoustic
   reverberation depends on the shape and the composition of a room,

   process. Inconsistencies in the acoustic environment traces can be used
   in a forensic and ballistic settings and acoustic environment
   identification (AEI). We describe a statistical framework to
   characterize recording environment. The proposed scheme uses inverse
   filtering to estimate reverberation component and particle filtering to
   estimate background noise from audio recording. A multi-class support
   vector machine (SVM) classifier is used for AEI. Experimental results
   show that the proposed system can successfully identify a recording

Abstract = {{We consider a matched subspace detection problem where a signal vector
   residing in an unknown low-rank k subspace is to be detected using a
   subspace estimate obtained from noisy signal-bearing training data with
   missing entries. The resulting subspace estimate is inaccurate due to
   limited training data, missing entries, and additive noise. Recent
   results from random matrix theory (RMT) precisely quantify these
   subspace estimation errors for the setting where the signal has low
   coherence. We analytically quantify the ROC performance of the resulting
   plug-in detector and derive a new detector which explicitly accounts for
   these subspace estimation errors. The realized increase in performance
   can be attributed to the new detector only using the k(eff) <= k
   ``informative{''} signal subspace components. The fraction of observed
   entries determines k(eff) via a simple relationship that we describe.
   Detection performance better than random guessing is only achievable
   when the percent of observed data is above a critical threshold which we
   explicitly characterize.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop an adaptive learning algorithm which is
   approximately optimal for an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) problem
   with polynomial complexity. In this OSA problem each channel is modeled
   as a two state discrete time Markov chain with a bad state which yields
   no reward and a good state which yields reward. This is known as the
   Gilbert-Elliot channel model and represents variations in the channel
   condition due to fading, primary user activity, etc. There is a user who
   can transmit on one channel at a time, and whose goal is to maximize its
   throughput. Without knowing the transition probabilities and only
   observing the state of the channel currently selected, the user faces a
   partially observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with unknown
   transition structure. In general, learning the optimal policy in this
   setting is intractable. We propose a computationally efficient learning
   algorithm which is approximately optimal for the infinite horizon
   average reward criterion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the delay performance of an opportunistic
   multi-channel medium access control scheme and compare it to that of the
   corresponding single channel MAC scheme. In the opportunistic
   multi-channel MAC scheme, we assume that the pair of sender/receiver is
   able to evaluate the channel quality after a certain amount of channel
   sensing delay and to choose the best one for data communication. We
   consider three settings: (1) an ideal scenario where no control channel
   is needed and no sensing delay is incurred, (2) a more realistic scheme
   where users compete for access on a control channel using random access,
   and (3) a scheme similar to (2) but with a Time Division Multiplex (TDM)
   based access scheme on the control channel. Our analysis show that in
   terms of delay performance, the random access overhead on the control
   channel almost always wipe out the channel diversity gain, which is the
   main motivation behind an opportunistic multi-channel MAC. Using a TDM
   based access scheme on the control channel can help remove this
   bottleneck, but only when channel sensing can be done sufficiently fast.}},

Abstract = {{Clutter is a key concern in the design of complex displays, particularly
   in safety- critical domains such as aviation. The objective of this
   research was to investigate techniques for measuring subjective
   perceptions of clutter and to model the predicted impacts of clutter on
   pilot performance within the context of advanced flight deck
   technologies. Six commercial pilots flew simulated approaches under
   varied workload conditions with low-, medium-, and high-clutter head-up
   displays, rating the perceived clutter and subjective mental workload
   associated with each display configuration. Results revealed that
   high-clutter displays produced elevated reports of perceived clutter and
   workload due to information density or redundancy, whereas low-clutter
   displays were perceived as less cluttered but challenging to use due to
   lack of relevant information typically used during flight. A
   multidimensional measure of clutter was found to be more sensitive to
   display differences than an overall perceived rating of clutter, and
   low-level visual display properties were successful in predicting
   clutter perceptions and pilot performance. Finalized products of this
   research could support optimized display design through the
   identification of clutter thresholds and the implementation of clutter
   alerts, decluttering mechanisms, or both, and could be used to support
   display certification and acquisitions processes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the accuracy and validity of subchannel, system, and
   computational fluid dynamics codes, the Paul Scherrer Institut has
   participated in the OECD/NRC PSBT benchmark with the thermal-hydraulic
   system code TRACE5.0 developed by US NRC, the subchannel code FLICA4
   developed by CEA, and the computational fluid dynamic code STAR-CD
   developed by CD-adapco. The PSBT benchmark consists of a series of void
   distribution exercises and departure from nucleate boiling exercises.
   The results reveal that the prediction by the subchannel code FLICA4
   agrees with the experimental data reasonably well in both steady-state
   and transient conditions. The analyses of single-subchannel experiments
   by means of the computational fluid dynamic code STAR-CD with the
   CD-adapco boiling model indicate that the prediction of the void
   fraction has no significant discrepancy from the experiments. The
   analyses with TRACE point out the necessity to perform additional
   assessment of the subcooled boiling model and bulk condensation model of
   TRACE.}},

Abstract = {{Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the process of damage
   identification in mechanical structures that encompasses four main
   phases: damage detection, damage localization, damage extent evaluation
   and prognosis of residual life. Among various existing SHM techniques,
   the one based on electromechanical impedance measurements has been
   considered as one of the most effective, especially in the
   identification of incipient damage. This method measures the variation
   of the electromechanical impedance of the structure as caused by the
   presence of damage by using piezoelectric transducers bonded on the
   surface of the structure (or embedded into it). The most commonly used
   smart material in the context of the present contribution is the lead
   zirconate titanate (PZT). Through these piezoceramic sensor-actuators,
   the electromechanical impedance, which is directly related to the
   mechanical impedance of the structure, is obtained as a frequency domain
   dynamic response. Based on the variation of the impedance signals, the
   presence of damage can be detected. A particular damage metric can be
   used to quantify the damage. For the success of the monitoring
   procedure, the measurement system should be robust enough with respect
   to environmental influences from different sources, in such a way that
   correct and reliable decisions can be made based on the measurements.
   The environmental influences become more critical under certain
   circumstances, especially in aerospace applications, in which extreme
   conditions are frequently encountered. In this paper, the influence of
   electromagnetic radiation, temperature and pressure variations, and
   ionic environment have been examined in laboratory. In this context, the
   major concern is to determine if the impedance responses are affected by
   these influences. In addition, the sensitivity of the method with
   respect to the shape of the PZT patches is evaluated. Conclusions are
   drawn regarding the monitoring efficiency, stability and precision.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feedback controller that allows MABEL, a kneed,
   planar bipedal robot, with 1 m-long legs, to accommodate an abrupt 20 cm
   decrease in ground height. The robot is provided information on neither
   where the step down occurs, nor by how much. After the robot has stepped
   off a raised platform, however, the height of the platform can be
   estimated from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot's
   joints. A real-time control strategy is implemented that uses this
   on-line estimate of step-down height to switch from a baseline
   controller, that is designed for flat-ground walking, to a second
   controller, that is designed to attenuate torso oscillation resulting
   from the step-down disturbance. After one step, the baseline controller
   is re-applied. The control strategy is developed on a simplified-design
   model of the robot and then verified on a more realistic model before
   being evaluated experimentally. The paper concludes with experimental
   results showing MABEL (blindly) stepping off a 20 cm high platform.}},

Abstract = {{A typical unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) mission can be composed of
   various tasks and several alternative paths. Small UGVs commonly rely on
   electric rechargeable batteries for their operations. Since each battery
   has limited energy storage capacity, it is essential to predict the
   expected mission energy requirement during the mission execution and
   update this prediction adaptively via real-time performance
   measurements, e. g., the total battery power required for the mission.
   We proposed and compared two methods in the paper. One is a linear
   regression model built upon the UGV longitudinal dynamics model alone.
   The other is a Bayesian regression model when prior knowledge, e. g.,
   road average grade and operator driving style, is available. In this
   case, the proposed Bayesian prediction can effectively combine the prior
   knowledge with real-time performance measurements for adaptively
   updating the prediction of the mission energy requirement. Our
   comparative simulation studies show that the Bayesian model can yield
   more accurate predictions than the linear regression model, particularly
   during the initial execution stage of a mission.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-fibrous scaffolding mimics aspects of the extracellular matrix to

   scaffolds with features at three different orders of magnitude to be
   formed, which is not easily achieved with other nano-fiber fabrication
   methods. This technique allows for the external shape and internal pore
   structure to be precisely controlled in an easily repeatable manner,
   while the nano-fibrous wall architecture facilitates cellular
   attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of the cells. In this

Abstract = {{One of the most fundamental results in inventory theory is the
   optimality of (s,S) policy for inventory systems with setup cost. This
   result is established under a key assumption of infinite
   ordering/production capacity. Several studies have shown that, when the
   ordering/production capacity is finite, the optimal policy for the
   inventory system with setup cost is very complicated and indeed, only
   partial characterization for the optimal policy is possible. In this
   paper, we consider a continuous review production/inventory system with
   finite capacity and setup cost. The demand follows a Poisson process and
   a demand that cannot be satisfied upon arrival is back-logged. We show
   that the optimal control policy has a very simple structure when the
   holding/shortage cost rate is quasi-convex. We also develop efficient
   algorithms to compute the optimal control parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new speed control model applicable to real-world

   anticipated acceleration reference (AAR) inputs. This addresses combined
   visual anticipation of lateral and longitudinal accelerations for the
   approach to an intersection where both stopping and turning outcomes are
   possible. The relationship between the AAR and the resulting vehicle
   accelerations are studied for both stopping and turning events using
   naturalistic driving data. A closed-loop model is developed, including
   braking to rest when the left turn is not attempted and for the turn and
   exit stages when it is. Parameter ranges are estimated, and as a
   demonstration of model applicability, Monte Carlo simulations are
   conducted to generate representative left turns using a full simulation
   model. Extension of the AAR model to other speed control problems, for
   example, driving on curved roads, is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient parallel algorithm for a new class of
   min-max problems based on the matrix multiplicative weights update
   method. Our algorithm can be used to find near-optimal strategies for
   competitive two-player classical or quantum games in which a referee
   exchanges any number of messages with one player followed by any number
   of additional messages with the other. This algorithm considerably
   extends the class of games which admit parallel solutions, demonstrating
   for the first time the existence of a parallel algorithm for a game in
   which one player reacts adaptively to the other.
   As a consequence, we prove that several competing-provers complexity
   classes collapse to PSPACE such as QRG(2), SQG and two new classes
   called DIP and DQIP. A special case of our result is a parallel
   approximation scheme for a new class of semidefinite programs whose
   feasible region consists of lists of semidefinite matrices that satisfy
   a ``transcript-like{''} consistency condition. Applied to this special
   case, our algorithm yields a direct polynomial-space simulation of
   multi-message quantum interactive proofs resulting in a first-principles
   proof of QIP-PSPACE.}},

Abstract = {{Self-organizing network (SON), which is an essential technology of
   future radio networks, is proposed in the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   specification as a usage case. In this paper, we focus on user equipment
   (UE)'s power control considering interference mitigation and
   retransmission constraints especially for physical random access channel
   (PRACH) of LTE. When a UE initially accesses an evolved-NodeB (eNB), it
   sends a preamble with an initial access level, and raises the power by a
   fixed step whenever the preamble was not detected by the eNB. We present
   an analysis and simulation to study the tradeoff relationship between
   inter-cell interference and retransmission according to the PRACH power
   setting, i.e., the initial target received power and power ramping step,
   assuming Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm
   tracing the optimal power setting that minimizes the resource wastage of
   the cell in consideration and its adjacent cells satisfying the
   constraint of retransmission and failure probability bound.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) perform collaborative distributed sensing
   of a moving object in an environment for the purpose of classification.
   This requires collecting measurements from as many sensors as possible
   to classify the object. However, there is a tradeoff between the value
   of information contained in a distributed set of measurements and the
   energy cost of acquiring these measurements, fusing them into a belief
   and transmitting the updated belief. To manage this tradeoff, sensor
   selection schemes are used. In this paper, the sensor selection scheme
   proceeds as a sequence of rounds as follows. The network chooses an
   active set of sensors at each round based on physical proximity to the
   object. From this set, one sensor is selected by bidding to take a
   measurement. This measurement is transmitted to the sensor selected at
   the next round. The main contribution is to dynamically optimize the
   classification performance for a given cost of sensing, communication
   and computation. The method is illustrated by an example.}},

Abstract = {{Nominally static contacts such as bolted or shrink-fit joints typically
   experience regions of microslip when subjected to oscillatory loading.
   This results in energy dissipation, reflected as apparent hysteretic
   damping of the system, and also may cause the initiation of fretting
   fatigue cracks. Early theoretical studies of the Hertzian contact
   problem by Cattaneo and Mindlin were confirmed experimentally by
   Johnson, who identified signs of fretting damage in the slip annulus
   predicted by the theory.
   For many years, tribologists assumed that Melan's theorem in plasticity
   could be extended to frictional systems - i.e. that if there exists a
   state of residual stress associated with frictional slip that is
   sufficient to prevent periodic slip in the steady state, then the system
   will shake down, regardless of the initial condition. However, we now
   know that this is true only if there is no coupling between the normal
   and tangential loading problems, as will be the case notably when
   contact occurs on a symmetry plane.
   For all other cases, periodic loading scenarios can be devised such that
   shakedown occurs for some initial conditions and not for others. The
   initial condition here might be determined by the assembly protocol -
   e.g. the order in which a set of bolts is tightened - or by the exact
   loading path before the steady cycle is attained. This non-uniqueness of
   the steady state persists at load amplitudes above the shakedown limit,
   in which case there is always some dissipation, but the dissipation per
   cycle (and hence both the effective damping and the susceptibility to
   fretting damage) depends on the initial conditions. This implies that
   fretting fatigue experiments need to follow a well-defined assembly
   protocol if reproducible results are to be obtained. We shall also
   present results showing that when both normal and tangential forces vary
   in time, the energy dissipation is very sensitive to the relative phase
   of the oscillatory components, being greatest when they are out of
   phase.
   With sufficient clamping force, `complete' contacts (i.e. those in which
   the contact area is independent of the normal load) can theoretically be
   prevented from slipping, but on the microscale, all contacts are
   incomplete because of surface roughness and some microslip is
   inevitable. In this case, the local energy dissipation density can be
   estimated from relatively coarse-scale roughness models, based on a
   solution of the corresponding `full stick' problem.}},

   The high-fidelity model accurately represents the system but is not
   easily amenable to trajectory optimization, due to high computational
   cost or due to being of ``black-box{''} type (e.g. Jacobian cannot be
   easily computed or the state is not easily accessible). The low-fidelity
   model is suitable for numerical optimization, but approximates the
   system dynamics with an unknown error. An iterative model and trajectory
   refinement method is proposed to systematically iterate between the two
   models and converge on a solution with efficient execution time.}},
