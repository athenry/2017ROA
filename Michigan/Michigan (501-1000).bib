Abstract = {{Here we present a novel in situ chemical modification process to form
   vertical Schottky diodes using palladium (Pd) rectifying bottom
   contacts, amorphous zinc tin oxide (ZnSnO) semiconductor made via
   acetate-based solution process, and molybdenum top ohmic contacts. Using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, we show that oxygen
   plasma treatment of Pd creates a PdOx interface layer, which is then
   reduced back to metallic Pd by in situ reactions during ZnSnO film
   annealing. The plasma treatment ensures an oxygen-rich environment in
   the semiconductor near the Schottky barrier, reducing the level of
   oxygen-deficiency-related defects and improving the rectifying contact.
   Using this process, we achieve diodes with high forward current density
   exceeding 103A cm(2) at 1 V, rectification ratios of >102, and ideality
   factors of around 1.9. The measured diode currentvoltage characteristics
   are compared to numerical simulations of thermionic field emission with
   sub-bandgap states in the semiconductor, which we attribute to spatial
   variations in metal stoichiometry of amorphous ZnSnO. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first demonstration of vertical Schottky diodes
   using solution-processed amorphous metal oxide semiconductor.
   Furthermore, the in situ chemical modification method developed here can
   be adapted to tune interface properties in many other oxide devices.}},

Title = {{The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) for
   standardized and reproducible statistical analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Statistics play a critical role in biological and clinical
   research. However, most reports of scientific results in the published
   literature make it difficult for the reader to reproduce the statistical
   analyses performed in achieving those results because they provide
   inadequate documentation of the statistical tests and algorithms
   applied. The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is
   put forward here as a step towards solving this problem.
   Results: The terms in OBCS including `data collection', `data
   transformation in statistics', `data visualization', `statistical data
   analysis', and `drawing a conclusion based on data', cover the major
   types of statistical processes used in basic biological research and
   clinical outcome studies. OBCS is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology
   (BFO) and extends the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), an
   OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry ontology
   supported by over 20 research communities. Currently, OBCS comprehends
   878 terms, representing 20 BFO classes, 403 OBI classes, 229 OBCS
   specific classes, and 122 classes imported from ten other OBO
   ontologies.
   We discuss two examples illustrating how the ontology is being applied.
   In the first (biological) use case, we describe how OBCS was applied to
   represent the high throughput microarray data analysis of immunological
   transcriptional profiles in human subjects vaccinated with an influenza
   vaccine. In the second (clinical outcomes) use case, we applied OBCS to
   represent the processing of electronic health care data to determine the
   associations between hospital staffing levels and patient mortality. Our
   case studies were designed to show how OBCS can be used for the
   consistent representation of statistical analysis pipelines under two
   different research paradigms. Other ongoing projects using OBCS for
   statistical data processing are also discussed.
   The OBCS source code and documentation are available at:
   https://github.com/obcs/obcs.
   Conclusions: The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS)
   is a community-based open source ontology in the domain of biological
   and clinical statistics. OBCS is a timely ontology that represents
   statistics-related terms and their relations in a rigorous fashion,
   facilitates standard data analysis and integration, and supports
   reproducible biological and clinical research.}},

Abstract = {{Combining the effect of layer mixing, mass mismatch, and intrinsic
   defects, we have investigated the origin of very low phonon conductivity
   k(p) in thermoelectric (TE) BiCuOQ (Q: S, Se, Te) compounds. Based on
   the first-principles anharmonic, lattice dynamics calculations, we use
   the single-mode relaxation time approximation of the linearized phonon
   Boltzmann equation, which shows good agreement with experiments. Here,
   we found that the most important parameter for low k(p) is the
   interlayer interaction between the BiO and CuQ layers. By analyzing the
   phonon linewidth distribution, which indicates the phonon scattering
   rate, we propose that the interlayer interactions play a critical role
   on suppressing k(p), i.e., the heterolayered crystal controls these
   interlayer interactions, achieving low k(p) and optimal TE properties.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary iron intake and systemic iron balance are implicated in
   colorectal cancer (CRC) development, but the means by which iron
   contributes to CRC are unclear. Gene expression and functional studies
   demonstrated that the cellular iron importer, divalent metal transporter
   1 (DMT1), is highly expressed in CRC through hypoxia-inducible factor 2
   alpha-dependent transcription. Colon-specific Dmt1 disruption resulted
   in a tumor-selective inhibitory effect of proliferation in mouse colon
   tumor models. Proteomic and genomic analyses identified an
   iron-regulated signaling axis mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1
   (CDK1), JAK1, and STAT3 in CRC progression. A pharmacological inhibitor
   of DMT1 antagonized the ability of iron to promote tumor growth in a CRC
   mouse model and a patient-derived CRC enteroid orthotopic model. Our
   studies implicate a growth-promoting signaling network instigated by
   elevated intracellular iron levels in tumorigenesis, offering molecular
   insights into how a key dietary component may contribute to CRC.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear safeguards applications require accurate fission models that
   exhibit prompt neutron anisotropy. In the laboratory reference frame, an
   anisotropic neutron angular distribution is observed because prompt
   fission neutrons carry momentum from fully accelerated fission
   fragments. A liquid organic scintillation detector array was used with
   pulse shape discrimination techniques to produce neutron neutron
   cross-correlation time distributions and angular distributions from
   spontaneous fission in a Cf-252, a 0.84 g Pu-240(eff) metal, and a 1.63
   g Pu-240(eff) metal sample. The effect of cross-talk, estimated with
   MCNPX-PoliMi simulations, is removed from neutron-neutron coincidences
   as a function of the angle between detector pairs. Fewer coincidences
   were observed at detector angles near 90, relative to higher and lower
   detector angles. As light output threshold increases, the observed
   anisotropy increases due to spectral effects arising from fission
   fragment momentum transfer to emitted neutrons. Stronger anisotropy was
   observed in Cf-252 spontaneous fission prompt neutrons than in Pu-240
   neutrons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon is regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for
   Li-ion batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity (4200mA h g(-1),
   Li22Si5), but the short cycle life mainly caused by the dramatic volume
   effect has hindered its practical application. To address this major
   issue, we report here an effective and scalable approach to fabricate a
   novel Si electrode via the addition of silane coupling agent, which not
   only connects silicon and polyacrylic acid (PAA) covalently but also
   crosslinks PAA, thus forming an entire 3D binding network. The dual
   functions of 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in an electrode with
   80\% Si nanoparticles greatly improves the structural stability during
   the charge/discharge process, leading to excellent electrochemical
   performances, such as 1000mAh g(-1) over 1200 cycles and high silicon
   loading of ca. 4.2mAh cm(-2). Moreover, this binder system is also
   effective for the thick silicon/graphite electrodes towards practical
   application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{All living organisms sense mechanical forces. Engineering
   mechanosensitive artificial cell through bottom-up in vitro
   reconstitution offers a way to understand how mixtures of macromolecules
   assemble and organize into a complex system that responds to forces. We
   use stable double emulsion droplets (aqueous/oil/aqueous) to prototype
   mechanosensitive artificial cells. In order to demonstrate
   mechanosensation in artificial cells, we develop a novel microfluidic
   device that is capable of trapping double emulsions into designated
   chambers, followed by compression and aspiration in a parallel manner.
   The microfluidic device is fabricated using multilayer soft lithography
   technology, and consists of a control layer and a deformable flow
   channel. Deflections of the PDMS membrane above the main microfluidic
   flow channels and trapping chamber array are independently regulated
   pneumatically by two sets of integrated microfluidic valves. We
   successfully compress and aspirate the double emulsions, which result in
   transient increase and permanent decrease in oil thickness,
   respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the influx of calcium ions as a
   response of our mechanically activated artificial cell through thinning
   of oil. The development of a microfluidic device to mechanically
   activate artificial cells creates new opportunities in force-activated

Abstract = {{Liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) patients differ in both
   pretreatment liver function (e.g. due to degree of cirrhosis and/or
   prior treatment) and radiosensitivity, leading to high variability in
   potential liver toxicity with similar doses. This work investigates
   three treatment planning optimization models that minimize risk of
   toxicity: two consider both voxel-based pretreatment liver function and
   local-function-based radiosensitivity with dose; one considers only
   dose. Each model optimizes different objective functions (varying in
   complexity of capturing the influence of dose on liver function) subject
   to the same dose constraints and are tested on 2D synthesized and 3D
   clinical cases. The normal-liver-based objective functions are the
   linearized equivalent uniform dose (lEUD) (conventional `lEUD model'),
   the so-called perfusion-weighted lEUD (fEUD) (proposed `fEUD model'),
   and post-treatment global liver function (GLF) (proposed `GLF model'),
   predicted by a new liver-perfusion-based dose-response model. The
   resulting lEUD, fEUD, and GLF plans delivering the same target lEUD are
   compared with respect to their post-treatment function and various
   dose-based metrics. Voxel-based portal venous liver perfusion, used as a
   measure of local function, is computed using DCE-MRI. In cases used in
   our experiments, the GLF plan preserves up to 4.6\%(7.5\%) more liver
   function than the fEUD (lEUD) plan does in 2D cases, and up to
   4.5\%(5.6\%) in 3D cases. The GLF and fEUD plans worsen in lEUD of
   functional liver on average by 1.0 Gy and 0.5 Gy in 2D and 3D cases,
   respectively. Liver perfusion information can be used during treatment
   planning to minimize the risk of toxicity by improving expected GLF; the
   degree of benefit varies with perfusion pattern. Although fEUD model
   optimization is computationally inexpensive and often achieves better
   GLF than lEUD model optimization does, the GLF model directly optimizes
   a more clinically relevant metric and can further improve fEUD plan
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for robust, fully automated whole body organ
   segmentation for diagnostic CT. This study investigates and optimizes a
   Random Forest algorithm for automated organ segmentation; explores the
   limitations of a Random Forest algorithm applied to the CT environment;
   and demonstrates segmentation accuracy in a feasibility study of
   pediatric and adult patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first study to investigate a trainable Weka segmentation (TWS)
   implementation using Random Forest machine-learning as a means to
   develop a fully automated tissue segmentation tool developed
   specifically for pediatric and adult examinations in a diagnostic CT
   environment.
   Current innovation in computed tomography (CT) is focused on radiomics,
   patient-specific radiation dose calculation, and image quality
   improvement using iterative reconstruction, all of which require
   specific knowledge of tissue and organ systems within a CT image. The
   purpose of this study was to develop a fully automated Random Forest
   classifier algorithm for segmentation of neck-chest-abdomen-pelvis CT
   examinations based on pediatric and adult CT protocols. Seven materials
   were classified: background, lung/internal air or gas, fat, muscle,
   solid organ parenchyma, blood/contrast enhanced fluid, and bone tissue
   using Matlab and the TWS plugin of FIJI. The following classifier
   feature filters of TWS were investigated: minimum, maximum, mean, and
   variance evaluated over a voxel radius of 2(n), (n from 0 to 4), along
   with noise reduction and edge preserving filters: Gaussian, bilateral,
   Kuwahara, and anisotropic diffusion. The Random Forest algorithm used
   200 trees with 2 features randomly selected per node. The optimized
   auto-segmentation algorithm resulted in 16 image features including
   features derived from maximum, mean, variance Gaussian and Kuwahara
   filters. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculations between manually
   segmented and Random Forest algorithm segmented images from 21 patient
   image sections, were analyzed. The automated algorithm produced
   segmentation of seven material classes with a median DSC of 0.86 +/-
   0.03 for pediatric patient protocols, and 0.85 +/- 0.04 for adult
   patient protocols. Additionally, 100 randomly selected patient
   examinations were segmented and analyzed, and a mean sensitivity of 0.91
   (range: 0.82-0.98), specificity of 0.89 (range: 0.70-0.98), and accuracy
   of 0.90 (range: 0.76-0.98) were demonstrated. In this study, we
   demonstrate that this fully automated segmentation tool was able to
   produce fast and accurate segmentation of the neck and trunk of the body
   over a wide range of patient habitus and scan parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The study of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been made possible by
   many technological advances in their isolation. Their isolation has seen
   many fronts, but each technology brings forth a new set of challenges to
   overcome. Microfluidics has been a key player in the capture of CTCs and
   their downstream analysis, with the aim of shedding light into their
   clinical application in cancer and metastasis. Researchers have taken
   diverging paths to isolate such cells from blood, ranging from
   affinity-based isolation targeting surface antigens expressed on CTCs,
   to label-free isolation taking advantage of the size differences between
   CTCs and other blood cells. For both major groups, many microfluidic
   technologies have reported high sensitivity and specificity for
   capturing CTCs. However, the question remains as to the superiority
   among these two isolation techniques, specifically to identify different
   CTC populations. This review highlights the key aspects of affinity and
   label-free microfluidic CTC technologies, and discusses which of these
   two would be the highest benefactor for the study of CTCs.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid fluid transport and exchange are critical operations involved in
   many microfluidic applications. However, conventional mechanisms used
   for driving fluid transport in microfluidics, such as micropumping and
   high pressure, can be inaccurate and difficult for implementation for
   integrated microfluidics containing control components and closed
   compartments. Here, a technology has been developed termed
   Vacuum-Pressure Accelerated Movement (V-PAM) capable of significantly
   enhancing biofluid transport in complex microfluidic environments
   containing dead-end channels and closed chambers. Operation of the V-PAM
   entails a pressurized fluid loading into microfluidic channels where gas
   confined inside can rapidly be dissipated through permeation through a
   thin, gas-permeable membrane sandwiched between microfluidic channels
   and a network of vacuum channels. Effects of different structural and
   operational parameters of the V-PAM for promoting fluid filling in
   microfluidic environments have been studied systematically. This work
   further demonstrates the applicability of V-PAM for rapid filling of
   temperature-sensitive hydrogels and unprocessed whole blood into complex
   irregular microfluidic networks such as microfluidic leaf venation
   patterns and blood circulatory systems. Together, the V-PAM technology
   provides a promising generic microfluidic tool for advanced fluid
   control and transport in integrated microfluidics for different
   microfluidic diagnosis, organs-on-chips, and biomimetic studies.}},

Abstract = {{A continuum model of an aprotic lithium/oxygen battery is validated
   against experimental first-discharge data and used to examine how the
   apparent cell capacity is affected by macroscopic multicomponent mass
   transfer, interfacial kinetics, and electronic conduction or tunneling
   through the discharge product. The model accounts for the three-phase
   nature of the positive electrode in detail, including an explicit
   discharge-product layer whose properties and volume distribution
   generally depend on the local discharge depth. Several hypothetical
   positiveelectrode reaction mechanisms involving different product
   morphologies and electron-transfer sites are explored within the
   theoretical framework. To match experimental discharge-voltage vs.
   capacity and capacity vs. discharge-current trends qualitatively, the
   discharge-product layer must be assumed to have electronic resistivity
   several orders of magnitude lower than typical insulators, supporting
   the notion that the presence of lithium peroxide does not wholly prevent
   electrons from reaching dissolved reactants. The discharge product also
   appears to allow charge transport over length scales longer than
   electron tunneling permits. ` Sudden death' of voltage in lithium/oxygen
   cells is explained by macroscopic oxygen-diffusion limitations in the
   positive electrode at high rates, and by pore clogging associated with
   discharge-product formation at low rates.}},

Title = {{Fusion of Renewable Ring Resonator Lasers and Ultrafast Laser Inscribed
   Photonic Waveguides}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrated the monolithic integration of reusable and wavelength
   reconfigurable ring resonator lasers and waveguides of arbitrary shapes
   to out-couple and guide laser emission on the same fused-silica chip.
   The ring resonator hosts were patterned by a single-mask standard
   lithography, whereas the waveguides were inscribed in the proximity of
   the ring resonator by using 3-dimensional femtosecond laser inscription
   technology. Reusability of the integrated ring resonator - waveguide
   system was examined by depositing, removing, and re-depositing dye-doped
   SU-8 solid polymer, SU-8 liquid polymer, and liquid solvent (toluene).
   The wavelength reconfigurability was validated by employing Rhodamine 6G
   (R6G) and 3,3'-Diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (CY3) as exemplary gain
   media. In all above cases, the waveguide was able to couple out and
   guide the laser emission. This work opens a door to reconfigurable
   active and passive photonic devices for on-chip coherent light sources,
   optical signal processing, and the investigation of new optical
   phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of power systems, tracking emissions attributable
   to a specific electrical load is a daunting challenge but essential for
   many environmental impact studies. Currently, no consensus exists on
   appropriate methods for quantifying emissions from particular
   electricity loads. This paper reviews a wide range of the existing
   methods, detailing their functionality, tractability, and appropriate
   use. We identified and reviewed 32 methods and models and classified
   them into two distinct categories: empirical data and relationship
   models and power system optimization models. To illustrate the impact of
   method selection, we calculate the CO2 combustion emissions factors
   associated with electric-vehicle charging using 10 methods at nine
   charging station locations around the United States. Across the methods,
   we found an up to 68\% difference from the mean CO2 emissions factor for
   a given charging site among both marginal and average emissions factors
   and up to a 63\% difference from the average across average emissions
   factors. Our results underscore the importance of method selection and
   the need for a consensus on approaches appropriate for particular loads
   and research questions being addressed in order to achieve results that
   are more consistent across studies and allow for soundly supported
   policy decisions. The paper addresses this issue by offering a set of
   recommendations for determining an appropriate model type on the basis
   of the load characteristics and study objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to develop a parametric ribcage model
   that can account for morphological variations among the adult
   population. Ribcage geometries, including 12 pair of ribs, sternum, and
   thoracic spine, were collected from CT scans of 101 adult subjects
   through image segmentation, landmark identification (1016 for each
   subject), symmetry adjustment, and template mesh mapping (26,180
   elements for each subject). Generalized procrustes analysis (GPA),
   principal component analysis (PCA), and regression analysis were used to
   develop a parametric ribcage model, which can predict nodal locations of
   the template mesh according to age, sex, height, and body mass index
   (BMI). Two regression models, a quadratic model for estimating the
   ribcage size and a linear model for estimating the ribcage shape, were
   developed. The results showed that the ribcage size was dominated by the
   height (p=0.000) and age sex-interaction (p=0.007) and the ribcage shape
   was significantly affected by the age (p=0.0005), sex (p=0.0002), height
   (p=0.0064) and BMI (p=0.0000). Along with proper assignment of cortical
   bone thickness, material properties and failure properties, this
   parametric ribcage model can directly serve as the mesh of finite
   element ribcage models for quantifying effects of human characteristics
   on thoracic injury risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2995-3003}},

Abstract = {{In this study we present a novel six-parameter shape model of the human
   rib centroidal path using logarithmic spirals. It provides a reduction
   in parameter space from previous models of overall rib shape, while
   simultaneously reducing fitting error by 34\% and increasing curvature
   continuity. Furthermore, the model directly utilizes geometric
   properties such as rib end-to-end span, aspect ratio, rib
   ``skewness{''}, and inner angle with the spine in its parameterization,
   making the effects of each parameter on overall shape intuitive and easy
   to visualize.
   The model was tested against 2197 rib geometries extracted from CT scans
   from a population of 100 adult females and males of uniformly
   distributed ages between 20 and 70. Significant size and shape
   differences between genders were identified, and shape model utility is
   demonstrated by the production of statistically average male and female
   rib shapes for all rib levels. Simulated mechanical loading of the
   resulting model rib shapes showed that the stiffness of statistically
   average male and female ribs matched well with the average rib stiffness
   from each separate population. This in-plane rib shape model can be used
   to characterize variation in human rib geometry seen throughout the
   population, including investigation of the overall changes in shape and
   resultant mechanical properties that ribs undergo during aging or
   disease progression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a facile methodology is discussed, involving
   fluoro-silanization followed by oxygen plasma etching, for the
   fabrication of surfaces with extreme wettabilities, i.e., surfaces that
   display all four possible combinations of wettabilities with water and
   different oils: hydrophobic-oleophilic, hydrophilic-oleophobic,
   omniphobic, and omniphilic. Open-channel, paper-based microfluidic
   devices fabricated using these surfaces with extreme wettabilities allow
   for the localization, manipulation, and transport of virtually all
   high-and low-surface tension liquids. This in turn expands the utility
   of paper-based microfluidic devices to a range of applications never
   before considered. These include, as demonstrated here, continuous
   oil-water separation, liquid-liquid extraction, open-channel
   microfluidic emulsification, microparticle fabrication, and precise
   measurement of mixtures' composition. Finally, the biocompatibility of
   the developed microfluidic devices and their utility for cell patterning

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a
   microhelium dielectric barrier discharge photoionization detector (mu
   HDBD-PID) on chip with dimensions of only similar to 15 mm x similar to
   10 mm x similar to 0.7 mm and weight of only similar to 0.25 g. It
   offers low power consumption (<400 mW), low helium consumption (5.8
   mL/min), rapid response (up to similar to 60 ms at a flow rate of 1.5
   mL/min), quick warm-up time (similar to 5 min), an excellent detection
   limit (a few picograms), a large linear dynamic range (>4 orders of
   magnitude), and maintenance-free operation. Furthermore, the mu HDBD-PID
   can be driven with a miniaturized (similar to 5 cm x similar to 2.5 cm x
   similar to 2.5 cm), light (22 g), and low cost (similar to\$2) power
   supply with only 1.5 VDC input. The dependence of the mu HDBD-PID
   performance on bias voltage, auxiliary helium flow rate, carrier gas
   flow rate, and temperature was also systematically investigated.
   Finally, the mu HDBD-PID was employed to detect permanent gases and a
   sublist of the EPA 8260 standard reagents that include 51 analytes. The
   mu HDBD-PID developed here can have a broad range of applications in
   portable and microgas chromatography systems for in situ, real-time, and
   sensitive gas analysis.}},

   Femtosecond Pulses by Angle-Multiplexed Spectral-Spatial Interferometry}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that temporally-dependent polarization states of
   ultrashort laser pulses can be reconstructed in a single shot by use of
   an angle-multiplexed spatial-spectral interferometry. This is achieved
   by introducing two orthogonally polarized reference pulses and
   interfering them with an arbitrarily polarized ultrafast pulse under
   measurement. A unique calibration procedure is developed for this
   technique which facilitates the subsequent polarization state
   measurements. The accuracy of several reconstructed polarization states
   is verified by comparison with that obtained from an analytic model that
   predicts the polarization state on the basis of its method of
   production. Laser pulses with mJ-level energies were characterized via
   this technique, including a time-dependent polarization state that can
   be used for polarization-gating of high-harmonic generation for
   production of attosecond pulses.}},

Title = {{Robust Protocols for Securely Expanding Randomness and Distributing Keys
   Using Untrusted Quantum Devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Randomness is a vital resource for modern-day information processing,
   especially for cryptography. A wide range of applications critically
   rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers generated securely. Here,
   we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without
   trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against
   the most general adversaries, and has the following new features:
   cryptographic level of security, tolerating a constant level of
   imprecision in devices, requiring only unit size quantum memory (for
   each device component) in an honest implementation, and allowing a large
   natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunction with a
   recent work by Chung et al. {[}2014], it also leads to robust unbounded
   expansion using just 2 multipart devices. When adapted for distributing
   cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential
   expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The
   proof proceeds by showing that the Renyi divergence of the outputs of
   the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as
   the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty
   principle on quantum measurements and a method for simulating trusted
   measurements with untrusted devices.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative hepatic perfusion parameters derived by fitting dynamic
   contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of liver to a
   pharmacokinetic model are prone to errors if the dynamic images are not
   corrected for respiratory motion by image registration. The
   contrast-induced intensity variations in pre-and postcontrast phases
   pose challenges for the accuracy of image registration. We propose an
   overdetermined system of transformation equations between the image
   volumes in the DCE-MRI series to achieve robust alignment. In this
   method, we register each volume to every other volume. From the
   transforms produced by all pairwise registrations, we constructed an
   overdetermined system of transform equations that was solved robustly by
   minimizing the L-1/2-norm of the residuals. This method was evaluated on
   a set of 100 liver DCEMRI examinations from 35 patients by examining the
   area under spikes appearing in the voxel time-intensity curves. The
   robust alignment procedure significantly reduced the area under
   intensity spikes compared with unregistered volumes (P <.001) and
   volumes registered to a single reference phase (P <.001). Our
   registration procedure provides a larger number of reliable
   time-intensity curve samples. The additional reliable samples in the
   precontrast baseline are important for calculating the postcontrast
   signal enhancement and thereby for converting intensity to contrast
   concentration. On the intensity ramp, retained samples help to better
   describe the uptake dynamics, providing a better foundation for
   parameter estimation. The presented method also simplifies the analysis
   of data sets with many patients by eliminating the need for manual
   intervention during registration.}},

   highly undersampled measurements by exploiting the sparsity of the
   images or image patches in a transform domain or dictionary. In this
   work, we focus on blind compressed sensing (BCS), where the underlying
   sparse signal model is a priori unknown, and propose a framework to
   simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the unknown
   model from highly undersampled measurements. Specifically, our model is
   that the patches of the underlying image(s) are approximately sparse in
   a transform domain. We also extend this model to a union of transforms
   model that better captures the diversity of features in natural images.
   The proposed block coordinate descent type algorithms for BCS are highly
   efficient, and are guaranteed to converge to at least the partial global
   and partial local minimizers of the highly nonconvex BCS problems. Our
   numerical experiments show that the proposed framework usually leads to
   better quality of image reconstructions in MRI compared to several
   recent image reconstruction methods. Importantly, the learning of a
   union of sparsifying transforms leads to better image reconstructions
   than a single adaptive transform.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Optical metamaterials have redefined how we understand light in notable
   ways: from strong response to optical magnetic fields, negative
   refraction, fast and slow light propagation in zero index and trapping
   structures, to flat, thin and perfect lenses. Many rules of thumb
   regarding optics, such as mu = 1, now have an exception, and basic
   formulas, such as the Fresnel equations, have been expanded. The field
   of metamaterials has developed strongly over the past two decades.
   Leveraging structured materials systems to generate tailored response to
   a stimulus, it has grown to encompass research in optics,
   electromagnetics, acoustics and, increasingly, novel hybrid material
   responses. This roadmap is an effort to present emerging fronts in areas
   of optical metamaterials that could contribute and apply to other
   research communities. By anchoring each contribution in current work and
   prospectively discussing future potential and directions, the authors
   are translating the work of the field in selected areas to a wider
   community and offering an incentive for outside researchers to engage
   our community where solid links do not already exist.}},

Abstract = {{We study an admission control model in revenue management with
   nonstationary and correlated demands over a finite discrete time
   horizon. The arrival probabilities are updated by current available
   information, that is, past customer arrivals and some other exogenous
   information. We develop a regret-based framework, which measures the
   difference in revenue between a clairvoyant optimal policy that has
   access to all realizations of randomness a priori and a given feasible
   policy which does not have access to this future information. This
   regret minimization framework better spells out the trade-offs of each
   accept/reject decision. We proceed using the lens of approximation
   algorithms to devise a conceptually simple regret-parity policy. We show
   the proposed policy achieves 2-approximation of the optimal policy in
   terms of total regret for a two-class problem, and then extend our
   results to a multiclass problem with a fairness constraint. Our goal in
   this article is to make progress toward understanding the marriage
   between stochastic regret minimization and approximation algorithms in
   the realm of revenue management and dynamic resource allocation. (c)

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Systems that make safety-critical decisions must undergo a rigorous
   verification and validation process to ensure automation decisions do
   not jeopardize the nominal safe state of operation. Flight safety
   assessment and management is a high-level decision-making system to
   reduce loss of control risk. This paper demonstrates how tools from
   formal verification can be used to guide the design of a takeoff flight
   safety assessment and management system implemented as a deterministic
   Moore machine. Finite state abstractions of simplified takeoff dynamics
   under different control authorities (i.e., pilot vs safety controller)
   are computed and composed with the Moore machine. By construction, the
   composition captures all behaviors of simplified takeoff dynamics. Then,
   a model checking tool analyzes whether this composition satisfies the
   takeoff safety requirements specified by federal aviation regulations.
   The results of model checking together with the abstraction are used to
   refine the Moore machine to ensure satisfaction of the specification.
   This paper contributes a novel approach to verification of a supervisory
   system specified by a Moore machine and applies this technique to flight
   safety assessment and management, which is itself an emerging flight
   management automation aid.}},

Title = {{A comparison of base running and sliding techniques in collegiate

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORT AND HEALTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{361-367}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare 4 techniques for
   arrival at a base after sprinting maximally to reach it: sliding
   head-first, sliding feet-first, running through the base without
   slowing, and stopping on the base. A secondary purpose of the study was
   to determine any advantage there may be to diving into first base to
   arrive sooner than running through the base.
   Methods: Two high-definition video cameras were used to capture
   3-dimensional kinematics of sliding techniques of 9 intercollegiate
   baseball players. Another video camera was used to time runs from first
   base to second in 4 counterbalanced conditions: running through the
   base, sliding head-first, sliding feet-first, and running to a stop.
   Mathematical modeling was used to simulate diving to first base such
   that the slide would begin when the hand touches the base.
   Results: Based upon overall results, the quickest way to the base is by
   running through it, followed by head-first, feet-first, and running to a
   stop.
   Conclusion: There was a non-significant trend toward an advantage for
   diving into first base over running through it, but more research is
   needed, and even if the advantage is real, the risks of executing this
   technique probably outweigh the miniscule gain. (C) 2016 Production and

Abstract = {{Soil-based radon investigations are of value in correlating radon
   production and its transportation into buildings through the processes
   of convection and diffusion. Such studies can help in identifying land
   areas that pose special concerns. We present preliminary results of soil
   radon gas measurements at 60 different locations in an attempt to map
   out the geohazard zone of the city of Muzaffarabad. The seismic
   geohazard microzonation for the area includes five microzones based on
   different hazard parameters: a very high hazard zone, a high hazard
   zone, a moderate hazard zone, a low hazard zone, and a safe zone.
   Measurements were taken with an active radon monitoring system at the
   depths of 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm below the ground surface. The results
   obtained were explained by the lithology of the area. Average soil radon
   gas concentrations were correlated with the depth from the ground
   surface and indoor radon values for the study area. No significant
   correlation was found between soil radon gas and meteorological
   parameters, however soil radon gas increases as the depth from the
   surface of the ground grows. The results showed a linear relation
   between soil radon concentrations with depth from ground surface (R-2 =
   0.9577). The minimum soil radon concentration (68.5 B q/m(3)) was found
   at a depth of 30 cm in the very high hazard zone, the maximum value
   (53.300 B q/m(3)) at a depth of 60 cm in the seismically safe zone.
   Measured soil gas radon concentrations at depths of 30, 40, 50, and 60
   cm were mapped for high, moderate, and low radon concentrations.
   Elevated soil radon gas concentrations were found in the safe zone,
   otherwise considered to be suitable for any type of construction.}},

Abstract = {{Management of fluid overload in patients with end-stage renal disease
   represents a unique challenge to clinical practice because of the lack
   of accurate and objective measurement methods. Currently, peripheral
   edema is subjectively assessed by palpation of the patient's
   extremities, ostensibly a qualitative indication of tissue viscoelastic
   properties. New robust quantitative estimates of tissue fluid content
   would allow clinicians to better guide treatment, minimizing reactive
   treatment decision making. Ultrasound viscoelastography (UVE) can be
   used to estimate strain in viscoelastic tissue, deriving material
   properties that can help guide treatment. We are developing and testing
   a simple, low-cost UVE system using a single-element imaging transducer
   that is simpler and less computationally demanding than array-based
   systems. This benchtop validation study tested the feasibility of using
   the UVE system by measuring the mechanical properties of a
   tissue-mimicking material under large strains. We generated
   depth-dependent creep curves and viscoelastic parameter maps of time
   constants and elastic moduli for the Kelvin model of viscoelasticity.
   During testing, the UVE system performed well, with mean UVE-measured
   strain matching standard mechanical testing with maximum absolute errors
   <= 4\%. Motion tracking revealed high correlation and signal-to-noise
   ratios, indicating that the system is reliable. (C) 2016 World

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer has emerged as one of the most
   frequently applied materials in microfluidics. However, precise and
   large-scale surface micro-machining of PDMS remains challenging,
   limiting applications of PDMS for microfluidic structures with
   high-resolution features. Herein, surface patterning of PDMS was
   achieved using a simple yet effective method combining direct
   photolithography followed by reactive-ion etching (RIE). This method
   incorporated a unique step of using oxygen plasma to activate PDMS
   surfaces to a hydrophilic state, thereby enabling improved adhesion of
   photoresist on top of PDMS surfaces for subsequent photolithography. RIE
   was applied to transfer patterns from photoresist to underlying PDMS
   thin films. Systematic experiments were conducted in the present work to
   characterize PDMS etch rate and etch selectivity of PDMS to photoresist
   as a function of various RIE parameters, including pressure, RF power,
   and gas flow rate and composition. We further compared two common RIE
   systems with and without bias power and employed inductively coupled
   plasma and capacitively coupled plasma sources, respectively, in terms
   of their PDMS etching performances. The RIE-based PDMS surface
   micromachining technique is compatible with conventional Si-based
   surface and bulk micromachining techniques, thus opening promising
   opportunities for generating hybrid microfluidic devices with novel
   functionalities. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Development of an advanced microfluidic micropipette aspiration device
   for single cell mechanics studies}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Various micro-engineered tools or platforms have been developed recently
   for cell mechanics studies based on acoustic, magnetic, and optical
   actuations. Compared with other techniques for single cell
   manipulations, microfluidics has the advantages with simple working
   principles and device implementations. In this work, we develop a
   multi-layer microfluidic pipette aspiration device integrated with
   pneumatically actuated microfluidic control valves. This configuration
   enables decoupling of cell trapping and aspiration, and hence causes
   less mechanical perturbation on trapped single cells before aspiration.
   A high trapping efficiency is achieved by the microfluidic channel
   design based on fluid resistance model and deterministic microfluidics.
   Compared to conventional micropipette aspiration, the suction pressure
   applied on the aspirating cells is highly stable due to the viscous
   nature of low Reynolds number flow. As a proof-of-concept of this novel
   microfluidic technology, we built a microfluidic pipette aspiration
   device with 2 x 13 trapping arrays and used this device to measure the
   stiffness of a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231, through the
   observation of cell deformations during aspiration. As a comparison, we
   studied the effect of Taxol, a FDA-approved anticancer drug on single
   cancer cell stiffness. We found that cancer cells treated with Taxol
   were less deformable with a higher Young's modulus. The multi-layer
   microfluidic pipette aspiration device is a scalable technology for
   single cell mechanophenotyping studies and drug discovery applications.

Abstract = {{This paper formulates analytical models to describe the static
   displacement and force interactions between generic serial-parallel
   compliant mechanisms and their loads by employing the matrix method. In
   keeping with the familiar piezoelectric constitutive equations, the
   generalized constitutive equations of compliant mechanism represent the
   input-output displacement and force relations in the form of a
   generalized Hooke's law and as analytical functions of physical
   parameters. Also significantly, a new model of output displacement for
   compliant mechanism interacting with piezo-stacks and elastic loads is
   deduced based on the generalized constitutive equations. Some original
   findings differing from the well-known constitutive performance of
   piezo-stacks are also given. The feasibility of the proposed models is
   confirmed by finite element analysis and by experiments under various
   elastic loads. The analytical models can be an insightful tool for
   predicting and optimizing the performance of a wide class of compliant
   mechanisms that simultaneously consider the influence of loads and

Title = {{Hybrid local FEM/global LISA modeling of damped guided wave propagation

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new hybrid modeling technique for the efficient
   simulation of guided wave generation, propagation, and interaction with
   damage in complex composite structures. A local finite element model is
   deployed to capture the piezoelectric effects and actuation dynamics of
   the transmitter, while the global domain wave propagation and
   interaction with structural complexity (structure features and damage)
   are solved utilizing a local interaction simulation approach (LISA).
   This hybrid approach allows the accurate modeling of the local dynamics
   of the transducers and keeping the LISA formulation in an explicit
   format, which facilitates its readiness for parallel computing. The
   global LISA framework was extended through the 3D Kelvin-Voigt
   viscoelasticity theory to include anisotropic damping effects for
   composite structures, as an improvement over the existing LISA
   formulation. The global LISA framework was implemented using the compute
   unified device architecture running on graphic processing units. A
   commercial preprocessor is integrated seamlessly with the computational
   framework for grid generation and material property allocation to handle
   complex structures. The excitability and damping effects are
   successfully captured by this hybrid model, with experimental validation
   using the scanning laser doppler vibrometry. To demonstrate the
   capability of our hybrid approach for complex structures, guided wave
   propagation and interaction with a delamination in a composite panel
   with stiffeners is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally-invasive surgery of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be
   limited by poor tumor visualization with white light. We demonstrate
   systemic administration of a Cy5.5-labeled peptide specific for
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to target HCC in vivo in a mouse
   xenograft model. We attached a compact imaging module to the proximal
   end of a medical laparoscope to collect near-infrared fluorescence and
   reflectance images concurrently at 15 frames/sec. We measured a mean
   target-to-background ratio of 2.99 +/- 0.22 from 13 surgically exposed
   subcutaneous human HCC tumors in vivo in 5 mice. This integrated imaging
   methodology is promising to guide laparoscopic resection of HCC. (C)2016

Abstract = {{The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission samples the
   Mars ionosphere down to altitudes of approximate to 150km over a wide
   range of local times and solar zenith angles. On 5 January 2015 (Orbit
   520) when the spacecraft was in darkness at high northern latitudes
   (solar zenith angle, SZA>120 degrees; latitude>60 degrees), the Solar
   Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) instrument observed photoelectrons at
   altitudes below 200km. Such observations imply the presence of closed
   crustal magnetic field loops that cross the terminator and extend
   thousands of kilometers to the deep nightside. This occurs over the weak
   northern crustal magnetic source regions, where the magnetic field has
   been thought to be dominated by draped interplanetary magnetic fields
   (IMF). Such a day-night magnetic connectivity also provides a source of
   plasma and energy to the deep nightside. Simulations with the
   SuperThermal Electron Transport (STET) model show that photoelectron
   fluxes measured by SWEA precipitating onto the nightside atmosphere
   provide a source of ionization that can account for the O(2)(+)density
   measured by the Suprathermal and Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC)
   instrument below 200km. This finding indicates another channel for
   Martian energy redistribution to the deep nightside and consequently
   localized ionosphere patches and potentially aurora.}},

Abstract = {{The empirical models of the plasma sheet electron temperature and
   density on the nightside at distances between 6and11R(E) are constructed
   based on Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During
   Substorms (THEMIS) particle measurements. The data set comprises
   approximate to 400h of observations in the plasma sheet during
   geomagnetic storm periods. The equatorial distribution of the electron
   density reveals a strong earthward gradient and a moderate variation
   with magnetic local time symmetric with respect to the midnight
   meridian. The electron density dependence on the external driving is
   parameterized by the solar wind proton density averaged over 4h and the
   southward component of interplanetary magnetic field (IMFBS) averaged
   over 6h. The interval of the IMF integration is much longer than a
   typical substorm growth phase, and it rather corresponds to the
   geomagnetic storm main phase duration. The solar wind proton density is
   the main controlling parameter, but the IMFBS becomes of almost the same
   importance in the near-Earth region. The root-mean-square deviation
   between the observed and predicted plasma sheet density values is
   0.23cm(-3), and the correlation coefficient is 0.82. The equatorial
   distribution of the electron temperature has a maximum in the
   postmidnight to morning MLT sector, and it is highly asymmetric with
   respect to the local midnight. The electron temperature model is
   parameterized by solar wind velocity (averaged over 4h), IMFBS (averaged
   over 45min), and IMFBN (northward component of IMF, averaged over 2h).
   The solar wind velocity is a major controlling parameter, and IMFBS and
   B-N are comparable in importance. In contrast to the density model, the
   electron temperature shows higher correlation with the IMFBS averaged
   over approximate to 45min (substorm growth phase time scale). The effect
   of B-N manifests mostly in the outer part of the modeled region (r >
   8R(E)). The influence of the IMFBS is maximal in the midnight to
   postmidnight MLT sector. The correlation coefficient between the
   observed and predicted plasma sheet electron temperature values is 0.76,
   and the root-mean-square deviation is 2.6keV. Both models reveal better
   performance in the dawn MLT sector.}},

Title = {{Stability of Brillouin flow in the presence of slow-wave structure}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Including a slow-wave structure (SWS) on the anode in the conventional,
   planar, and inverted magnetron, we systematically study the linear
   stability of Brillouin flow, which is the prevalent flow in
   crossed-field devices. The analytic treatment is fully relativistic and
   fully electromagnetic, and it incorporates the equilibrium density
   profile, flow profile, and electric field and magnetic field profiles in
   the linear stability analysis. Using parameters similar to the
   University of Michigan's recirculating planar magnetron, the numerical
   data show that the resonant interaction of the vacuum circuit mode and
   the corresponding smooth-bore diocotron-like mode is the dominant cause
   for instability. This resonant interaction is far more important than
   the intrinsic negative (positive) mass property of electrons in the
   inverted (conventional) magnetron geometry. It is absent in either the
   smooth-bore magnetron or under the electrostatic assumption, one or both
   of which was almost always adopted in prior analytical formulation. This
   resonant interaction severely restricts the wavenumber for instability
   to the narrow range in which the cold tube frequency of the SWS is
   within a few percent of the corresponding smooth bore diocotron-like
   mode in the Brillouin flow. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Microbiome Composition and Function Drives Wound-Healing Impairment in
   the Female Genital Tract}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism(s) by which bacterial communities impact susceptibility to
   infectious diseases, such as HIV, and maintain female genital tract
   (FGT) health are poorly understood. Evaluation of FGT bacteria has
   predominantly been limited to studies of species abundance, but not
   bacterial function. We therefore sought to examine the relationship of
   bacterial community composition and function with mucosal epithelial
   barrier health in the context of bacterial vaginosis (BV) using
   metaproteomic, metagenomic, and in vitro approaches. We found highly
   diverse bacterial communities dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis
   associated with host epithelial barrier disruption and enhanced immune
   activation, and low diversity communities dominated by Lactobacillus
   species that associated with lower Nugent scores, reduced pH, and
   expression of host mucosal proteins important for maintaining epithelial
   integrity. Importantly, proteomic signatures of disrupted epithelial
   integrity associated with G. vaginalis-dominated communities in the
   absence of clinical BV diagnosis. Because traditional clinical
   assessments did not capture this, it likely represents a larger
   underrepresented phenomenon in populations with high prevalence of G.
   vaginalis. We finally demonstrated that soluble products derived from G.
   vaginalis inhibited wound healing, while those derived from L. iners did
   not, providing insight into functional mechanisms by which FGT bacterial
   communities affect epithelial barrier integrity.}},

   strong symbol-based code that can correct errors due to small
   granularity faults and detect errors caused by large granularity faults;
   the tier-2 code is an XOR-based code that corrects errors detected by
   the tier-1 code. The rate-adaptive feature of RATT-ECC enables permanent
   bank failures to be handled through sparing. It can also be used to
   significantly reduce the refresh power consumption without decreasing
   reliability and timing performance.}},

Title = {{Estimating the Additional Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Korea: Focused on
   Demolition of Asbestos Containing Materials in Building}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{When asbestos containing materials (ACM) must be removed from the
   building before demolition, additional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   are generated. However, precedent studies have not considered the
   removal of ACM from the building. The present study aimed to develop a
   model for estimating GHG emissions created by the ACM removal processes,
   specifically the removal of asbestos cement slates (ACS). The second
   objective was to use the new model to predict the total GHG emission
   produced by ACM removal in the entire country of Korea. First, an
   input-equipment inventory was established for each step of the ACS
   removal process. Second, an energy consumption database for each
   equipment type was established. Third, the total GHG emission
   contributed by each step of the process was calculated. The GHG
   emissions generated from the 1,142,688 ACS-containing buildings in Korea
   was estimated to total 23,778 tonCO(2)eq to 132,141 tonCO(2)eq. This
   study was meaningful in that the emissions generated by ACS removal have
   not been studied before. Furthermore, the study deals with additional
   problems that can be triggered by the presence of asbestos in building
   materials. The method provided in this study is expected to contribute
   greatly to the calculation of GHG emissions caused by ACM worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Low back pain (LBP) is a common occupational problem and continues to be
   the leading cause of occupational disability. Among diverse known risk
   factors, sitting is commonly considered as an important exposure related
   to LBP risk, and modern living and contemporary work both involve
   increasing sedentary behaviors including more frequent and prolonged
   sitting. Specifically, a few studies have assessed lumbosacral loads in
   seated postures, but no sitting-specific model has been developed to
   investigate the effects of seated tasks and time-dependent variations in
   lumbosacral loading during sitting. Here, a three-dimensional,
   electromyography-based biomechanical model of the trunk was developed to
   predict lumbotacral loads during a range of seated tasks. This model was
   a modification of an earlier approach, and specific modifications
   included a revised representation of lumbar muscle anatomy and
   viscoelastic soft-tissue properties, and a method to account for
   muscular fatigue during prolonged sitting. With these enhancements, the
   predictive ability of the model was assessed over a range of seated
   tasks that differed in terms of lumbar posture, time pressure, and
   mental workload. Predicted model parameters corresponded well with
   values reported earlier. Reasonable levels of correspondence were found
   between external and predicted lumbosacral moments across all tested
   tasks. Physical exposures and injury risks related to seated work can
   potentially be estimated using this modeling approach, which may
   facilitate future injury prevention strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{True Color Correction of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Imagery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{853-874}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an automated approach to recovering the true color
   of objects on the seafloor in images collected from multiple
   perspectives by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during the
   construction of three-dimensional (3D) seafloor models and image
   mosaics. When capturing images underwater, the water column induces
   several effects on light that are typically negligible in air, such as
   color-dependent attenuation and backscatter. AUVs must typically carry
   artificial lighting when operating at depths below 20-30 m; the lighting
   pattern generated is usually not spatially consistent. These effects
   cause problems for human interpretation of images, limit the ability of
   using color to identify benthic biota or quantify changes over multiple
   dives, and confound computer-based techniques for clustering and
   classification. Our approach exploits the 3D structure of the scene
   generated using structure-from-motion and photogrammetry techniques to
   provide basic spatial data to an underwater image formation model.
   Parameters that are dependent on the properties of the water column are
   estimated from the image data itself, rather than using fixed in situ
   infrastructure, such as reflectance panels or detailed data on water
   constitutes. The model accounts for distance-based attenuation and
   backscatter, camera vignetting and the artificial lighting pattern,
   recovering measurements of the true color (reflectance) and thus allows
   us to approximate the appearance of the scene as if imaged in air and
   illuminated from above. Our method is validated against known color
   targets using imagery collected in different underwater environments by
   two AUVs that are routinely used as part of a benthic habitat monitoring
   program.}},

Title = {{Engineering Circular Gliding of Actin Filaments Along Myosin-Patterned
   DNA Nanotube Rings To Study Long-Term Actin-Myosin Behaviors}},

Abstract = {{Nature has evolved molecular motors that are critical in cellular
   processes occurring over broad time scales, ranging from seconds to
   years. Despite the importance of the long-term behavior of molecular
   machines, topics such as enzymatic lifetime are underexplored due to the
   lack of a suitable approach for monitoring motor activity over long time
   periods. Here, we developed an ``O{''}-shaped Myosin Empowered Gliding
   Assay (OMEGA) that utilizes engineered micron-scale DNA nanotube rings
   with precise arrangements of myosin VI to trap gliding actin filaments.
   This circular gliding assay platform allows the same individual actin
   filament to glide over the same myosin ensemble (50-1000 motors per
   ring) multiple times. First, we systematically characterized the
   formation of DNA nanotubes rings with 4, 6, 8, and 10 helix
   circumferences. Individual actin filaments glide along the nanotube
   rings with high processivity for up to 12.8 revolutions or 11 min in run
   time. We then show actin gliding speed is robust to variation in motor
   number and independent of ring curvature within our sample space (ring
   diameter of 0.5-4 mu m). As a model application of OMEGA, we then
   analyze motor-based mechanical influence on ``stop-and-go{''} gliding
   behavior of actin filaments, revealing that the stop-to-go transition
   probability is dependent on motor flexibility. Our circular gliding
   assay may provide a dosed-loop platform for monitoring long-term
   behavior of broad classes of molecular motors and enable
   characterization of motor robustness and long time scale nanomechanical
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Gene delivery from biomaterial scaffolds has been employed to induce the
   expression of tissue inductive factors for applications in regenerative
   medicine. The delivery of viral vectors has been described as reflecting
   a balance between vector retention and release. Herein, we investigated
   the design of hydrogels in order to retain the vector at the material in
   order to enhance transgene expression. Poly(ethylene-glycol) (PEG)
   hydrogels were modified with poly-L-lysine (PLL) to non-covalently bind
   lentivirus. For cells cultured on the hydrogels, increasing the PLL
   molecular weight from 1 to 70 kDa led to increased transgene expression.
   The incubation time of the virus with the hydrogel and the PLL
   concentration modulated the extent of virus adsorption, and adsorbed
   virus had a 20\% increase in the half-life at 37 degrees C. Alternatives
   to high molecular weight PLL were identified through phage display
   technology, with peptide sequences specific for the VSV-G ectodomain, an
   envelope protein pseudotyped on the virus. These affinity peptides could
   easily be incorporated into the hydrogel, and expression was increased
   20-fold relative to control peptide, and comparable to levels observed
   with the high molecular weight PLL. The modification of hydrogels with
   affinity proteins or peptides to bind lentivirus can be a powerful
   strategy to enhance and localized transgene expression. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Soil particle roundness (R) and sphericity (S) are two important
   intrinsic properties that govern a soil's mechanical behavior. Although
   R and S have well-established mathematical definitions dating back to
   the 1930s, the values are much more typically estimated using charts
   developed in the 1940s and 1950s. The charts, are based on the earlier
   mathematical definitions. Using these charts, a class of undergraduate
   civil engineering students at the University of Michigan were asked to
   estimate (R-c and S-c) from images of twenty geologically and
   geographically diverse sands spanning a range of actual R and S values.
   The images were of three-dimensional (3D) assemblies of the sands as
   they would be found in images taken remotely or in situ. The students'
   estimates were statistically analyzed and compared with rigorously
   determined R and S using a recently developed computational geometry
   algorithm. Overall, the students' estimates were scattered, particularly
   for natural sands exhibiting intermediate values of R and low values of
   S. On average, the students underestimated R-c and S-c. Reasons for the
   diverse responses and underestimates of the actual R and S are proposed.

Title = {{A Linear-Size Logarithmic Stretch Path-Reporting Distance Oracle for
   General Graphs}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ALGORITHMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Thorup and Zwick {[}2001a] proposed a landmark distance oracle with the
   following properties. Given an n-vertex undirected graph G = (V, E) and
   a parameter k = 1, 2, ..., their oracle has size O(kn(1+1/k)), and upon
   a query (u, v) it constructs a path Pi between u and v of length
   delta(u, v) such that d(G)(u, v) <= delta(u, v) <= (2k-1) d(G)(u, v).
   The query time of the oracle from Thorup and Zwick {[}2001a] is O(k) (in
   addition to the length of the returned path), and it was subsequently
   improved to O(1) {[}Wulff-Nilsen 2012; Chechik 2014]. A major drawback
   of the oracle of Thorup and Zwick {[}2001a] is that its space is Omega(n
   center dot log n). Mendel and Naor {[}2006] devised an oracle with space
   O(n(1+ 1/k)) and stretch O(k), but their oracle can only report distance
   estimates and not actual paths. In this article, we devise a
   path-reporting distance oracle with size O(n(1+ 1/k)), stretch O(k), and
   query time O(n(epsilon)), for an arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0.
   In particular, for k = log n, our oracle provides logarithmic stretch
   using linear size. Another variant of our oracle has size O(n log log
   n), polylogarithmic stretch, and query time O(log log n).
   For unweighted graphs, we devise a distance oracle with multiplicative
   stretch O(1), additive stretch O(beta(k)), for a function beta(center
   dot), space O(n(1+ 1/k)), and query time O(n(epsilon)), for an
   arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0. The tradeoff between
   multiplicative stretch and size in these oracles is far below Erdos's
   girth conjecture threshold (which is stretch 2k - 1 and size O(n(1+
   1/k))). Breaking the girth conjecture tradeoff is achieved by exhibiting
   a tradeoff of different nature between additive stretch beta(k) and size
   O(n(1+ 1/k)). A similar type of tradeoff was exhibited by a construction
   of (1+ epsilon, beta)-spanners due to Elkin and Peleg {[}2001]. However,
   so far (1 + epsilon, beta)-spanners had no counterpart in the distance
   oracles' world.
   An important novel tool that we develop on the way to these results is a
   distance-preserving path-reporting oracle. We believe that this oracle
   is of independent interest.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a sub-mu W on-chip oscillator for fully integrated
   system-on-chip designs. The proposed oscillator introduces a resistive
   frequency locked loop topology for accurate clock generation. In this
   topology, a switched-capacitor circuit is controlled by an internal
   voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and the equivalent resistance of
   this switched-capacitor is matched to a temperature-compensated on-chip
   resistor using an ultra-low power amplifier. This design yields a
   temperature-compensated frequency from the internal VCO. The approach
   eliminates the traditional comparator from the oscillation loop; this
   comparator typically consumes a significant portion of the total
   oscillator power and limits temperature stability in conventional RC
   relaxation oscillators due to its temperature-dependent delay. A test
   chip is fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS that exhibits a temperature
   coefficient of 34.3 ppm/degrees C with long-term stability of less than
   7 ppm (12 second integration time) while consuming 110 nW at 70.4 kHz. A
   radio transmitter circuit that uses the proposed oscillator as a
   baseband timing source is also presented to demonstrate a system-on-chip
   design using this oscillator.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers optimal multiband transmission under hostile
   jamming, where both the authorized user and the jammer are power-limited
   and operate against each other. The strategic decision making of the
   authorized user and the jammer is modeled as a two-party zero-sum game,
   where the payoff function is the capacity that can be achieved by the
   authorized user in the presence of the jammer. First, we investigate the
   game under AWGN channels. It is found that: either for the authorized
   user to maximize its capacity, or for the jammer to minimize the
   capacity of the authorized user, the best strategy for both of them is
   to distribute the transmission power or jamming power uniformly over all
   the available spectrum. The minimax capacity can be calculated based on
   the channel bandwidth and the signal-to-jamming and noise ratio, and it
   matches with the Shannon channel capacity formula. Second, we consider
   frequency selective fading channels. We characterize the dynamic
   relationship between the optimal signal power allocation and the optimal
   jamming power allocation in the minimax game, and then propose an
   iterative water pouring algorithm to find the optimal power allocation
   schemes for both the authorized user and the jammer.}},

Title = {{The Impact of GCM Dynamical Cores on Idealized Sudden Stratospheric
   Warmings and Their QBO Interactions}},

Abstract = {{The paper demonstrates that sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) can be
   simulated in an ensemble of dry dynamical cores that miss the typical
   SSW forcing mechanisms like moist processes, land-sea contrasts, or
   topography. These idealized general circulation model (GCM) simulations
   are driven by a simple Held-Suarez-Williamson (HSW) temperature
   relaxation and low-level Rayleigh friction. In particular, the four
   dynamical cores of NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAMS),
   are used, which are the semi-Lagrangian (SLD) and Eulerian (EUL)
   spectral-transform models and the finite-volume (FV) and the spectral
   element (SE) models.
   Three research themes are discussed. First, it is shown that SSW events
   in such idealized simulations have very realistic flow characteristics
   that are analyzed via the SLD model. A single vortex-split event is
   highlighted that is driven by wavenumber-1 and -2 wave-mean flow
   interactions. Second, the SLD simulations are compared to the EUL, FV,
   and SE dynamical cores, which sheds light on the impact of the numerical
   schemes on the circulation. Only SLD produces major SSWs, while others
   only exhibit minor stratospheric warmings. These differences are caused
   by SLD's more vigorous wave-mean flow interactions in addition to a warm
   pole bias, which leads to relatively weak polar jets in SLD. Third, it
   is shown that tropical quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO)-like
   oscillations and SSWs can coexist in such idealized HSW simulations.
   They are present in the SLD dynamical core that is used to analyze the
   QBO-SSW interactions via a transformed Eulerian-mean (TEM) analysis. The
   TEM results provide support for the Holton-Tan effect.}},

Abstract = {{While current atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) still treat
   the surface as a blackbody in their longwave radiation scheme, recent
   studies suggest the need for taking realistic surface spectral
   emissivity into account. There have been few measurements available for
   the surface emissivity in the far IR (<650 cm(-1)). Based on
   first-principle calculation, the authors compute the spectral emissivity
   over the entire longwave spectrum for a variety of surface types.
   MODIS-retrieved mid-IR surface emissivity at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees
   spatial resolution is then regressed against the calculated spectral
   emissivity to determine the surface type for each grid. The derived
   spectral emissivity data are then spatially averaged onto 0.5 degrees x
   0.5 degrees grids and spectrally integrated onto the bandwidths used by
   the RRTMG\_LW-a longwave radiation scheme widely used in current climate
   and numerical weather models. The band-by-band surface emissivity
   dataset is then compared with retrieved surface spectral emissivities
   from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) measurements.
   The comparison shows favorable agreement between two datasets in all the
   bands covered by the IASI measurements. The authors further use the
   dataset in conjunction with ERA-Interim to evaluate its impact on the
   top-of-atmosphere radiation budget. Depending on the blackbody surface
   assumptions used in the original calculation, the globally averaged
   difference caused by the inclusion of realistic surface emissivity
   ranges from -1.2 to -1.5 W m(-2) for clear-sky OLR and from -0.67 to
   -0.94 W m(-2) for all-sky OLR. Moreover, the difference is not spatially
   uniform and has a distinct spatial pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Output-based high-order adaptive results are presented for several

   output (e.g., the drag coefficient) weights a fine-space residual and
   automatically selects the elements that need more resolution. The roles

   differences are investigated between two mesh refinement strategies:
   hanging-node refinement of structured meshes versus metric-based
   remeshing of unstructured triangles.}},

Title = {{Predictors of Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction in Major League
   Baseball Pitchers}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction surgeries in
   Major League Baseball (MLB) have increased significantly in recent
   decades. Although several risk factors have been proposed, a scientific
   consensus is yet to be reached, providing challenges to those tasked
   with preventing UCL injuries.
   Purpose: To identify significant predictors of UCL reconstruction in MLB
   pitchers.
   Study Design: Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods: Demographic and pitching performance data were sourced from
   public databases for 104 MLB pitchers who underwent UCL reconstruction
   surgery and 104 age- and position-matched controls. These variables were
   compared between groups and inserted into a binary logistic regression
   to identify significant predictors of UCL reconstruction. Two machine
   learning models (naive Bayes and support vector machine) were also
   employed to predict UCL reconstruction in this cohort.
   Results: The binary linear regression model was statistically
   significant ((2)(12) = 33.592; P = .001), explained 19.9\% of the
   variance in UCL reconstruction surgery, and correctly classified 66.8\%
   of cases. According to this model, (1) fewer days between consecutive
   games, (2) a smaller repertoire of pitches, (3) a less pronounced
   horizontal release location, (4) a smaller stature, (5) greater mean
   pitch speed, and (6) greater mean pitch counts per game were all
   significant predictors of UCL reconstruction. More specifically, an
   increase in mean days between consecutive games (odds ratio {[}OR],
   0.685; 95\% CI, 0.542-0.865) or number of unique pitch types thrown (OR,
   0.672; 95\% CI, 0.492-0.917) was associated with a significantly smaller
   likelihood of UCL reconstruction. In contrast, an increase in mean pitch
   speed (OR, 1.381; 95\% CI, 1.103-1.729) or mean pitches per game (OR,
   1.020; 95\% CI, 1.007-1.033) was associated with significantly higher
   odds of UCL reconstruction surgery. The naive Bayes classifier predicted
   UCL reconstruction with an accuracy of 72\% and the support vector
   machine classifier with an accuracy of 75\%.
   Conclusion: This study identified 6 key performance factors that may
   present significant risk factors for UCL reconstruction in MLB pitchers.
   These findings could help to enhance the prevention of UCL
   reconstruction surgery in MLB pitchers and shape the direction of future
   research in this domain.}},

Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{476-486}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Delamination interacting with matrix cracking is a characteristic
   failure mechanism that is observed in the damage evolution of laminated
   composites subjected to low velocity impact. This failure mode can be
   studied in isolation by investigating the low velocity impact response
   of sandwich panels that have thin face sheets bonded to a core. In these
   panels, failure is seen to initiate in the core (akin to the matrix) by
   cracking, leading to delamination between the core and the face sheet.
   Experimental and modeling results for the flexural response and failure
   mechanisms of sandwich composite beams under three point bend loading,
   both for quasi-static and impact loading are presented. Digital image
   correlation (DIC) technique is used to obtain the surface strain field
   during the response event as well as capturing the onset of failure. A
   2D, plane strain finite element (FE) model using the Smeared Crack
   Approach (SCA) has been developed to predict the response, and to
   capture the interactive failure seen in the experiments. The FE model
   accurately captures the response seen in the experiments as well as the
   mode of failure and the progression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Surface/subsurface crack during grinding limits the application of
   engineering ceramics. High-speed grinding is proposed in ceramics
   grinding for high material removal rate and surface quality. The dynamic
   fracture toughness of ceramic materials is established by combining the
   Johnson-Holmquist 2 damage model for brittle material and the Griffith
   fracture theory. Single-grit simulation was utilized to investigate the
   individual crack generation and propagation in silicon carbide (SiC)
   indentation and engagement under different wheel surface speed. The
   indentation simulation results indicate that high-speed grinding
   enhances the SiC plastic deformation in the contact zone. Engagement
   simulation shows that the micro-crack transforms from deep and narrow
   longitudinal crack in the subsurface to shallow and width lateral crack
   on the surface when the wheel surface speed increases with a constant
   maximum undeformed chip thickness. To validate this model, the
   high-speed grinding experiments are conducted. The trends of micro-crack
   evolution, single grit force, and surface roughness of the experimental
   results at the constant workpiece feed rate match well with the

Abstract = {{Using optical spectroscopy experiments, including conventional
   low-temperature photo-reflectance and photoluminescence (PL) together
   with time-resolved PL and near-field magneto PL, we distinguish between
   statistical composition fluctuations (CFs) and nitrogen clusters (N-cl)
   in i- and n-type GaAs1-xNx alloys (x = 0.01-0.03). We measured the size
   (l = 3-24 nm), activation energy (Ea = 15-30 meV) and density (n(l)
   similar to 10(11) cm(-2)) of CFs in i-type material. In n-type material
   we resolved the emission of nitrogen clusters (N-cl) having activation
   energy similar to 70 meV and density n(cl) similar to 10(12) cm(-2).
   Analysis of l and E-a values in i-GaAs1-xNx revealed a strong
   interaction between substitutional (N-s) and interstitial (N-i)
   nitrogen, which results in band gap splitting accompanied by activation
   of the heavy-hole exciton and N-cl emission. In the optical spectra of
   i-GaAs1-xNx, we suggest the identification of different N-i species and
   N-i-N-s arrangements, and in n-GaAs1-xNx we observed
   activation/suppression of N-cl/CF emission and interference between CFs
   and ionized donors. Using numerical analysis of amplitude, size and
   density of CFs we revealed unexpected quasi-ordering which results in
   modulation of CFs having period 2l. This is consistent with the high
   n(l) values observed. We show that this quasi-ordering, arising from
   statistical non-uniformity of the CFs, creates a set of latent states,
   which allows us to probe exciton properties, defect density and the
   structural homogeneity in GaAs1-xNx.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the staffing problem at Peace Arch, one of the major
   U.S.-Canada border crossings, with the goal of reducing time delay
   without compromising the effectiveness of security screening. Our data
   analytics show how the arrival rates of vehicles vary by time of day and
   day of week, and that the service rate per booth varies considerably by
   the time of day and the number of active booths. We propose a
   time-varying queueing model to capture these dynamics and use empirical
   data to estimate the model parameters using a multiple linear
   regression. We then formulate the staffing task as an integer
   programming problem and derive a near-optimal workforce schedule.
   Simulations reveal that our proposed workforce policy improves on the
   existing schedule by about 18\% in terms of average delay without
   increasing the total work hours of the border staff. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) releasing polymers are promising in improving the
   biocompatibility of medical devices. Polyurethanes are commonly used to
   prepare/fabricate many devices (e.g., catheters); however, the transport
   properties of NO within different polyurethanes are less studied,
   creating a gap in the rational design of new NO releasing devices
   involving polyurethane materials. Herein, we study the diffusion and
   partitioning of NO in different biomedical polyurethanes via the
   time-lag method. The diffusion of NO is positively correlated with the
   PDMS content within the polyurethanes, which can be rationalized by
   effective media theory considering various microphase morphologies.
   Using catheters as a model device, the effect of these transport
   properties on the NO release profiles and the distribution around an
   asymmetric dual lumen catheter are simulated using finite element
   analysis and validated experimentally. This method can be readily
   applied in studying other NO release medical devices with different
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Neutral generation 3 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers were labeled with
   Oregon Green 488 (G3-OG(n)) to obtain materials with controlled
   fluorophore:dendrimer ratios (n = 1-2), a mixture containing mostly 3
   dyes per dendrimer, a mixture containing primarily 4 or more dyes per
   dendrimer (n = 4+), and a stochastic mixture (n = 4(avg)). The UV
   absorbance of the dye conjugates increased linearly as n increased and
   the fluorescence emission decreased linearly as n increased. Cellular
   uptake was studied in RAW cells and HEK 293A cells as a function of the
   fluorophore:dendrimer ratio (n). The cellular uptake of G3-OG(n) (n = 3,
   4+, 4(avg)) into RAW cells was significantly lower than G3-OG(n) (n = 1,
   2). The uptake of G3-OG(n) (n = 3, 4+, 4(avg)) into HEK 293A cells was
   not significantly different from G3-OG(1). Thus, the
   fluorophore:dendrimer ratio was observed to change the extent of uptake
   in the macrophage uptake mechanism but not in the HEK 293A cell. This
   difference in endocytosis indicates the presence of a pathway in the

Title = {{3D Mapping of calcite and a demonstration of its relevance to
   permeability evolution in reactive fractures}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{246-253}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is a need to better understand reaction-induced changes in fluid
   transport in fractured shales, caprocks and reservoirs, especially in
   the context of emerging energy technologies, including geologic carbon
   sequestration, unconventional natural gas, and enhanced geothermal
   systems. We developed a method for 3D calcite mapping in rock specimens.
   Such information is critical in reactive transport modeling, which
   relies on information about the locations and accessible surface area of
   reactive minerals. We focused on calcite because it is a mineral whose
   dissolution could lead to substantial pathway alteration because of its
   high solubility, fast reactivity, and abundance in sedimentary rocks.
   Our approach combines X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and scanning
   electron microscopy. The method was developed and demonstrated for a
   fractured limestone core containing about 50\% calcite, which was 2.5 cm
   in diameter and 3.5 cm in length and had been scanned using XCT. The
   core was subsequently sectioned and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   was used to determine elemental signatures for mineral identification
   and mapping. Back-scattered electron microscopy was used to identify
   features for co-location. Finally, image analysis resulted in
   characteristic grayscale intensities of X-ray attenuation that identify
   calcite. This attenuation mapping ultimately produced a binary segmented
   3D image of the spatial distribution of calcite in the entire core. To
   demonstrate the value of this information, permeability changes were
   investigated for hypothetical fractures created by eroding calcite from
   2D rock surfaces. Fluid flow was simulated using a 2D steady state
   model. The resulting increases in permeability were profoundly
   influenced by the degree to which calcite is contiguous along the flow
   path. If there are bands of less reactive minerals perpendicular to the
   direction of flow, fracture permeability may be an order of magnitude
   smaller than when calcite is contiguous. These results emphasize the
   importance of characterizing spatial distribution of calcite in
   heterogeneous rocks that also contain a similar abundance of less
   reactive minerals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE \& PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Specimens of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have been implanted with 400
   keV Cr+ ions at different ion fluences ranging from 5 x 10(13) to 5 x
   10(15) ions/cm(2). The possible chemical reactions involved in the
   nucleation of conjugated carbonaceous clusters in implanted PMMA are
   discussed. Furthermore, impact of formation of carbonaceous clusters on
   structural, optical, electrical and morphological properties of
   implanted PMMA has been examined. The structural modifications in
   implanted PMMA are observed by Raman spectroscopy. The variation in
   optical band gap and Urbach energy is measured using UV-visible
   spectroscopic analysis. The effects of Cr+ ion implantation on
   electrical and morphological properties are investigated by four-probe
   apparatus and atomic force microscopy, respectively. The Raman
   spectroscopic analysis confirmed the formation of carbonaceous clusters
   with the transformation of implanted layer of PMMA into amorphous
   carbon. Simultaneously, the optical band gap of implanted PMMA has
   reduced from 3.13 to 0.85 eV. The increase in Urbach energy favors the
   decline in band gap together with the structural modification in
   implanted PMMA. As a result of Cr+ ion implantation, the electrical
   conductivity of PMMA has improved from 2.14 +/- 0.06 x 10(-10) S/cm
   (pristine) to 7.20 +/- 0.36 x 10(-6) S/cm. The AFM images revealed a
   decrease in surface roughness with an increment in ion fluence up to 5 X
   10(14) ions/cm(2). The modification in the electrical, optical and
   structural properties makes the PMMA a promising candidate for its
   future utilization, as a semi-conducting and optically active material,
   in various fields like plastic electronics and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of literature has emerged supporting the importance of
   cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the pathogenesis of head and neck cancers.
   CSCs are a sub-population of cells within a tumor that share the
   properties of self-renewal and multipotency with stem cells from normal
   tissue. Their functional relevance to the pathobiology of cancer arises
   from the unique properties of tumorigenicity, chemotherapy resistance,
   and their ability to metastasize and invade distant tissues. Several
   molecular profiles have been used to discriminate a stem cell from a
   non-stem cell. CSCs can be grown for study and further enriched using a
   number of in vitro techniques. An evolving option for translational
   research is the use of mathematical and computational models to describe
   the role of CSCs in complex tumor environments. This review is focused
   discussing the evidence emerging from modeling approaches that have
   clarified the impact of CSCs to the biology of cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Structural monitoring systems are an objective and quantitative-based
   management tool that have been developed to assist structure owners with
   their diagnostic and prognostic decision making processes. As sensing
   technologies mature, the deployment of permanent sensing arrays in
   structures is becoming more popular, resulting in increasing volumes of
   sensing data. Comprehensive data-management systems are needed to host
   and curate heterogeneous data sets associated with structural asset
   management including structural information (design and inspection
   information) and massive amounts of sensing data. More importantly, the
   data-management system must also provide a functional but secure means
   of allowing software clients to perform analytics on the data contained
   in the system. In this paper, a scalable and secure cyberinfrastructure
   platform termed SenStore is introduced for the management and automated
   analysis of sensing data. SenStore includes a hybrid database
   architecture that maximizes query speed by storing structural metadata
   in a relational database, sensor data in a hierarchical data format
   repository, and multimedia files such as inspector photos in a flat file
   system. The design of SenStore is presented, followed by description of
   its application to manage and process data associated with a long-term
   wireless monitoring system installed on the Telegraph Road Bridge
   (Monroe, Michigan). To illustrate the effectiveness of SenStore in
   tracking the performance of monitored bridges, this study automates the
   process of extracting modal data from the Telegraph Road Bridge sensor
   data stored in SenStore and using modal parameters to update a
   finite-element model that is integral to the bridge owner's
   decision-making processes. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a switching feedback controller for the attitude of
   an underactuated spacecraft that exploits two internal control torques
   provided by reaction wheels. The problem is challenging; for example,
   even in the zero total angular momentum case, no smooth or even
   continuous time-invariant feedback law for stabilizing a desired
   orientation exists. The method introduced here exploits the separation
   of the system states into inner-loop base variables and outer-loop fiber
   variables. The base variables track periodic reference trajectories, the
   amplitude of which is governed by parameters that are adjusted to induce
   an appropriate change in the fiber variables. Under suitable assumptions
   on the total angular momentum, this controller stabilizes an equilibrium
   that corresponds to a desired inertially fixed orientation. If the
   desired attitude violates the assumption on angular momentum, then
   controlled oscillations in a neighborhood around the target orientation
   are induced by the switching controller. The control scheme is based on
   several approximations and is designed for relatively small maneuvers
   close to the desired attitude in a vicinity which may be achieved by
   thruster-based control schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   switching feedback law provides good performance in controlling the
   attitude of an underactuated spacecraft.}},

   experiments}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{276-287}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The energy conversion potential of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposed
   of in landfills remains largely untapped because of the slow and
   variable rate of biogas generation, delayed and inefficient biogas
   collection, leakage of biogas, and landfill practices and infrastructure
   that are not geared toward energy recovery. A database consisting of
   methane (CH4) generation data, the major constituent of biogas, from 49
   laboratory experiments and field monitoring data from 57 landfills was
   developed. Three CH4 generation parameters, i.e., waste decay rate (k),
   CH4 generation potential (L-0), and time until maximum CH4 generation
   rate (t(max)), were calculated for each dataset using U.S. EPA's
   Landfill Gas Emission Model (LandGEM). Factors influencing the derived
   parameters in laboratory experiments and landfills were investigated
   using multi-linear regression analysis. Total weight of waste (W) was
   correlated with biodegradation conditions through a ranked
   classification scheme. k increased with increasing percentage of readily
   biodegradable waste (B-r0 (\%)) and waste temperature, and reduced with
   increasing W, an indicator of less favorable biodegradation conditions.
   The values of k obtained in the laboratory were commonly significantly
   higher than those in landfills and those recommended by LandGEM. The
   mean value of L-0 was 98 and 88 L CH4/kg waste for laboratory and field
   studies, respectively, but was significantly affected by waste
   composition with ranges from 10 to 300 L CH4/kg. t(max) increased with
   increasing percentage of biodegradable waste (B-0) and W. The values of
   t(max) in landfills were higher than those in laboratory experiments or
   those based on LandGEM's recommended parameters. Enhancing
   biodegradation conditions in landfill cells has a greater impact on
   improving k and t(max) than increasing B-0. Optimizing the B-0 and B-r0
   values of landfilled waste increases L-0 and reduces t(max). (C) 2015

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Objective: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are being studied as a
   biomarker of epilepsy, yet it is unknown how various acquisition
   parameters at different centers affect detection and analysis of HFOs.
   This paper specifically quantifies effects of sampling rate (FS) and
   anti-aliasing filter (AAF) positions on automated HFO detection.
   Methods: HFOs were detected on intracranial EEG recordings (17 patients)
   with 5 kHz FS. HFO detection was repeated on downsampled and/or filtered
   copies of the EEG data, mimicking sampling rates and low-pass filter
   settings of various acquisition equipment. For each setting, we compared
   the HFO detection sensitivity, HFO features, and ability to identify the
   ictal onset zone.
   Results: The relative sensitivity remained above 80\% for either FS >= 2
   kHz or AAF >= 500 Hz. HFO feature distributions were consistent (AUROC <
   0.7) down to 1 kHz FS or 200 Hz AAF. HFO rate successfully identified
   ictal onset zone over most settings. HFO peak frequency was highly
   variable under most parameters (Spearman correlation < 0.5).
   Conclusions: We recommend at least FS >= 2 kHz and AAF >= 500 Hz to
   detect HFOs. Additionally, HFO peak frequency is not robust at any
   setting: the same HFO event can be variably classified either as a
   ripple (< 200 Hz) or fast ripple (> 250 Hz) under different acquisition
   settings.
   Significance: These results inform clinical centers on requirements to
   analyze HFO rates and features. (C) 2016 International Federation of

Abstract = {{Background. Ventriculostomy is a common neurosurgical procedure with a
   relatively steep learning curve. A low-cost, high-fidelity simulator
   paired with procedure-specific performance measures would provide a safe
   environment to teach ventriculostomy procedural skills. The same
   validated simulation model could also allow for assessment of trainees'
   proficiencies with measures that align with Accreditation Council for
   Graduate Medical Education milestones. This study extends previous work
   to evaluate validity evidence from the simulator, its newly developed
   performance assessment, the Ventricolostomy Procedural Assessment Tool,
   and the Objective Structured Assessment for Technical Skills.
   Methods. After Institutional Review Board exemption, performance data
   were collected from 11 novice and 3 expert neurosurgeons (n = 14).
   Participants self-reported their ability to perform tasks on the
   simulator using the Ventricolostomy Procedural Assessment Tool, an
   11-item, step-wise instrument with 5-point rating scales ranging from 1
   (unable to perform) to 5 (performs easily and smoothly). De identified
   operative performances were videotaped and independently rated by 3
   neurosurgeons, using the Ventricolostomy Procedural Assessment Tool and
   Objective Structured Assessment for Technical Skills. We evaluated
   multiple sources of validity evidence (2014 Standards) to examine
   psychometric quality of the measures and to test our assumption that the
   tools could discriminate between novice and expert performances
   adequately. We used a multifacet Rasch model and traditional indices,
   such as Cronbach alpha, Intraclass correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank
   test estimates.
   Results. Validity evidence relevant to test content and response
   processes was supported adequately. Evidence of internal structure was
   supported by high interitem consistency (n = 0.95) and inter-rater
   agreement for most Ventricolostomy Procedural Assessment Tool items
   (Intraclass correlation coefficient = {[}0.00, 0.91]) and all Objective
   Structured Assessment for Technical Skills items (Intraclass correlation
   coefficient = {[}0.80, 0.93]). Overall, novices performed at a lower
   level than experts on both scales (P < .05), supporting evidence
   relevant to relationships to other variables. Deeper analysis of
   novice/expert ratings indicated novices attained lower performances
   ratings for all Ventricolostomy Procedural Assessment Tool and Objective
   Structured Assessment for Technical Skills items, but statistical
   significance was only achieved for the Objective Structured Assessment
   for Technical Skills items (P < .01). Rater bias estimates were
   favorable, supporting evidence relevant to consequences of testing.
   Conclusion. Despite a small sample, favorable evidence using current
   Standards supports the use of the novel simulator and both tools
   combined for skills training and performance assessment, but challenges
   (potential threats to validity) should be considered prior to
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody-drug conjugates exhibit complex pharmacokinetics due to their
   combination of macromolecular and small molecule properties. These
   issues range from systemic concerns, such as deconjugation of the small
   molecule drug during the long antibody circulation time or rapid
   clearance from nonspecific interactions, to local tumor tissue
   heterogeneity, cell bystander effects, and endosomal escape.
   Mathematical models can be used to study the impact of these processes
   on overall distribution in an efficient manner, and several types of
   models have been used to analyze varying aspects of antibody
   distribution including physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
   models and tissue-level simulations. However, these processes are
   quantitative in nature and cannot be handled qualitatively in isolation.
   For example, free antibody from deconjugation of the small molecule will
   impact the distribution of conjugated antibodies within the tumor. To
   incorporate these effects into a unified framework, we have coupled the
   systemic and organ-level distribution of a PBPK model with the
   tissue-level detail of a distributed parameter tumor model. We used this
   mathematical model to analyze new experimental results on the
   distribution of the clinical antibody-drug conjugate Kadcyla in
   HER2-positive mouse xenografts. This model is able to capture the impact
   of the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) on tumor penetration, the net result of
   drug deconjugation, and the effect of using unconjugated antibody to
   drive ADC penetration deeper into the tumor tissue. This modeling
   approach will provide quantitative and mechanistic support to
   experimental studies trying to parse the impact of multiple mechanisms
   of action for these complex drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Early-transition-metal nitrides, including gamma-Mo2N, are active and
   selective for a variety of reactions, including the hydrogenation of
   organics (e.g., hydrodeoxygenation), CO (e.g., Fischer Tropsch
   synthesis), and CO2. In addition to adsorbing hydrogen onto the surface,
   some of these materials can incorporate hydrogen into subsurface,
   interstitial sites. Research described in this paper examined,
   experimentally and computationally, the nature of hydrogen on and in
   gamma-Mo2N, with a particular focus on characterizing the interactions
   of these hydrogens with crotonaldehyde. Hydrogen was added to gamma-Mo2N
   via exposure to gaseous hydrogen at elevated temperatures, forming
   gamma-Mo2N-H-x, where 0.061< x < 0.082. Temperature-programmed
   desorption (TPD) experiments indicate that gamma-Mo2N-H-x has at least
   two distinct hydrogen binding sites and that these sites can be
   selectively populated. Inelastic neutron scattering and density
   functional theory calculations indicate the presence of surface
   nitrogen-bound (kappa(1)-NHsurf), surface Mo-bound (kappa(1)-MoHsurf),
   and interstitial Mo-bound (mu(6)-Mo6Hsub) hydrogens. Selectivities for
   the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, a model of species in
   biomass-derived liquids, correlated with the populations at these sites.
   Importantly, materials with high densities of interstitial, hydridic
   hydrogen were selective for C=O hydrogenation (i.e., formation of crotyl
   alcohol). Collectively the results provide mechanistic insights
   regarding the desorption and reactivity of hydrogen on and in
   gamma-Mo2N. Hydrogen adsorption/desorption to gamma-Mo2N is heterolytic;
   in particular, H-2 adds across a Mo-N bond. Because the surface Mo-H
   site is energetically unfavorable in comparison to the interstitial
   site, hydrogen migrates into interstitial sites once the surface NH
   sites are saturated. Crotonaldehyde adsorption facilitates migration of
   this interstitial hydrogen back to the surface, forming surface Mo-H
   that is selective for hydrogenation of the C=O bond. These insights will
   facilitate the design of gamma-Mo2N and other early-transition metal
   nitrides for catalytic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The ferrite-martensite interfacial energy and equilibrium interfacial
   length as a function of martensite carbon content are assessed using
   first-principles atomistic simulations. The weight percent of carbon in
   the martensite phase was implicitly varied from 0.6 to 1.8 wt percent by
   modifying the lattice constant of body-centered tetragonal (BCT)
   martensite according to Kurdjumov and Kaminsky's empirical expressions.
   With increasing carbon content, a decrease is found in both the
   interfacial energy and in the equilibrium distance between ferrite and
   martensite interfaces. Moreover, the Morse interatomic potentials
   between the atoms in the ferrite-martensite interface for four different
   martensite carbon contents are calculated, and the parameters of the
   Morse potential are correlated linearly with the martensite carbon
   content. In addition, the dissociation local strains during uniaxial
   loading in a direction normal to the interfacial plane are calculated
   from the interatomic potentials. The local strain at the interface
   needed for ferrite-martensite interface separation increases with
   increase in martensite carbon content. The fitted expressions can be
   used to predict the ferrite-martensite interfacial energy, equilibrium
   interfacial distance, dissociation local strain at the interface, and
   the Morse parameters as functions of martensite carbon content within
   the range of 0.6-1.8 wt percent. Furthermore, the introduced implicit
   method can potentially be used to study the mechanical properties of
   other materials with dopant impurities such as n-type and p-type
   semiconductors. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Functional strength training is becoming increasingly popular when
   rehabilitating individuals with neurological injury such as stroke or
   cerebral palsy. Typically, resistance during walking is provided using
   cable robots or weights that are secured to the distal shank of the
   subject. However, there exists no device that is wearable and capable of
   providing resistance across the joint, allowing over ground gait
   training. In this study, we created a lightweight and wearable device
   using eddy current braking to provide resistance to the knee. We then
   validated the device by having subjects wear it during a walking task
   through varying resistance levels. Electromyography and kinematics were
   collected to assess the biomechanical effects of the device on the
   wearer. We found that eddy current braking provided resistance levels
   suitable for functional strength training of leg muscles in a package
   that is both lightweight and wearable. Applying resistive forces at the
   knee joint during gait resulted in significant increases in muscle
   activation of many of the muscles tested. A brief period of training
   also resulted in significant aftereffects once the resistance was
   removed. These results support the feasibility of the device for
   functional strength training during gait. Future research is warranted
   to test the clinical potential of the device in an injured population.}},

Abstract = {{The black carbon (BC) emitted from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) is
   an important source of urban atmospheric pollution and creates strong
   climate-forcing impacts. The emission ratio of BC to total particle mass
   (PM) (i.e., BC/PM ratio) is an essential variable used to estimate total
   BC emissions from historical PM data; however, these ratios have not
   been measured using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS) in
   order to obtain real-world measurements over a wide range of driving
   conditions. In this study, we developed a PEMS platform by integrating
   two Aethalometers and an electric low pressure impactor to realize the
   joint measurement of real-world BC and PM emissions for ten HDDVs in
   China. Test results showed that the average BC/PM ratio for five HDDVs
   equipped with mechanical fuel injection (MI) engines was 0.43 +/- 0.06,
   significantly lower (P < 0.05) than another five HDDVs equipped with
   electronically-controlled fuel injection (EI) engines (0.56 +/- 0.12).
   Traffic conditions also affected the BC/PM ratios with higher ratios on
   freeway routes than on local roads. Furthermore, higher ratios were
   observed for HDDVs equipped with EI engines than for the MI engines for
   the highway and local road routes. With an operating mode binning
   approach, we observed that the instantaneous BC/PM ratios of El engine
   vehicles were above those of the MI engine vehicles in all operating
   modes except for the braking mode (i.e., Bin 0). Therefore, the complex
   impacts from engine technology and traffic conditions on BC/PM ratios
   should be carefully considered when estimating real-world BC emissions
   from HDDVs based on overall PM emissions data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Heterotopic implantation of transcatheter tricuspid valve is a new
   treatment option for tricuspid regurgitation. Transcatheter tricuspid
   valves are implanted onto the cavoatrial junction in order to avoid the
   challenging task of anchoring the valve onto the complex tricuspid valve
   annulus. However, little is known about optimum extent of oversizing of
   the valved stent in a vena cava. In this study, we implanted valves of
   the same diameter onto the larger sized inferior vena cava (IVC) and a
   smaller sized superior vena cava (SVC). The valve in the IVC was
   oversized by 10.7\% while the valve in the SVC was oversized by 21.6\%.
   Finite element analysis was performed (i) to assess the strain on the
   nitinol stent during manufacturing and deployment; (ii) the stents were
   deployed in a patient-specific vena cava model and the intramural stress
   of the vena cava was calculated computationally. These valves were
   fabricated and placed in a silicone model of a patient-specific right
   atrium which was part of a mock circulatory system that emulated the
   patho-physiological flow rate and pressure of a patient with tricuspid
   regurgitation. Flow measurements were conducted by particle image
   velocimetry (PIV). It was found that the maximum crimping strain on the
   nitinol stent was 6.85\% which was lower than the critical threshold of
   10\%. The maximum stress on the vena cava was located at the spot where
   the hooks met the wall. The maximum stress on the IVC was 0.5098 MPa
   while the maximum stress on the SVC was 0.7 MPa. The maximum Reynolds
   shear stress (mRSS) in the vena cava was found to be higher in the IVC
   than SVC with the highest mRSS being 1741 dynes/cm(2) found in the
   region of high flow during the peak flow phase. The overtly oversized
   valve in the SVC did not cause flow disturbances and exhibited mostly
   laminar flows. The mRSS at the downstream of the vena cava valve and the
   middle of the atrium remained at low magnitudes. However, velocity
   fluctuations were high in the IVC in all the time points measured. In
   conclusion, oversizing the valve may assist anchorage; yet, careful
   consideration should be taken in choosing the extent of oversizing as it
   may lead to adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{The Carnot, Diesel, Otto, and Brayton power cycles are reconsidered
   endor-eversibly in finite time thermodynamics (FTT). In particular, the
   thermal efficiency of these standard power cycles is compared to the
   well-known results in classical thermodynamics. The present analysis
   based on FTT modelling shows that a reduction in both the maximum and
   minimum temperatures of the cycle causes the thermal efficiency to
   increase. This is antithetical to the existing trend in the classical
   references. Under the assumption of endoreversibility, the relation
   between the efficiencies is also changed to eta(Carnot) >eta(Brayton)
   >eta(Diesel) >eta(Otto), which is again very different from the
   corresponding classical results. The present results benefit a better
   understanding of the important role of irreversibility on heat engines

Abstract = {{Due to the sustainable nature and stimulus plans from government,
   renewable energy (such as wind and solar) has been increasingly used in
   power systems. However, the intermittency of renewable energy creates
   challenges for power system operators to keep the systems reliable and
   cost-effective. In addition, information about renewable energy is
   usually incomplete. Instead of knowing the true probability distribution
   of the renewable energy course, only a set of historical data samples
   can be collected from the true (while ambiguous) distribution. In this
   article, we study two risk-averse stochastic unit commitment models with
   incomplete information: the first model being a chance-constrained unit
   commitment model and the second one a two-stage stochastic unit
   commitment model with recourse. Based on historical data on renewable
   energy, we construct a confidence set for the probability distribution
   of the renewable energy and propose data-driven stochastic unit
   commitment models to hedge against the incomplete nature of the
   information. Our models also ensure that, with a high probability, a
   large portion of renewable energy is utilized. Furthermore, we develop
   solution approaches to solve the models based on deriving strong valid
   inequalities and Benders' decomposition algorithms. We show that the
   risk-averse behavior of both models decreases as more data samples are
   collected and eventually vanishes as the sample size goes to infinity.
   Finally, our case studies verify the effectiveness of our proposed
   models and solution approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Full-cycle computational fluid dynamics simulations with gasoline
   chemical kinetics were performed to determine the impact of breathing
   and fuel injection strategies on thermal and compositional
   stratification, combustion and emissions during homogeneous charge
   compression ignition combustion. The simulations examined positive valve
   overlap and negative valve overlap strategies, along with fueling by
   port fuel injection and direct injection. The resulting charge mass
   distributions were analyzed prior to ignition using ignition delay as a
   reactivity metric. The reactivity stratification arising from
   differences in the distributions of fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio
   (phi(FO)), oxygen molar fraction (chi(O2)) and temperature (T) was
   determined for three parametric studies. In the first study, the
   reactivity stratification and burn duration for positive valve overlap
   valve events with port fuel injection and early direct injection were
   nearly identical and were dominated by wall-driven thermal
   stratification. nitrogen oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions
   were negligible for both injection strategies. In the second study,
   which examined negative valve overlap valve events with direct injection
   and port fuel injection, reactivity stratification increased for direct
   injection as the phi(FO) and T distributions associated with direct fuel
   injection into the hot residual gas were positively correlated; however,
   the latent heat absorbed from the hot residual gas by the evaporating
   direct injection fuel jet reduced the overall thermal and reactivity
   stratification. These stratification effects were offsetting, resulting
   in similar reactivity stratification and burn durations for the two
   injection strategies. The higher local burned gas temperatures with
   direct injection resulted in an order of magnitude increase in NO, while
   incomplete combustion of locally over-lean regions led to a sevenfold
   increase in CO emissions compared to port fuel injection. The final
   study evaluated positive valve overlap and negative valve overlap valve
   events with direct injection. Relative to positive valve overlap, the
   negative valve overlap condition had a wider reactivity stratification,
   a longer burn duration and higher NO and CO emissions associated with
   reduced fuel-air mixing.}},

   based on additives (polymer injection and gas injection), and those
   based on morphological alterations in the boundary layer flow (air
   layers and partial cavity formation). A common theme for all methods is
   their disruption of one or more of the underlying physical processes

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), due to their unique structure/function
   relationship, have great opportunities to be developed into novel
   diagnostic and therapeutic agents for a variety of pathogens and
   illnesses. Often such peptides are administered using powder or
   suspension, limiting their reusability or recyclability. Immobilization
   of these antimicrobial peptides on biotic/abiotic surfaces may
   circumvent such disadvantages, but such immobilization is likely to not
   only change the peptide secondary structures and their orientations but
   also ultimately affect functionality. In order to better understand
   surface-bound structures of AMPs on abiotic surfaces; cecropin A
   (1-8)-melittin (1-18) hybrid peptides were chemically immobilized on
   polymer surfaces prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   polymerization. Measurements by sum frequency generation
   (SFG)-vibrational spectroscopy and circular dichroism were used to
   characterize the peptides immobilized on the CVD-based polymer in situ.
   In addition, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were
   used to understand the orientation of these peptides :on the molecular
   level. Simulation results were highly consistent with experimental data:
   Results indicated that, unlike other linear peptides immobilized on
   similar abiotic surfaces, this hybrid peptide immobilized on CVD-based
   polymer surfaces exhibited two bending points. Such conclusions help
   further understand the role surface immobilization for such unique
   molecules.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Symmetry-breaking problems are among the most well studied in the field
   of distributed computing and yet the most fundamental questions about
   their complexity remain open. In this article we work in the LOCAL model
   (where the input graph and underlying distributed network are identical)
   and study the randomized complexity of four fundamental
   symmetry-breaking problems on graphs: computing MISs (maximal
   independent sets), maximal matchings, vertex colorings, and ruling sets.
   A small sample of our results includes the following:
   -An MIS algorithm running in O(log(2) Delta + 2(O(root loglogn))) time,
   where Delta is the maximum degree. This is the first MIS algorithm to
   improve on the 1986 algorithms of Luby and Alon, Babai, and Itai, when
   log n << Delta << 2(root log n), and comes close to the Omega (log
   Delta/log log Delta) lower bound of Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer.
   -A maximal matching algorithm running in O(log Delta + log(4) log n)
   time. This is the first significant improvement to the 1986 algorithm of
   Israeli and Itai. Moreover, its dependence on Delta is nearly optimal.
   -A (Delta + 1)-coloring algorithm requiring O(log Delta + 2(O(root
   loglog n))) time, improving on an O(log Delta + root logn)-time
   algorithm of Schneider and Wattenhofer.
   -A method for reducing symmetry-breaking problems in low
   arboricity/degeneracy graphs to low-degree graphs. (Roughly speaking,
   the arboricity or degeneracy of a graph bounds the density of any
   subgraph.) Corollaries of this reduction include an O(root log n)-time
   maximal matching algorithm for graphs with arboricity up to 2(root log
   n) and an O(log(2/3) n)-time MIS algorithm for graphs with arboricity up
   to 2((log n)1/3).
   Each of our algorithms is based on a simple but powerful technique for
   reducing a randomized symmetry-breaking task to a corresponding
   deterministic one on a poly(log n)-size graph.}},

Abstract = {{We present a field formulation for defects that draws from the classical
   representation of the cores as force dipoles. We write these dipoles as
   singular distributions. Exploiting the key insight that the variational
   setting is the only appropriate one for the theory of distributions, we
   arrive at universally applicable weak forms for defects in nonlinear
   elasticity. Remarkably, the standard, Galerkin finite element method
   yields numerical solutions for the elastic fields of defects that, when
   parameterized suitably, match very well with classical, linearized
   elasticity solutions. The true potential of our approach, however, lies
   in its easy extension to generate solutions to elastic fields of defects
   in the regime of nonlinear elasticity, and even more notably for
   Toupin's theory of gradient elasticity at finite strains (Toupin Arch.
   Ration. Mech. Anal., 11 (1962) 385). In computing these solutions we
   adopt recent numerical work on an isogeometric analytic framework that
   enabled the first three-dimensional solutions to general boundary value
   problems of Toupin's theory (Rudraraju et al. Comput. Methods Appl.
   Mech. Eng., 278 (2014) 705). We first present exhaustive solutions to
   point defects, edge and screw dislocations, and a study on the
   energetics of interacting dislocations. Then, to demonstrate the
   generality and potential of our treatment, we apply it to other complex
   dislocation configurations, including loops and low-angle grain
   boundaries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical homeostasis-a fundamental process by which cells maintain
   stable states under environmental perturbations-is regulated by two
   subcellular mechano-transducers: cytoskeleton tension and
   integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs)(1-5). Here, we show that
   single-cell mechanical homeostasis is collectively driven by the
   distinct, graduated dynamics (rheostasis) of subcellular cytoskeleton
   tension and FAs. Such rheostasis involves a mechanosensitive pattern
   wherein ground states of cytoskeleton tension and FA determine their
   distinct reactive paths through either relaxation or reinforcement.
   Pharmacological perturbations of the cytoskeleton and molecularly
   modulated integrin catch slip bonds biased the rheostasis and induced
   non-homeostasis of FAs, but not of cytoskeleton tension, suggesting a
   unique sensitivity of FAs in regulating homeostasis. Theoretical
   modelling revealed myosin-mediated cytoskeleton contractility and
   catch-slip-bond-like behaviours in FAs and the cytoskeleton as
   sufficient and necessary mechanisms for quantitatively recapitulating
   mechanosensitive rheostasis. Our findings highlight the previously
   underappreciated physical nature of the mechanical homeostasis of cells.}},

Journal = {{SHOCK WAVES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{539-549}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The presence of shocks in scramjet internal flows introduces
   nonequilibrium of internal energy modes of the molecules. Here, the
   effect of vibrational nonequilibrium on key reactions of hydrogen-air
   combustion is studied. A quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) approach is
   used to derive reaction probability for nonequilibrium conditions using
   ab initio-derived potential energy surfaces. The reaction rates under
   nonequilibrium are studied using a two-temperature description, where
   the vibrational modes are assumed to be distributed according to a
   Boltzmann distribution at a characteristic vibrational temperature, in
   addition to a translational temperature describing the translational and
   rotational population distribution. At scramjet-relevant conditions, it
   is found that the nonequilibrium reaction rate depends not only on the
   level of vibrational excitation, but also on the reactants involved.
   Conventional two-temperature models for reaction rates, often derived
   using empirical means, were found to be inaccurate under these
   conditions, and modified parameters are proposed based on the QCT
   calculations. It is also found that models that include details of the
   reaction process through dissociation energy, for instance, provide a
   better description of nonequilibrium effects.}},

   n-heptane, n-octane, and n-decane}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a comprehensive experimental study on
   the effect of initial droplet diameter (Do) over a very wide range (0.5
   mm < D-0 < 5 mm) on the spherically symmetric droplet burning
   characteristics in the standard atmosphere of three alkanes - n-heptane,
   n-octane and n-decane - that are representative of components found in
   petroleum-based transportation fuels and their surrogates. Spherical
   symmetry in the burning process was promoted by carrying out the
   experiments in a reduced convection (stagnant ambience) and buoyancy
   (low gravity) environment using the facilities of a ground based drop
   tower for D-0 < 0.8 mm and a spaced-based platform (the International
   Space Station) for D-0 > 1.0 mm.
   The results show that for Do greater than about 2 mm, K decreases with
   increasing Do in an early period of burning and with the data being
   correlated in the form K similar to D-0(-n) based on a scale analysis of
   an energy balance on the flame. For Do larger than approximately 2 mm
   the droplet flames often disappeared indicating an extinction mechanism
   that was speculated to be due to radiative losses from the flame.
   Concurrently, measurements of wideband radiation dropped significantly
   and the burning rate gradually approached pure evaporation.
   In some instances for n-heptane and n-octane radiative extinction was
   accompanied by droplet evaporation rates that were significantly higher
   than evaporation in a hot ambience which persisted for a significant
   fraction of the burning history before decreasing to evaporation in a
   cold ambience. An energy balance on the drop related the flame
   temperature to droplet diameter from which it was predicted that flame
   temperatures after ignition were greater than 1200 K before dropping to
   under approximately 800 K and remaining constant thereafter until
   eventually reaching near ambient conditions. This intermediate regime of
   burning was conjectured to be associated with a low temperature
   combustion process. The transition to this intermediate regime upon
   radiative extinction was occasionally accompanied by flame oscillations,
   the origin of which was uncertain but could have been initiated by
   motion of the droplet owing to the deployment process. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{LES/PDF modeling of autoignition in a lifted turbulent flame: Analysis
   of flame sensitivity to differential diffusion and scalar mixing
   time-scale}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{69-86}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The stabilization of lifted flames involves a complex competition
   between small-scale mixing and propagation of flame kernels at the base
   of the flame. Here, the effect of species diffusivity on this
   stabilization process is explored. For this purpose, a large-eddy
   simulation (LES)/probability density function (PDF) methodology
   accounting for differential diffusion is developed. A dynamic model for
   scalar mixing time-scale is formulated to accurately describe the
   turbulence-driven mixing of scalars at the small scales.
   Autoignition-stabilized H-2/N-2 lifted turbulent flames in a vitiated
   coflow burner are chosen as test cases. Detailed chemical kinetics is
   used along with in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) to accelerate the
   computations. Four configuration test cases are considered: neglecting
   differential diffusion (Cases 1 and 2), considering differential
   diffusion (Case 3) and considering differential diffusion but neglecting
   molecular transport of H and H-2 (Case 4). A dynamic model for scalar
   mixing time-scale appearing in the mixing model is used in Cases 2, 3
   and 4, which removes the need to specify the value of model constant. It
   is found that the lifted flames are very sensitive to differential
   diffusion. The predictions of major species mass fractions, temperatures
   and lift-off heights are in good agreement with the experimental data.
   Further, such agreement could be achieved without changing any boundary
   conditions. In particular, increased diffusion of species upstream
   allows ignition kernels to survive turbulent dissipation, causing
   stabilization to occur upstream. H2 and H are identified as two critical
   species that play a dominant role in the differential diffusion effect.
   The model is also able to capture the change in lift-off height with
   change in coflow temperature. The results show that even in turbulent
   flames, stabilization of the flame zone can be sensitive to molecular
   diffusion. In LES computations where a significant part of this
   diffusion effect is resolved, the use of the enhanced LES/PDF/ISAT
   approach is seen as a promising approach for capturing the lift-off
   physics accurately. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Shear wave imaging can quantitatively measure tissue elasticity in vivo
   using a 2D algebraic Helmholtz inversion (AHI) equation. The 2D AHI
   equation reconstructs tissue elasticity by assuming that the shear wave
   diffraction in the elevational direction (out-of-plane direction) is not
   substantial. However, the application of 2D AHI equation is limited in
   assessing heterogeneous tissues, as the shear wave diffraction in the
   elevational direction critically affects the shear modulus
   reconstruction. A 3D AHI equation can improve the accuracy of shear
   modulus reconstruction for heterogeneous tissues. In this study, a
   finite element (FE) based shear wave simulation was performed on an
   early stage of cancer and an advanced cancer tissue model. The shear
   modulus of FE model computed by the proposed 3D AHI equation was
   compared to the 2D AHI equation. The 3D AM equation substantially
   improved accuracy of shear modulus computation especially for the early
   stage of cancer model. The results from the shear modulus of inclusion
   by the 3D AHI equation produced the same as the input value of 150 kPa
   and two times lower variation than the shear modulus obtained by the 2D
   AHI equation.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitive and reproducible platforms have been developed for detection,
   isolation, and enrichment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-rare cells
   that enter the blood from solid tumors, including those of the breast,
   prostate gland, lung, pancreas, and colon. These might be used as
   biomarkers in diagnosis or determination of prognosis. CTCs are no
   longer simply detected and quantified; they are now used in ex vivo
   studies of anticancer agents and early detection. We review what we have
   recently learned about CTCs from pancreatic tumors, describing advances
   in their isolation and analysis and challenges to their clinical
   utility. We summarize technologies used to isolate CTCs from blood
   samples of patients with pancreatic cancer, including immunoaffinity and
   label-free physical attribute-based capture. We explain methods of CTC
   analysis and how findings from these studies might be used to detect
   cancer at earlier stages, monitor disease progression, and determine
   prognosis. We review studies that have expanded CTCs for testing of
   anticancer agents and how these approaches might be used to personalize
   treatment. Advances in the detection, isolation, and analysis of CTCs
   have increased our understanding of the dissemination and progression of
   pancreatic cancer. However, standardization of methodologies and
   prospective studies are needed for this emerging technology to have a
   significant effect on clinical care.}},

Abstract = {{Enforcing constraints on the maximum deliverable power is essential to
   protect lithium-ion batteries and to maximize resource utilization. This
   paper describes an algorithm to address the estimation of power
   capability of battery systems accounting for thermal and electrical
   constraints. The algorithm is based on model inversion to compute the
   limiting currents and, hence, power capability. The adequacy of model
   inversion significantly depends on the accuracy of model states and
   parameters. Herein, these are estimated by designing cascading
   estimators whose structure is determined by quantifying the relative
   estimability of states and parameters. The parameterized battery model
   and the estimation algorithms are integrated with a power management
   system in a model of a series hybrid electric vehicle to demonstrate
   their effectiveness.}},

   governs the throttle command, and the outer-loop governs the requested

   results are presented, showing that both designs enforce the surge
   constraint without the use of a compressor bypass valve, but that the
   inner-loop design requires scheduling in order to do so.}},

Abstract = {{Gaussian random fields are a powerful tool for modeling environmental
   processes. For high dimensional samples, classical approaches for
   estimating the covariance parameters require highly challenging and
   massive computations, such as the evaluation of the Cholesky
   factorization or solving linear systems. Recently, Anitescu et al.
   (2014) proposed a fast and scalable algorithm which does not need such
   burdensome computations. The main focus of this article is to study the
   asymptotic behavior of the algorithm of Anitescu et al. (ACS) for
   regular and irregular grids in the increasing domain setting.
   Consistency, minimax optimality and asymptotic normality of this
   algorithm are proved under mild differentiability conditions on the
   covariance function. Despite the fact that ACS's method entails a
   non-concave maximization, our results hold for any stationary point of
   the objective function. A numerical study is presented to evaluate the
   efficiency of this algorithm for large data sets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS}},

Volume = {{447}},
Pages = {{300-306}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a small-scale resistance spot welding method was utilized
   to join two dissimilar Zr-based bulk metallic glasses and to fabricate
   the sandwich-laminated metallic glass plates. The laminates exhibit an
   almost fully amorphous structure without undesirable crystallization.
   Elemental line scanning across the joint interface shows a uniform
   distribution of the main elements, demonstrating favorable metallurgical
   bond in the laminate. The resultant tensile strength of the welded
   laminate is comparable to that of the parent metallic glasses. The
   fractured surface of the laminate exhibits extensive multiple failure
   planes, suggesting that the fracture instability was mediated by a crack
   branching mechanism over across the joint interface. Such a crack
   branching mechanism results in a stepwise fracture behavior which is
   contrastingly different from the conventional single primary shear band
   dominated catastrophic fracture in monolithic metallic glasses under
   tension. The unique stepwise fracture behavior endows the sandwiched
   metallic glass laminates with an excessive strain energy absorption
   through the joint interface than monolithic metallic glasses. Our
   results demonstrate that small-scale resistance spot welding is a
   promising approach to scaling up metallic glasses and to fabricating
   metallic glass laminates with desirable mechanical performance for
   structural applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Possessing the unique properties of lower mass and higher performances,
   the structure with Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) can be widely used in
   aerospace and vehicle industry. By combing the NPR structure filled core
   and the traditional crash box, a novel NPR crash box is first proposed
   in this work to improve the performances of the crash box. The
   performances of the novel NPR crash box are fully studied by comparing
   to the traditional crash box and the aluminum foam filled crash box. A
   parameterized model of the NPR crash box, which integrates the design
   parameters of the basic NPR cell structure, is built to improve the
   analysis and optimization efficiency, the accuracy of the parameterized
   model is also verified by comparing to traditional FEM model.
   Multi-objective optimization model of the NPR crash box is established
   by combining the parameterized model, optimal Latin square design method
   and response surface model approach. Non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is then applied to optimize the design parameters
   of the basic NPR cell structure to improve the performances of the NPR
   crash box. The results indicate that the novel NPR crash box can improve
   the performances of the crash box remarkably and the combination of
   parameterized model and multi-objective genetic algorithms optimize the
   NPR crash box efficiently. The presented new method also serves as a
   good example for other application and optimization of NPR structure.}},

Title = {{A mechanism of basal spacing reduction in sodium smectitic clay
   materials in contact with DNAPL wastes}},

Abstract = {{There has been concern regarding the possible attack of clays in
   aquitards, slurry walls and landfill liners by dense nonaqueous phase
   liquid (DNAPL) wastes, resulting in cracking. Despite the fact that a
   reduction in basal spacing in sodium smectitic clay materials has been
   linked to cracking, no plausible mechanism by which this reduction
   occurs in contact with waste DNAPLs has been formulated. To elucidate a
   mechanism, screening studies were conducted that showed that the
   combination of an anionic surfactant (AOT), a nonionic surfactant
   (TritonX-100) and a chlorinated solvent, tetrachloroethylene (PCE),
   could replicate the basal spacing reduction and cracking behavior of
   water-saturated bentonite caused by two waste DNAPLs obtained from the
   field. FTIR measurements of this system showed a displacement of the
   H-O-H bending band of water symptomatic of desiccation. Sorption
   measurements showed that the uptake of AOT by bentonite increased eight
   fold in the presence of TritonX-100 and PCE. The evidence presented here
   supports a mechanism of syneresis, involving the extraction of water
   from the interlayer space of the clay through the synergistic sorption
   of a nonionic and anionic surfactant mixture. It is speculated that the
   solvation of water in reverse micellar aggregates is the process driving
   the syneresis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Bubbly shock propagation as a mechanism for sheet-to-cloud transition of
   partial cavities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{802}},
Pages = {{37-78}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Partial cavitation in the separated region forming from the apex of a
   wedge is examined to reveal the flow mechanism responsible for the
   transition from stable sheet cavity to periodically shedding cloud
   cavitation. High-speed visualization and time-resolved X-ray
   densitometry measurements are used to examine the cavity dynamics,
   including the time-resolved void-fraction fields within the cavity. The
   experimentally observed time-averaged void-fraction profiles are
   compared to an analytical model employing free-streamline theory. From
   the instantaneous void-fraction flow fields, two distinct shedding
   mechanisms are identified. The classically described re-entrant flow in
   the cavity closure is confirmed as a mechanism for vapour entrainment
   and detachment that leads to intermittent shedding of smaller-scale
   cavities. But, with a sufficient reduction in cavitation number,
   large-scale periodic cloud shedding is associated with the formation and
   propagation of a bubbly shock within the high void-fraction bubbly
   mixture in the separated cavity flow. When the shock front impinges on
   flow at the wedge apex, a large cloud is pinched off. For periodic
   shedding, the speed of the front in the laboratory frame is of the order
   of half the free-stream speed. The features of the observed condensation
   shocks are related to the average and dynamic pressure and void fraction
   using classical one-dimensional jump conditions. The sound speed of the
   bubbly mixture is estimated to determine the Mach number of the cavity
   flow. The transition from intermittent to transitional to strongly
   periodic shedding occurs when the average Mach number of the cavity flow
   exceeds that required for the generation of strong shocks.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{104-113}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) forms multiple micro-cracks
   under tension when loaded to beyond the elastic stage. Unlike normal
   concrete, such tight cracks help to maintain low water permeability even
   in the cracked stage. Therefore ECC shows great potential for
   application in hydraulic structures, such as dams and levees for which
   water seepage control is critical for their performance. In this paper,
   the permeability of ECC under constant tensile load was experimentally
   studied using a specially designed displacement-control loading device,
   providing permeability data for ECC under realistic loading conditions.
   In addition, an analytical model capable of predicting permeability
   property of ECC composite based on tensile strain and crack patterns has
   been proposed and experimentally verified on two different ECC mixtures.
   The findings of this research are expected to support future design and
   application of ECC for hydraulic structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{56-70}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Wind energy has experienced a continuous cost reduction in the last
   decades. A popular cost reduction technique is to increase the rated
   power of the wind turbine by making it larger. However, it is not clear
   whether further upscaling of the existing wind turbines beyond the 5-7
   MW range is technically feasible and economically attractive. To address
   this question, this study uses 5, 10, and 20 MW wind turbines that are
   developed using multidisciplinary design optimization as upscaling data
   points. These wind turbines are upwind, 3-bladed, pitch-regulated,
   variable-speed machines with a tubular tower. Based on the design data
   and properties of these wind turbines, scaling trends such as loading,
   mass, and cost are developed. These trends are used to study the
   technical and economical aspects of upscaling and its impact on the
   design and cost. The results of this research show the technical
   feasibility of the existing wind turbines up to 20 MW, but the design of
   such an upscaled machine is cost prohibitive. Mass increase of the rotor
   is identified as a main design challenge to overcome. The results of
   this research support the development of alternative lightweight
   materials and design concepts such as a two-bladed downwind design for
   upscaling to remain a cost effective solution for future wind turbines.

Abstract = {{Supervoxel segmentation has strong potential to be incorporated into
   early video analysis as superpixel segmentation has in image analysis.
   However, there are many plausible supervoxel methods and little
   understanding as to when and where each is most appropriate. Indeed, we
   are not aware of a single comparative study on supervoxel segmentation.
   To that end, we study seven supervoxel algorithms, including both
   off-line and streaming methods, in the context of what we consider to be
   a good supervoxel: namely, spatiotemporal uniformity, object/region
   boundary detection, region compression and parsimony. For the evaluation
   we propose a comprehensive suite of seven quality metrics to measure
   these desirable supervoxel characteristics. In addition, we evaluate the
   methods in a supervoxel classification task as a proxy for subsequent
   high-level uses of the supervoxels in video analysis. We use six
   existing benchmark video datasets with a variety of content-types and
   dense human annotations. Our findings have led us to conclusive evidence
   that the hierarchical graph-based (GBH), segmentation by weighted
   aggregation (SWA) and temporal superpixels (TSP) methods are the
   top-performers among the seven methods. They all perform well in terms
   of segmentation accuracy, but vary in regard to the other desiderata:
   GBH captures object boundaries best; SWA has the best potential for
   region compression; and TSP achieves the best undersegmentation error.}},

Title = {{An optimally diffusive Coarse Mesh Finite Difference method to
   accelerate neutron transport calculations}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{116-124}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A new optimally diffusive Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (odCMFD) method
   is proposed. The new method generalizes the Coarse Mesh Finite
   Difference (CMFD) and partial current-based CMFD (pCMFD) methods by
   adding an artificial term to the diffusion coefficient. The standard
   CMFD and pCMFD methods preserve the net current and partial currents
   respectively and can greatly reduce the spectral radius for solving
   neutron transport problems. Linearized Fourier analysis shows that these
   methods essentially differ only by the definition of the diffusion
   coefficient - the pCMFD diffusion coefficient contains an additional
   ``artificial{''} term, usually taken to be,A the coarse mesh size. In
   this paper, the magnitude of the artificially diffusive term is
   numerically investigated and optimized using Fourier analysis. The
   results show that the optimal coefficient increases as the coarse cell
   optical thicicness increases. Also, the optimal value is always smaller
   than the pCMFD value. This indicates that the pCMFD method overcorrects
   the diffusion coefficient which increases the spectral radius. A simple
   polynomial fitting was found for implementing the odCMFD in the MPACT
   code to perform calculations for realistic problems. Numerical MPACT
   results for a two-region homogeneous problem, a 2D C5G7 problem, a VERA
   problem 5 and a 2D BWR Peach Bottom Unit 2 core problem agree well with
   the Fourier analysis and confirm previous research results that: (1)
   CMFD converges faster than pCMFD for optically thin coarse grids, but
   CMFD diverges for optically.thick coarse grids; (2) pCMFD is
   unconditionally stable for all coarse grids; and show that the newly
   proposed odCMFD is the most efficient among these three methods for all
   cases. The new method has a similar convergence rate as CMFD for
   optically thin coarse grids, is faster than both CMFD and pCMFD for
   coarse grids with intermediate optical thickness, and is unconditionally
   stable and faster than pCMFD for optically thick coarse grids. Published

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper deploys a recently proposed, biologically inspired, on-line,
   search-based optimization technique called Selective Evolutionary
   Generation Systems (SEGS) for control purposes; here, to evolve Micro
   Air Vehicle (MAV) flapping wing gaits in changing flight conditions to
   maintain hovering flight and track trajectories in unsteady airflow. The
   SEGS technique has several advantages, including: (1) search efficiency,
   by optimally trading off prior search space information for search
   effort savings as quickly as possible in dynamic environments; (2)
   model-independence, as in biology, avoiding biases induced by built-in
   models rendered incorrect by environment changes; and (3) resilience,
   through sufficiency for stochastic behavior that is itself sufficient
   for responsiveness to search-objective variations caused by environment
   fluctuations. This work presents the first approach that can
   simultaneously evolve optimal MAV flapping wing gaits efficiently and
   resiliently, adapt on-line, and, via model-independence, allow feedback
   from either experimental sensors or alternate external models (affording
   control versatility for hover or forward flight, unsteady or
   quasi-steady aerodynamics, and any dynamics or wing kinematics).
   Performance benchmarks are also provided. Because the (1+1)-Evolution
   Strategy (ES) and the Canonical Genetic Algorithm with Fitness
   Proportional Selection (CGAFPS) are two SEGS special extreme cases, an
   additional comparison showcases SEGS possession of both (1+1)-ES
   computational speed and CGAFPS resilience. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The infrared imager onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental
   Satellite 15 (GOES-15) provides temporally continuous observations over
   a limited spatial domain. To quantify bias of the GOES-15 imager,
   observations from four infrared channels (2, 3, 4, and 6) are compared
   with simulations from the numerical weather prediction model and
   radiative transfer model. One-day clear-sky infrared observations from
   the GOES-15 imager over an oceanic domain during nighttime are selected.
   Two datasets, Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis and ERAInterim
   reanalysis, are used as inputs to the radiative transfer model. The
   results show that magnitudes of biases for the GOES-15 surface channels
   are approximately 1 K using two datasets, whereas the magnitude of bias
   for the GOES-15 water vapor channel can reach 5.5 K using the GFS
   dataset and 2.5 K using the ERA dataset. The GOES- 15 surface channels
   show positive dependencies on scene temperature, whereas the water vapor
   channel has a weak dependence on scene temperature. The strong
   dependence of bias on sensor zenith angle for the GOES-15 water vapor
   channel using GFS analysis implies large biases might exist in GFS water
   vapor profiles.}},

   strain energy densities contributed by normal and shear deformation and
   each weighted by a path-dependent function. Then, the MLP-based damage
   parameter in terms of either equivalent stress range or strain range, in
   conjunction with path-dependent maximum-range cycle counting procedure
   (Dong et al., 2010; Wei and Dong, 2010), has been shown effective in
   correlating a large amount of test data obtained under non-proportional
   multi-axial loading conditions both for welded joints under stress
   controlled conditions in high cycle fatigue regime and non-welded
   components under strain controlled conditions in low-cycle regime. (C)

Abstract = {{Unlike phonon-boundary resistance at the interface of two dissimilar

   Using nonequilibrium, classical molecular dynamic simulations on
   bicrystal UO2 over 300-1200 K, we predict that AR(p,gb) (i.e., phonon,
   grain mean free path) is independent of temperature and the grain
   boundary type (e.g., tilt, twist). We compare these predictions with
   existing analytical models and identify those which include the proper
   grain-boundary phonon scattering mechanisms. Also, using the same
   embedded-atom interatomic potential models, we predict the phonon
   dispersion, density of states and bulk thermal conductivity of UO2, and
   verify the predictions (comparing with available ab initio molecular
   dynamics and experimental results), under equilibrium and nonequilibrium

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that representation of surface spectral
   emissivity has a non negligible impact on the polar radiation budget and
   on simulated climate. This fact motivates the inclusion of surface
   spectral emissivity into the radiative transfer scheme employed in the
   climate models. Using a line-by-line radiative transfer model, LBLRTM,
   as a benchmark, we quantify the errors due to the approximation of
   surface spectral emissivity in the RRTMG\_LW, a radiation scheme widely
   used by climate models and numerical forecast models. Error
   quantifications are done using representative sounding profiles in the
   tropics, mid-latitude summer, sub-arctic winter and Sahara desert
   interfaced with either ocean or desert spectral emissivities. Though
   including surface emissivity causes little difference in broadband
   outgoing longwave radiation, it can cause noticeable differences in
   longwave radiative cooling rate from surface to 700 hPa. Compared to the
   benchmark, the largest deviation in radiative cooling rate usually
   happens at the lowest atmospheric layers next to the surface, ranging
   from -0.23 K/day to 0.19 K/day with the largest fractional difference
   being -16.22\%. The discrepancies caused solely by the representation of
   surface emissivity are confined at the lowest atmospheric layer. Using
   the emissivity at the diffusive angle or the hemispherically averaged
   emissivity can affect the calculation accuracy, especially for strongly
   anisotropic surface emission. The band-by-band contribution to the
   discrepancies between the RRTMG\_LW and benchmark reveals compensating
   errors among the bands used in the RRTMG\_LW. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been in use for many decades. To date, it
   has been primarily aimed at treating organic wastes, mainly manures and
   wastewater sludge, and industrial wastewaters. However, with the current
   advancements, a more open mind is required to look beyond these somewhat
   restricted original applications of AD. Biorefineries are such concepts,
   where multiple products including chemicals, fuels, polymers etc. are
   produced from organic feedstocks. The anaerobic biorefinery concept is
   now gaining increased attention, utilizing AD as the final disposal
   step. This review aims at evaluating the potential significance of
   anaerobic biorefineries, including types of feedstocks, uses for the
   produced energy, as well as sustainable applications of the generated
   residual digestate. A comprehensive analysis of various types of
   anaerobic biorefineries has been developed, including both large-scale
   and household level applications. Finally, future directives are
   highlighted showing how anaerobic biorefinery concept could impact the
   bioeconomy in the near future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Taxis play important roles in modern urban transportation systems,
   especially in mega cities. While providing necessary amenities, taxis
   also significantly contribute to traffic congestion, urban energy
   consumption, and air pollution. Understanding the travel patterns of
   taxis is thus important for addressing many urban sustainability
   challenges. Previous research has primarily focused on examining the
   statistical properties of passenger trips, which include only taxi trips
   occupied with passengers. However, unoccupied trips are also important
   for urban sustainability issues because they represent potential
   opportunities to improve the efficiency of the transportation system.
   Therefore, we need to understand the travel patterns of taxis as an
   integrated system, instead of focusing only on the occupied trips. In
   this study we examine GPS trajectory data of 11,880 taxis in Beijing,
   China for a period of three weeks. Our results show that taxi travel
   patterns share similar traits with travel patterns of individuals but
   also exhibit differences. Trip displacement distribution of taxi travels
   is statistically greater than the exponential distribution and smaller
   than the truncated power-law distribution. The distribution of short
   trips (less than 30 miles) can be best fitted with power-law while long
   trips follow exponential decay. We use radius of gyration to
   characterize individual taxi's travel distance and find that it does not
   follow a truncated power-law as observed in previous studies. Spatial
   and temporal regularities exist in taxi travels. However, with
   increasing spatial coverage, taxi trips can exhibit dual high
   probability density centers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Actin dynamics provides membrane tension to merge fusing vesicles into
   the plasma membrane}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Vesicle fusion is executed via formation of an Omega-shaped structure
   (Omega-profile), followed by closure (kiss-and-run) or merging of the
   Omega-profile into the plasma membrane (full fusion). Although
   Omega-profile closure limits release but recycles vesicles economically,
   Omega-profile merging facilitates release but couples to classical
   endocytosis for recycling. Despite its crucial role in determining
   exocytosis/endocytosis modes, how Omega-profile merging is mediated is
   poorly understood in endocrine cells and neurons containing small
   similar to 30-300 nm vesicles. Here, using confocal and super-resolution
   STED imaging, force measurements, pharmacology and gene knockout, we
   show that dynamic assembly of filamentous actin, involving ATP
   hydrolysis, N-WASP and formin, mediates Omega-profile merging by
   providing sufficient plasma membrane tension to shrink the Omega-profile
   in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells containing similar to 300 nm
   vesicles. Actin-directed compounds also induce Omega-profile
   accumulation at lamprey synaptic active zones, suggesting that actin may
   mediate Omega-profile merging at synapses. These results uncover
   molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying Omega-profile merging.}},

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4) impacts climate as the second strongest anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas and air quality by influencing tropospheric ozone levels.
   Space-based observations have identified the Four Corners region in the
   Southwest United States as an area of large CH4 enhancements. We
   conducted an airborne campaign in Four Corners during April 2015 with
   the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer
   (near-infrared) and Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (thermal
   infrared) imaging spectrometers to better understand the source of
   methane by measuring methane plumes at 1-to 3-m spatial resolution. Our
   analysis detected more than 250 individual methane plumes from fossil
   fuel harvesting, processing, and distributing infrastructures, spanning
   an emission range from the detection limit similar to 2 kg/h to 5 kg/h
   through similar to 5,000 kg/h. Observed sources include gas processing
   facilities, storage tanks, pipeline leaks, and well pads, as well as a
   coal mine venting shaft. Overall, plume enhancements and inferred fluxes
   follow a lognormal distribution, with the top 10\% emitters contributing
   49 to 66\% to the inferred total point source flux of 0.23 Tg/y to 0.39
   Tg/y. With the observed confirmation of a lognormal emission
   distribution, this airborne observing strategy and its ability to locate
   previously unknown point sources in real time provides an efficient and
   effective method to identify and mitigate major emissions contributors
   over a wide geographic area. With improved instrumentation, this
   capability scales to spaceborne applications {[}Thompson DR, et al.
   (2016) Geophys Res Lett 43(12): 6571-6578]. Further illustration of this
   potential is demonstrated with two detected, confirmed, and repaired
   pipeline leaks during the campaign.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state electrolytes such as cubic Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) can
   enable solid-state batteries, metallic lithium anodes and higher voltage
   cathodes. However, the stability of cubic LLZO is affected by current
   density. In beta alumina solid electrolyte, microstructural failure was
   caused by Na dendrite penetration, and was shown to be a function of the
   fracture toughness, K-IC. The relationship between dendrite penetration
   and K-IC indicates electronic failure is related to creation of
   microstructural damage, and the microstructural damage may be used as an
   indicator of imminent electronic failure. To monitor micro structural
   damage during cycling, we developed a non-invasive, in-situ cell
   monitoring apparatus to help to correlate mechanical stability with
   Li-ion current density in LLZO. A pulse-echo transducer was integrated
   into all solid-state Li-LLZO-Li cells. The capability enables the
   characterization of microscopic inhomogeneities through the careful
   measurement of changes to the elastic moduli. The elastic moduli and
   fracture toughness have been previously reported for dense (>99\%)
   specimens, but monitoring of the relative change in moduli during
   cycling has not been explored. In this study, an acoustic monitoring
   method is presented to monitor LLZO specimens during cycling. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Historically, alloy development with better radiation performance has
   been focused on traditional alloys with one or two principal element(s)
   and minor alloying elements, where enhanced radiation resistance depends
   on microstructural or nanoscale features to mitigate displacement
   damage. In sharp contrast to traditional alloys, recent advances of
   single-phase concentrated solid solution alloys (SP-CSAs) have opened up
   new frontiers in materials research. In these alloys, a random
   arrangement of multiple elemental species on a crystalline lattice
   results in disordered local chemical environments and unique
   site-to-site lattice distortions. Based on closely integrated
   computational and experimental studies using a novel set of SP-CSAs in a
   face-centered cubic structure, we have explicitly demonstrated that
   increasing chemical disorder can lead to a substantial reduction in
   electron mean free paths, as well as electrical and thermal
   conductivity, which results in slower heat dissipation in SP-CSAs. The
   chemical disorder also has a significant impact on defect evolution
   under ion irradiation. Considerable improvement in radiation resistance
   is observed with increasing chemical disorder at electronic and atomic
   levels. The insights into defect dynamics may provide a basis for
   understanding elemental effects on evolution of radiation damage in
   irradiated materials and may inspire new design principles of
   radiation-tolerant structural alloys for advanced energy systems.}},

   evaluated at ultimate transient operation, i.e. ultimate utopia point.
   Recursive feasibility and stability of the scheme are established by a
   closed-loop optimisation dual-mode formulation. Moreover, convergence of
   the closed-loop average performance is established in the context of
   multiobjective optimisation. The theoretical results are illustrated by
   two examples of chemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{NASA Aqua-derived thermodynamic profiles, calculated spectral clear-sky
   outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and vertical velocity fields from
   meteorological reanalyses are combined to determine the relative
   proportion of the far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectral
   contributions to the total clear-sky OLR during different phases of El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the ascending branch of the
   tropical circulation, the spatial variance of upper tropospheric water
   vapor is shown to be larger during La Nina than El Nino and is
   consistent with zonal symmetry changes in the tropical waveguide and
   associated tropical-extratropical mixing. In the descending branch,
   upper tropospheric water vapor shows weaker coupling to lower layers
   that is evidenced by changes in the ratio of FIR to MIR in the clear-sky
   OLR. Diagnostics from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AM3
   model simulation are generally similar to satellite data, but the ratio
   of FIR to MIR is 5-10\% larger with respect to dynamic regime.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric observations of greenhouse gases provide essential
   information on sources and sinks of these key atmospheric constituents.
   To quantify fluxes from atmospheric observations, representation of
   transport-especially vertical mixing-is a necessity and often a source
   of error. We report on remotely sensed profiles of vertical aerosol
   distribution taken over a 2 year period in Pasadena, California. Using
   an automated analysis system, we estimate daytime mixing layer depth,
   achieving high confidence in the afternoon maximum on 51\% of days with
   profiles from a Sigma Space Mini Micropulse LiDAR (MiniMPL) and on 36\%
   of days with a Vaisala CL51 ceilometer. We note that considering
   ceilometer data on a logarithmic scale, a standard method, introduces,
   an offset in mixing height retrievals. The mean afternoon maximum mixing
   height is 770 m Above Ground Level in summer and 670 m in winter, with
   significant day-to-day variance (within season sigma = 220 m approximate
   to 30\%). Taking advantage of the MiniMPL's portability, we demonstrate
   the feasibility of measuring the detailed horizontal structure of the
   mixing layer by automobile. We compare our observations to planetary
   boundary layer (PBL) heights from sonde launches, North American
   regional reanalysis (NARR), and a custom Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model developed for greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring in
   Los Angeles. NARR and WRF PBL heights at Pasadena are both
   systematically higher than measured, NARR by 2.5 times; these biases
   will cause proportional errors in GHG flux estimates using modeled
   transport. We discuss how sustained lidar observations can be used to
   reduce flux inversion error by selecting suitable analysis periods,
   calibrating models, or characterizing bias for correction in post
   processing.}},

   recovery in superelasticity tests where 350 degrees C-18 h aged samples
   exhibited almost perfect superelasticity with 95\% recovery ratio with
   5.5\% strain in the first cycle and stabilized superelasticity with a

Abstract = {{The Land Surface, Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project
   (LS3MIP) is designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of land
   surface, snow and soil moisture feedbacks on climate variability and
   climate change, and to diagnose systematic biases in the land modules of
   current Earth system models (ESMs). The solid and liquid water stored at
   the land surface has a large influence on the regional climate, its
   variability and predictability, including effects on the energy, water
   and carbon cycles. Notably, snow and soil moisture affect surface
   radiation and flux partitioning properties, moisture storage and land
   surface memory. They both strongly affect atmospheric conditions, in
   particular surface air temperature and precipitation, but also
   large-scale circulation patterns. However, models show divergent
   responses and representations of these feedbacks as well as systematic
   biases in the underlying processes. LS3MIP will provide the means to
   quantify the associated uncertainties and better constrain climate
   change projections, which is of particular interest for highly
   vulnerable regions (densely populated areas, agricultural regions, the
   Arctic, semi-arid and other sensitive terrestrial ecosystems).
   The experiments are subdivided in two components, the first addressing
   systematic land biases in offline mode ({''}LMIP{''}, building upon the
   3rd phase of Global Soil Wetness Project; GSWP3) and the second
   addressing land feedbacks attributed to soil moisture and snow in an
   integrated framework ({''}LFMIP{''}, building upon the GLACE-CMIP
   blueprint).}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric films have vast applications due to
   their dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties that meet
   the requirements of sensors, nonvolatile ferroelectric random access
   memory (NVFeRAM) devices, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).
   However, the small surface area of these 2D ferroelectric films has
   limited their ability to achieve higher memory storage density in
   NVFeRAM devices and more sensitive sensors and transducer. Thus,
   conformally deposited ferroelectric films have been actively studied for
   these applications in order to create three-dimensional (3D) structures,
   which lead to a larger surface area. Most of the current methods
   developed for the conformal deposition of ferroelectric films, such as
   metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and plasma-enhanced
   vapor deposition (PECVD), are limited by high temperatures and unstable
   and toxic organic precursors. In this paper, an innovative fabrication
   method for barium titanate (BaTiO3) textured films with 3D architectures
   is introduced to alleviate these issues. This fabrication method is
   based on converting conformally grown rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays into
   BaTiO3 textured films using a simple two-step hydrothermal process which
   allows for thickness-controlled growth of conformal films on patterned
   silicon wafers coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Moreover, the
   processing parameters have been optimized to achieve a high
   piezoelectric coupling coefficient of 100 pm/V. This high piezoelectric
   response along with high relative dielectric constant (epsilon(r) =
   1600) of the conformally grown textured BaTiO3 films demonstrates their
   potential application in sensors, NVFeRAM, and MEMS.}},

Abstract = {{Annular quasimonoenergetic electron beams with a mean energy in the
   range 200-400 MeV and charge on the order of several picocoulombs were
   generated in a laser wakefield accelerator and subsequently accelerated
   using a plasma afterburner in a two-stage gas cell. Generation of these
   beams is associated with injection occurring on the density down ramp
   between the stages. This well-localized injection produces a bunch of
   electrons performing coherent betatron oscillations in the wakefield,
   resulting in a significant increase in the x-ray yield. Annular electron
   distributions are detected in 40\% of shots under optimal conditions.
   Simultaneous control of the pulse duration and frequency chirp enables
   optimization of both the energy and the energy spread of the annular
   beam and boosts the radiant energy per unit charge by almost an order of
   magnitude. These well-defined annular distributions of electrons are a
   promising source of high-brightness laser plasma-based x rays.}},

Abstract = {{The current high mortality rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC)
   reflects frequent presentation at an advanced stage. Recent efforts
   utilizing fluorescent peptides have identified overexpressed cell
   surface targets for endoscopic detection of early stage
   Barrett's-derived EAC. Unfortunately, 30\% of EAC patients present with
   gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas ( GEJAC) and lack premalignant
   Barrett's metaplasia, limiting this early detection strategy. We
   compared mRNA profiles from 52 EACs ( tubular EAC; tEAC) collected above
   the gastroesophageal junction with 70 GEJACs, 8 normal esophageal and 5
   normal gastric mucosa samples. We also analyzed our previously published
   whole-exome sequencing data in a large cohort of these tumors. Principal
   component analysis, hierarchical clustering and survival-based analyses
   demonstrated that GEJAC and tEAC were highly similar, with only modest
   differences in expression and mutation profiles. The combined expression
   cohort allowed identification of 49 genes coding cell surface targets
   overexpressed in both GEJAC and tEAC. We confirmed that three of these
   candidates ( CDH11, ICAM1 and CLDN3) were overexpressed in tumors when
   compared to normal esophagus, normal gastric and non-dysplastic
   Barrett's, and localized to the surface of tumor cells. Molecular
   profiling of tEAC and GEJAC tumors indicated extensive similarity and
   related molecular processes. Identified genes that encode cell surface
   proteins overexpressed in both Barrett's-derived EAC and those that
   arise without Barrett's metaplasia will allow simultaneous detection
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic spectrum analysis (PASA) has been demonstrated as a new
   method for quantitative tissue imaging and characterization. The ability
   of PASA in evaluating micro-size tissue features was limited by the
   bandwidth of detectors for photoacoustic (PA) signal acquisition. We
   improve upon such a limit, and report on developments of PASA
   facilitated by an optical ultrasonic detector based on micro-ring
   resonator. The detector's broad and flat frequency response
   significantly improves the performance of PASA and extents its
   characterization capability from the tissue level to cellular level. The
   performance of the system in characterizing cellular level (a few
   microns) stochastic objects was first shown via a study on
   size-controlled optically absorbing phantoms. As a further demonstration
   of PASA's potential clinical application, it was employed to
   characterize the morphological changes of red blood cells (RBCs) from a
   biconcave shape to a spherical shape as a result of aging. This work
   demonstrates that PASA equipped with the micro-ring ultrasonic detectors
   is an effective technique in characterizing cellular-level
   micro-features of biological samples. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Title = {{Towards developing a compact model for magnetization switching in
   straintronics magnetic random access memory devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Strain-mediated magnetization switching in a magnetic tunneling junction
   (MTJ) by exploiting a combination of piezoelectricity and
   magnetostriction has been proposed as an energy efficient alternative to
   spin transfer torque (STT) and field induced magnetization switching
   methods in MTJ-based magnetic random access memories (MRAM). Theoretical
   studies have shown the inherent advantages of strain-assisted switching,
   and the dynamic response of the magnetization has been modeled using the
   Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. However, an attempt to use LLG
   for simulating dynamics of individual elements in large-scale
   simulations of multi-megabyte straintronics MRAM leads to extremely
   time-consuming calculations. Hence, a compact analytical solution,
   predicting the flipping delay of the magnetization vector in the
   nanomagnet under stress, combined with a liberal approximation of the
   LLG dynamics in the straintronics MTJ, can lead to a simplified model of
   the device suited for fast large-scale simulations of multi-megabyte
   straintronics MRAMs. In this work, a tensor-based approach is developed
   to study the dynamic behavior of the stressed nanomagnet. First, using
   the developed method, the effect of stress on the switching behavior of
   the magnetization is investigated to realize the margins between the
   underdamped and overdamped regimes. The latter helps the designer
   realize the oscillatory behavior of the magnetization when settling
   along the minor axis, and the dependency of oscillations on the stress
   level and the damping factor. Next, a theoretical model to predict the
   flipping delay of the magnetization vector is developed and tested
   against LLG-based numerical simulations to confirm the accuracy of
   findings. Lastly, the obtained delay is incorporated into the
   approximate solutions of the LLG dynamics, in order to create a compact
   model to liberally and quickly simulate the magnetization dynamics of
   the MTJ under stress. Using the developed delay equation, the efficiency
   of the straintronics switching over the STT method is highlighted by
   analytically investigating the energy-delay trade-off of both
   methodologies. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only near-infrared dye approved by the
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. When injected in
   blood, ICG binds primarily to plasma proteins and lipoproteins,
   resulting in enhanced fluorescence. Recently, the optofluidic laser has
   emerged as a novel tool in bio-analysis. Laser emission has advantages
   over fluorescence in signal amplification, narrow linewidth, and strong
   intensity, leading to orders of magnitude increase in detection
   sensitivity and imaging contrast. Here we successfully demonstrate, to
   the best of our knowledge, the first ICG lasing in human serum and whole
   blood with the clinical ICG concentrations and the pump intensity far
   below the clinically permissible level. Furthermore, we systematically
   study ICG laser emission within each major serological component
   (albumins, globulins, and lipoproteins) and reveal the critical elements
   and conditions responsible for lasing. Our work marks a critical step
   toward eventual clinical and biomedical applications of optofluidic
   lasers using FDA approved fluorophores, which may complement or even
   supersede conventional fluorescence-based sensing and imaging. (C) 2016

Title = {{In vivo biodistribution and physiologically based pharmacokinetic
   modeling of inhaled fresh and aged cerium oxide nanoparticles in rats}},
Journal = {{PARTICLE AND FIBRE TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles used as a diesel fuel
   additive can be emitted into the ambient air leading to human
   inhalation. Although biological studies have shown CeO2 nanoparticles
   can cause adverse health effects, the extent of the biodistribution of
   CeO2 nanoparticles through inhalation has not been well characterized.
   Furthermore, freshly emitted CeO2 nanoparticles can undergo an aging
   process by interaction with other ambient airborne pollutants that may
   influence the biodistribution after inhalation. Therefore, understanding
   the pharmacokinetic of newly-generated and atmospherically-aged CeO2
   nanoparticles is needed to assess the risks to human health.
   Methods: A novel experimental system was designed to integrate the
   generation, aging, and inhalation exposure of Sprague Dawley rats to
   combustion-generated CeO2 nanoparticles (25 and 90 nm bimodal
   distribution). Aging was done in a chamber representing typical ambient
   urban air conditions with UV lights. Following a single 4-hour nose-only
   exposure to freshly emitted or aged CeO2 for 15 min, 24 h, and 7 days,
   ICP-MS detection of Ce in the blood, lungs, gastrointestinal tract,
   liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, brain, olfactory bulb, urine, and feces
   were analyzed with a mass balance approach to gain an overarching
   understanding of the distribution. A physiologically based
   pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that includes mucociliary clearance,
   phagocytosis, and entry into the systemic circulation by alveolar wall
   penetration was developed to predict the biodistribution kinetic of the
   inhaled CeO2 nanoparticles.
   Results: Cerium was predominantly recovered in the lungs and feces, with
   extrapulmonary organs contributing less than 4 \% to the recovery rate
   at 24 h post exposure. No significant differences in biodistribution
   patterns were found between fresh and aged CeO2 nanoparticles. The PBPK
   model predicted the biodistribution well and identified phagocytizing
   cells in the pulmonary region accountable for most of the nanoparticles
   not eliminated by feces.
   Conclusions: The biodistribution of fresh and aged CeO2 nanoparticles
   followed the same patterns, with the highest amounts recovered in the
   feces and lungs. The slow decrease of nanoparticle concentrations in the
   lungs can be explained by clearance to the gastrointestinal tract and
   then to the feces. The PBPK model successfully predicted the kinetic of
   CeO2 nanoparticles in various organs measured in this study and
   suggested most of the nanoparticles were captured by phagocytizing
   cells.}},

Title = {{Perfect control of reflection and refraction using spatially dispersive
   metasurfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Nonuniform metasurfaces (electrically thin composite layers) can be used
   for shaping refracted and reflected electromagnetic waves. However,
   known design approaches based on the generalized refraction and
   reflection laws do not allow realization of perfectly performing
   devices: there are always some parasitic reflections into undesired
   directions. In this paper we introduce and discuss a general approach to
   the synthesis of metasurfaces for full control of transmitted and
   reflected plane waves and show that perfect performance can be realized.
   The method is based on the use of an equivalent impedance matrix model
   which connects the tangential field components at the two sides on the
   metasurface. With this approach we are able to understand what physical
   properties of the metasurface are needed in order to perfectly realize
   the desired response. Furthermore, we determine the required
   polarizabilities of the metasurface unit cells and discuss suitable cell
   structures. It appears that only spatially dispersive metasurfaces allow
   realization of perfect refraction and reflection of incident plane waves
   into arbitrary directions. In particular, ideal refraction is possible
   only if the metasurface is bianisotropic (weak spatial dispersion), and
   ideal reflection without polarization transformation requires spatial
   dispersion with a specific, strongly nonlocal response to the fields.}},

Title = {{Effect of gold nanoparticle hydrophobicity on thermally induced color
   change of PNIPAM brush/gold nanoparticle hybrids}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{454-463}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the relation between gold nanoparticle (AuNP)
   distribution in thermoresponsive polymer brushes and the thermally
   induced color change of the polymer brush/AuNP hybrids. Therefore, we
   report on the effect of AuNP surface functionalization on the structure
   and optical response of the nanoparticles in thermoresponsive poly(N-
   isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes. Two different types of gold
   nanoparticles are attached to the PNIPAM brushes: (1) AuNPs that are
   coated with citrate anions (AuNP-citrate), and (2) AuNPs stabilized with
   12-mercaptododecanoic acid ligands (AuNP-MDA). Neutron reflectivity (NR)
   measurements indicate that the spatial structure of the hybrid depends
   on the particle type. A strong increase in thickness is observed after
   attachment of AuNP-citrate; this is not the case for AuNP-MDA. The
   thermoinduced color change of the PNIPAM/AuNP hybrids depends strongly
   on the particle type. While a red-shift of the surface plasmon band
   occurs in case of AuNP-citrate, a blue-shift is found for AuNP-MDA when
   the temperature is increased above the PNIPAM's volume phase transition
   temperature. This blue-shift vanishes after a certain number of
   heating/cooling cycles, indicating a rearrangement of the AuNPs in the
   brush. The different behavior of AuNP-citrate as compared to AuNP-MDA
   can be explained by the hydrophobic nature of the 12-mercaptododecanoic
   acid ligands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Porous CuO nanosheets were prepared on alumina tubes using a facile
   hydrothermal method, and their morphology, microstructure, and
   gas-sensing properties were investigated. The monoclinic CuO nanosheets
   had an average thickness of 62.5 nm and were embedded with numerous
   holes with diameters ranging from 5 to 17 nm. The porous CuO nanosheets
   were used to fabricate gas sensors to detect hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   operating at room temperature. The sensor showed a good response
   sensitivity of 1.25 with respond/recovery times of 234 and 76 s,
   respectively, when tested with the H2S concentrations as low as 10 ppb.
   It also showed a remarkably high selectivity to the H2S, but only minor
   responses to other gases such as SO2 NO, NO2, H-2, CO, and C2H5OH. The
   working principle of the porous CuO nanosheet based sensor to detect the
   H2S was identified to be the phase transition from semiconducting CuO to
   a metallic conducting CuS.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experimental studies demonstrated that the aqueous
   methylcellulose (MC) polymer chains in water can form nanoscale fibrils
   (diameter similar to 14 nm, persistence length similar to 60 nm), and
   those fibrils can organize into networks at higher temperatures and/or
   concentrations, forming the commonly observed gel. Here we propose that
   the fibrils are one-dimensional self-assemblies of stacked, fused
   polymer rings that are formed at elevated temperatures due to the
   changing nature of the MC-water hydrogen bonding. This mechanism is
   analogous to the coil-helix transition in polypeptides, although it is
   not clear whether the MC fibrils possess chirality. We perform
   coarse-grained molecular simulations of MC chain structure at
   temperatures both above and below the hypothesized coil-to-ring
   transition, with CG forcefield tuned by atomistic molecular dynamics
   simulations, and observe the expected conformational change. We then
   develop a statistical mechanical theory to predict the fibril
   self-assembly, gelation and rheology as function of temperature and
   concentration. The findings are in reasonable agreement with
   experimental data and could be generalized to other carbohydrate
   polymers. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The FARO tests have aimed at understanding an important severe accident
   mitigation action in a light water reactor when the accident progresses
   from the reactor pressure vessel boundary. These tests have aimed to
   measure the coolability of a molten core material (corium) gravity
   dispersed as jet into a water pool, quantifying the loose particle
   diameter distribution and fraction converted to cake under range of
   initial melt superheat and pool temperature and depth. Under complete
   hydrodynamic breakup of corium and consequent sedimentation in the pool,
   the initially superheated corium can result in debris bed consisting of
   discrete solid particles (loose debris) and/or a solid cake at the
   bottom of the pool. The success of the debris bed coolability requires
   cooling of the cake, and this is controlled by the large internal
   resistance. We postulate that the corium cake forms when there is a
   remelting part in the sediment. We show that even though a solid shell
   forms around the melt particles transiting in the water pool due to
   film-boiling heat transfer, the superheated melt allows remelting of the
   large particles in the sediment (depending on the water temperature and
   the transit time) using the COOLAP (Coolability Analysis with Parametric
   fuel-cooant interaction models) code. With this remelting and its
   liquid-phase sintering of the non-remelted particles, we predict the
   fraction of the melt particles converting to a cake through liquid
   sintering. Our predictions are in good agreement with the existing
   results of the FARO experiments. We address only those experiments with
   pool depths sufficient/exceeding the length required for complete
   breakup of the molten jet. Our analysis of the fate of molten corium
   aimed at devising the effective scenarios for its safe cooling in the
   containment so that predicted the minimum pool depth for no cake
   formation as functions of the melt superheat and water
   (subcooled/saturation) temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Specimens of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were implanted with 400-keV
   Ag+ ions at different ion fluences ranging from 1 x 10(14) to 5 x 10(15)
   ions/cm(2) using a 400-kV NEC ion implanter. The surface topographical
   features of the implanted PMMA were investigated by a confocal
   microscope. Modifications in the structural properties of the implanted
   specimens were analyzed in comparison with pristine PMMA by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. UV-Visible spectroscopy was
   applied to determine the effects of ion implantation on optical
   transmittance of the implanted PMMA. The confocal microscopic images
   revealed the formation of hillock-like microstructures along the ion
   track on the implanted PMMA surface. The increase in ion fluence led to
   more nucleation of hillocks. The XRD pattern confirmed the amorphous
   nature of pristine and implanted PMMA, while the Raman studies justified
   the transformation of Ag+-implanted PMMA into amorphous carbon at the
   ion fluence of >= 5 x 10(14) ions/cm(2). Moreover, the decrease in
   optical transmittance of PMMA is associated with the formation of
   hillocks and ion-induced structural modifications after implantation.

Abstract = {{At very high damage levels in ion irradiated samples, the decrease in

   similar to 1 x 10(-3) dpa/s at 460 degrees C. Voids were characterized
   from 0 to 1300 nm. Fixed damage rate and fixed depth methods were
   developed to account for damage-dependent porosity increase and
   resulting dependence on depth. The fixed depth method was more
   appropriate as it limits undue effects from the injected interstitial
   while maintaining a usable void distribution. By keeping the depth fixed
   and accounting for the change in damage rate due to reduced density, the
   steady state swelling rate was 10\% higher than calculation of swelling
   from raw data. This method is easily translatable to other materials,
   ion types and energies and limits the impact of the injected

Abstract = {{In this work, Taguchi-based grey relational analysis (TGRA) was adopted
   for the optimization of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)
   process-parameters of c-plane gallium-nitride (GaN), in a

   the combination of process-parameters-slurry pH = 2, KMnO4 conc. = 0.3
   M, Al2O3\% = 2.50, down-pressure = 38 kPa, and platen RPM = 90-provides
   the optimum combination of response variables: material removal rate
   (MRR) similar to 142 nm/h and root-mean-square surface roughness (RMS)
   similar to 22 nm. The optimum condition provides a marked improvement in
   the multiple performance, grey relational grade (GRG), as high as
   similar to 0.86. The strongest influence on GRG was slurry pH, followed
   by down-pressure, platen RPM, Al2O3\%, and KMnO4 conc. The combination
   of CMP process-parameters suggested by TGRA provides a superior
   combination of MRR and RMS compared to the combination of
   process-parameters suggested by Taguchi-larger is better MRR (TMRR) and
   Taguchi-smaller is better RMS (TRMS). Comparing optimal condition for
   TGRA to that of TMRR indicates marginal reduction (similar to 8\%) in
   MRR, and significant improvement (similar to 21\%) in RMS. Similarly,
   comparison of optimal condition for TGRA to that of TRMS indicates
   increase in RMS by a miniscule similar to 5\% and a dramatic increase in
   MRR by similar to 48\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bandwidth truncation for Chebyshev polynomial and
   ultraspherical/Chebyshev Galerkin discretizations of differential
   equations: Restrictions and two improvements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{302}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The Petrov-Galerkin ultraspherical polynomial/Chebyshev polynomial
   discretization of the highest derivative of a differential equation is a
   diagonal matrix. The same is true for Fourier-Galerkin discretizations.
   Nevertheless, the spectral discretizations of simple problems like u(xx)
   + q(x)u = f (x) are usually dense matrices. The villain is the
   ``multiplication matrix{''}, the Galerkin representation of a term like
   q(x)u(x); unfortunately, this part of the Galerkin matrix is dense.
   However, if the ODE coefficient q(x) has a Chebyshev or Fourier series
   that converges much more rapidly than u(x), then it is possible to
   realize great cost savings at no loss of accuracy by truncating the full
   N x N Galerkin matrix to a banded matrix where the bandwidth m << N. One
   of our themes is that when the spectral series for q(x) and u(x) have
   similar rates of convergence, as is almost universal when a nonlinear
   equation is linearized for a Newton-Krylov iteration, such
   ``{[}accuracy] lossless{''} truncation is impossible. Nonlinearity is
   but one of many causes of this sort of solution coefficient
   ``equiconvergence{''}. When bandwidth truncation is possible, though,
   our second theme is to show that a modest amount of floating point
   operations and memory can be saved by an unsymmetric truncation in which
   the number of elements retained to the left of the main diagonal is
   roughly double the number kept to the right. Our second improvement is
   to replace the M-term spectral series for q(x) by its {[}(M/2)/(M/2)]
   Chebyshev-Pade rational approximation. This sometimes allow one to halve
   the matrix bandwidth, reducing the linear algebra costs by a factor of
   four. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Verification of future warhead-dismantlement treaties will require
   detection of certain warhead attributes without the disclosure of
   sensitive design information, and this presents an unusual measurement
   challenge. Neutron spectroscopy-commonly eschewed as an ill-posed
   inverse problem-may hold special advantages for warhead verification by
   virtue of its insensitivity to certain neutron-source parameters like
   plutonium isotopics. In this article, we investigate the usefulness of
   unfolded neutron spectra obtained from organic-scintillator data for
   verifying a particular treaty-relevant warhead attribute: the presence
   of high-explosive and neutron-reflecting materials. Toward this end,
   several improvements on current unfolding capabilities are demonstrated:
   deuterated detectors are shown to have superior response-matrix
   condition to that of standard hydrogen-base scintintillators; a novel
   data-discretization scheme is proposed which removes important detector
   nonlinearities; and a technique is described for re-parameterizing the
   unfolding problem in order to constrain the parameter space of solutions
   sought, sidestepping the inverse problem altogether. These improvements
   are demonstrated with trial measurements and verified using
   accelerator-based time-of-flight calculation of reference spectra. Then,
   a demonstration is presented in which the elemental compositions of
   low-Z neutron-attenuating materials are estimated to within 10\%. These
   techniques could have direct application in verifying the presence of
   high-explosive materials in a neutron-emitting test item, as well as
   other for treaty verification challenges. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Hysteretic behavior of bladder afferent neurons in response to changes
   in bladder pressure}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase
   their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises. However, the
   relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is
   not a simple linear one. Firing rate responses to pressure can differ
   depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system.
   Though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it
   has not been quantified.
   Results: Sixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root
   ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified
   based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation
   coefficient >= 0.2) during saline infusion (2 ml/min). For saline
   infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the
   firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate
   range (or Hmax) of 0.86 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- standard deviation) and mean
   hysteresis ratio (or Hmean) of 0.52 +/- 0.13 (n = 46 afferents). For
   isovolumetric trials in two experiments (n = 33 afferents) Hmax was 0.72
   +/- 0.14 and Hmean was 0.40 +/- 0.14.
   Conclusions: A comprehensive state model that integrates these
   hysteresis parameters to determine the bladder state may improve upon
   existing neuroprostheses for bladder control.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was performed to determine the neutron energy of
   near-monoergetic deuterium deuterium (D-D) neutrons that elastically
   scatter in a hydrogenous target. The experiment used two liquid
   scintillators to perform time of flight (TOF) measurements to determine
   neutron energy, with the start detector also serving as the scatter
   target. The stop detector was placed 1.0 m away and at scatter angles of
   pi/6, pi/4, and pi/3 rad, and 1.5 m at a scatter angle of pi/4 rad. When
   discrete 1 ns increments were implemented, the TOF peaks had estimated
   errors between 21.2 and 3.6\% relative to their expected locations. Full
   widths at half-maximum (FWHM) ranged between 9.6 and 20.9 ns, or
   approximately 0.56-0.66 MeV. Monte Carlo simulations were also conducted
   that approximated the experimental setup and had both D-D and deuterium
   tritium (DT) neutrons. The simulated results had errors between 17.2 and
   0.0\% relative to their expected TOF peaks when 1 ns increments were
   applied. The largest D-D and D-T FWHMs were 26.7 and 13.7 ns, or
   approximately 0.85 and 4.98 MeV, respectively. These values, however,
   can be reduced through manipulation of the dimensions of the system
   components. The results encourage further study of the neutron elastic
   scatter TOF system with particular interest in application to active
   neutron interrogation to search for conventional explosives. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Mesoporous anatase TiO2/carbon composite nanospheres (designated as
   meso-ATCCNs) were successfully synthesized via a facile soft-templated
   self-assembly followed by thermal treatment. Structural and
   morphological analyses reveal that the as-synthesized meso-ATCCNs are
   composed of primary TiO2 nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm), combined with
   in situ deposited carbon either on the surface or between the primary
   TiO2 nanoparticles. When cycled in an extended voltage Meso-ATCCNs
   window from 0.01 to 3.0 V, meso-ATCCNs exhibit excellent rate
   capabilities (413.7, 289.7, and 206.8 mAh g(-1) at 200, 1000, and 3000
   mA g(-1), respectively) as well as stable cydability (90\% capacity
   retention over 500 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1)). Compared with both
   mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres and bulk TiO2, the superior electrochemical
   performance of the meso-ATCCNs electrode could be ascribed to a
   synergetic effect induced by hierarchical structure that includes
   uniform TiO2 nanoparticles, the presence of hydrothermal carbon derived
   from phenolic resols, a high surface area, and open mesoporosity.}},

Abstract = {{The Pacific coast of the Tohoku region of Japan experiences repeated
   tsunamis, with the most recent events having occurred in 1896, 1933,
   1960, and 2011. These events have caused large loss of life and damage
   throughout the coastal region. There is uncertainty about the degree to
   which seawalls reduce deaths and building damage during tsunamis in
   Japan. On the one hand they provide physical protection against tsunamis
   as long as they are not overtopped and do not fail. On the other hand,
   the presence of a seawall may induce a false sense of security,
   encouraging additional development behind the seawall and reducing
   evacuation rates during an event. We analyze municipality-level and
   sub-municipality-level data on the impacts of the 1896, 1933, 1960, and
   2011 tsunamis, finding that seawalls larger than 5 m in height generally
   have served a protective role in these past events, reducing both death
   rates and the damage rates of residential buildings. However, seawalls
   smaller than 5 m in height appear to have encouraged development in
   vulnerable areas and exacerbated damage. We also find that the extent of
   flooding is a critical factor in estimating both death rates and
   building damage rates, suggesting that additional measures, such as
   multiple lines of defense and elevating topography, may have significant
   benefits in reducing the impacts of tsunamis. Moreover, the area of
   coastal forests was found to be inversely related to death and
   destruction rates, indicating that forests either mitigated the impacts
   of these tsunamis, or displaced development that would otherwise have
   been damaged.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin metasurfaces supporting transverse surface currents provide
   extreme electromagnetic wave front and polarization control. Here, it is
   shown that adding longitudinal (normal) surface currents significantly
   expands the scope of electromagnetic phenomena that can be engineered
   with reciprocal materials. In particular, these metasurfaces are
   inherently spatially dispersive, which allows them to emulate
   nonreciprocal phenomena. It is analytically shown that spatially
   dispersive metasurfaces are effectively self-biased by the transverse
   momentum of the incident wave front. Long-standing notions of what makes
   a metasurface reciprocal are reinvestigated, and generalized reciprocity
   relations are derived. Several metasurfaces are designed that imitate
   Faraday rotation and optical isolation when illuminated with obliquely
   incident plane waves and normally incident vortex beams. These new
   surfaces break the inherent symmetry of previous metasurface designs,
   enabling low-profile devices with unprecedented functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle emissions containing air pollutants created substantial
   environmental impacts on air quality for many traffic-populated cities
   in eastern Asia. A high-resolution emission inventory is a useful tool
   compared with traditional tools (e.g. registration data-based approach)
   to accurately evaluate real-world traffic dynamics and their
   environmental burden. In this study, Macau, one of the most populated
   cities in the world, is selected to demonstrate a high-resolution
   simulation of vehicular emissions and their contribution to air
   pollutant concentrations by coupling multimodels. First, traffic volumes
   by vehicle category on 47 typical roads were investigated during
   weekdays in 2010 and further applied in a networking demand simulation
   with the TransCAD model to establish hourly profiles of link-level
   vehicle counts. Local vehicle driving speed and vehicle age distribution
   data were also collected in Macau. Second, based on a localized vehicle
   emission model (e.g. the emission factor model for the Beijing vehicle
   fleet - Macau, EMBEV-Macau), this study established a link-based vehicle
   emission inventory in Macau with high resolution meshed in a temporal
   and spatial framework. Furthermore, we employed the AERMOD (AMS/EPA
   Regulatory Model) model to map concentrations of CO and primary PM2.5
   contributed by local vehicle emissions during weekdays in November 2010.
   This study has discerned the strong impact of traffic flow dynamics on
   the temporal and spatial patterns of vehicle emissions, such as a
   geographic discrepancy of spatial allocation up to 26aEuro-\% between
   THC and PM2.5 emissions owing to spatially heterogeneous vehicle-use
   intensity between motorcycles and diesel fleets. We also identified that
   the estimated CO2 emissions from gasoline vehicles agreed well with the
   statistical fuel consumption in Macau. Therefore, this paper provides a
   case study and a solid framework for developing high-resolution
   environment assessment tools for other vehicle-populated cities in
   eastern Asia.}},

Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Nations increasingly trade electricity, and understanding the structure
   of the global power grid can help identify nations that are critical for
   its reliability. This study examines the global grid as a network with
   nations as nodes and international electricity trade as links. We
   analyze the structure of the global electricity trade network and find
   that the network consists of four sub-networks, and provide a detailed
   analysis of the largest network, Eurasia. Russia, China, Ukraine, and
   Azerbaijan have high betweenness measures in the Eurasian sub-network,
   indicating the degrees of centrality of the positions they hold. The
   analysis reveals that the Eurasian sub-network consists of seven
   communities based on the network structure. We find that the communities
   do not fully align with geographical proximity, and that the present
   international electricity trade in the Eurasian sub-network causes an
   approximately 11 million additional tons of CO2 emissions.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency co dependent storage G'(omega) and loss G{''}(omega)
   moduli of star-shaped polystyrene (SPS) molecules of a range of
   functionalities f and molecular weights per arm M-a were measured under
   small amplitude oscillatory shear conditions. Star-shaped macromolecules
   are composed of an inner region, core, where the chain segments are
   stretched and the ``packing{''} density is higher than that of the outer
   region, corona. The frequency dependencies of G' (omega) and G{''}(tau)
   for low functionality molecules (f < 8) with long arms M-a are well
   described by the model of Milner and McLeish, indicating that the
   translational dynamics are facilitated by an arm retraction mechanism.
   With increasing values of f and decreasing M-a the model fails the arm
   retraction process is no longer valid due largely to the increasing size
   of the core in relation to the overall size of the molecule. The
   molecules exhibit evidence of spatial structural order due to entropic,
   intermolecular interactions, and the translational dynamics of these
   molecules occur via a cooperative process, akin to that of soft
   colloids, for sufficiently large values of f and small M-a. The overall
   dynamics may be summarized in a diagram delineating different mechanisms

Title = {{Nanoroughened adhesion-based capture of circulating tumor cells with
   heterogeneous expression and metastatic characteristics}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have shown prognostic
   relevance in many cancer types. However, the majority of current CTC
   capture methods rely on positive selection techniques that require a
   priori knowledge about the surface protein expression of disseminated
   CTCs, which are known to be a dynamic population.
   Methods: We developed a microfluidic CTC capture chip that incorporated
   a nanoroughened glass substrate for capturing CTCs from blood samples.
   Our CTC capture chip utilized the differential adhesion preference of
   cancer cells to nanoroughened etched glass surfaces as compared to
   normal blood cells and thus did not depend on the physical size or
   surface protein expression of CTCs.
   Results: The microfluidic CTC capture chip was able to achieve a
   superior capture yield for both epithelial cell adhesion molecule
   positive (EpCAM+) and EpCAM-cancer cells in blood samples. Additionally,
   the microfluidic CTC chip captured CTCs undergoing transforming growth
   factor beta-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
   (TGF-beta-induced EMT) with dynamically down-regulated EpCAM expression.
   In a mouse model of human breast cancer using EpCAM positive and
   negative cell lines, the number of CTCs captured correlated positively
   with the size of the primary tumor and was independent of their EpCAM
   expression. Furthermore, in a syngeneic mouse model of lung cancer using
   cell lines with differential metastasis capability, CTCs were captured
   from all mice with detectable primary tumors independent of the cell
   lines' metastatic ability.
   Conclusions: The microfluidic CTC capture chip using a novel
   nanoroughened glass substrate is broadly applicable to capturing
   heterogeneous CTC populations of clinical interest independent of their
   surface marker expression and metastatic propensity. We were able to
   capture CTCs from a non-metastatic lung cancer model, demonstrating the
   potential of the chip to collect the entirety of CTC populations
   including subgroups of distinct biological and phenotypical properties.
   Further exploration of the biological potential of metastatic and
   presumably non-metastatic CTCs captured using the microfluidic chip will
   yield insights into their relevant differences and their effects on
   tumor progression and cancer outcomes.}},

Pages = {{18695-18708}},

Abstract = {{Standard phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) generally requires
   collecting at least three phase-shifted interferograms to extract the
   physical quantity being measured. Here, we propose the application of a
   simple two-frame PSI for the testing of a range of optical surfaces,
   including flats, spheres, and aspheres. The two-frame PSI extracts
   modulated phase from two randomly phase-shifted interferograms using a
   Gram-Schmidt algorithm, and can work in either null testing or non-null
   testing modes. Since only two interferograms are used for phase
   demodulation and the phase shift amount can be random, requirements on
   environmental conditions and phase shifter calibration are greatly
   relaxed. Experimental results of three different mirrors suggest that
   the two-frame PSI can achieve comparable measurement precision with
   conventional multi-frame PSI, but has faster data acquisition speed and
   less stringent hardware requirements. The proposed two-frame PSI expands
   the flexibility of PSI and holds great potential in many applications.

Title = {{The suppression of scale-free fMRI brain dynamics across three different
   sources of effort: aging, task novelty and task difficulty}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that fluctuations in brain activity may
   exhibit scale-free ({''}fractal{''}) dynamics. Scale-free signals follow
   a spectral-power curve of the form P(f) proportional to f(-beta), where
   spectral power decreases in a power-law fashion with increasing
   frequency. In this study, we demonstrated that fractal scaling of BOLD
   fMRI signal is consistently suppressed for different sources of
   cognitive effort. Decreases in the Hurst exponent (H), which quantifies
   scale-free signal, was related to three different sources of cognitive
   effort/task engagement: 1) task difficulty, 2) task novelty, and 3)
   aging effects. These results were consistently observed across multiple
   datasets and task paradigms. We also demonstrated that estimates of H
   are robust across a range of time-window sizes. H was also compared to
   alternative metrics of BOLD variability (SDBOLD) and global connectivity
   (Gconn), with effort-related decreases in H producing similar decreases
   in SDBOLD and Gconn. These results indicate a potential global brain
   phenomenon that unites research from different fields and indicates that
   fractal scaling may be a highly sensitive metric for indexing cognitive
   effort/task engagement.}},

Abstract = {{The sputtering of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by impacts of energetic
   xenon ions is investigated using a molecular dynamics (MD) model. The
   model is implemented within an open-source MD framework that utilizes
   graphics processing units to accelerate its calculations, allowing the
   sputtering process to be studied in much greater detail than has been
   feasible in the past. Integrated sputter yields are computed over a
   range of ion energies from 20 eV to 300 eV, and incidence angles from 0
   degrees to 75 degrees. Sputtering of boron is shown to occur at energies
   as low as 40 eV at normal incidence, and sputtering of nitrogen at as
   low as 30 eV at normal incidence, suggesting a threshold energy between
   20 eV and 40 eV. The sputter yields at 0 degrees incidence are compared
   to existing experimental data and are shown to agree well over the range
   of ion energies investigated. The semi-empirical Bohdansky curve and an
   empirical exponential function are fit to the data at normal incidence,
   and the threshold energy for sputtering is calculated from the Bohdansky
   curve fit as 35 +/- 2 eV. These results are shown to compare well with
   experimental observations that the threshold energy lies between 20 eV
   and 40 eV. It is demonstrated that h-BN sputters predominantly as atomic
   boron and diatomic nitrogen, and the velocity distribution function
   (VDF) of sputtered boron atoms is investigated. The calculated VDFs are
   found to reproduce the Sigmund-Thompson distribution predicted by
   Sigmund's linear cascade theory of sputtering. The average surface
   binding energy computed from Sigmund-Thompson curve fits is found to be
   4.5 eV for ion energies of 100 eV and greater. This compares well to the
   value of 4.8 eV determined from independent experiments. Published by

Abstract = {{In this review, we discuss how superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) can
   provide friction drag reduction in turbulent flow. Whereas biomimetic
   SHSs are known to reduce drag in laminar flow, turbulence adds many new
   challenges. We first provide an overview on designing SHSs, and how
   these surfaces can cause slip in the laminar regime. We then discuss
   recent studies evaluating drag on SHSs in turbulent flow, both
   computationally and experimentally. The effects of streamwise and
   spanwise slip for canonical, structured surfaces are well characterized
   by direct numerical simulations, and several experimental studies have
   validated these results. However, the complex and hierarchical textures
   of scalable SHSs that can be applied over large areas generate
   additional complications. Many studies on such surfaces have measured no
   drag reduction, or even a drag increase in turbulent flow. We discuss
   how surface wettability, roughness effects and some newly found scaling
   laws can help explain these varied results. Overall, we discuss how, to
   effectively reduce drag in turbulent flow, an SHS should have:
   preferentially streamwise-aligned features to enhance favourable slip, a
   capillary resistance of the order of megapascals, and a roughness no
   larger than 0.5, when non-dimensionalized by the viscous length scale.
   This article is part of the themed issue `Bioinspired hierarchically
   structured surfaces for green science'.}},

Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension can absorb impact energy and
   improve Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance of entire
   vehicle. In this paper, a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure was
   introduced and applied on the jounce bumper. The NPR jounce bumper can
   be primarily described by few parameters and is convenient for design,
   analysis and optimization. Three NPR jounce bumper prototypes were
   manufactured and tested. The test results of prototype 1 indicated that
   the NPR jounce bumpers had excellent viscoelasticity characteristic to
   absorb impact energy owing to its high damping. Compared with
   traditional jounce bumper, the NPR jounce bumper can achieve similar
   mechanical behavior but with a smoother load-displacement curve, which
   is beneficial to the NVH performance. Moreover, numerical calculation
   was conducted. Its results were fairly reliable for the prediction of
   mechanical behavior of NPR jounce bumper. The numerical results implied
   the stress concentration areas and the displacement of failure. The
   deformation shapes of NPR jounce bumper were also discussed. Finally,
   prototypes 2 and 3 manufactured from 3D printing technology were tested
   to explore the possibility of the application of 3D printing technology
   on NPR structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is known to
   increase the force-generating capacity of the skeletal muscles. However,
   when tDCS is concurrently combined with a motor task, interference may
   occur that hinders tDCS effects. Here, we tested the interaction and
   time course of tDCS effects on force production when paired with a
   low-level force-matching task. Twenty-two subjects were randomized into
   two groups: tDCS-Matching and tDCS-Resting. Each group received tDCS and
   a sham stimulation, separated by one week. Maximal knee extensor and
   flexor torques were measured before and up to twenty-five minutes
   following the stimulation. The tDCS-Matching group produced greater knee
   extension torques relative to sham when compared with the tDCS-Resting
   group. There was no significant effect for knee flexion. This suggests
   that interference does not occur for force production tasks when tDCS is
   combined with a motor task. Rather, the task appears to aid and isolate
   the effects to the muscle groups involved in the task. (C) 2016 IBRO.

Abstract = {{Blood coagulation is a critical hemostatic process that must be properly
   regulated to maintain a delicate balance between bleeding and clotting.
   Disorders of blood coagulation can expose patients to the risk of either
   bleeding disorders or thrombotic diseases. Coagulation diagnostics using
   whole blood is very promising for assessing the complexity of the
   coagulation system and for global measurements of hemostasis. Despite
   the clinic values that existing whole blood coagulation tests have
   demonstrated, these systems have significant limitations that diminish
   their potential for point-of-care applications. Here, recent
   advancements in device miniaturization using functional soft materials
   are leveraged to develop a miniaturized clot retraction force assay
   device termed mHemoRetractoMeter (mHRM). The mHRM is capable of precise
   measurements of dynamic clot retraction forces in real time using minute
   amounts of whole blood. To further demonstrate the clinical utility of
   the mHRM, systematic studies are conducted using the mHRM to examine the
   effects of assay temperature, treatments of clotting agents, and pro-and
   anti-coagulant drugs on clot retraction force developments of whole
   blood samples. The mHRM's low fabrication cost, small size, and
   consumption of only minute amounts of blood samples make the technology
   promising as a point-of-care tool for future coagulation monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Maximizing the potential of optogenetic approaches in deep brain
   structures of intact animals requires optical manipulation of neurons at
   high spatial and temporal resolutions, while simultaneously recording
   electrical data from those neurons. Here, we present the first
   fiber-less optoelectrode with a monolithically integrated optical
   waveguide mixer that can deliver multicolor light at a common waveguide
   port to achieve multicolor modulation of the same neuronal population in
   vivo. We demonstrate successful device implementation by achieving
   efficient coupling between a side-emitting injection laser diode (ILD)
   and a dielectric optical waveguide mixer via a gradient-index (GRIN)
   lens. The use of GRIN lenses attains several design features, including
   high optical coupling and thermal isolation between ILDs and waveguides.
   We validated the packaged devices in the intact brain of anesthetized
   mice co-expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 and Archaerhodopsin in pyramidal
   cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, achieving high quality recording,
   activation and silencing of the exact same neurons in a given local
   region. This fully-integrated approach demonstrates the spatial
   precision and scalability needed to enable independent activation and

   regions while simultaneously recording from them, thus considerably
   advancing the capabilities of currently available optogenetic toolsets.}},

Abstract = {{Recent observations of the Martian surface by the Phoenix lander and the
   Sample Analysis at Mars indicate the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-).
   The abundance and isotopic composition of these perchlorates suggest
   that the mechanisms responsible for their formation in the Martian
   environment may be unique in our solar system. With this in mind, we
   propose a potential mechanism for the production of Martian perchlorate:
   the radiolysis of the Martian surface by galactic cosmic rays, followed
   by the sublimation of chlorine oxides into the atmosphere and their
   subsequent synthesis to form perchloric acid (HClO4) in the atmosphere,
   and the surface deposition and subsequent mineralization of HClO4 in the
   regolith to form surface perchlorates. To evaluate the viability of this
   mechanism, we employ a one-dimensional chemical model, examining
   chlorine chemistry in the context of Martian atmospheric chemistry.
   Considering the chlorine oxide, OCIO, we find that an OCIO flux as low
   as 3.2 x 10(7) molecules cm(-2) s(-1) sublimated into the atmosphere
   from the surface could produce sufficient HClO4 to explain the
   perchlorate concentration on Mars, assuming an accumulation depth of 30
   cm and integrated over the Amazonian period. Radiolysis provides an
   efficient pathway for the oxidation of chlorine, bypassing the efficient
   Cl/HCl recycling mechanism that characterizes HClO4 formation mechanisms
   proposed for the Earth but not Mars.}},

Abstract = {{The double-pinhole resonator with a localized mode bounded to the
   apertures was demonstrated by 3D simulation. The light coupling was
   engineered by making a bevel to the side wall of the pinholes. By
   changing the bevel angle, the radiation Q factor is tuned. When the
   radiation Q matches the absorption Q, the resonant absorption is
   optimized, making the device applicable as a nano thermal emitter. For
   application in superfocusing, there is no optimized bevel angle and a
   balance needs to be found between a small spot size and a considerable
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, residual stress distributions in rectangular bars due to
   rolling or burnishing at very high rolling or burnishing loads are
   investigated by roll burnishing experiments and three-dimensional finite
   element analyses using ABAQUS. First, roll burnishing experiments on
   rectangular bars at two roller burnishing loads are presented. The
   results indicate the higher burnishing load induces lower residual
   stresses and the higher burnishing load does not improve fatigue lives.
   Next, in the corresponding finite element analyses, the roller is
   modeled as rigid and the roller rolls on the flat surface of the bar
   with a low coefficient of friction. The bar material is modeled as an
   elastic-plastic strain hardening material with a nonlinear kinematic
   hardening rule for loading and unloading. The computational results
   showed that a higher rolling load does not necessarily always produce
   higher compressive residual stresses in the desired regions of the bar
   and gives better fatigue lives of the bar under bending as indicated
   from the experimental results. The computational results also showed
   that the longitudinal residual stresses are sensitive to the initial
   yield stress and the detailed strain hardening behavior assumed at large
   strains.}},

Abstract = {{Failure mode and fatigue behavior of flow drill screw (FDS) joints in
   lap-shear specimens of aluminum 6082-T6 sheets with and without
   clearance hole are investigated based on experiments and a structural
   stress fatigue life estimation model. Lap-shear specimens with FDS
   joints were tested under cyclic loading conditions. Optical micrographs
   show that the failure modes of the FDS joints in specimens with and

   conditions. The fatigue lives of the FDS joints in specimens with
   clearance hole are longer than those of the FDS joints in specimens
   without clearance hole for the given load ranges under cyclic loading
   conditions. A structural stress fatigue life estimation model is adopted
   to estimate the fatigue lives of the FDS joints in lap-shear specimens
   under high-cycle loading conditions. The closed-form structural stress
   solutions are based on the analytical solution for a plate with a rigid
   inclusion under a resultant shear load. The general trends of the

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments of pure electric vehicles have shown that pure
   electric vehicles equipped with two-speed or multi-speed gearbox possess
   higher energy efficiency by ensuring the drive motor operates at its
   peak performance range. This article presents the design, analysis, and
   control of a two-speed automatic mechanical transmission for pure
   electric vehicles. The shift actuator is based on a motor-controlled
   camshaft where a special geometric groove is machined, and the camshaft
   realizes the axial positions of the synchronizer sleeve for gear
   engaging, disengaging, and speed control of the drive motor. Based on
   the force analysis of shift process, the parameters of shift actuator
   and shift motor are designed. The drive motor's torque control strategy
   before shifting, speed governing control strategy before engaging, shift
   actuator's control strategy during gear engaging, and drive motor's
   torque recovery strategy after shift process are proposed and
   implemented with a prototype. To validate the performance of the
   two-speed gearbox, a test bed was developed based on dSPACE that
   emulates various operation conditions. The experimental results indicate
   that the shift process with the proposed shift actuator and control
   strategy could be accomplished within 1 s under various operation
   conditions, with shift smoothness up to passenger car standard.}},

Abstract = {{The role of universal time (UT) dependence on storm time development has
   remained an unresolved question in geospace research. This study
   presents new insight into storm progression in terms of the UT of the
   storm peak. We present a superposed epoch analysis of solar wind drivers
   and geomagnetic index responses during magnetic storms, categorized as a
   function of UT of the storm peak, to investigate the dependency of storm
   intensity on UT. Storms with Dst minimum less than -100 nT were
   identified in the 1970-2012 era (305 events), covering four solar
   cycles. The storms were classified into six groups based on the UT of
   the minimum Dst (40 to 61 events per bin) then each grouping was
   superposed on a timeline that aligns the time of the minimum Dst.
   Fifteen different quantities were considered: seven solar wind
   parameters and eight activity indices derived from ground-based
   magnetometer data. Statistical analyses of the superposed means against
   each other (between the different UT groupings) were conducted to
   determine the mathematical significance of similarities and differences
   in the time series plots. It was found that the solar wind parameters
   have no significant difference between the UT groupings, as expected.
   The geomagnetic activity indices, however, all show statistically
   significant differences with UT during the main phase and/or early
   recovery phase. Specifically, the 02: 00 UT groupings are stronger
   storms than those in the other UT bins. That is, storms are stronger
   when the Asian sector is on the nightside (American sector on the
   dayside) during the main phase.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a statistical study of flux ropes and reconnection fronts
   based on MErcury Surface, Space ENviroment, GEochemistry, and Ranging
   (MESSENGER) magnetic field and plasma observations to study the
   implications for the spatial distribution of reconnection sites in
   Mercury's near magnetotail. The results show important differences of
   temporal and spatial distributions as compared to Earth. We have
   surveyed the plasma sheet crossings between -2 R-M and -3 R-M downtail
   from the planet, i.e., the location of Near-Mercury Neutral Line (NMNL).
   Plasma sheets were defined to be regions with beta >= 0.5. Using this
   definition, 39 flux ropes and 86 reconnection fronts were identified in
   the plasma sheet. At Mercury, the distributions of flux ropes and
   reconnection fronts show clear dawn-dusk asymmetry with much higher
   occurrence rate on the dawnside plasma sheet than on the duskside. This
   suggests that magnetic reconnection in Mercury's magnetotail occurs more
   frequently in the dawnside than in the duskside plasma sheet, which is
   different than the observations in Earth's magnetotail showing more
   reconnection signatures in the duskside plasma sheet. The distribution
   of plasma sheet thickness shows that plasma sheet near the midnight is
   the thinnest part and does not show obvious asymmetry. Thus, the reasons
   that cause magnetic reconnection to preferentially occur on the dawnside
   of the magnetotail at Mercury may not be the plasma sheet thickness and
   require further study. The peak occurrence rates of flux ropes and
   reconnection fronts in Mercury's plasma sheet are similar to 60 times
   higher than that of Earth's values, which we interpret to be due to the
   highly variable magnetospheric conditions at Mercury. Such higher
   occurrence rate of magnetic reconnection would generate more plasma
   flows in the dawnside plasma sheet than in the duskside. These plasma
   flows would mostly brake and initiate the substorm dipolarization on the
   postmidnight sector at Mercury rather than the premidnight susbtorm
   onset location at Earth.}},

Abstract = {{Using quasi-simultaneous line-of-sight velocity measurements at multiple
   frequencies from the Hankasalmi Cooperative UK Twin Auroral Sounding
   System (CUTLASS) on the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), we
   calculate electron number densities using a derivation outlined in
   Gillies et al. (2010, 2012). Backscatter targets were generated using
   the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) ionospheric modification
   facility at Tromso, Norway. We use two methods on two case studies. The
   first approach is to use the dual-frequency capability on CUTLASS and
   compare line-of-sight velocities between frequencies with a MHz or
   greater difference. The other method used the kHz frequency shifts
   automatically made by the SuperDARN radar during routine operations.
   Using ray tracing to obtain the approximate altitude of the backscatter,
   we demonstrate that for both methods, SuperDARN significantly
   overestimates Ne compared to those obtained from the EISCAT incoherent
   scatter radar over the same time period. The discrepancy between the Ne
   measurements of both radars may be largely due to SuperDARN sensitivity
   to backscatter produced by localized density irregularities which
   obscure the background levels.}},

Abstract = {{Cationic polymers have been investigated as nonviral vectors for gene
   delivery due to their favorable safety profile when compared to viral
   vectors. However, nonviral vectors are limited by poor efficacy in
   inducing gene expression. The physicochemical properties of cationic
   polymers enabling successful gene expression have been investigated in
   order to improve expression efficiency and safety. Studies over the past
   several years have focused on five possible rate-limiting processes to
   explain the differences in gene expression: (1) endosomal release, (2)
   transport within specific intracellular pathways, (3) protection of DNA
   from nucleases, (4) transport into the nucleus, and (5) DNA release from
   vectors. However, determining the relative importance of these processes
   and the vector properties necessary for optimization remain a challenge
   to the field. In this Account, we describe over a decade of studies
   focused on understanding the interaction of cationic polymer and
   cationic polymer/oligonucleotide (polyplex) interactions with model
   lipid membranes, cell membranes, and cells in culture. In particular, we
   have been interested in how the interaction between cationic polymers
   and the membrane influences the intracellular transport of intact DNA to
   the nucleus. Recent advances in microfluidic patch clamp techniques
   enabled us to quantify polyplex cell membrane interactions at the
   cellular level with precise control over material concentrations and
   exposure times. In attempting to relate these findings to subsequent
   intracellular transport of DNA and expression of protein, we needed to
   develop an approach that could distinguish DNA that was intact and
   potentially functional for gene expression from the much larger pool of
   degraded, nonfunctional DNA within the cell. We addressed this need by
   developing a FRET oligonucleotide molecular beacon (OMB) to monitor
   intact DNA transport. The research highlighted in this Account builds to
   the conclusion that polyplex transported DNA is released from endosomes
   by free cationic polymer intercalated into the endosomal membrane. This
   cationic polymer initially interacts with the cell plasma membrane and
   appears to reach the endosome by lipid cycling mechanisms. The fraction
   of cells displaying release of intact DNA from endosomes quantitatively
   predicts the fraction of cells displaying gene expression for both
   linear poly(ethylenimine) (L-PEI; an effective vector) and generation
   five poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (G.5 PAMAM; an ineffective vector).
   Moreover, intact OMB delivered with G5 PAMAM, which normally is confined
   to endosomes, was released by the subsequent addition of L-PEI with a
   corresponding 10-fold increase in transgene expression. These
   observations are consistent with experiments demonstrating, that
   cationic polymer/membrane partition coefficients, not polyplex/membrane
   partition coefficients, predict successful gene expression.
   Interestingly, a similar partitioning of cationic polymers into the
   mitochondria' membranes has been proposed to explain the cytotoxicity of
   these materials. Thus, the proposed model indicates the same
   physicochemical property (partitioning into lipid bilayers) is linked to
   release from endosomes, giving protein expression,{''} and to
   cytotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The warehouse problem with deterministic production cost, selling
   prices, and demand was introduced in the 1950s and there is a renewed
   interest recently due to its applications in energy storage and
   arbitrage. In this paper, we consider two extensions of the warehouse
   problem and develop efficient computational algorithms for finding their
   optimal solutions. First, we consider a model where the firm can invest
   in capacity expansion projects for the warehouse while simultaneously
   making production and sales decisions in each period. We show that this
   problem can be solved with a computational complexity that is linear in
   the product of the length of the planning horizon and the number of
   capacity expansion projects. We then consider a problem in which the
   firm can invest to improve production cost efficiency while
   simultaneously making production and sales decisions in each period. The
   resulting optimization problem is non-convex with integer decision
   variables. We show that, under some mild conditions on the cost data,
   the problem can be solved in linear computational time. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Sensing platforms are becoming batteryless to enable the vision of the
   Internet of Things, where trillions of devices collect data, interact
   with each other, and interact with people. However, these batteryless
   sensing platforms-that rely purely on energy harvesting-are rarely able
   to maintain a sense of time after a power failure. Thismakes working
   with sensor data that is time sensitive especially difficult. We propose
   two novel, zero-power timekeepers that use remanence decay to measure
   the time elapsed between power failures. Our approaches compute the
   elapsed time from the amount of decay of a capacitive device, either
   on-chip Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) or a dedicated capacitor.
   This enables hourglass-like timers that give intermittently powered
   sensing devices a persistent sense of time. Our evaluation shows that
   applications using either timekeeper can keep time accurately through
   power failures as long as 45s with low overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is an ultrasound ablation method that depends on the
   initiation of a dense cavitation bubble cloud to fractionate soft
   tissue. Previous work has demonstrated that a cavitation cloud can be
   formed by a single acoustic pulse with one high-amplitude negative
   cycle, when the negative pressure amplitude exceeds a threshold
   intrinsic to the medium. The intrinsic thresholds in soft tissues and
   tissue phantoms that are water based are similar to the intrinsic
   threshold of water over an experimentally verified frequency range of
   0.3-3 MHz. Previous work studying the histotripsy intrinsic threshold
   has been limited to experiments performed at room temperature (similar
   to 20 degrees C). In this study, we investigate the effects of
   temperature on the histotripsy intrinsic threshold in water, which is
   essential to accurately predict the intrinsic thresholds expected over
   the full range of in vivo therapeutic temperatures. Based on previous
   work studying the histotripsy intrinsic threshold and classical
   nucleation theory, we hypothesize that the intrinsic threshold will
   decrease with increasing temperature. To test this hypothesis, the
   intrinsic threshold in water was investigated both experimentally and
   theoretically. The probability of generating cavitation bubbles was
   measured by applying a single pulse with one high-amplitude negative
   cycle at 1 MHz to distilled degassed water at temperatures ranging from
   10 degrees C to 90 degrees C. Cavitation was detected and characterized
   by passive cavitation detection and high-speed photography, from which
   the probability of cavitation was measured versus pressure amplitude.
   The results indicate that the intrinsic threshold (the negative pressure
   at which the cavitation probability = 0.5) significantly decreases with
   increasing temperature, showing a nearly linear decreasing trend from
   29.8 +/- 0.4 MPa at 10 degrees C to 14.9 +/- 1.4 MPa at 90 degrees C.
   Overall, the results of this study support our hypothesis that the
   intrinsic threshold is highly dependent on the temperature of the
   medium, which may allow for better predictions of cavitation generation
   at body temperature in vivo and at the elevated temperatures commonly
   seen in high-intensity focused ultrasound regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Methanogenic inhibitors are often used to study methanogenesis in
   complex microbial communities or inhibit methanogens in the
   gastrointestinal tract of livestock. However, the resulting structural
   and functional changes in archaeal and bacterial communities are poorly
   understood. We characterized microbial community structure and activity
   in mesocosms seeded with cow dung and municipal wastewater treatment
   plant anaerobic digester sludge after exposure to two methanogenic
   inhibitors, 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) and propynoic acid (PA).
   Methane production was reduced by 89\% (0.5mmol/L BES), 100\%
   (10mmol/LBES), 24\% (0.1mmol/LPA), and 95\% (10mmol/LPA). Using modified
   primers targeting the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) gene, changes
   in mcrA gene expression were found to correspond with changes in methane
   production and the relative activity of methanogens. Methanogenic
   activity was determined by the relative abundance of methanogen 16S rRNA
   cDNA as a percentage of the total community 16S rRNA cDNA. Overall,
   methanogenic activity was lower when mesocosms were exposed to higher
   concentrations of both inhibitors, and aceticlastic methanogens were
   inhibited to a greater extent than hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
   Syntrophic bacterial activity, measured by 16S rRNA cDNA, was also
   reduced following exposure to both inhibitors, but the overall structure
   of the active bacterial community was not significantly affected.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose/objectives: Radiation injury to parahippocampal cingulum white
   matter is associated with cognitive decline. Diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) detects micropathologic changes in white matter. Increased radial
   diffusion (RD) and decreased axial diffusion (AD) correspond to
   demyelination and axonal degeneration/gliosis respectively. We aimed to
   develop a predictive model for radiation-induced cognitive changes based
   upon DTI changes.
   Materials/methods: Twenty-seven adults with benign or low-grade tumors
   received partial brain radiation therapy (RT) to a median dose of 54 Gy.
   Patients underwent DTI before RT, during RT, and at the end of RT.
   Cognitive testing was performed before RT, and 6 and 18 months after RT.
   Parahippocampal cingulum white matter was contoured to obtain mean
   values of AD and RD.
   Results: By univariate analysis, decreasing AD and increasing RD during
   RT predicted declines in verbal memory and verbal fluency. By
   multivariate analysis, baseline neurocognitive score was the only
   clinical variable predicting verbal memory change; no clinical variables
   predicted verbal fluency change. In a multivariate model, increased RD
   at the end of RT significantly predicted decline in verbal fluency 18
   months after RT.
   Conclusions: Imaging biomarkers of white matter injury contributed to
   predictive models of cognitive function change after RT. (C) 2016

Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic tweezers are powerful tools to manipulate and study the
   mechanical properties of biological molecules and living cells. In this
   paper we present a novel, bona fide electromagnetic tweezer (EMT) setup
   that allows independent control of the force and torque applied via
   micrometer-sized magnetic beads to a molecule under study. We
   implemented this EMT by combining a single solenoid that generates force
   (f-EMT) with a set of four solenoids arranged into a symmetric
   quadrupole to generate torque (t-EMT). To demonstrate the capability of
   the tweezers, we attached optically asymmetric Janus beads to single,
   tethered DNA molecules. We show that tension in the piconewton force
   range can be applied to single DNA molecules and the molecule can
   simultaneously be twisted with torques in the piconewton-nanometer
   range. Furthermore, the EMT allows the two components to be
   independently controlled. At various force levels applied to the Janus
   bead, the trap torsional stiffness can be continuously changed simply by
   varying the current magnitude applied to the t-EMT. The flexible and
   independent control of force and torque by the EMT makes it an ideal
   tool for a range of measurements where tensional and torsional
   properties need to be studied simultaneously on a molecular or cellular
   level. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by a dense
   stroma consisting of a prevalence of activated fibroblasts whose
   functional contributions to pancreatic tumorigenesis remain incompletely
   understood. In this study, we provide the first identification and
   characterization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) within the human PDA
   microenvironment, highlighting the heterogeneity of the fibroblast
   population. Primary patient PDA samples and low-passage human pancreatic
   cancer-associated fibroblast cultures were found to contain a unique
   population of cancer-associated MSCs (CA-MSC). CA-MSCs markedly enhanced
   the growth, invasion, and metastatic potential of PDA cancer cells.
   CA-MSCs secreted the cytokine GM-CSF that was required for tumor cell
   proliferation, invasion, and transendothelial migration. Depletion of
   GM-CSF in CA-MSCs inhibited the ability of these cells to promote tumor
   cell growth and metastasis. Together, these data identify a population
   of MSCs within the tumor microenvironment that possesses a unique
   ability, through GM-CSF signaling, to promote PDA survival and
   metastasis.
   SIGNIFICANCE: The role of stroma in pancreatic cancer is controversial.
   Here, we provide the first characterization of MSCs within the human PDA
   microenvironment and demonstrate that CA-MSCs promote tumorigenesis
   through the production of GM-CSF. These data identify a novel cytokine
   pathway that mediates mesenchymal-epithelial cross-talk and is amenable
   to therapeutic intervention. Cancer Discov; 6( 8); 886-99. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A retrieval algorithm is presented for the Level 2 ocean surface wind
   speed data product of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System
   (CYGNSS) mission. The algorithm is based on the approach described by
   Clarizia et al., 2014. The approach is applied to the specific orbital
   measurement geometry, antenna, and receiver hardware characteristics of
   the CYGNSS mission. Several additional processing steps have also been
   added to improve the performance. A best weighted estimator is used to
   optimally combine two different partially correlated estimates of the
   winds by taking their weighted average. The optimal weighting
   dynamically adjusts for variations in the signal-to-noise ratio of the
   observations that result from changes in the measurement geometry.
   Variations in the incidence angle of the measurements are accounted for
   by the use of a 2-D geophysical model function that depends on both wind
   speed and incidence angle. Variations in the propagation time and signal
   Doppler shift at different measurement geometries affect the
   instantaneous spatial resolution of the measurements, and these effects
   are compensated by a variable temporal integration of the data. In
   addition to a detailed description of the algorithm itself, the
   root-mean-square wind speed retrieval error is characterized as a
   function of the measurement geometry and the wind speed using a detailed
   mission end-to-end simulator.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithm to compute the globally optimal fixture
   with frictionless contacts in a discrete point set on an object. The
   capability of a fixture to immobilize the object is evaluated by the
   minimum of the largest conflict of the object with the contacts over all
   motion directions, which can be reduced to the radius of the largest
   origin-centered ball contained in the convex hull of primitive contacts
   wrenches. All candidate fixtures (combinations of the discrete points of
   a certain number) are expressed in a tree structure, in which each node
   contains a discrete point representing a contact location and each path
   from the roots to a leaf represents a fixture. A preorder walk of the
   tree is performed to search for the optimal fixture. Necessary
   conditions are derived to predict whether the subtree of a node contains
   a better fixture. If any necessary condition is not met, then all the
   fixtures contained in the subtree can be simply rejected. By this means
   only a small portion of the tree will be traversed and the globally
   optimal fixture can be found more quickly. This algorithm has been
   tested on various three-dimensional objects and has been found to be
   over ten times faster than the brute-force search.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) are essential elements for today's
   structural health monitoring (SHM). As the design technology for WSNs
   evolves, there have been continuous efforts to address challenges for
   WSNs such as short lifetime, high power consumption, and bulky volume.
   Recent trends show energy harvesting becoming a popular solution for
   extending the lifetime of WSNs; even implementing energy-autonomous
   systems is an option. Smaller WSN form factors have been developed for
   volume-limited applications and sensor nodes as small as a few mm(3)
   were created with custom-designed integrated circuits (ICs). Custom
   IC-based sensor nodes enable energy-efficient implementation of WSNs for
   SHM. Ultralow power circuits with operation power on the order of
   nanowatts are introduced in this paper. Ultralow power energy
   harvesters, timers, wakeup receivers, sensing modalities, and
   microprocessors are expected to significantly extend sensor node
   lifetime or achieve sensor node operation with ambient energy
   harvesting.}},

Title = {{Three-Tier Modular Structural Health Monitoring Framework Using
   Environmental and Operational Condition Clustering for Data
   Normalization: Validation on an Operational Wind Turbine System}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a three-tier algorithmic framework as the basis for
   the flexible design of data-driven structural health monitoring (SHM)
   systems. The three major functions of the SHM system, including data
   normalization, feature extraction, and hypothesis testing (HT), are
   mapped to the three layers of the framework. The first tier of the
   framework is devoted to data normalization. Machine learning (ML)
   methods are adopted to normalize available data sets by binning data
   sets to similar environmental and operational conditions (EOCs) of the
   system. Specifically, affinity propagation clustering is used to
   delineate data into groups of similar EOC. Once data are normalized by
   EOC, the second tier of the framework extracts features from the data to
   serve as condition parameters (CPs) for damage assessment. To ascertain
   the health state of the structure, the third tier of the framework is
   devoted to statistical analysis of the CP through HT. An intrinsic goal
   of the study is to explore the modularity of the three tier framework as
   a means of offering SHM system designers opportunity to explore and test
   different computational block sets at each layer to maximize the
   detection capability of the SHM system. Various realizations of the
   three-tier modular framework are presented and applied to acceleration
   and EOC data collected from an operational 3-kW wind turbine. In total,
   354 data sets are collected from the turbine, including tower lateral
   accelerations in two orthogonal directions at six heights, wind speed
   and wind direction; 317 of the data sets correspond to the wind turbine
   in a healthy state and 37 with the wind turbine in a damage state. Using
   quantitative metrics derived from receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curves, the damage classification capabilities of the framework
   are validated and shown to accurately identify intentionally introduced
   damage in the turbine.}},

   Diabetic Macular Edema Treatment Analysis From the Diabetic Retinopathy
   Clinical Research Network Comparative Effectiveness Trial}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medicines have
   revolutionized diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment. A recent
   randomized clinical trial comparing anti-VEGF agents for patients with
   decreased vision from DME found that at 1 year aflibercept (2.0 mg)
   achieved better visual outcomes than repackaged (compounded) bevacizumab
   (1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.3 mg); the worse the starting vision, the
   greater the treatment benefit with aflibercept. However, aflibercept and
   ranibizumab, respectively, are approximately 31 and 20 times more
   expensive than bevacizumab.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs)
   of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab for the treatment of DME.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Post hoc analysis of efficacy, safety,
   and resource utilization data at 1-year follow-up from the Diabetic
   Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Comparative Effectiveness Trial.
   Patients were enrolled from August 22, 2012, through August 28, 2013,
   and analysis was performed from August 21, 2014, through November 7,
   2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ICERs for all trial participants and
   subgroups with baseline vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/ 32
   to 20/ 40 (better vision) and baseline vision of approximate Snellen
   equivalent 20/ 50 or worse (worse vision). One-year trial data were used
   to calculate cost-effectiveness for 1 year for the 3 anti-VEGF agents;
   mathematical modeling was then used to project 10-year
   cost-effectiveness results.
   RESULTS The study included 624 participants (mean {[}SD] age, 60.6
   {[}10.5] years; 45.7\% female; 65.5\% white), 209 in the aflibercept
   group, 207 in the bevacizumab group, and 208 in the ranibizumab group.
   For all participants, during 1 year, the ICERs of aflibercept and
   ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were \$ 1 110 000 per
   quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and \$ 1 730 000 per QALY,
   respectively. During 10 years, they were \$ 349 000 per QALY and \$ 603
   000 per QALY, respectively. Compared with ranibizumab, aflibercept's
   ICER was \$ 648 000 per QALY at 1 year and \$ 203 000 per QALY at 10
   years. For the subgroup with worse baseline vision, the 10-year ICERs of
   aflibercept and ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were \$ 287 000
   per QALY and \$ 817 000 per QALY, respectively. In eyes with decreased
   vision from DME, treatment costs of aflibercept and ranibizumab would
   need to decrease by 69\% and 80\%, respectively, to reach a
   cost-effectiveness threshold of \$ 100 000 per QALY compared with
   bevacizumab during a 10-year horizon; for the subgroup with worse
   baseline vision, the costs would need to decrease by 62\% and 84\%,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Aflibercept (2.0 mg) and ranibizumab (0.3 mg)
   are not cost-effective relative to bevacizumab for treatment of DME
   unless their prices decrease substantially. These results highlight the
   challenges that physicians, patients, and policymakers face when safety
   and efficacy results are at odds with cost-effectiveness results.}},

Abstract = {{Two isostructural energetic cocrystals containing 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene
   (TNB) were obtained with the energetic materials
   1,3,5-triiodo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TITNB) and
   1,3,5-tribromo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TBTNB) in ratios of 2:1 TNB/TITNB
   (1) and 2:1 TNB/TBTNB (2). These materials contain the shortest
   nitro-iodo and second shortest nitro-bromo interactions seen in the
   Cambridge Structural Database for organohalides. Computational studies
   indicate that the cocrystals are more stable than their respective
   component crystals by 11.5 kJ/mol for 1 and 8.2 kJ/mol for 2. While the
   formation of an isostructural 2:1 cocrystal with
   1,3,5-trichloro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TCTNB) was calculated to be
   favorable by 8.5 kJ/mol, only a physical mixture of the two coformers
   was obtained experimentally. Both 1 and 2 possess high crystallographic
   densities (2.203 and 1.980 g/cm(3), respectively) and were found to be
   insensitive in small-scale impact drop tests, possessing sensitivity
   between that of TNB and TXTNB (X = I or Br). The halogen content of the
   two cocrystals suggests application as insensitive biocidal energetics.
   Halogen bonding, facilitated by the strong polarization induced by
   aromatic ring nitration, plays a critical role in the formation of these
   cocrystals and offers a promising route to the development of new
   energetic cocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{The problem under consideration in this paper is that of enforcement by
   supervisory control of a given property on a partially-observed
   discrete-event system. We present a general methodology that is
   applicable to a large class of properties previously studied
   (individually) in the literature. These properties include, but are not
   restricted to, safety, diagnosability, opacity, detectability, anonymity
   and attractability. When the given system does not satisfy the
   considered property, the objective is to synthesize a supervisor that
   restricts the system's behavior and provably enforces the given
   property; moreover, it is required that this supervisor be maximally
   permissive. We consider the general case where the system's events are
   partitioned into observable and unobservable events, and controllable
   and uncontrollable events, and we do not make any assumptions about
   these two partitions; in particular, we do not assume that all
   controllable events are observable. Our uniform approach first maps the
   considered property to a suitably-defined information state for the
   partially-observed system and then develops a supervisor synthesis
   methodology based on a finite bipartite transition system that embeds
   all reachable information states and all admissible supervisory control
   strategies. This transition system is called the All Enforcement
   Structure (or AES). We present an algorithm for the construction of the
   AES and discuss its properties. Then we use the AES to develop a
   synthesis algorithm that constructs a supervisor that is provably
   property enforcing and maximally permissive. We illustrate the
   application of our uniform approach to the enforcement of the
   above-mentioned properties.}},

Abstract = {{To harvest more energy from wind, wind turbine size has rapidly
   increased, entailing the serious concern on the reliability of the wind
   turbine. Accordingly, the international standard requires turbine
   designers to estimate the extreme load that could be imposed on a
   turbine during normal operations. At the design stage, physics-based
   load simulations can be used for this purpose. However, simulating the
   extreme load associated with a small load exceedance probability is
   computationally prohibitive. In this study, we propose using importance
   sampling combined with order statistics to reduce the computational
   burden significantly while achieving much better estimation accuracy
   than existing methods.}},

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Chains in a polymer network deform nonaffinely at small length scales
   due to the ability for extensive microscopic rearrangement. Classically,
   the conformations of an individual chain can be described solely by an
   end-to-end length. This picture neglects interchain interactions and
   therefore does not represent the behavior of a real polymer network. The
   primitive path concept provides the additional detail to represent
   interchain entanglements, and techniques have recently been developed to
   identify the network of primitive paths in a polymer simulation. We use
   coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) to track both chain end-to-end
   and primitive path deformation in crosslinked polymer networks. The
   range of simulated materials includes short chain unentangled networks
   to long, entangled chain networks. Both chain end-to-end and primitive
   path length are found to be linear functions of the applied deformation,
   and a simple relationship describes the behavior of a network in
   response to large stretch uniaxial, pure shear, and equibiaxial
   deformations. As expected, end-to-end chain length deformation is
   nonaffine for short chain networks, and becomes closer to affine for
   networks of long, entangled chains. However, primitive path deformation
   is found to always be nonaffine, even for long, entangled chains. We
   demonstrate how the microscopic constraints of crosslinks and
   entanglements affect nonaffine chain deformation as well as the
   simulated elastic behavior of the different networks.}},

Abstract = {{In consulting, finance, and other service industries, customers
   represent a revenue stream, and must be acquired and retained over time.
   In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem of a profit
   maximizing service firm that dynamically allocates its resources toward
   acquiring new clients and retaining unsatisfied existing ones. The
   interaction between acquisition and retention in our model is reflected
   in the cash constraint on total expected spending on acquisition and
   retention in each period. We formulate this problem as a dynamic program
   in which the firm makes decisions in both acquisition and retention
   after observing the current size of its customer base and receiving
   information about customers in danger of attrition, and we characterize
   the structure of the optimal acquisition and retention strategy. We show
   that when the firm's customer base size is relatively low, the firm
   should spend heavily on acquisition and try to retain every unhappy
   customer. However, as its customer base grows, the firm should gradually
   shift its emphasis from acquisition to retention, and it should also aim
   to strike a balance between acquisition and retention while spending its
   available resources. Finally, when the customer base is large enough, it
   may be optimal for the firm to begin spending less in both acquisition
   and retention. We also extend our analysis to situations where
   acquisition or retention success rate, as a function of resources
   allocation, is uncertain and show that the optimal acquisition and
   retention policy can be surprisingly complex. However, we develop an
   effective heuristic for that case. This paper aims to provide service
   managers some analytical principles and effective guidelines on resource
   allocation between these two significant activities based on their
   firm's customer base size.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a method to spatially control gene expression following
   nonviral delivery of DNA. This method includes surface-modifying DNA
   nanocarriers with heparin to inhibit passive gene transfer in both the
   target and the off-target tissues and using ultrasound-targeted micro
   bubble destruction (UTMD) to selectively activate heparin inhibited gene
   transfer at the target site. We observed that the engraftment of heparin
   onto the surface of cationic liposomes reduced off-target gene
   expression in the liver, a major site of nanoplex accumulation, by more
   than 700-fold compared to the nonheparinized PEGylated liposomes. We
   further observed that tumor-directed UTMD increased gene transfer with
   heparin-modified nanoplexes by more than 10 fold. This method augmented
   tumor-to-liver selectivity of gene expression by 4000-fold compared to
   controls. We conclude that heparinization of DNA nanocarriers in
   conjunction with localized activation of gene transfer by UTMD may
   enable greater spatial control over genetic therapy.}},

Abstract = {{We study the charge transfer (CT) states in small-molecule blend
   heterojunctions comprising the nonpolar donor,
   tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP), and the acceptor, C-70, using
   electroluminescence and steady-state and time resolved photoluminescence
   spectroscopy along with density functional theory 3 calculations. We
   find that the CT exciton energy blue shifts as the C-70 ea 10
   concentration in the blend is either decreased or increased away from 50
   vol \%. At 20 K, the increase in CT state lifetime is correlated with
   the increasing diameter of C-70 nanocrystallites in the blends. A
   quantum confinement model is used to 5 quantitatively describe the
   dependence of both CT energy and lifetime on the C-70 or DBP domain
   size. Two discrete CT emission peaks are observed for blends whose C-70
   concentration is >65\%, at which point C-70 nanocrystallites with
   diameters >4 nm appear in high-resolution transmission electron
   micrographs. The presence of two CT states is attributed to coexistence
   of crystalline C-70 and amorphous phases in the blends. Furthermore,
   analysis of CT dissociation efficiency versus photon energy suggests
   that the >90\% dissociation efficiency of delocalized CT2 states from
   the crystalline phase significantly contributes to surprisingly
   efficient photogeneration in highly dilute (>80\% C-70) DBP/C-70
   heterojunctions.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{826}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{An innovative field-particle correlation technique is proposed that uses
   single-point measurements of the electromagnetic fields and particle
   velocity distribution functions to investigate the net transfer of
   energy from fields to particles associated with the collisionless
   damping of turbulent fluctuations in weakly collisional plasmas, such as
   the solar wind. In addition to providing a direct estimate of the local
   rate of energy transfer between fields and particles, it provides vital
   new information about the distribution of that energy transfer in
   velocity space. This velocity-space signature can potentially be used to
   identify the dominant collisionless mechanism responsible for the
   damping of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind. The application of
   this novel field-particle correlation technique is illustrated using the
   simplified case of the Landau damping of Langmuir waves in an
   electrostatic 1D-1V Vlasov-Poisson plasma, showing that the procedure
   both estimates the local rate of energy transfer from the electrostatic
   field to the electrons and indicates the resonant nature of this
   interaction. Modifications of the technique to enable single-point
   spacecraft measurements of fields and particles to diagnose the
   collisionless damping of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind are
   discussed, yielding a method with the potential to transform our ability
   to maximize the scientific return from current and upcoming spacecraft
   missions, such as the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and Solar Probe
   Plus missions.}},

Title = {{Hybrid Simulation Framework for Immediate Facility Restoration Planning
   after a Catastrophic Disaster}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Since the effects of external conditions, such as limited resource
   supplies and poor working environments in damaged regions, are critical
   to facility restoration projects after a catastrophic disaster, a lack
   of understanding regarding restoration conditions may lead to unexpected
   delays and additional project costs. The fact that various elements of
   postdisaster restoration conditions interact with each other and vary
   with a facility's surrounding damage and recovery situations over time
   makes many stakeholders' comprehension even more challenging. To support
   immediate and appropriate facility restoration planning under changing
   project conditions, this study developed a hybrid system dynamics
   (SD)-discrete event simulation (DES) framework. In this hybrid
   restoration simulation, SD allows for a comprehensive understanding of
   the dynamic features of various restoration conditions, while DES
   enables an in-depth examination of facility restoration operations
   according to external condition changes. By allowing two simulations to
   seamlessly interact together, this study provides key insights into
   postdisaster restoration, including how complex and critical restoration
   conditions change over time depending on facility types and subregions,
   and to what extent these conditions adversely impact a project's
   performance and uncertainty throughout lengthy project durations,
   especially when restoration work scope and processes vary with damage
   patterns. A test tool for analyzing the effectiveness of managerial
   policies is also provided by showing experimental results. For instance,
   a project initiation, postponed to avoid unfavorable restoration
   conditions, can be delayed to reduce the project's uncertainty by
   alleviating possible increases in wasted time and cost of running an
   unproductive site. Therefore, the major contribution of this research to
   the body of knowledge in construction engineering resides in the
   capacity for the developed hybrid model to make facility restoration
   planning and execution deal with project uncertainties caused by chaotic
   and disrupting external conditions. As such, unexpected delays and
   additional costs common for postdisaster recovery can be alleviated.}},

Title = {{High-resolution velocity measurement in the inner part of turbulent
   boundary layers over super-hydrophobic surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{801}},
Pages = {{670-703}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Digital holographic microscopy is used for characterizing the profiles
   of mean velocity, viscous and Reynolds shear stresses, as well as
   turbulence level in the inner part of turbulent boundary layers over
   several super-hydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) with varying roughness/texture
   characteristics. The friction Reynolds numbers vary from 693 to 4496,
   and the normalized root mean square values of roughness (k(rms)(+)) vary
   from 0.43 to 3.28. The wall shear stress is estimated from the sum of
   the viscous and Reynolds shear stress at the top of roughness elements
   and the slip velocity is obtained from the mean profile at the same
   elevation. For flow over SHSs with k(rms)(+)<1, drag reduction and an
   upward shift of the mean velocity profile occur, along with a mild
   increase in turbulence in the inner part of the boundary layer. As the
   roughness increases above k(rms)(+) similar to 1, the flow over the SHSs
   transitions from drag reduction, where the viscous stress dominates, to
   drag increase where the Reynolds shear stress becomes the primary
   contributor. For the present maximum value of k(rms)(+) = 3.28, the
   inner region exhibits the characteristics of a rough wall boundary
   layer, including elevated wall friction and turbulence as well as a
   downward shift in the mean velocity profile. Increasing the pressure in
   the test facility to a level that compresses the air layer on the SHSs
   and exposes the protruding roughness elements reduces the extent of drag
   reduction. Aligning the roughness elements in the streamwise direction
   increases the drag reduction. For SHSs where the roughness effect is not
   dominant (k(rms)(+) < 1), the present measurements confirm previous
   theoretical predictions of the relationships between drag reduction and
   slip velocity, allowing for both spanwise and streamwise slip
   contributions.}},

Abstract = {{Pile driving is a complex dynamic process where little insight has been
   garnered in terms of the energy transfer from the driver to the soil and
   surrounding structures. Ground motion measurements during driving of
   full-scale steel H-piles with diesel hammers are presented. The key
   feature of this work is the in-depth sensor installation starting very
   close to the pile (0.2m), at other radial distances from the pile, and
   at various depths in the ground. Differences in wave sources from the
   tip and the shaft of the pile as well as wave attenuation coefficients
   are revealed from the sensor measurements. Attenuation relationships
   fitted through the data could be used to predict ground motion that
   could cause shakedown settlement. A conventional line array of
   surface-mounted geophones was also used and results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenesis of cancer is often driven by the modulation of the
   tumor microenvironment. Recent reports have highlighted that the
   progressive stiffening of tumor matrix is crucial for malignant
   transformation. Though extensive work has been done analyzing the
   mechanotransductive signals involved in tumor progression, it is still
   not clear whether the stiffness induced changes in cancer cell behavior
   is conserved across the invasive/ aggressive phenotype of cells. Here,
   we used synthetic hydrogel based cell culture platform to correlate the
   aggressive potential of the breast cancer cells to the responses to
   matrix stiffness. The cellular functions such as proliferation,
   migration, and angiogenic capability were characterized. We report that
   the proliferation and motility of the highly aggressive cell line
   MDA-MB-231 increased with increase in matrix rigidity. We also
   demonstrated for the first time that the change in matrix stiffness
   stimulated the angiogenic activity of these cells as manifested from
   enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
   Inhibition of actomyosin contractility attenuated proliferation of
   MDA-MB-231 cells on stiff matrices while promoted the growth on soft
   gels. In addition, the release of VEGF was reduced upon inhibition of
   contractility. The less and non-aggressive breast cancer cells, SKBr3
   and MCF-7 respectively displayed less dependency on matrix stiffness.

Abstract = {{A particular challenge in biomaterial development for treating
   orthopedic injuries stems from the need to balance bioactive design
   criteria with the mechanical and geometric constraints governed by the
   physiological wound environment. Such trade-offs are of particular
   importance in large craniofacial bone defects which arise from both
   acute trauma and chronic conditions. Ongoing efforts in our laboratory
   have demonstrated a mineralized collagen biomaterial that can promote
   human mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis in the absence of osteogenic
   media but that possesses suboptimal mechanical properties in regards to
   use in loaded wound sites. Here we demonstrate a multi-scale composite
   consisting of a highly bioactive mineralized collagen-glycosaminoglycan
   scaffold with micron-scale porosity and a polycaprolactone support frame
   (PCL) with millimeter-scale porosity. Fabrication of the composite was
   performed by impregnating the PCL support frame with the mineral
   scaffold precursor suspension prior to lyophilization. Here we evaluate
   the mechanical properties, permeability, and bioactivity of the
   resulting composite. Results indicated that the PCL support frame
   dominates the bulk mechanical response of the composite resulting in a
   6000-fold increase in modulus compared to the mineral scaffold alone.
   Similarly, the incorporation of the mineral scaffold matrix into the
   composite resulted in a higher specific surface area compared to the PCL
   frame alone. The increased specific surface area in the collagen-PCL
   composite promoted increased initial attachment of porcine adipose
   derived stem cells versus the PCL construct. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Due to the good balance between high efficiency and accuracy, meta-model
   based optimization algorithm is an important global optimization
   category and has been widely applied. To better solve the highly
   nonlinear and computation intensive engineering optimization problems,
   an enhanced hybrid and adaptive meta-model based global optimization
   (E-HAM) is first proposed in this work. Important region update method
   (IRU) and different sampling size strategies are proposed in the
   optimization method to enhance the performance. By applying self-moving
   and scaling strategy, the important region will be updated adaptively
   according to the search results to improve the resulting precision and
   convergence rate. Rough sampling strategy and intensive sampling
   strategy are applied at different stages of the optimization to improve
   the search efficiently and avoid results prematurely gathering in a
   small design space. The effectiveness of the new optimization algorithm
   is verified by comparing to six optimization methods with different
   variables bench mark optimization problems. The E-HAM optimization
   method is then applied to optimize the design parameters of the
   practical negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) crash box in this work. The
   results indicate that the proposed E-HAM has high accuracy and
   efficiency in optimizing the computation intensive problems and can be
   widely used in engineering industry.}},

   using a Segway robot. The dataset was collected to facilitate research
   focusing on long-term autonomous operation in changing environments. The
   dataset is composed of 27 sessions spaced approximately biweekly over
   the course of 15 months. The sessions repeatedly explore the campus,
   both indoors and outdoors, on varying trajectories, and at different
   times of the day across all four seasons. This allows the dataset to
   capture many challenging elements including: moving obstacles (e.g.
   pedestrians, bicyclists and cars), changing lighting, varying viewpoint,
   seasonal and weather changes (e.g. falling leaves and snow), and
   long-term structural changes caused by construction projects. To further
   facilitate research, we also provide ground-truth pose for all sessions

Abstract = {{Objective. Loss of even part of the upper limb is a devastating injury.
   In order to fully restore natural function when lacking sufficient
   residual musculature, it is necessary to record directly from peripheral
   nerves. However, current approaches must make trade-offs between signal
   quality and longevity which limit their clinical potential. To address
   this issue, we have developed the regenerative peripheral nerve
   interface (RPNI) and tested its use in non-human primates. Approach. The
   RPNI consists of a small, autologous partial muscle graft reinnervated
   by a transected peripheral nerve branch. After reinnervation, the graft
   acts as a bioamplifier for descending motor commands in the nerve,
   enabling long-term recording of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   functionally-specific electromyographic (EMG) signals. We implanted nine
   RPNIs on separate branches of the median and radial nerves in two rhesus
   macaques who were trained to perform cued finger movements. Main
   results. No adverse events were noted in either monkey, and we recorded
   normal EMG with high SNR (>8) from the RPNIs for up to 20 months
   post-implantation. Using RPNI signals recorded during the behavioral
   task, we were able to classify each monkey's finger movements as
   flexion, extension, or rest with >96\% accuracy. RPNI signals also
   enabled functional prosthetic control, allowing the monkeys to perform
   the same behavioral task equally well with either physical finger
   movements or RPNI-based movement classifications. Significance. The RPNI
   signal strength, stability, and longevity demonstrated here represents a
   promising method for controlling advanced prosthetic limbs and fully
   restoring natural movement.}},

   influence of pump and seed chirp on the generated idler bandwidth and
   pulse duration. The amplifier is realized using zinc-germanium phosphide
   crystals pumped by a 2 mu m ultrafast parametric source. Idler pulses at
   a center wavelength of 5 mu m with adjustable bandwidth are produced by
   equally chirping the pump and seed pulses using material dispersion.
   Using this simple approach, efficient generation of narrowband, short,
   mid-IR laser pulses is achieved without the use of high-loss dispersive
   gratings or prism pairs. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The need for more data throughput is a requirement that will keep
   growing in future wireless standards, and during the past few years,
   millimeter-wave technology has generated much excitement in the mobile
   and wireless communications sectors due to the large bandwidth it can
   offer. In this letter two different travelling-wave, slot antenna arrays
   are proposed which can offer tunable switched-beam capability at
   millimeter-wave frequencies. The antenna systems are built on a single
   layer PCB with top- and bottom-side etching for operation at 28 GHz with
   at least 0.7 GHz of measured impedance bandwidth. For the first design,
   a planar 2 X 4 slot antenna array is proposed while the second design is
   implemented using a 4 X 4 slot array to demonstrate improved beam
   directivity. A Butler matrix for simple beam switching in the far-field
   is also integrated within the compact antenna structure to provide the
   needed phased array operation. The total size of the two proposed
   systems with their feed networks are 55.2 X 55 X 0.13 mm(3) and 53.7 X
   61.2 X 0.13 mm(3), respectively. These new travelling-wave switched beam
   arrays can be placed within current handheld mobile devices for high
   bandwidth short range communications enabling 5G technologies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Ultrasound techniques are increasingly being used to quantitatively
   characterize both native and engineered tissues. This review provides an
   overview and selected examples of the main techniques used in these
   applications. Grayscale imaging has been used to characterize
   extracellular matrix deposition, and quantitative ultrasound imaging
   based on the integrated backscatter coefficient has been applied to
   estimating cell concentrations and matrix morphology in tissue
   engineering. Spectral analysis has been employed to characterize the
   concentration and spatial distribution of mineral particles in a
   construct, as well as to monitor mineral deposition by cells over time.
   Ultrasound techniques have also been used to measure the mechanical
   properties of native and engineered tissues. Conventional ultrasound
   elasticity imaging and acoustic radiation force imaging have been
   applied to detect regions of altered stiffness within tissues.
   Sonorheometry and monitoring of steady-state excitation and recovery
   have been used to characterize viscoelastic properties of tissue using a
   single transducer to both deform and image the sample. Dual-mode
   ultrasound elastography uses separate ultrasound transducers to produce
   a more potent deformation force to microscale characterization of
   viscoelasticity of hydrogel constructs. These ultrasound-based
   techniques have high potential to impact the field of tissue engineering
   as they are further developed and their range of applications expands.}},

Abstract = {{For the problem of a functionally graded thick-walled tube subjected to
   internal pressure, we have already presented the elasticity solution
   based on the Voigt method in Xin et al. (Int J Mech Sci 89:344-349,
   2014). This paper discusses the elastic-plastic problem of the
   functionally graded thick-walled tube subjected to internal pressure and
   gives the solution in terms of volume fractions of the constituents. We
   assume that the tube consists of two linear work hardening
   elastic-plastic constituents and the volume fraction of one phase is a
   power function varied in the radical direction. The Lam, constants and
   yield stress of the constituents of the FGM tube are given rather than
   Young's modulus and yield stress with different unknown parameters of
   the whole material in the existing papers. As the internal pressure
   increases, the deformations of one phase and two phases from elastic to
   plastic are analyzed. The present method is valid for materials with
   different Poisson's ratios rather than constant Poisson's ratios usually
   used in the existing references to obtain the effective Young's modulus.
   More importantly, the influences of linear work hardening on plastic
   behavior are considered in this work.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, it is attempted to give an insight into the injection
   processability of three self-prepared polymers from A to Z. This work
   presents material analysis, injection molding simulation, design of
   experiments alongside considering all interaction effects of controlling
   parameters carefully for green biodegradable polymeric systems,
   including polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic acid-thermoplastic
   polyurethane (PLA-TPU) and polylactic acid-thermoplastic starch
   (PLA-TPS). The experiments were carried out using injection molding
   simulation software Autodesk Moldflow (R) in order to minimize warpage
   and volumetric shrinkage for each of the mentioned systems. The analysis
   was conducted by changing five significant processing parameters,
   including coolant temperature, packing time, packing pressure, mold
   temperature and melt temperature. Taguchi's L27 (35) orthogonal array
   was selected as an efficient method for design of simulations in order
   to consider the interaction effects of the parameters and reduce
   spurious simulations. Meanwhile, artificial neural network (ANN) was
   also used for pattern recognition and optimization through modifying the
   processing conditions. The Taguchi coupled analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   and ANN analysis resulted in definition of optimum levels for each
   factor by two completely different methods. According to the results,
   melting temperature, coolant temperature and packing time had
   significant influence on the shrinkage and warpage. The ANN optimal
   level selection for minimization of shrinkage and/or warpage is in good
   agreement with ANOVA optimal level selection results. This investigation
   indicates that PLA-TPU compound exhibits the highest resistance to
   warpage and shrinkage defects compared to the other studied compounds.

Abstract = {{Objective: Psychostimulants are partially effective in reducing
   cognitive dysfunction associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD). Cognitive effects of guanfacine, an alternative
   treatment, are poorly understood. Given its distinct action on alpha(2A)
   receptors, guanfacine may have different or complementary effects
   relative to stimulants. This study tested stimulant and guanfacine
   monotherapies relative to combined treatment on cognitive functions
   important in ADHD.
   Method: Children with ADHD (n = 182; aged 7-14 years) completed an
   8-week, double blind, randomized, controlled trial with 3 arms:
   d-methylphenidate (DMPH), guanfacine (GUAN), or combination treatment
   with DMPH and GUAN (COMB). A nonclinical comparison group (n = 93) had
   baseline testing, and a subset was retested 8 weeks later (n = 38).
   Analyses examined treatment effects in 4 cognitive domains (working
   memory, response inhibition, reaction time, and reaction time
   variability) constructed from 20 variables.
   Results: The ADHD group showed impaired working memory relative to the
   nonclinical comparison group (effect size = -0.53 SD unit). The
   treatments differed in effects on working memory but not other cognitive
   domains. Combination treatment improved working memory more than GUAN
   but was not significantly better than DMPH alone. Treatment did not
   fully normalize the initial deficit in ADHD relative to the comparison
   group.
   Conclusion: Combined treatment with DMPH and GUAN yielded greater
   improvements in working memory than placebo or GUAN alone, but the
   combined treatment was not superior to DMPH alone and did not extend to
   other cognitive domains. Although GUAN may be a useful add-on treatment
   to psychostimulants, additional strategies appear to be necessary to
   achieve normalization of cognitive function in ADHD.}},

Title = {{Ammonia-water mixture property code (AWProC) development, verification

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{26-37}},

Abstract = {{The improvement of thermodynamic efficiency of power plants is of great
   interest for the whole energy industry. The use of Kalina cycle has a
   great potential to improve the thermal efficiency of a nuclear power
   plant. This cycle uses a mixture of ammonia and water as working fluid.
   In this paper, we discuss the development of an Ammonia-Water mixture
   Property Code (AWProC). The estimation of the mixture properties are
   based on the Gibbs free energy functions. The code is verified and
   validated against experimental data available in the literature and
   REFPROP code. It is shown that AWProC can accurately estimate the
   thermodynamic properties of ammonia-water mixtures over a wide range of
   conditions, including high temperature and pressure regions. The code is
   then used to investigate the feasibility of applying the Kalina cycle to
   a typical Pressurizer Water Reactor (PWR) plant as an effective way to
   improve the plant efficiency. The fundamental of Basic-Kalina (B-K)
   cycle is described in detail firstly. Then, two modified configurations,
   Recuperation-Kalina (R-K) and Flash-Kalina (F-K) cycles respectively,
   are proposed for a typical 1000 MWe PWR. The simulation results indicate
   that the R-K type cycle can reach about 31.2\% efficiency with simple
   equipment requirements, while the F-K type cycle can reach efficiencies
   up to about 34.8\%, but at the expenses of a slightly more complex
   design. The present work demonstrates the applicability of the Kalina
   cycle as a way to improve the thermal efficiency of a nuclear power
   plant. This concept is meaningful for improving nuclear power plants
   economic and competitiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aortic dissection is a disease whereby an injury in the wall of the
   aorta leads to the creation of a true lumen and a false lumen separated
   by an intimal flap which may contain multiple communicating tears
   between the lumina. It has a high associated morbidity and mortality,
   but at present, the timing of surgical intervention for stable type B
   dissections remains an area of debate. Detailed knowledge of
   haemodynamics may yield greater insight into the long-term outcomes for
   dissection patients by providing a greater understanding of pressures,
   wall shear stress and velocities in and around the dissection. In this
   paper, we aim to gather further insight into the complex haemodynamics
   in aortic dissection using medical imaging and computational fluid
   dynamics modelling. Towards this end, several computer models of the
   aorta of a patient presenting with an acute Stanford type B dissection
   were created whereby morphometric parameters related to the dissection
   septum were altered, such as removal of the septum, and the variation of
   the number of connecting tears between the lumina. Patient-specific flow
   data acquired using 2D PC-MRI in the ascending aorta were used to set
   the inflow boundary condition. Coupled zero-dimensional (Windkessel)
   models representing the distal vasculature were used to define the
   outlet boundary conditions and tuned to match 2D PC-MRI flow data
   acquired in the descending aorta. Haemodynamics in the dissected aorta
   were compared to those in an equivalent `healthy aorta', created by
   virtually removing the intimal flap (septum). Local regions of increased
   velocity, pressure, wall shear stress and alterations in flow
   distribution were noted, particularly in the narrow true lumen and
   around the primary entry tear. The computed flow patterns compared
   favourably with those obtained using 4D PC-MRI. A lumped-parameter heart
   model was subsequently used to show that in this case there was an
   estimated 14 \% increase in left ventricular stroke work with the onset
   of dissection. Finally, the effect of secondary connecting tears (i.e.
   those excluding the primary entry and exit tears) was also studied,
   revealing significant haemodynamic changes when no secondary tears are
   included in the model, particularly in the true lumen where increases in
   flow over and drops in peak pressure of 18 \% were observed.}},

Abstract = {{Though the new OSN model, which deploys datacenters globally, helps
   reduce service latency, it causes higher inter-datacenter communication
   load. In Facebook, each datacenter has a full copy of all data, and the
   master datacenter updates all other datacenters, generating tremendous
   load in this new model. Distributed data storage, which only stores a
   user's data to his/her geographically closest datacenters mitigates the
   problem. However, frequent interactions between distant users lead to
   frequent inter-datacenter communication and hence long service
   latencies. In this paper, we aim to reduce inter-datacenter
   communications while still achieving low service latency. We first
   verify the benefits of the new model and present OSN typical properties
   that underlie the basis of our design. We then propose Selective Data
   replication mechanism in Distributed Datacenters (SD3). Since replicas
   need inter-datacenter data updates, datacenters in SD3 jointly consider
   update rates and visit rates to select user data for replication;
   furthermore, SD3 atomizes users' different types of data (e.g., status
   update, friend post, music) for replication, ensuring that a replica
   always reduces inter-datacenter communication. SD3 also incorporates
   three strategies to further enhance its performance: locality-aware
   multicast update tree, replica deactivation, and datacenter congestion
   control. The results of trace-driven experiments on the real-world
   PlanetLab testbed demonstrate the higher efficiency and effectiveness of
   SD3 in comparison to other replication methods and the effectiveness of
   its three schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to describe a novel strategy to determine the traction
   forces needed to reproduce physiologic uterine displacement in women
   with and without prolapse.
   Participants underwent dynamic stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   testing as part of a study examining apical uterine support. Physiologic
   uterine displacement was determined by analyzing uterine location in
   images taken at rest and at maximal Valsalva. Force-displacement curves
   were calculated based on intraoperative cervical traction testing. The
   intraoperative force required to achieve the uterine displacement
   measured during MRI was then estimated from these curves. Women were
   categorized into three groups based on pelvic organ support: group 1
   (normal apical and vaginal support), group 2 (normal apical support but
   vaginal prolapse present), and group 3 (apical prolapse).
   Data from 19 women were analyzed: five in group 1, five in group 2, and
   nine in group 3. Groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index
   (BMI), and parity. Median operating room (OR) force required for uterine
   displacement measured during MRI was 0.8 N {[}interquartile range (IQR)
   0.62-3.22], and apical ligament stiffness determined using MRI uterine
   displacement was 0.04 N/mm (IQR 0.02-0.08); differences between groups
   were nonsignificant. Uterine locations determined at rest and during
   maximal traction were lower in the OR compared with MRI in all groups.
   Using this investigative strategy, we determined that only 0.8 N of
   traction force in the OR was required to achieve maximal physiologic
   uterine displacement seen during dynamic (maximal Valsalva) MRI testing,
   regardless of the presence or absence of prolapse.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a robust control problem of a class of
   networked systems operated within a multiple communication channels
   (MCCs) environment. A practical scenario is considered that the active
   channel in such MCCs for the data communication is switched and the
   switching is governed by a Markov chain. For each channel, two
   network-induced imperfections, time delays, and packet dropouts with
   different characteristics are taken into account. Suppose that the
   practical plant is subject to energy-bounded disturbance and
   norm-bounded uncertainties, a robust controller is designed to ensure
   that the closed-loop system is robustly stable and achieves a
   disturbance attenuation index against the phenomenon of channel
   switching. A semi-active suspension system is introduced to illustrate
   the effectiveness, applicability of the proposed approach, and to
   demonstrate the advantages of the MCCs scheme within the
   channel-switching framework.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{800}},
Pages = {{5-56}},

Abstract = {{The atmospheric ventilation of a surface-piercing hydrofoil is examined
   in a series of towing-tank experiments, performed on a vertically
   cantilevered hydrofoil with an immersed free tip. The results of the
   experiments expand upon previous studies by contributing towards a
   comprehensive understanding of the topology, formation and elimination
   of ventilated flows at low-to-moderate Froude and Reynolds numbers.
   Fully wetted, fully ventilated and partially ventilated flow regimes are
   identified, and their stability regions are presented in parametric
   space. The stability of partially and fully ventilated regimes is
   related to the angle of the re-entrant jet, leading to a set of criteria
   for identifying flow regimes in a laboratory environment. The stability
   region of fully wetted flow overlaps those of partially and fully
   ventilated flows, forming bi-stable regions where hysteresis occurs.
   Ventilation transition mechanisms are classified as formation and
   elimination mechanisms, which separate the three steady flow regimes
   from one another. Ventilation formation requires air ingress into
   separated flow at sub-atmospheric pressure from a continuously available
   air source. Ventilation washout is caused by upstream flow of the
   re-entrant jet. The boundary denoting washout of fully ventilated flow
   is expressed as a semi-theoretical scaling relation, which captures past
   and present experimental data well across a wide range of Froude and
   Reynolds numbers.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{290-308}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study fatigue failure using the variational multiscale
   method (VMM). In the VMM, displacement jumps are represented using
   finite elements with specially constructed discontinuous shape
   functions. These elements are progressively added along the crack path
   during fatigue failure. The stiffness of these elements changes
   non-linearly in response to the accumulation of damage during cyclic
   loading. The evolution law for stiffness is represented as a function of
   traction and the number of loading cycles since the initial onset of
   failure. Numerical examples illustrate the use of this new methodology
   for modeling macroscopic crack growth under Mode I loading as well as
   microscopic crack growth under mixed mode loading within the elastic
   regime. We find that the discontinuous elements can consistently predict
   the Mode I stress intensity factor (SIF) and the micro-structurally
   short crack growth paths, and that the computed Paris law for steady
   crack growth is controlled primarily by two parameters in the decohesion
   law. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Existing hybrid powertrain architectures, i.e., the connections from
   engine and motors to the vehicle output shaft, are designed for
   particular vehicle applications, e.g., passenger cars or city buses, to
   achieve good fuel economy. For effective electrification of new
   applications (e.g., heavy-duty trucks or racing cars), new architectures
   may need to be identified to accommodate the particular vehicle
   specifications and drive cycles. The exploration of feasible
   architectures is combinatorial in nature and is conventionally based on
   human intuition. We propose a mathematically rigorous algorithm to
   enumerate all feasible powertrain architectures, therefore enabling
   automated optimal powertrain design. The proposed method is general
   enough to account for single and multimode architectures as well as
   different number of planetary gears (PGs) and powertrain components. We
   demonstrate through case studies that our method can generate the
   complete sets of feasible designs, including the ones available in the
   market and in patents.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs) are highly nonlinear and it is hard to
   approach the problem analytically or computationally. Experimental
   investigation is therefore essential to address the problem and reveal
   some physical aspects of VIV. Although computational fluid dynamics
   (CFDs) offers powerful methods to generate solutions, it cannot replace
   experiments as yet. When used as a supplement to experiments, however,
   CFD can be an invaluable tool to explore some underlying issues
   associated with such complicated flows that could otherwise be
   impossible or very expensive to visualize or measure experimentally. In
   this paper, VIVs and galloping of a cylinder with selectively
   distributed surface roughness-termed passive turbulence control
   (PTC)-are investigated experimentally and computationally. The
   computational approach is first validated with benchmark experiments on
   smooth cylinders available in the literature. Then, experiments
   conducted in the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab) of the
   University of Michigan are replicated computationally to visualize the
   flow and understand the effects of thickness and width of roughness
   strips placed selectively on the cylinder. The major outcomes of this
   work are: (a) Thicker PTC initiates earlier galloping but wider PTC does
   not have a major impact on the response of the cylinder and (b) The
   amplitude response is restricted in VIV due to the dead fluid zone
   attached to the cylinder, which is not observed in galloping.}},

   provided the reference LR image (to be super-resolved). The (simple)
   algorithm implemented by Salem and Yagle is only applicable when the
   scene is static. In this paper, we recast our approach to SR as a
   two-stage example-based algorithm to process dynamic scenes. We employ
   feature selection to create, from the LR frames, local LR dictionaries
   to represent PPCs of HR patches. To enforce sparsity, we implement
   Gaussian generative models as an efficient alternative to L1-norm
   minimization. Estimation errors are further reduced using what we refer
   to as the anchors, which are based on the relationship between PPCs
   corresponding to different sampling rates. In the second stage, we
   revert to simple single frame SR (applied to each frame), using HR
   dictionaries extracted from the super-resolved sequence of the previous
   stage. The second stage is thus a reiteration of the sparsity coding
   scheme, using only one LR sequence, and without involving PPCs. The
   ability of the modified algorithm to super-resolve challenging LR
   sequences reintroduces sampling rate diversity as a prerequisite of
   robust multiframe SR.}},

Abstract = {{Cut surface quality of electrodes' affect lithium-ion battery
   performance. Current uses of mechanical cutting require expensive
   tooling. Furthermore, tool wears out over time so that it results in
   process instability and poor cut quality. This may cause an internal
   short circuit and significant heat generation. These problems can be
   solved by using a laser cutting technique since it has many advantages,
   such as no tool wear, high energy concentration, fast processing speed,
   very narrow heat affected zone, applicability to nearly all materials,
   and flexibility of laser power. Understanding physical phenomena
   provides significant advantages to fully utilize the remote laser
   cutting of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, a 3D
   mathematical model of three-dimensional self-consistent remote laser
   cutting is developed for cathode (LiCoO2-coated aluminum) of lithium-ion
   batteries. Characteristics of the remote laser cutting of cathodes,
   liquid/vapor (L/V) interface geometry, and melt pool flow are
   investigated by computational analysis at the laser power of 150W and
   scanning speed of 5000mm s(-1). Experimental results validate the
   proposed computational model and show in good agreement with
   computationally observed results in terms of the kerf width and aluminum
   composition changes along the vertical line of the cut surface. (C) 2016

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LASER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The efficiency of any laser materials processing depends on the
   efficient energy transfer from the laser to a substrate. One of the
   critical factors in the process is the spatial distribution or the
   ``mode{''} of the laser beam. Although an inverse Bremsstrahlung
   initiates the photon to electron energy transfer, a major part of the
   process is transport phenomena created by the absorbed energy. A
   mathematical model for transport phenomena during laser materials
   interaction is developed that includes multiple reflections, capillary
   and thermocapillary forces, recoil pressure, temperature distribution,
   melt pool flow, and phase changes. This model simulates interaction
   between a CO2 laser (lambda = 10.6 mu m) with four different spatial
   distributions and iron. The results of a simulation for fundamental
   understanding of this laser-material interaction are presented in this
   paper. First, overall keyhole behaviors are compared in terms of
   response time, penetration hole geometry, and absorptivity. Furthermore,
   a dimensionless parameter is developed to examine keyhole collapse
   quantitatively. Finally, velocity, temperature, and, intensity fields
   are analyzed. (C) 2016 Laser Institute of America.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, CoNiCrAlY alloy coatings were deposited by
   high-efficiency supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) and

   primarily consisted of the unmelted particles. The beta-NiAl phase
   mainly existed in the unmelted particles, and its content increased with
   the increase of unmelted particles. The thermal cycling life of SAPS
   coating was 258 cycles, about 117 \% higher than that of HVOF coating.
   During thermal cycling, significant internal oxidation and large cracks
   formed in the HVOF coating, which was one of the reasons that led to the

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a robust topology optimization
   methodology for structures with imprecise probability uncertainty. In
   this paper, the imprecise probability uncertainties are treated with an
   interval random model, in which the probability variables are used to
   model the uncertain parameters and some distribution parameters of
   probability variables are expressed as interval variables instead of a
   precise value. In the presented methodology, the deterministic topology
   optimization techniques and the hybrid stochastic interval perturbation
   method (HSIPM) are combined to obtain robust topology designs for
   structures with interval random parameters. The exploitation of HSIPM
   transforms the problem of topology optimization with interval random
   parameters into an augmented deterministic topology optimization
   problem. This provides a computationally cheap alternative to Monte
   Carlo-based optimization algorithms. Several numerical examples are
   presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C)

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver cancer, has the fastest growing
   incidence among cancers in the United States. Current liver ablation
   methods are thermal-based and share limitations due to the heat sink
   effect from the blood flow through the highly vascular liver. Recently,
   our group has investigated histotripsy as a non-invasive liver cancer
   ablation method. Histotripsy is a non-thermal ultrasonic ablation method
   that fractionates tissue through the control of acoustic cavitation.
   Previous experiments in an in vivo porcine model show that histotripsy
   can create well-confined lesions in the liver through ribcage
   obstruction without damaging the overlying ribs and other tissues.
   Histotripsy can also completely fractionate liver tissue surrounding
   major vessels while preserving the vessels. In this study, we
   investigate the long-term effects of histotripsy liver ablation in a
   rodent model. We hypothesize that the fractionated histotripsy lesion
   will be resorbed by the liver, resulting in effective tissue healing. To
   test this hypothesis, the livers of 20 healthy rats were treated with
   histotripsy using an 8-element 1-MHz histotripsy transducer. Rats were
   euthanized after 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days (n = 4). In vivo and post
   mortem results showed histotripsy lesions were successfully generated
   through the intact abdomen in all 20 rats. Magnetic resonance imaging
   found primarily negative contrast on day 0, positive contrast on day 3
   and rapid normalization of signal intensity thereafter (i.e., signal
   amplitude returned to baseline levels seen in healthy liver tissue).
   Histologically, lesions were completely fractionated into an acellular
   homogenate. The lesions had a maximum cross-sectional area of 17.2 +/-
   1.9 mm(2) and sharp boundaries between the lesion and the healthy
   surrounding tissue after treatment. As the animals recovered after
   treatment, the histotripsy tissue homogenate was almost completely
   replaced by regenerated liver parenchyma, resulting in a small fibrous
   lesion (<1 mm(2) maximum cross-section) remaining after 28 d. The
   results of this study suggest that histotripsy has potential as a
   non-invasive liver ablation method for effective tissue removal.

Abstract = {{Retracted blood clots have been previously recognized to be more
   resistant to drug-based thrombolysis methods, even with ultrasound and
   microbubble enhancements. Microtripsy, a new histotripsy approach, has
   been investigated as a non-invasive, drug-free and image-guided method
   that uses ultrasound to break up clots with improved treatment accuracy
   and a lower risk of vessel damage compared with the traditional
   histotripsy thrombolysis approach. Unlike drug-mediated thrombolysis,
   which is dependent on the permeation of the thrombolytic agents into the
   clot, microtripsy controls acoustic cavitation to fractionate clots. We
   hypothesize that microtripsy thrombolysis is effective on retracted
   clots and that the treatment efficacy can be enhanced using strategies
   incorporating electronic focal steering. To test our hypothesis,
   retracted clots were prepared in vitro and the mechanical properties
   were quantitatively characterized. Microtripsy thrombolysis was applied
   on the retracted clots in an in vitro flow model using three different
   strategies: single-focus, electronically-steered multi-focus and
   dual-pass multi-focus. Results show that microtripsy was used to
   successfully generate a flow channel through the retracted clot and the
   flow was restored. The multi-focus and the dual-pass treatments
   incorporating the electronic focal steering significantly increased the
   recanalized flow channel size compared to the single-focus treatments.
   The dual-pass treatments achieved a restored flow rate up to 324 mL/min
   without cavitation contacting the vessel wall. The clot debris particles
   generated from microtripsy thrombolysis remained within the safe range.
   The results of this study show the potential of microtripsy thrombolysis
   for retracted clot recanalization with the enhancement of electronic
   focal steering. (E-mail: xizh@umich.edu) (C) 2016 World Federation for

Abstract = {{The first quantitative surface acidity scale for Bronsted acids on a
   solid surface is presented through the use of titration-displacement and
   equilibrium experiments on anatase TiO2. Surface acidities of species on
   TiO2 correlated with gas phase acidities, as was previously observed in
   qualitative studies of Bronsted acid displacement on Ag(110), Cu(110)
   and Au(111). A 90\% compression of the surface acidity scale relative to
   the gas phase was observed due to compensation from the covalent
   component of the conjugate base - surface bond. Adsorbed conjugate bases
   need not be completely anionic for correlations with gas phase acidities
   to hold. Positive and negative substituent effects, such as substituted
   fluorine and hydrocarbon sidechain dispersion interactions with the
   surface, may modify the surface acidity scale, in agreement with
   previous experimental and theoretical work on Au(111). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a technology for converting algal
   biomass into biocrude oil and high-value products. To elucidate the
   underlying kinetics for this process, we conducted isothermal and

   min), temperatures (100-400 degrees C), and average heating rates
   (110-350 degrees C min(-1)). Biocrude reached high yields (>= 37 wt\%)
   within 2 min for heat-source set-point temperatures of 350 degrees C or
   higher. We developed a microalgal HTL kinetic model valid from 10 s to
   60 min, including significantly shorter timescales (10 s-10 min) than
   any previous model. The model predicts that up to 46 wt\% biocrude
   yields are achievable at 400 degrees C and 1 min, reaffirming the
   utility of short holding times and ``fast{''}HTL. We highlight potential
   trade-offs between maximizing biocrude quantity and facilitating aqueous
   phase recovery, which may improve biocrude quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel multi-layer diffusion couple was used to isolate the diffusion
   of strontium, europium and cesium in SiC without introducing radiation
   damage to SiC and at concentrations below the solubility limit for the
   fission products in SiC. Diffusion occurred by both bulk and grain
   boundary pathways for all three fission products between 900 degrees C
   and 1, 300 degrees C. Cesium was the fastest diffuser below 1,100
   degrees C and the slowest above this temperature. Strontium and europium
   diffusion tracked very closely as a function of temperature for both
   bulk and grain boundary diffusion. Migration energies ranged from 1.0 eV
   to 5.7 eV for bulk diffusion and between 2.2 eV and 4.7 eV for grain
   boundary diffusion. These constitute the first measurements of diffusion
   of cesium, europium, and strontium in silicon carbide, and the magnitude
   of the cesium diffusion coefficient supports the premise that high
   quality TRISO fuel should have minimal cesium release. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{269-277}},

Abstract = {{Cryopreservation or cryostorage of tissue engineered constructs can
   enhance the off-the shelf availability of these products and thus can
   potentially facilitate the commercialization or clinical translation of
   tissue engineered products. Encapsulation of cells within hydrogel
   matrices, in particular alginate, is widely used for fabrication of
   tissue engineered constructs. While previous studies have explored the
   cryopreservation response of cells encapsulated within alginate
   matrices, systematic investigation of the impact of alginate
   concentration on the metabolic activity and functionality of
   cryopreserved cells is lacking. The objective of the present work is to
   determine the metabolic and angiogenic activity of cryopreserved human
   dermal fibroblasts encapsulated within 1.0\%, 1.5\% and 2.0\% (w/v)
   alginate matrices. In addition, the goal is to compare the efficacy of
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and trehalose as cryoprotectant. Our study
   revealed that the concentration of alginate plays a significant role in
   the cryopreservation response of encapsulated cells. The lowest
   metabolic activity of the cryopreserved cells was observed in 1\%
   alginate microspheres. When higher concentration of alginate was
   utilized for cell encapsulation, the metabolic and angiogenic activity
   of the cells frozen in the absence of cryoprotectants was comparable to
   that observed in the presence of DMSO or trehalose. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries have a major impact on material properties, but
   explicit consideration of the complex geometries of grain structures in
   simulations poses a challenge. In this paper, we present a general
   method for incorporating the effect of grain boundaries based on the
   Smoothed Boundary Method (SBM). By using multiple domain parameters to
   define the domains of different grains, this method circumvents
   time-consuming mesh generation steps that are associated with finite
   element calculations involving complex microstructures. To validate the
   approach, we evaluate the accuracy of the SBM against the sharp
   interface method. The capabilities of this approach were demonstrated
   through simulations of surface and grain boundary diffusion, as well as
   those of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This method is
   applicable to many material systems in which grain boundaries play a
   crucial role. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   ions (Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, and Tb) and several ns(2) ions (TI, Pb, Bi,
   and Sb). Based on both ground-state calculations and constrained DFT
   calculations to simulate excited states, the trivalent lanthanide
   dopants were shown not to constitute an improvement over Ce3+, for which
   experimental data exist, as they showed occupied 4f states below the
   valence band maximum (VBM) and 5d states above the conduction band
   maximum (CBM). In contrast, the only divalent lanthanide considered,
   Eu2+, displayed occupied 4f states within the band gap of the host, but
   its 5d states were calculated to be above the CBM. Eu2+ could
   nonetheless be exploited as an activator by increasing the band gap
   energy slightly through substitution of iodide ions by bromide ions.
   Similar results were obtained for Tr+. Finally, Bi3+ and Sla(3+) were
   predicted to be efficient activators in LaI3 by virtue of having
   unoccupied p states below the CBM, which can serve as electron traps and
   can combine with holes at the VBM to form localized luminescence
   centers. Therefore, Bi- and Sb-doped LaI3 should be grown and tested
   experimentally. Comparison with empirical relationships of the relative
   positions of the energy levels of rare-earth dopants and implications
   for efficient doping schemes and scintillation mechanisms in LaI3 are
   also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Naval shipbuilding industry faces significant challenges to
   build ships on-time and within budgeted cost. To achieve greater
   efficiency and timeliness in shipbuilding, we developed a flexible two
   stage queueing model under a CONWIP job release policy to enhance the
   planning and control of the outfitting process, one of the key processes
   in shipbuilding. The model is formulated using Markov Decision Processes
   which can provide (1) the optimal dynamic control policy and (2) the
   optimal cost. The numerical results showed that the optimal control
   policy is a state dependent threshold type policy and very complex to
   analyze. Therefore, we developed a static model to simplify the dynamic
   model and used Mean Value Analysis to gain insights. Using both data
   from the dynamic model and the static model, we developed a regression
   model to calculate a threshold policy heuristic. Testing reveals that
   the performance of this heuristic is very close to the optimal. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Thermal modulation of analyte effluents at a junction between serially
   connected complementary columns is a critical process in comprehensive
   two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC). However, little effort has
   been made to theoretically study this process with a full understanding
   of key phenomena. We developed a theoretical model of single-stage
   thermal modulation processes based on fundamental physics of gas
   chromatography (GC) with the aim to elucidate factors leading to
   improvements in GC x GC analyses. Model predictions were compared with
   experimental data obtained using our microfabricated thermal modulator
   (mu TM) operating as a single-stage thermal modulator. Built upon
   one-dimensional (D-1) GC theory, our model predicted the temporal and
   spatial distribution of analyte concentration within a thermal modulator
   (TM) channel during periodically repeating modulation cycles, each
   consisting of a cooling and heating period and yielding sharp peaks from
   a broad first dimension peak. Our model incorporated the effect of the
   location of the incoming D-1 Gaussian peak to the mu TM, with respect to
   the onset of the cooling period and the influence of cold interconnects
   on the thermal modulation process. Excellent match between experiment
   and simulation was obtained. Finally we proposed a few design
   modifications which could drastically improve performance of our mu TM.

Title = {{Stochastic shock response spectrum decomposition method based on
   probabilistic definitions of temporal peak acceleration, spectral

   shock test data}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Most of the times pyrotechnic shock design and test requirements for
   space systems are provided in Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) without the
   input time history. Since the SRS does not describe the input or the
   environment, a decomposition method is used to obtain the source time
   history. The main objective of this paper is to develop a decomposition
   method producing input time histories that can satisfy the SRS
   requirement based on the pyrotechnic shock test data measured from a
   mechanical impact test apparatus. At the heart of this decomposition
   method is the statistical representation of the pyrotechnic shock test
   data measured from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory (LL) designed Universal
   Pyrotechnic Shock Simulator (UPSS). Each pyrotechnic shock test data
   measured at the interface of a test unit has been analyzed to produce
   the temporal peak acceleration, Root Mean Square (RMS) acceleration, and
   the phase lag at each band center frequency. Maximum SRS of each
   filtered time history has been calculated to produce a relationship
   between the input and the response. Two new definitions are proposed as
   a result. The Peak Ratio (PR) is defined as the ratio between the
   maximum SRS and the temporal peak acceleration at each band center
   frequency. The ratio between the maximum SRS and the RMS acceleration is
   defined as the Energy Ratio (ER) at each band center frequency. Phase
   lag is estimated based on the time delay between the temporal peak
   acceleration at each band center frequency and the peak acceleration at
   the lowest band center frequency. This stochastic process has been
   applied to more than one hundred pyrotechnic shock test data to produce
   probabilistic definitions of the PR, ER, and the phase lag. The SRS is
   decomposed at each band center frequency using damped sinusoids with the
   PR and the decays obtained by matching the ER of the damped sinusoids to
   the ER of the test data. The final step in this stochastic SRS
   decomposition process is the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The MC
   simulation identifies combinations of the PR and decays that can meet
   the SRS requirement at each band center frequency. Decomposed input time
   histories are produced by summing the converged damped sinusoids with
   the MC simulation of the phase lag distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed of increasing the application of random
   forest (RF) models that are known as an exhibit good practical
   performance, especially in high-dimensional settings. However, on the
   theoretical side, their predictive ability markedly remains unexplained,
   especially in coal preparation. RF as a predictive model can tend to
   work well with large dimensional databases and rank predictors through
   its inbuilt variable importance measures. In this study, relationships
   among ultimate and proximate analyses of 6339 US coal samples from 26
   states with gross calorific value (GCV) have been investigated by
   multivariable regression (MVR) and random forest (RF) models. RF method
   has been used for the variable importance. Models have shown that the
   ultimate analysis parameters are the most suitable estimators for GCV
   and that RF can predict GCV quite satisfactory. Running of the best
   arranged RF structures for the input sets and assessment of errors have
   suggested that RF models are suitable for complicated relationships. (C)

Abstract = {{Tin (Sn) has long been considered to be a promising replacement anode
   material for graphite in next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),
   because of its attractive comprehensive advantages of high
   gravimetric/volumetric capacities, environmental benignity, low cost,
   high safety, etc. However, Sn-based anodes suffer from severe capacity
   fading resulting mainly from their large volume expansions/contractions
   during lithiation/delithiation and subsequent pulverization,
   coalescence, delamination from current collectors, and poor Li+/electron
   transport. To circumvent these issues, a number of extraordinary
   architectures from nanostructures to anchored, layered/sandwich,
   core-shell, porous and even integrated structures have been exquisitely
   constructed to enhance the cycling performance. To cater for the rapid
   development of Sn-based anodes, we summarize the advances made in
   structural design principles, fabrication methods, morphological
   features and battery performance with focus on material structures. In
   addition, we identify the associated challenges and problems presented
   by recently-developed anodes and offer suggestions and perspectives for
   facilitating their practical implementations in next-generation LIBs.

Abstract = {{Dipolarization fronts (DFs), embedded in bursty bulk flows, play a
   crucial role in Earth's plasma sheet dynamics because the energy input
   from the solar wind is partly dissipated in their vicinity. This
   dissipation is in the form of strong low-frequency waves that can heat
   and accelerate energetic electrons up to the high-latitude plasma sheet.
   However, the dynamics of DF propagation and associated low-frequency
   waves in the magnetotail are still under debate due to instrumental
   limitations and spacecraft separation distances. In May 2015 the
   Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission was in a string-of-pearls
   configuration with an average intersatellite distance of 160km, which
   allows us to study in detail the microphysics of DFs. Thus, in this
   letter we employ MMS data to investigate the properties of
   dipolarization fronts propagating earthward and associated whistler mode
   wave emissions. We show that the spatial dynamics of DFs are below the
   ion gyroradius scale in this region (approximate to 500km), which can
   modify the dynamics of ions in the vicinity of the DF (e.g., making
   their motion nonadiabatic). We also show that whistler wave dynamics
   have a temporal scale of the order of the ion gyroperiod (a few
   seconds), indicating that the perpendicular temperature anisotropy can
   vary on such time scales.}},

Abstract = {{The response of equatorial ionosphere to the magnetospheric origin DP 2
   current system fluctuations is examined using ground-based
   multiinstrument observations. The interaction between the solar wind and
   magnetosphere generates a convection electric field that can penetrate
   to the ionosphere and cause the DP 2 current system. The quasiperiodic
   DP 2 current system, which fluctuates coherently with fluctuations of
   the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B-z, penetrates nearly
   instantaneously to the dayside equatorial region at all longitudes and
   modulates the electrodynamics that governs the equatorial density
   distributions. In this paper, using magnetometers at high and equatorial
   latitudes, we demonstrate that the quasiperiodic DP 2 current system
   penetrates to the equator and causes the dayside equatorial electrojet
   (EEJ) and the independently measured ionospheric drift velocity to
   fluctuate coherently with the high-latitude DP 2 current as well as with
   the IMF B-z component. At the same time, radar observations show that
   the ionospheric density layers move up and down, causing the density to
   fluctuate up and down coherently with the EEJ and IMF B-z.}},

Abstract = {{Surface waves at the magnetopause flanks typically feature steeper,
   i.e., more inclined leading (antisunward facing) than trailing (sunward
   facing) edges. This is expected for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI)
   amplified waves. Very rarely, during northward interplanetary magnetic
   field (IMF) conditions, anomalous/inverse steepening has been observed.
   The small-scale tetrahedral configuration of the Magnetospheric
   Multiscale spacecraft and their high time resolution measurements enable
   us to routinely ascertain magnetopause boundary inclinations during
   surface wave passage with high accuracy by four-spacecraft timing
   analysis. At the dusk flank magnetopause, 77\%/23\% of the analyzed wave
   intervals exhibit regular/inverse steepening. Inverse steepening happens
   during northward IMF conditions, as previously reported and, in
   addition, during intervals of dominant equatorial IMF. Inverse
   steepening observed under the latter conditions may be due to the
   absence of KHI or due to instabilities arising from the alignment of
   flow and magnetic fields in the magnetosheath.}},

   three-dimensional analysis}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Of interest here is the fully three-dimensional analysis of the
   Freedericksz transition for the twisted nematic device (TND), which is
   widely used in liquid-crystal display monitors. Using a coupled
   electromechanical variational formulation, the problem is treated as a
   bifurcation instability triggered by an externally applied electric
   field. More specifically, we study a finite thickness liquid-crystal
   layer, anchored between two infinite parallel plates relatively rotated
   with respect to each other by a given twist angle and subjected to a
   uniform electric field perpendicular to these bounding plates. The
   novelty of the proposed analysis lies in the fully three-dimensional
   formulation of the TND problem that considers all possible bounded
   perturbations about the principal solution. By scanning a wide range of
   the liquid crystal's material parameter space, we establish whether the
   Freedericksz transition is global, i.e., has an eigenmode depending
   solely on the layer thickness coordinate, or local (also termed the
   periodic Freedericksz transition), i.e., has an eigenmode with finite
   wavelengths in one or both directions parallel to the plate. It is found
   that global modes are typical for low values, while local modes appear
   at large values of the twist angle. Moreover, for certain TND's, the
   increase in twist angle can lower the critical electric field, findings
   that could be useful in guiding liquid-crystal selection for
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We study photonic band gap formation in two-dimensional
   high-refractive-index disordered materials where the dielectric
   structure is derived from packing disks in real and reciprocal space.
   Numerical calculations of the photonic density of states demonstrate the
   presence of a band gap for all polarizations in both cases. We find that
   the band gap width is controlled by the increase in positional
   correlation inducing short-range order and hyperuniformity concurrently.
   Our findings suggest that the optimization of short-range order, in
   particular the tailoring of Bragg scattering at the isotropic Brillouin
   zone, are of key importance for designing disordered PBG materials.}},

Abstract = {{Point mutations in gamma-cytoplasmic actin have been shown to result in
   autosomal-dominant, nonsyndromic, early-onset deafness. Two mutations at
   the same site, K118M and K118N, provide a unique opportunity to compare
   the effects of two dissimilar amino acid substitutions that produce a
   similar phenotype in humans. K118 resides in a helix that runs from K113
   to T126, and mutations that alter the position, dynamics, and/or
   biochemistry of this helix can result in a wide range of pathologies.
   Using a combination of computational and experimental studies, both
   employing yeast actin, we find that these mutations at K118 result in
   changes in the structure and dynamics of the DNase-I loop, alterations
   in the structure of the H73 loop as well as the side-chain orientations
   of W79 and W86, changes in nucleotide exchange rates, and significant
   shifts in the twist of the actin monomer. Interestingly, in the case of
   K118N, the twist of the monomer is nearly identical to that of the
   F-actin protomer, and in vitro polymerization assays show that this
   mutation results in faster polymerization. Taken together, these results
   indicate that mutations at this site give rise to a series of small
   changes that can be tolerated in vivo but result in misregulation of
   actin assembly and dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Many oxygenated hydrocarbon species formed during combustion, such as
   furans, are highly toxic and detrimental to human health and the
   environment. These species may also increase the hygroscopicity of soot
   and strongly influence the effects of soot on regional and global
   climate. However, large furans and associated oxygenated species have
   not previously been observed in flames, and their formation mechanism
   and interplay with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are poorly
   understood. We report on a synergistic computational and experimental
   effort that elucidates the formation of oxygen-embedded compounds, such
   as furans and other oxygenated hydrocarbons, during the combustion of
   hydrocarbon fuels. We used ab initio and probabilistic computational
   techniques to identify low-barrier reaction mechanisms for the formation
   of large furans and other oxygenated hydrocarbons. We used vacuum-UV
   photoionization aerosol mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy to confirm these predictions. We show that furans are
   produced in the high-temperature regions of hydrocarbon flames, where
   they remarkably survive and become the main functional group of
   oxygenates that incorporate into incipient soot. In controlled flame
   studies, we discovered similar to 100 oxygenated species previously
   unaccounted for. We found that large alcohols and enols act as
   precursors to furans, leading to incorporation of oxygen into the carbon
   skeletons of PAHs. Our results depart dramatically from the crude
   chemistry of carbon-and oxygen-containing molecules previously
   considered in hydrocarbon formation and oxidation models and spearhead
   the emerging understanding of the oxidation chemistry that is critical,
   for example, to control emissions of toxic and carcinogenic combustion
   by-products, which also greatly affect global warming.}},

Abstract = {{The structural stability of fluorite-type La2Ce2O7 was studied at
   pressure up to similar to 40 GPa and under hydrothermal conditions of 1
   GPa and up to 350 degrees C, respectively, using synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering measurements. XRD measurements
   indicated that the fluorite-type La2Ce2O7 is not stable at pressures
   greater than 22.6 GPa and gradually transformed to a high-pressure
   phase. The high-pressure phase is not stable and changeed back to the
   fluorite-type structure when pressure is released. The La2Ce2O7 fluorite
   is also not stable under hydrothermal conditions and began to react with
   water at 200-250 degrees C. Both Raman and XRD results suggest that
   lanthanum hydroxide La(OH)(3) and La3+-doped CeO2 fluorite are the
   dominant products after hydrothermal treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{An emerging number of non-chemokine mediators are found to bind to
   classical chemokine receptors and to elicit critical biological
   responses. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an
   inflammatory cytokine that exhibits chemokine-like activities through
   non-cognate interactions with the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4,
   in addition to activating the type II receptor CD74. Activation of the
   MIF-CXCR2 and -CXCR4 axes promotes leukocyte recruitment, mediating the
   exacerbating role of MIF in atherosclerosis and contributing to the
   wealth of other MIF biological activities. Although the structural basis
   of the MIF-CXCR2 interaction has been well studied and was found to
   engage a pseudo-ELR and an N-like loop motif, nothing is known about the
   regions of CXCR4 and MIF that are involved in binding to each other.
   Using a genetic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that expresses a
   functional CXCR4 receptor, site-specific mutagenesis, hybrid CXCR3/CXCR4
   receptors, pharmacological reagents, peptide array analysis, chemotaxis,
   fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism, we provide novel
   molecular information about the structural elements that govern the
   interaction between MIF and CXCR4. The data identify similarities with
   classical chemokine-receptor interactions but also provide evidence for
   a partial allosteric agonist compared with CXCL12 that is possible due
   to the two binding sites of CXCR4.}},

Abstract = {{We combine classical nucleation theory with superharmonic focusing to
   predict necessary pressures to induce nucleation in acoustic droplet
   vaporization. We show that linear acoustics is a valid approximation to
   leading order when particle displacements in the sound field are small
   relative to the radius of the droplet. This is done by perturbation
   analysis of an axisymmetric compressible inviscid flow about a droplet
   with small surface perturbations relative to the mean radius subjected
   to an incoming ultrasonic wave. The necessary nucleation pressure
   threshold inside the droplet is calculated to be -9.33 +/- 0.30 MPa for
   typical experimental parameters by employing results from classical
   homogeneous nucleation theory. As a result, we are able to predict if a
   given incident pressure waveform will induce nucleation. Published by

Abstract = {{We have developed and tested a radiation portal monitor using organic
   liquid scintillation detectors. In order to optimize our system designs,
   neutron measurements were carried out with three organic liquid
   scintillation detectors of different shapes and sizes, along with a He-3
   radiation portal monitor (RPM) as a reference.
   The three liquids tested were a 7.62 cm diameter by 7.62 cm length
   cylindrical active volume organic liquid scintillation detector, a 12.7
   cm diameter by 12.7 cm length cylindrical active volume organic liquid
   scintillation detector, and a 25 cm by 25 cm by 10 cm ``paddle{''}
   shaped organic liquid scintillation detector. Background and Cf-252
   neutron measurements were recorded to allow for a comparison of neutron
   intrinsic efficiencies as well as receiver operating characteristics
   (ROC) curves between detectors.
   The 12.7 cm diameter cylindrical active volume organic liquid
   scintillation detector exhibited the highest intrinsic neutron
   efficiency (54\%) of all three liquid scintillators. An ROC curve
   analysis for a heavily moderated Cf-252 measurement showed that using
   the 12.7 cm diameter by 12.7 cm length cylindrical active volume Eljen
   EJ309 organic liquid scintillation detector would result in the fewest
   needed detector units in order to achieve a near 100\% positive neutron
   alarm rate while maintaining a better than 1 in 10,000 false alarm rate
   on natural neutron background. A small number of organic liquid
   scintillation detectors could therefore be a valid alternative to He-3
   in some RPM applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Localized delivery of nucleic acids to target sites (e.g., diseased
   tissue) is critical for safe and efficacious gene therapy. An
   ultrasound-based technique termed acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV)
   has been used to spatiotemporally control the release of therapeutic
   small molecules and proteins contained within sonosensitive emulsions.
   Here, ADV is used to control the release of lipoplex-containing plasmid
   DNA encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter-from a
   sonosensitive emulsion. Focused ultrasound (3.5 MHz, mechanical index
   (MI) >= 1.5) generates robust release of fluorescein (i.e., surrogate
   payload) and lipoplex from the emulsion. In situ release of the lipoplex
   from the emulsion using ADV (MI = 1.5, 30 cycles) yields a 55\% release
   efficiency, resulting in 43\% transfection efficiency and 95\% viability
   with C3H/10T1/2 cells. Without exposure to ultrasound, the release and
   transfection efficiencies are 5\% and 7\%, respectively, with 99\%
   viability. Lipoplex released by ADV retains its bioactivity while the
   ADV process does not yield any measureable sonoporative enhancement of
   transfection. Co-encapsulation of Ficoll PM 400 within the
   lipoplex-loaded emulsion, and its subsequent release using ADV, yield
   higher transfection efficiency than the lipoplex alone. The results
   demonstrate that ADV can have utility in the spatiotemporal control of
   gene delivery.}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed analysis of the properties of magnetic
   reconnection at large-scale current sheets (CSs) in a high cadence
   version of the Lynch \& Edmondson 2.5D MHD simulation of sympathetic
   magnetic breakout eruptions from a pseudostreamer source region. We
   examine the resistive tearing and break-up of the three main CSs into
   chains of X- and O-type null points and follow the dynamics of magnetic
   island growth, their merging, transit, and ejection with the
   reconnection exhaust. For each CS, we quantify the evolution of the
   length-to-width aspect ratio (up to similar to 100:1), Lundquist number
   (similar to 10(3)), and reconnection rate (inflow-to-outflow ratios
   reaching similar to 0.40). We examine the statistical and spectral
   properties of the fluctuations in the CSs resulting from the plasmoid
   instability, including the distribution of magnetic island area, mass,
   and flux content. We show that the temporal evolution of the spectral
   index of the reconnection-generated magnetic energy density fluctuations
   appear to reflect global properties of the CS evolution. Our results are
   in excellent agreement with recent, high-resolution
   reconnection-in-a-box simulations even though our CSs' formation,
   growth, and dynamics are intrinsically coupled to the global evolution
   of sequential sympathetic coronal mass ejection eruptions.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the physical origin of plasmas that are ejected from the
   solar corona. To address this issue, we perform a comprehensive analysis
   of the elemental composition of interplanetary coronal mass ejections
   (ICMEs) using recently released elemental composition data for Fe, Mg,
   Si, S, C, N, Ne, and He as compared to O and H. We find that ICMEs
   exhibit a systematic abundance increase of elements with first
   ionization potential (FIP) < 10 eV, as well as a significant increase of
   Ne as compared to quasi-stationary solar wind. ICME plasmas have a
   stronger FIP effect than slow wind, which indicates either that an FIP
   process is active during the ICME ejection or that a different type of
   solar plasma is injected into ICMEs. The observed FIP fractionation is
   largest during times when the Fe ionic charge states are elevated above
   Q(Fe) > 12.0. For ICMEs with elevated charge states, the FIP effect is
   enhanced by 70\% over that of the slow wind. We argue that the
   compositionally hot parts of ICMEs are active region loops that do not
   normally have access to the heliosphere through the processes that give
   rise to solar wind. We also discuss the implications of this result for
   solar energetic particles accelerated during solar eruptions and for the
   origin of the slow wind itself.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{331-338}},

Abstract = {{High consumption of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) is
   accompanied with a high yield of waste electrical and electronic
   equipment (WEEE). Meanwhile, because the different types of resources
   have their own unique properties, the current content of each type will
   remain limited in a range of fluctuations. Therefore, WEEE recycling is
   an obvious choice to meet the resource demands of the electronics
   industry. However, there are uncertainties as to whether a sustainable
   resource supply of the electronics industry can be achieved using
   secondary resources recycled from WEEE. A dynamic sustainable supply
   model was used to estimate the resource sustainability supply index
   (SSI) and the primary resource accumulated consumption (PRAC) from 2010
   to 2050. Four scenarios, which changed one of the key assumptions of the
   model, were used to assess the impact on the SSI and PRAC. These four
   scenarios are lifespan shortening scenario, high-speed formal recycling
   growth scenario, high formal recycling peak scenario, and the resource
   reduction scenario, respectively. Subsequently, a combined policy
   scenario based on their advantages was built and demonstrated to be a
   feasible method to achieve a sustainable resource supply using recycled
   resources. To achieve this scenario, the support of government policy is
   suggested. However, the policy of the funding system in China can only
   be used as an assistant policy because it is unsustainable and cannot
   fundamentally squeeze backyard recyclers out of the market. The Extended
   Producer Responsibility system can be employed to improve the formal
   waste recycle network system in the long run, and in this way, a
   sustainable resources supply can be achieved by 2037 in Beijing, China.

Abstract = {{Existing studies examined the U.S.'s direct GHG emitters and final
   consumers driving upstream GHG emissions, but overlooked the U.S.'s
   primary suppliers enabling downstream GHG emissions and relative
   contributions of socioeconomic factors to GHG emission changes from the
   supply side. This study investigates GHG emissions of sectors in the
   U.S. from production-based (direct emissions), consumption-based
   (upstream emissions driven by final consumption of products), and
   income-based (downstream emissions enabled by primary inputs of sectors)
   viewpoints. We also quantify relative contributions of socioeconomic
   factors to the US's GHG emission changes during 1995-2009 from both the
   consumption and supply sides, using structural decomposition analysis
   (SDA). Results show that income-based method can identify new critical
   sectors leading to GHG emissions (e.g., Renting of Machinery \&
   Equipment and Other Business Activities and Financial Intermediation
   sectors) which are unidentifiable by production-based and
   consumption-based methods. Moreover, the supply side SDA reveals new
   factors for GHG emission changes: mainly production output structure
   representing product allocation pattern and primary input structure
   indicating sectoral shares in primary inputs. In addition to
   production-side and consumption-side GHG reduction measures, the U.S.
   should also pay attention to supply side measures such as influencing
   the behaviors of product allocation and primary inputs.}},

Abstract = {{The thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions are of considerable
   interest due to their promise for efficient energy conversion. While the
   dependence of thermoelectric properties of junctions on molecular
   structure has been recently studied, their temperature dependence
   remains unexplored. Using a custom built variable temperature scanning
   tunneling microscope, we measured the thermopower and electrical
   conductance of individual benzenedithiol junctions over a range of
   temperatures (100K-300K). We find that while the electrical conductance
   is independent of temperature, the thermopower increases linearly with
   temperature, confirming the predictions of the Landauer theory.

   magnetopause. This is an important result because it shows that the
   Saturnian magnetopause is conducive to multiple X-line reconnection and
   flux rope generation. Minimum variance analysis shows that the magnetic
   signature is consistent with a flux rope. The magnetic observations were
   well fitted to a constant- force-free flux rope model. The radius and
   magnetic flux content of the rope are estimated to be 4600-8300km and
   0.2-0.8MWb, respectively. Cassini also observed five traveling
   compression regions (remote signatures of flux ropes), in the adjacent
   magnetosphere. The magnetic flux content is compared to other estimates
   of flux opening via reconnection at Saturn.}},

Abstract = {{Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are oxidized quickly in the
   atmosphere to form oxygenated VOC (OVOC) and play crucial roles in the
   formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. We use the National
   Center for Atmospheric Research's large-eddy simulation model and
   Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically
   Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality 2011 flight data to
   understand the role of boundary layer turbulence on the atmospheric
   chemistry of key BVOC species and their oxidation products. We simulate
   three distinct convective environments during the campaign, representing
   fair weather conditions (case 1: 1 July), a convective event dominated
   by southwesterly flow (case 2: 11 July), and a polluted event with high
   temperature and convection (case 3: 29 July). Isoprene segregation is
   greatest in the lower boundary layer under warm and convective
   conditions, reaching up to a 10\% reduction in the isoprene-OH reaction
   rate. Under warm and convective conditions, the BVOC lifetimes lengthen
   due to increased isoprene emission, elevated initial chemical
   concentrations, and OH competition. Although turbulence-driven
   segregation has less influence on the OVOC species, convection mixes
   more OVOC into the upper atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and increases
   the total OH reactivity. Production and loss rates of ozone above 2km in
   all the three cases indicate in situ ozone formation in addition to
   vertical convective transport of ozone from the surface and aloft,
   consistent with the increased contribution of OH reactivity from OVOC.
   Together, these results show that total OH reactivity in the ABL
   increases under warmer and stronger convective conditions due to
   enhanced isoprene emission and the OVOC contribution to ozone formation.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Topological domains have been proposed as the backbone of
   interphase chromosome structure. They are regions of high local contact
   frequency separated by sharp boundaries. Genes within a domain often
   have correlated transcription. In this paper, we present a computational
   efficient spectral algorithm to identify topological domains from
   chromosome conformation data (Hi-C data). We consider the genome as a
   weighted graph with vertices defined by loci on a chromosome and the
   edge weights given by interaction frequency between two loci.
   Laplacian-based graph segmentation is then applied iteratively to obtain
   the domains at the given compactness level. Comparison with algorithms
   in the literature shows the advantage of the proposed strategy. Results:
   An efficient algorithm is presented to identify topological domains from
   the Hi-C matrix. Availability and Implementation: The Matlab source code

Abstract = {{Purpose: There are no effective treatment options for patients with
   advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Here, we evaluated the effect
   of a new small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction (MI-773)
   in preclinical models of ACC.
   Experimental Design: To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of MI773, we
   administered it to mice harboring three different patient-derived
   xenograft (PDX) models of ACC expressing functional p53. The effect of
   MI-773 on MDM2, p53, phospho-p53, and p21 was examined by Western blots
   in 5 low passage primary human ACC cell lines and in MI-773-treated PDX
   tumors.
   Results: Single-agent MI-773 caused tumor regression in the 3 PDX models
   of ACC studied here. For example, we observed a tumor growth inhibition
   index of 127\% in UM-PDX-HACC-5 tumors that was associated with an
   increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells (P = 0.015). The number of
   p53-positive cells was increased in MI-773-treated PDX tumors (P <
   0.001), with a correspondent shift in p53 localization from the nucleus
   to the cytoplasm. Western blots demonstrated that MI-773 potently
   induced expression of p53 and its downstream targets p21, MDM2, and
   induced phosphorylation of p53 (serine 392) in low passage primary human
   ACC cells. Notably, MI-773 induced a dose-dependent increase in the
   fraction of apoptotic ACC cells and in the fraction of cells in the G(1)
   phase of cell cycle (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Collectively, these data demonstrate that therapeutic
   inhibition of the MDM2-p53 interaction with MI-773 activates downstream
   effectors of apoptosis and causes robust tumor regression in preclinical
   models of ACC. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to investigate the influence of skew on
   the added mass and damping matrices, which govern the vibration
   characteristics of the propulsion system. A 3-D curved lifting line
   model is developed to predict the propeller performance, and the model
   is validated with experimental measurements of the open water
   performance for the classic DTMB propellers 4381-4384 with varying skew.
   To compute the added mass and damping matrices of skewed propellers, the
   3-D curved lifting line model is coupled with 2-D unsteady thin foil
   theory. The added mass and damping predictions are validated with
   published numerical data and empirical equations for a propeller with
   moderate skew. The added mass and damping characteristics of DTMB
   propellers 4381-4384 are calculated, and the influence of skew on these
   characteristics is discussed. The results show that skew affects the
   coupled motions with the sway, heave, pitch, and yaw components of the
   added mass and damping matrices, while the influence on the surge and
   roll components is negligible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Variable viscosity and density biofilm simulations using an immersed

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{317}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to develop a numerical simulation that
   accurately captures the biomechanical response of bacterial biofilms and
   their associated extracellular matrix (ECM). In this, the second of a
   two-part effort, the primary focus is on formally presenting the
   heterogeneous rheology Immersed Boundary Method(hrIBM) and validating
   our model by comparison to experimental results. With this extension of
   the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), we use the techniques originally
   developed in Part I ({[}19]) to treat biofilms as viscoelastic fluids
   possessing variable rheological properties anchored to a set of moving
   locations (i.e., the bacteria locations). In particular, we incorporate
   spatially continuous variable viscosity and density fields into our
   model. Although in {[}14,15], variable viscosity is used in an IBM
   context to model discrete viscosity changes across interfaces, to our
   knowledge this work and Part I are the first to apply the IBM to model a
   continuously variable viscosity field.
   We validate our modeling approach from Part I by comparing dynamic
   moduli and compliance moduli computed from our model to data from
   mechanical characterization experiments on Staphylococcus epidermidis
   biofilms. The experimental setup is described in {[}26] in which
   biofilms are grown and tested in a parallel plate rheometer. In order to
   initialize the positions of bacteria in the biofilm, experimentally
   obtained three dimensional coordinate data was used. One of the major
   conclusions of this effort is that treating the spring-like connections
   between bacteria as Maxwell or Zener elements provides good agreement
   with the mechanical characterization data. We also found that
   initializing the simulations with different coordinate data sets only
   led to small changes in the mechanical characterization results. Matlab
   code used to produce results in this paper will be available at

Abstract = {{We find evidence for hydrated material in the lunar regolith using
   ``albedo protons{''} measured with the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the
   Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).
   Fluxes of these albedo protons, which are emitted from the regolith due
   to steady bombardment by high energy radiation (Galactic Cosmic Rays),
   are observed to peak near the poles, and are inconsistent with the
   latitude trends of heavy element enrichment (e.g., enhanced Fe
   abundance). The latitudinal distribution of albedo protons
   anti-correlates with that of epithermal or high energy neutrons. The
   high latitude enhancement may be due to the conversion of upward
   directed secondary neutrons from the lunar regolith into tertiary
   protons due to neutron-proton collisions in hydrated regolith that is
   more prevalent near the poles. The CRaTER instrument may thus provide
   important measurements of volatile distributions within regolith at the
   Moon and potentially, with similar sensors and observations, at other
   bodies within the Solar System. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Cell therapy is a promising strategy to regenerate cardiac tissue for
   myocardial infarction. Injectable hydrogels with conductivity and
   self-healing ability are highly desirable as cell delivery vehicles for
   cardiac regeneration. Here, we developed self-healable conductive
   injectable hydro gels based on chitosan-graft-aniline tetramer (CS-AT)
   and dibenzaldehyde-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-DA) as cell
   delivery vehicles for myocardial infarction. Self-healed electroactive
   hydrogels were obtained after mixing CS-AT and PEG-DA solutions at
   physiological conditions. Rapid self healing behavior was investigated
   by rheometer. Swelling behavior, morphology, mechanical strength,
   electrochemistry, conductivity, adhesiveness to host tissue and
   antibacterial property of the injectable hydrogels were fully studied.
   Conductivity of the hydrogels is similar to 10(-3) S.cm(-1), which is
   quite dose to native cardiac tissue. Proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in
   the hydrogel showed its good biocompatibility. After injection,
   viability of C2C12 cells in the hydrogels showed no significant
   difference with that before injection. Two different cell types were
   successfully encapsulated in the hydrogels by self-healing effect. Cell
   delivery profile of C2C12 myoblasts and H9c2 cardiac cells showed a
   tunable release rate, and in vivo cell retention in the conductive
   hydrogels was also studied. Subcutaneous injection and in vivo
   degradation of the hydrogels demonstrated their injectability and
   biodegradability. Together, these self-healing conductive biodegradable
   injectable hydrogels are excellent candidates as cell delivery vehicle
   for cardiac repair.}},

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic patterning is a technique that enables
   micro/nanostructures via imposing an external voltage on thin polymer
   films. In this investigation, we studied the electrohydrodynamic
   patterning theoretically and experimentally, with special interest
   focused on the equilibrium state. It is found that the equilibrium
   structure height increases with the voltage. In addition, we have
   observed, and believe it to be the first time, a hysteresis phenomenon
   exists in the relationship between the voltage and structure height.
   With an increase in the voltage, a critical value (the first critical
   voltage) is noticed, above which the polymer film would increase
   dramatically until it comes into contact with the template. However,
   with a decrease in the voltage, a smaller voltage (the second critical
   voltage) is needed to detach the polymer from the template. The mismatch
   of the first and second critical voltages distorts the voltage structure
   height curve into an ``S{''} shape. Such a phenomenon is verified for
   three representative templates and also by experiments. Furthermore, the
   effects of some parameters (e.g., polymer film thickness and dielectric
   constant) on this hysteresis phenomenon are also discussed.}},

Title = {{Damage and failure modelling of hybrid three-dimensional textile
   composites: a mesh objective multi-scale approach}},
Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with predicting the progressive damage and
   failure of multi-layered hybrid textile composites subjected to uniaxial
   tensile loading, using a novel two-scale computational mechanics
   framework. These composites include three-dimensional woven textile
   composites (3DWTCs) with glass, carbon and Kevlar fibre tows.
   Progressive damage and failure of 3DWTCs at different length scales are
   captured in the present model by using a macroscale finite-element (FE)
   analysis at the representative unit cell (RUC) level, while a
   closed-form micromechanics analysis is implemented simultaneously at the
   subscale level using material properties of the constituents (fibre and
   matrix) as input. The N-layers concentric cylinder (NCYL) model (Zhang
   and Waas 2014 Acta Mech. 225, 1391-1417; Patel et al. submitted Acta
   Mech.) to compute local stress, srain and displacement fields in the
   fibre and matrix is used at the subscale. The 2-CYL fibre-matrix
   concentric cylinder model is extended to fibre and (N - 1) matrix
   layers, keeping the volume fraction constant, and hence is called the
   NCYL model where the matrix damage can be captured locally within each
   discrete layer of the matrix volume. The influence of matrix microdamage
   at the subscale causes progressive degradation of fibre tow stiffness
   and matrix stiffness at the macroscale. The global RUC stiffness matrix
   remains positive definite, until the strain softening response resulting
   from different failure modes (such as fibre tow breakage, tow splitting
   in the transverse direction due to matrix cracking inside tow and
   surrounding matrix tensile failure outside of fibre tows) are initiated.
   At this stage, the macroscopic post-peak softening response is modelled
   using the mesh objective smeared crack approach (Rots et al. 1985 HERON
   30, 1-48; Heinrich and Waas 2012 53rd AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures,
   Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, Honolulu, HI, 23-26 April
   2012. AIAA 2012-1537). Manufacturing-induced geometric imperfections are
   included in the simulation, where the FE mesh of the unit cell is
   generated directly from micro-computed tomography (MCT) real data using
   a code SIMPLEWARE. Results from multi-scale analysis for both an
   idealized perfect geometry and one that includes geometric imperfections
   are compared with experimental results (Pankow et al. 2012 53rd
   AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials
   Conference, Honolulu, HI, 23-26 April 2012. AIAA 2012-1572).

Abstract = {{We compare predictions of two of the most advanced versions of the tube
   model, namely the ``Hierarchical model{''} by Wang et al. {[}J. Rheol.
   2010, 54, 223] and the BoB (branch-on-branch) model by Das et al. {[}J.
   Rheol. 2006, SO, 207], against linear viscoelastic G' and G `' data of
   binary blends of nearly monodisperse 1,4-polybutadiene 4-arm star
   polymer of arm molar mass 24 000 g/mol with a monodisperse linear
   1,4-polybutadiene of molar mass 58 000 g/mol. The star was carefully
   synthesized and characterized by temperature gradient interaction
   chromatography and by linear rheology over a wide frequency region
   through time temperature superposition. We found large failures of both
   the Hierarchical and BoB models to predict the terminal relaxation
   behavior of the star/linear blends, despite their success in predicting
   the rheology of the pure star and pure linear polymers. This failure
   occurred regardless of the choices made concerning constraint release,
   such as assuming arm retraction in ``fat{''} or ``skinny{''} tubes.
   Allowing for ``disentanglement relaxation{''} to cut off the constraint
   release Rouse process at long times does lead to improved predictions
   for our blends, but leads to much worse predictions for other
   star/linear blends described in the literature, especially those of
   Shivokhin et al. {[}Macromolecules 2014, 47, 2451]. In addition, our
   blends and those of Shivokhin et al. were also tested against a
   coarse-grained slip-link model, the ``clustered fixed slip-link model
   (CFSM){''} of Schieber and co-workers {[}J. Rheol. 2014, 58, 723], in
   which several Kuhn steps are clustered together for computational
   efficiency. The CFSM with only two molecular-weight- and
   chain-architecture-independent parameters was able to give very good
   agreement with all experimental data for both of these sets of blends.
   In light of its success, the CFSM slip-link model may be used to address
   the constraint release issue more rigorously and potentially help
   develop improved tube models.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the relatively simple morphological blueprint provided by

   cardiomyocytes on an elastomeric body enclosing a microfabricated gold
   skeleton, we replicated fish morphology at 1/10 scale and captured basic
   fin deflection patterns of batoid fish. Optogenetics allows for
   phototactic guidance, steering, and turning maneuvers. Optical
   stimulation induced sequential muscle activation via
   serpentine-patterned muscle circuits, leading to coordinated undulatory
   swimming. The speed and direction of the ray was controlled by
   modulating light frequency and by independently eliciting right and left
   fins, allowing the biohybrid machine to maneuver through an obstacle
   course.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of O-2-N collisions is performed by means of the
   quasi-classical trajectory method on the two lowest ab initio potential
   energy surfaces at temperatures relevant to hypersonic flows. A complete
   set of bound-bound and bound-free transition rates is obtained for each
   precollisional rovibrational state. Special attention is paid to the
   vibrational and rotational relaxations of oxygen as a result of
   chemically non-reactive interaction with nitrogen atoms. The vibrational
   relaxation of oxygen partially occurs via the formation of an
   intermediate NO2 complex. The efficient energy randomization results in
   rapid vibrational relaxation at low temperatures, compared to other
   molecular systems with a purely repulsive potential. The vibrational
   relaxation time, computed by means of master equation studies, is nearly
   an order of magnitude lower than the relaxation time in N-2-O
   collisions. The rotational nonequilibrium starts to play a significant
   effect at translational temperatures above 8000 K. The present work
   provides convenient relations for the vibrational and rotational
   relaxation times as well as for the quasi-steady dissociation rate
   coefficient and thus fills a gap in data due to a lack of experimental
   measurements for this system. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{An analytical approach for predicting the energy capture and conversion

Abstract = {{Impulsive energies are abundant throughout the natural and built
   environments, for instance as stimulated by wind gusts, foot-steps, or
   vehicle-road interactions. In the interest of maximizing the
   sustainability of society's technological developments, one idea is to
   capture these high-amplitude and abrupt energies and convert them into
   usable electrical power such as for sensors which otherwise rely on less
   sustainable power supplies. In this spirit, the considerable sensitivity
   to impulse-type events previously uncovered for bistable oscillators has
   motivated recent experimental and numerical studies on the power
   generation performance of bistable vibration energy harvesters. To lead
   to an effective and efficient predictive tool and design guide, this
   research develops a new analytical approach to estimate the
   electroelastic response and power generation of a bistable energy
   harvester when excited by an impulse. Comparison with values determined
   by direct simulation of the governing equations shows that the
   analytically predicted net converted energies are very accurate for a
   wide range of impulse strengths. Extensive experimental investigations
   are undertaken to validate the analytical approach and it is seen that
   the predicted estimates of the impulsive energy conversion are in
   excellent agreement with the measurements, and the detailed structural
   dynamics are correctly reproduced. As a result, the analytical approach
   represents a significant leap forward in the understanding of how to
   effectively leverage bistable structures as energy harvesting devices
   and introduces new means to elucidate the transient and far-from
   equilibrium dynamics of nonlinear systems more generally. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Nonlinear energy harvesters are very sensitive to ambient vibrations. If
   the excitation level is too low, their large-amplitude oscillations for
   high-energy voltage output cannot be obtained. A nonlinear tristable
   energy harvester has been previously proposed to achieve more effective
   broadband energy harvesting for low-level excitations. However, the
   sensitivity of its dynamic characteristics to the system parameters
   remains uninvestigated. Therefore, this paper theoretically analyzes the
   influence of the external load, the external excitation, the internal
   system parameters and the equilibrium positions on the dynamic responses
   of nonlinear tristable energy harvesters by using the harmonic balance
   method. In addition, numerical acceleration excitation thresholds and
   basins of attraction are provided to investigate the potential for
   energy harvesting performance enhancement using the suitable equilibrium
   positions, appropriate initial conditions or external disturbances, due
   to high-energy interwell oscillations in the multi-solution ranges. More
   importantly, experimental voltage responses of a given tristable energy
   harvester versus the external excitation frequency and amplitude verify
   the existence of experimental multi-solution ranges and the
   effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. It is also revealed that
   achieving high-energy interwell oscillations in the multi-solution
   ranges of tristable energy harvesters will be feasible for improving
   energy harvesting from low-level ambient excitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The performance of polymer interfaces in biology is governed by a wide
   spectrum of interfacial properties. With the ultimate goal of
   identifying design parameters for stem cell culture coatings, we
   developed a statistical model that describes the dependence of brush
   properties on surface-initiated polymerization (SIP) parameters.
   Employing a design of experiments (DOE) approach, we identified
   operating boundaries within which four gel architecture regimes can be
   realized, including a new regime of associated brushes in thin films.
   Our statistical model can accurately predict the brush thickness and the
   degree of intermolecular association of poly{[}\{2-(methacryloyloxy)
   ethyl\} dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide] (PMEDSAH), a
   previously reported synthetic substrate for feeder-free and xeno-free
   culture of human embryonic stem cells. DOE-based multifunctional
   predictions offer a powerful quantitative framework for designing
   polymer interfaces. For example, model predictions can be used to
   decrease the critical thickness at which the wettability transition
   occurs by simply increasing the catalyst quantity from 1 to 3 mol \%.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of amorphous materials near the interface with an ordered
   substrate can be affected by various characteristics of the adjoining
   phases, such as the lattice spacing of the adherent surface, polymer
   chain length, and adhesive strength. To discern the influence of each of
   these factors, four FCC metal lattices are examined for three chain
   lengths of n-alkane and van der Waals interfacial interactions are
   controlled by adjusting the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential parameters. The
   role of interaction strength is investigated for a single chain length
   and substrate combination. Four nanoconfined systems are also analyzed
   in terms of their mechanical strength. A strong layering effect is
   observed near the interface for all systems. The distinctiveness of
   polymer layering, i.e., the maximum density and spatial extent, exhibits
   a logarithmic dependence on the interaction strength between polymer and
   substrate. Congruency with the substrate lattice parameter further
   enhances this effect. Moreover, the elastic modulus of the alkane phase
   as a function of layer thickness indicates that the effects of ordering
   within the structure extend beyond the immediately obvious interfacial
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Dissemination of cancer stem cells (CSCs) serves as the basis of
   metastasis. Recently, we demonstrated that circulating prostate cancer
   targets the hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) `niche' in marrow during
   dissemination. Once in the niche, disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) may
   remain dormant for extended periods. As the major function of the HSC
   niche is to maintain stem cell functions, we hypothesized that the niche
   regulates CSC activities of DTCs. Here we show that DTCs recovered from
   marrow were significantly enriched for a CSC phenotype. Critically, the
   conversion of DTCs to CSCs is regulated by niche-derived GAS6 through
   the Mer/mTOR; molecules previously shown to regulate dormancy. The data
   demonstrate that the niche plays a significant role in maintaining
   tumor-initiating prostate cancer in marrow and suggests a functional
   relationship between CSCs and dormancy. Understanding how the marrow
   niche regulates the conversion of DTCs to CSCs is critical for the
   development of therapeutics specifically targeting skeletal bone
   metastasis and dormancy.}},

Abstract = {{A cohesive-zone analysis for crack propagation in a linear
   visco-elastic/creeping material is presented. The concept of a viscous
   fracture length is defined; this serves an analogous role to the elastic
   fracture length in determining the conditions under which fracture is
   controlled by the continuum crack-tip stress field. It is shown that
   there are two regimes for viscous crack growth. The first regime occurs
   in the limit of small viscous fracture lengths, when the crack-tip
   stress field has a region exhibiting the inverse square-root dependence
   expected from classical linear fracture mechanics. In this regime, the
   crack velocity is proportional to the fourth power of the
   stress-intensity factor. This is consistent with an existing analytical
   model developed for crack growth in linear polymers. The second regime
   occurs for large viscous fracture lengths, where classical fracture
   mechanics is not appropriate. In this regime, the crack velocity has a
   weaker dependence on the applied load, and can be modeled accurately by
   the solution to the problem of a viscous beam on an elastic foundation.
   At higher crack velocities, when the viscous fracture length exceeds the
   elastic fracture length, the expected transition to elastic fracture
   occurs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Cancer Detection}},
Journal = {{CANCERS}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Improving early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving lung
   cancer survival. Studies have shown that computerized tomography (CT)
   screening can reduce mortality from lung cancer, but this involves risks
   of radiation exposure and can identify non-cancer lung nodules that lead
   to unnecessary interventions for some. There is a critical need to
   develop alternative, less invasive methods to identify patients who have
   early-stage lung cancer. The detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
   are a promising area of research, but current technology is limited by a
   low yield of CTCs. Alternate studies are investigating circulating
   nucleic acids and proteins as possible tumor markers. It is critical to
   develop innovative methods for early lung cancer detection that may
   include CTCs or other markers that are low-risk and low-cost, yet
   specific and sensitive, to facilitate improved survival by diagnosing
   the disease when it is surgically curable.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the high innate regenerative capacity of bone, large osseous
   defects fail to heal and remain a clinical challenge. Healing such
   defects requires the formation of large amounts of bone in an
   environment often rendered hostile to osteogenesis by damage to the
   surrounding soft tissues and vasculature. In recent years, there have
   been intensive research efforts directed towards tissue engineering and
   regenerative approaches designed to overcome this multifaceted
   challenge. In this paper, we describe and critically evaluate the
   state-of-the-art approaches to address the various components of this
   intricate problem. The discussion includes (i) the properties of
   synthetic and natural scaffolds, their use in conjunction with cell and
   growth factor delivery, (ii) their vascularisation, (iii) the potential
   of gene therapies and (iv) the role of the mechanical environment. In
   particular, we present a critical analysis of where the field stands,
   and how it can move forward in a coordinated fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Classified advertisement sites often follow two different approaches to
   filter classified advertisement data to customers and potential
   customers. The first approach is to reach out to the broader market,
   allowing the customers to filter to their target market on the
   classified website. The downside of this approach is that it lacks the
   customization and specialization people in a niche market tend to
   prefer. The second approach is to create classified advertisement
   websites that are customized to meet the needs of a target or niche
   market. This specialization is more appealing to niche market customers.
   However, the second approach is more focused. Therefore, the customer
   base is smaller, and expanding to more markets requires building more
   websites, which can be costly in time, money and effort. In this paper
   the authors propose a framework that allows website developers to
   quickly and efficiently create targeted market websites. The framework
   proposed enables website developers to quickly customize text, context
   and features offered on the newly created targeted market website. In
   addition, the framework overcomes the entry barrier new websites face by
   obtaining the starting classified listings required to make a new
   classified website viable to potential buyers and sellers.}},

Abstract = {{Search engines are crucial for information gathering systems (IGS). New
   challenges face search engines concerning automatic learning from user

   (MFIS), the first step is to implement a scalable system to relay
   logical rules in order to produce three classifications for search
   behavior, user profiles, and query characteristics from analysis of
   navigation log files. These three outputs from the MFIS are used as
   inputs for the second step, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System
   (ANFIS). The training process of the ANFIS replaced the rules by
   adjusting the weights in order to find the most relevant result for the
   search query. This proposed system, called MFIS-ANFIS, is implemented as
   an experimental system. The system performance is evaluated using
   quantitative and comparative analysis. MFIS-ANFIS aimed to be the core
   of intelligent and reliable search process.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of volume status in critically ill patients poses a challenge
   to clinicians. Measuring changes in the inferior vena cava (IVC)
   diameter using ultrasound is becoming a standard tool to assess volume
   status. Ultrasound requires physicians with significant training and
   specialized expensive equipment. It would be of significant value to be
   able to obtain this measurement continuously without physician presence.
   We hypothesize that dynamic changes in limb's bioimpedance in response
   to respiration could be used to predict changes in IVC. Forty-six
   subjects were tested a hemodialysis session. Impedance was measured via
   electrodes placed on the arm. Simultaneously, the IVC diameter was
   assessed by ultrasound. Subjects were asked to breathe spontaneously and
   perform respiratory maneuvers using a respiratory training device.
   Impedance (dz) was determined and compared with change in IVC diameter
   (dIVC; r = 0.76, p < 0.0001). There was significant relationship between
   dz and dIVC (p < 0.0001). Receiver-operator curves for dz at thresholds
   of dIVC (20\% to70\%) demonstrated high predictive power with areas
   under the curves (0.87-0.99, p < 0.0001). This evaluation suggests that
   real-time dynamic changes in limb impedance are capable of tracking a
   wide range of dynamic dIVC. This technique might be a suitable surrogate
   for monitoring real-time changes in dIVC to assess intravascular volume
   status.}},

Abstract = {{Immunomodulatory drugs-agents regulating the immune response-are
   commonly used for treating immune system disorders and minimizing graft
   versus host disease in persons receiving organ transplants. At the
   cellular level, immunosuppressant drugs are used to inhibit
   pro-inflammatory or tissue-damaging responses of cells. However, few
   studies have so far precisely characterized the cellular-level effect of
   immunomodulatory treatment. The primary challenge arises due to the
   rapid and transient nature of T-cell immune responses to such treatment.
   T-cell responses involve a highly interactive network of different types
   of cytokines, which makes precise monitoring of drug-modulated T-cell
   response difficult. Here, we present a nanoplasmonic biosensing approach
   to quantitatively characterize cytokine secretion behaviors of T cells
   with a fine time-resolution (every 10 min) that are altered by an
   immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of T-cell-mediated
   diseases. With a microfluidic platform integrating antibody-conjugated
   gold nanorod (AuNR) arrays, the technique enables simultaneous
   multi-time-point measurements of pro-inflammatory (IL-2, IFN-gamma, and
   TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines secreted by T cells.
   The integrated nanoplasmonic biosensors achieve precise measurements
   with low operating sample volume (1 mu L), short assay (similar to 30
   min), heightened sensitivity (similar to 20-30 pg/mL), and negligible
   sensor crosstalk. Data obtained from the multicytokine secretion
   profiles with high practicality resulting from all of these sensing
   capabilities provide a comprehensive picture of the time-varying
   cellular functional state during pharmacologic immunosuppression. The
   capability to monitor cellular functional response demonstrated in this
   study has great potential to ultimately permit personalized
   immunomodulatory treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The baseline active and passive (AP) algorithm of the NASA Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) mission disaggregates the brightness temperature
   (T-B) from a spatial resolution of 36 km to 9 km for the soil moisture
   (SM) using the radar backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) at 3 km. This
   algorithm was derived based upon an assumption of a linear relationship
   between T-B and sigma(0). In this study, we investigated the robustness
   of this assumption with plot-scale AP measurements obtained under
   different conditions of surface roughness and stages of growing sweet
   corn. The uncertainties in the estimated T-B at 9 km and, hence, the
   retrieved SM, due to uncertainties in the algorithm parameters, beta and
   Gamma, were assessed under different landcover heterogeneities. Overall,
   the linear regression was robust, with r(2) > 0.75 under bare soil
   conditions when surface scattering is dominant and > 0.52 during the
   growing season. The uncertainties in beta and Gamma due to AP
   observations result in uncertainties in retrieved SM < 0.04 m(3)/m(3)
   for most conditions of heterogeneity. The differences in T-B at 9 km,
   obtained when using beta derived from vegetation water content (VWC) and
   using those from radar vegetation index, were also assessed. The errors
   in retrieved SM could reach as high as 0.5 m(3)/m(3) for the worst-case
   scenario, when an intermediate scale contains high VWC, but the coarse
   scale region has low averaged VWC. These results suggest that
   determination of growth stages using a biophysical parameter is
   essential for beta estimations, particularly for highly heterogeneous
   landcovers.}},

Abstract = {{An important goal of haptic display is to make available the
   action/reaction relationships that define interactions between the body
   and the physical world. While in physical world interactions reaction
   cues invariably impinge on the same part of the body involved in action
   (reaction and action are colocated), a haptic interface is quite capable
   of rendering feedback to a separate body part than that used for
   producing exploratory actions (non-colocated action and reaction). This
   most commonly occurs with the use of vibrotactile display, in which a
   cutaneous cue has been substituted for a kinesthetic cue (a kind of
   sensory substitution). In this paper, we investigate whether
   non-colocated force and displacement cues degrade the perception of
   compliance. Using a custom non-colocated kinesthetic display in which
   one hand controls displacement and the other senses force, we ask
   participants to discriminate between two virtual springs with matched
   terminal force and adjustable non-linearity. An additional condition
   includes one hand controlling displacement while the other senses force
   encoded in a vibrotactile cue. Results show that when the terminal force
   cue is unavailable, and even when sensory substitution is not involved,
   non-colocated kinesthetic displays degrade compliance discrimination
   relative to colocated kinesthetic displays. Compliance discrimination is
   also degraded with vibrotactile display of force. These findings suggest
   that non-colocated kinesthetic displays and, likewise, cutaneous sensory
   substitution displays should be avoided when discrimination of
   compliance is necessary for task success.}},

   Computational Modeling Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In a sensitive cochlea, the basilar membrane response to transient
   excitation of any kind-normal acoustic or artificial intracochlear
   excitation-consists of not only a primary impulse but also a coda of
   delayed secondary responses with varying amplitudes but similar spectral
   content around the characteristic frequency of the measurement location.
   The coda, sometimes referred to as echoes or ringing, has been described
   as a form of local, short term memory which may influence the ability of
   the auditory system to detect gaps in an acoustic stimulus such as
   speech. Depending on the individual cochlea, the temporal gap between
   the primary impulse and the following coda ranges from once to thrice
   the group delay of the primary impulse (the group delay of the primary
   impulse is on the order of a few hundred microseconds). The coda is
   physiologically vulnerable, disappearing when the cochlea is compromised
   even slightly. The multicomponent sensitive response is not yet
   completely understood. We use a physiologically-based, mathematical
   model to investigate (i) the generation of the primary impulse response
   and the dependence of the group delay on the various stimulation
   methods, (ii) the effect of spatial perturbations in the properties of
   mechanically sensitive ion channels on the generation and separation of
   delayed secondary responses. The model suggests that the presence of the
   secondary responses depends on the wavenumber content of a perturbation
   and the activity level of the cochlea. In addition, the model shows that
   the varying temporal gaps between adjacent coda seen in experiments
   depend on the individual profiles of perturbations. Implications for
   non-invasive cochlear diagnosis are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The small wavelength at millimeter wave (mmWave) allows to pack antenna
   arrays in a very small area enabling practical large-scale MIMO.
   However, wideband and high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)
   are very expensive and power-hungry. In this paper, we propose a mmWave
   MIMO communication system that employs simple one-bit ADCs at the
   receiver and MIMO precoding at the transmitter. One significant
   challenge associated with this system is efficient channel estimation
   based on one-bit quantized channel output. We propose a novel
   continuous-time channel estimator based on level-triggered sampling, a
   nonuniform sampling scheme that offers estimation performance similar to
   that of the estimator based on full-precision channel output. We also
   develop the transmitter precoding scheme that reduces the transmit
   peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and, at the same time, equalizes the
   antenna cross-talks so that receiver demodulation can be implemented
   simply by symbol-rate slicing. Extensive simulation results are provided
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation and
   precoding techniques for mmWave systems.}},

Abstract = {{Active Gurney flaps, or microflaps, are studied to determine their
   effectiveness in reducing noise and vibration in rotorcraft as well as
   improving rotor performance. The effectiveness of the microflap is
   examined using a comprehensive rotorcraft simulation code. The
   aerodynamic properties of the microflap are modeled using a nonlinear
   computational-fluid-dynamics-based reduced-order aerodynamic model that
   takes into account unsteadiness, compressibility, and time-varying
   freestream effects. Active control studies are conducted on a hingeless
   rotor configuration resembling the Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm BO-105,
   using various spanwise microflap configurations, including single, dual,
   and segmented five-microflap configurations. Results indicate that the
   microflap is capable of substantial reductions in blade-vortex
   interaction noise ranging from 3 to 6 dB. Vibration reduction ranging
   from 70 to 90\% is also demonstrated. The effect of vibration reduction
   on noise and vice versa is also examined, and it was found that
   reduction in one objective is accompanied by an increase in the other, a
   trend also observed when using other active control approaches. Finally,
   the microflap is considered for combined vibration reduction and
   performance enhancement at a high-speed cruise flight condition. The
   results clearly indicate that the microflaps are very effective for both
   noise and vibration reduction in helicopters, and they also have
   potential for rotor performance enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The impact of coordination and problem solving on health
   care quality has become increasingly prevalent within the literature.
   However, few studies have empirically investigated the impact of these
   factors across organizational boundaries.
   Methods: This was an embedded, single-case study conducted within a
   large, academic Anatomic Pathology department. We surveyed 96 team
   members within 18 distinct processing or specialty units within the
   department and forward the Network Alignment Approach to measure
   coordination between units. In addition, we measure perceived safety
   culture and frequency of error in specimen documentation and
   preparation.
   Results: Regression results suggest that downstream cross-unit
   coordination between units (clarity of customer requirements)
   significantly improves safety culture (P < .001). In addition,
   within-unit process improvement efforts improved safety culture (P <
   .001). These 2 factors alone accounted for 30\% of the variation in the
   regression model, with safety culture as our dependent variable.
   Conclusion: Clarity of customer requirements and process improvement
   efforts significantly improve safety culture within the system. This
   approach to understanding and analyzing connections within complex
   systems provides insight into specific ways that leaders can begin to
   understand how each unit or department can improve as both a customer
   and a supplier within the larger system.}},

Abstract = {{We use data on an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) seen by
   MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging
   (MESSENGER) and STEREO A starting on 29 December 2011 in a near-perfect
   longitudinal conjunction (within 3 degrees) to illustrate changes in its
   structure via interaction with the solar wind in less than 0.6AU. From
   force-free field modeling we infer that the orientation of the
   underlying flux rope has undergone a rotation of approximate to 80
   degrees in latitude and approximate to 65 degrees in longitude. Based on
   both spacecraft measurements as well as ENLIL model simulations of the
   steady state solar wind, we find that interaction involving magnetic
   reconnection with corotating structures in the solar wind dramatically
   alters the ICME magnetic field. In particular, we observed a highly
   turbulent region with distinct properties within the flux rope at STEREO
   A, not observed at MESSENGER, which we attribute to interaction between
   the ICME and a heliospheric plasma sheet/current sheet during
   propagation. Our case study is a concrete example of a sequence of
   events that can increase the complexity of ICMEs with heliocentric
   distance even in the inner heliosphere. The results highlight the need
   for large-scale statistical studies of ICME events observed in
   conjunction at different heliocentric distances to determine how
   frequently significant changes in flux rope orientation occur during
   propagation. These results also have significant implications for space
   weather forecasting and should serve as a caution on using very distant
   observations to predict the geoeffectiveness of large interplanetary
   transients.}},

Abstract = {{The trailing-edge rarefactions of 54 high-speed streams at 1AU are
   analyzed. The temporal durations of the trailing-edge rarefactions agree
   with ballistic calculations based on the observed speeds of the fast and
   slow wind bounding the rarefactions. A methodology is developed to
   measure solar-wind compression and rarefaction using the orientations of
   solar-wind current sheets. One focus is to determine the signature that
   best describes the location of the trailing-edge stream interface
   between coronal-hole-origin plasma and streamer-belt-origin plasma;
   based on the current-sheet orientations, on the magnetic-field strength,
   on the intensity of the electron strahl, and on the intensity of the
   negative vorticity, an inflection point in the temporal profile of the
   solar-wind velocity is taken as the best indicator of the trailing-edge
   stream interface. Computer simulations support this choice. Using
   superposed-epoch analysis, the plasma properties and turbulence
   properties of trailing-edge rarefactions are surveyed. Whereas the
   signatures of the coronal-hole/streamer-belt (slow-wind/fast-wind)
   boundary in the leading edge (corotating interaction region) stream
   interface are simultaneous, they are not simultaneous in the trailing
   edge, with ion-charge-state signatures occurring on average 13.7h prior
   to the proton entropy signature. It is suggested that differences in the
   leading and trailing edges of coronal holes on the Sun might account for
   the differences in the leading and trailing edges of high-speed streams
   at 1AU: the formation timescales, heating timescales, and
   charge-state-equilibration timescales of closed flux loops in the corona
   might be involved.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of solar wind conditions at Mars is often necessary to study
   the planet's magnetospheric and ionospheric dynamics. With no continuous
   upstream solar wind monitor at Mars, studies have used a variety of
   methods to measure or predict Martian solar wind conditions. In situ
   measurements, when available, are preferred, but can often be limited in
   continuity or scope, and so studies have also utilized solar wind
   proxies, spacecraft flybys, and Earth-Mars alignment to provide solar
   wind context. Despite the importance of solar wind knowledge and the
   range of methods used to provide it, the use of solar wind models
   remains relatively unutilized. This study uses the Wang-Sheeley-Arge
   (WSA)-ENLIL+Cone solar wind model to calculate solar wind parameters at
   Mars' orbital location to provide a new approach to determining solar
   wind conditions at Mars. Comparisons of the model results with
   observations by the MAVEN spacecraft indicate that the WSA-ENLIL+Cone
   model can forecast solar wind conditions at Mars as accurately as it has
   predicted them historically at the Earth, although at Mars the model
   systematically mispredicts solar wind speed and density, likely a result
   of magnetogram calibration. Particular focus is placed on modeling the
   early March 2015 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) that
   interacted with Mars. Despite the complexity of the ICMEs, the model
   accurately predicted the speed and arrival time of the ICME-driven
   interplanetary shock, although it underpredicted other solar wind
   parameters. These results suggest that solar wind models can be used to
   provide the necessary general context of the heliospheric conditions to
   planetary studies.}},

Abstract = {{Recent observations from the Van Allen Probes Helium Oxygen Proton
   Electron (HOPE) instrument revealed a persistent depletion in the 1-10eV
   ion population in the postmidnight sector during quiet times in the 2 <

   developing an algorithm to classify 26 months of pitch angle
   distributions measured by the HOPE instrument. We correct the HOPE low
   energy fluxes for spacecraft potential using measurements from the
   Electric Field and Waves (EFW) instrument. A high percentage of low
   count pitch angle distributions is found in the postmidnight sector
   coupled with a low percentage of ion distributions peaked perpendicular
   to the field line. A peak in loss cone distributions in the dusk sector
   is also observed. These results characterize the nature of the dearth of
   the near 90 degrees pitch angle 1-10eV ion population in the near-Earth
   postmidnight sector. This study also shows, for the first time,
   low-energy HOPE differential number fluxes corrected for spacecraft

Abstract = {{This study analyzes results from a multifluid MHD simulation to
   investigate the shape and structure of the pressure and composition
   boundaries at Mars, which can provide physical insight for the
   observational analysis. These boundaries are examined via the unity
   contours and gradients of the plasma , as well as , which includes the
   dynamic pressure in the numerator, and the ion mass and number density
   ratios. It is found that unity contours are well aligned with the
   gradient extrema, indicating that the unity contour is a topological
   boundary. In addition, these two transitions of pressure and composition
   are of a thickness of 0.05-0.1R(M) near the subsolar region to 1-1.5R(M)
   in the tail. The comparison of the pressure and composition boundaries
   indicates that the two are very similar and that not only the plasma
   sheet but also the full volume of the lobes are dominated by planetary
   ions. It suggests that the tail escape for ions not only concentrates in
   the central plasma sheet but also the magnetic lobes. It is also worthy
   pointing out that the ion number density ratio unity contour is found to
   be systematically smaller than other unity boundaries, which calls for
   attention when the ion number density is used to identify such
   boundaries. Finally, the comparison between the boundaries of this study
   and two analytical fittings is carried out. We found a good agreement
   with the Vignes fitting, with little flaring in the tail, in contrast to
   a larger flaring angle from the Trotignon fitting.}},

Abstract = {{Every magnetic field of solar and planetary space environments is
   associated with a current of differentially flowing charged particles.
   Electric potential patterns in geospace and near other planets are also
   closely linked with currents. Close to the Earth, particularly in the
   near-Earth nightside magnetosphere, several current systems wax and wane
   during periods of space weather activity. The velocity-dependent drift,
   energization, and loss processes in this region complicate current
   system evolution. There is a discrepancy about the magnitude, timing,
   and location of these currents, however, and this Commentary pitches the
   case for a concerted community effort to resolve this issue.}},

Title = {{A First Model of the Dynamics of the Bacteriophage T4 Injection
   Machinery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bacteriophage T4 is one of the most common and complex of the tailed
   viruses that infect host bacteria using an intriguing contractile tail
   assembly. Despite extensive progress in resolving the structure of T4,
   the dynamics of the injection machinery remains largely unknown. This
   paper contributes a first model of the injection machinery that is
   driven by elastic energy stored in a structure known as the sheath. The
   sheath is composed of helical strands of protein that suddenly collapse
   from an energetic, extended conformation prior to infection to a
   relaxed, contracted conformation during infection. We employ Kirchhoff
   rod theory to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of a single protein strand
   coupled to a model for the remainder of the virus, including the coupled
   translation and rotation of the head (capsid), neck, and tail tube.
   Doing so provides an important building block toward the future goal of
   modeling the entire sheath structure which is composed of six
   interacting helical protein strands. The resulting numerical model
   exposes fundamental features of the injection machinery including the
   time scale and energetics of the infection process, the nonlinear
   conformational change experienced by the sheath, and the contribution of
   hydrodynamic drag on the head (capsid).}},

Title = {{Adaptive Microslip Projection for Reduction of Frictional and Contact
   Nonlinearities in Shrouded Blisks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Reduced order models (ROMs) of turbine bladed disks (blisks) are
   essential to quickly yet accurately characterize vibration
   characteristics and effectively design for high cycle fatigue. Modeling
   blisks with contacting shrouds at adjacent blades is especially
   challenging due to friction damping and localized nonlinearities at the
   contact interfaces which can lead to complex stick-slip behavior. While
   well-known techniques such as the harmonic balance method (HBM) and
   Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis (CB-CMS) have generally been
   employed to generate ROMs in the past, they do not reduce
   degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) at the interfaces themselves. In this paper,
   we propose a novel method to obtain a set of reduction basis functions
   for the contact interface DoFs as well as the remaining DoFs called
   ``adaptive microslip projection{''} (AMP). The method is based on
   analyzing a set of linear systems with specifically chosen boundary
   conditions on the contact interface. Simulated responses of full order
   baseline models and the novel ROMs under various conditions are studied.
   Results obtained from the ROMs compare very favorably with the baseline
   model. This study addresses the case of a shrouded blisk in microslip
   close to stick. The AMP procedure may be possibly applied to other
   systems with Coulomb friction contacts, but its accuracy and
   effectiveness will need to be evaluated separately.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the crystal structure of epitaxial ZnSnN2 films synthesized
   via plasma-assisted vapor deposition on (111) yttria stabilized zirconia
   (YSZ) and (001) lithium gallate (LiGaO2) substrates. X-ray diffraction
   measurements performed on ZnSnN2 films deposited on LiGaO2 substrates

   the Pn2(1)a symmetry {[}space group (33)], with lattice parameters in
   good agreement with theoretically predicted values. This Pn2(1)a
   symmetry is imposed on the ZnSnN2 films by the LiGaO2 substrate, which
   also has orthorhombic symmetry. A structural change from the wurtzite
   phase to the orthorhombic phase in films grown at high substrate
   temperatures similar to 550 degrees C and low values of nitrogen flux
   similar to 10(-5) Torr is observed in ZnSnN2 films deposited on YSZ
   characterized by lattice contraction in the basal plane and a 5.7\%
   expansion of the out-of-plane lattice parameter. (C) 2016 Author(s). All

   We find that the thermal conductivity is lower than the alloy value

   to that of alloy films, and the Seebeck coefficient is comparable to
   other SLs. Calculations based on Rytov's elastic model show that the

Abstract = {{Clouds scatter direct solar radiation, generating diffuse radiation and
   altering the ratio of direct to diffuse light. If diffuse light
   increases plant canopy CO2 uptake, clouds may indirectly influence
   climate by altering the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, past research
   primarily uses proxies or qualitative categories of clouds to connect
   the effect of diffuse light on CO2 uptake to sky conditions. We
   mechanistically link and quantify effects of cloud optical thickness
   ((c)) to surface light and plant canopy CO2 uptake by comparing
   satellite retrievals of (c) to ground-based measurements of diffuse and
   total photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700nm) and gross
   primary production (GPP) in forests and croplands. Overall, total PAR
   decreased with (c), while diffuse PAR increased until an average (c) of
   6.8 and decreased with larger (c). When diffuse PAR increased with (c),
   7-24\% of variation in diffuse PAR was explained by (c). Light-use
   efficiency (LUE) in this range increased 0.001-0.002 per unit increase
   in (c). Although (c) explained 10-20\% of the variation in LUE, there
   was no significant relationship between (c) and GPP (p>0.05) when
   diffuse PAR increased. We conclude that diffuse PAR increases under a
   narrow range of optically thin clouds and the dominant effect of clouds
   is to reduce total plant-available PAR. This decrease in total PAR
   offsets the increase in LUE under increasing diffuse PAR, providing
   evidence that changes within this range of low cloud optical thickness
   are unlikely to alter the magnitude of terrestrial CO2 fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{Rapamycin extends mouse life span, but the extent to which rapamycin
   prevents aging-associated changes in specific tissues remains unclear.
   Stiffness increases and collagen turnover decreases in mouse tendon with
   aging; thus, our aim was to determine the effect of long-term rapamycin
   treatment on the mechanical and structural properties of tendons from
   old mice. Tendons were harvested from female UM-HET3 mice maintained on
   a standard chow diet for 4 (adult) or 22 (old) months or fed chow
   containing polymer-encapsulated rapamycin (eRAPA) from 9 to 22 months of
   age (old RAPA). Stiffness was twofold higher for tendons of old compared
   with adult mice, but in old RAPA mice, tendon stiffness was maintained
   at a value not different from that of adults. Additionally, expression
   of collagen decreased, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8
   increased, and total hydroxyproline content trended toward decreased
   levels in tendons of old eRAPA-fed mice compared with controls. Finally,
   age-associated calcification of Achilles tendons and accompanying
   elevations in expression of chondrocyte and osteoblast markers were all
   lower in old eRAPA-fed mice. These results suggest that long-term
   administration of rapamycin alters the molecular pathways responsible
   for aging of tendon extracellular matrix, resulting in tissue that is
   structurally and mechanically similar to tendons in adult mice.}},

Abstract = {{A new empirical model of the electron fluxes and ion fluxes at
   geosynchronous orbit (GEO) is introduced, based on observations by Los
   Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites. The model provides flux
   predictions in the energy range similar to 1eV to similar to 40keV, as a
   function of local time, energy, and the strength of the solar wind
   electric field (the negative product of the solar wind speed and the z
   component of the magnetic field). Given appropriate upstream solar wind
   measurements, the model provides a forecast of the fluxes at GEO with a
   similar to 1h lead time. Model predictions are tested against in-sample
   observations from LANL satellites and also against out-of-sample
   observations from the Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor II detector
   on the AMC-12 satellite. The model does not reproduce all structure seen
   in the observations. However, for the intervals studied here (quiet and
   storm times) the normalized root-mean-square deviation < similar to 0.3.
   It is intended that the model will improve forecasting of the spacecraft
   environment at GEO and also provide improved boundary/input conditions
   for physical models of the magnetosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple types of heterogeneity including label heterogeneity and
   feature heterogeneity often co-exist in many real-world data mining
   applications, such as diabetes treatment classification, gene
   functionality prediction, and brain image analysis. To effectively
   leverage such heterogeneity, in this article, we propose a novel
   graph-based model for Learning with both Label and Feature
   heterogeneity, namely (LF)-F-2. It models the label correlation by
   requiring that any two label-specific classifiers behave similarly on
   the same views if the associated labels are similar, and imposes the
   view consistency by requiring that view-based classifiers generate
   similar predictions on the same examples. The objective function for
   (LF)-F-2 is jointly convex. To solve the optimization problem, we
   propose an iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the
   global optimum. One appealing feature of (LF)-F-2 is that it is capable
   of handling data with missing views and labels. Furthermore, we analyze
   its generalization performance based on Rademacher complexity, which
   sheds light on the benefits of jointly modeling the label and feature
   heterogeneity. Experimental results on various biomedical datasets show
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Numerical and experimental investigation of natural flow-induced
   vibrations of flexible hydrofoils}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to present combined numerical and
   experimental studies of natural flow-induced vibrations of flexible
   hydrofoils. The focus is on identifying the dependence of the foil's
   vibration frequencies and damping characteristics on the inflow
   velocity, angle of attack, and solid-to-fluid added mass ratio.
   Experimental results are shown for a cantilevered polyacetate (POM)
   hydrofoil tested in the cavitation tunnel at the French Naval Academy
   Research Institute (IRENav). The foil is observed to primarily behave as
   a chordwise rigid body and undergoes spanwise bending and twisting
   deformations, and the flow is observed to be effectively two-dimensional
   (2D) because of the strong lift retention at the free tip caused by a
   small gap with a thickness less than the wall boundary layer. Hence, the
   viscous fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is formulated by
   coupling a 2D unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) model
   with a two degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) model representing the spanwise tip
   bending and twisting deformations. Good agreements were observed between
   viscous FSI predictions and experimental measurements of natural
   flow-induced vibrations in fully turbulent and attached flow conditions.
   The foil vibrations were found to be dominated by the natural
   frequencies in absence of large scale vortex shedding due to flow
   separation. The natural frequencies and fluid damping coefficients were
   found to vary with velocity, angle of attack, and solid-to-fluid added
   mass ratio. In addition, the numerical results showed that the in-water
   to in-air natural frequency ratios decreased rapidly, and the fluid
   damping coefficients increased rapidly, as the solid-to-fluid added mass
   ratio decreases. Uncoupled mode (UM) linear potential theory was found
   to significantly over-predict the fluid damping for cases of lightweight
   flexible hydrofoils, and this over-prediction increased with higher
   velocity and lower solid-to-fluid added mass ratio. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

Pages = {{969-985}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Digital image correlation (DIC) is a surface deformation measurement
   technique for which accuracy and precision are sensitive to image
   quality. This work presents cross polarization, the use of orthogonal
   linear polarizers on light source(s) and camera(s), as an effective
   method for improving optical DIC measurements. The benefits of cross
   polarization are characterized through quantitative and statistical
   comparisons from two experiments: rigid body translation of a flat
   sample and uniaxial tension of a superelastic shape-memory alloy (SMA).
   In both experiments, cross polarization eliminated saturated pixels that
   degrade DIC measurements, and increased image contrast, which enabled
   higher spatial precision by using smaller subsets. Subset sizes are
   usually optimized for correlation confidence interval (typically with
   subsets of 21 x 21 px or larger), but can be decreased to achieve the
   highest possible spatial precision at the expense of increased
   correlation confidence intervals. Smaller subset sizes (such as 9 x 9
   px) require better images to maintain correlation within error
   thresholds. By comparing DIC results from a uniaxial SMA tension test
   with unpolarized and cross-polarized images, we show that for 9 x 9 px
   subsets, the loss of valid DIC data points was reduced almost ten-fold
   with cross polarization. The only disadvantage we see to cross
   polarization is the decrease in specimen illumination due to
   transmission losses through the polarizers, which can easily be
   accommodated with sufficiently intense light sources. With the
   installation of relatively inexpensive linear polarizing filters, an
   optimum optical DIC setup can provide even better DIC measurements by
   delivering images without saturated pixels and with higher contrast for
   increased DIC spatial precision.}},

Abstract = {{Various types of collagens, e.g., type I and III, represent the main
   load-bearing components in biological tissues. Their composition changes
   during processes such as wound healing and fibrosis. When excited by
   ultraviolet light, collagens exhibit autofluorescence distinguishable by
   their unique fluorescent lifetimes across a range of emission
   wavelengths. Here, we designed a miniaturized spectral-lifetime
   detection system as a noninvasive probe for monitoring tissue collagen
   compositions. A sine-modulated LED illumination was applied to enable
   frequency domain fluorescence lifetime measurements under three
   wavelength bands, separated via a series of longpass dichroics at 387,
   409, and 435 nm. We employed a lithography-based three-dimensional (3-D)
   printer with <50 mu m resolution to create a custom designed
   optomechanics in a handheld form factor. We examined the characteristics
   of the optomechanics with finite element modeling to simulate the effect
   of thermal (from LED) and mechanical (from handling) strain on the
   optical system. The geometry was further optimized with ray tracing to
   form the final 3-D printed structure. Using this device, the phase shift
   and demodulation of collagen types were measured, where the separate
   spectral bands enhanced the differentiation of their lifetimes. This
   system represents a low cost, handheld probe for clinical tissue
   monitoring applications. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{A novel approach to analyze kink banding failure in fiber reinforced
   composites is presented in this paper. By considering a single
   fiber-matrix unit cell and utilizing a fiber deformation representation
   that can simultaneously account for instability due to increasing fiber
   amplitude and fiber rotation, a sequence of events that lead to the
   formation of a kink band is elucidated. It is shown that peak
   compressive strength does not necessarily correspond to the onset of
   yielding (non-linearity) in the matrix and is dictated by the
   interaction between matrix non-linearity and initial fiber misalignment.
   Predictions of compressive strength and kink band formation, utilizing
   the new model, are found to be in good agreement with reported
   experimental data and associated higher-order finite element analysis.}},

   for piezoelectric compliant mechanisms}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Piezo-actuated, flexure hinge-based compliant mechanisms have been
   frequently used in precision engineering in the last few decades. There
   have been a considerable number of publications on modeling the
   displacement amplification behavior of rhombus-type and bridge-type
   compliant mechanisms. However, due to an unclear geometric approximation
   and mechanical assumption between these two flexures, it is very
   difficult to obtain an exact description of the kinematic performance
   using previous analytical models, especially when the designed angle of
   the compliant mechanisms is small. Therefore, enhanced theoretical
   models of the displacement amplification ratio for rhombus-type and
   bridge-type compliant mechanisms are proposed to improve the prediction
   accuracy based on the distinct force analysis between these two
   flexures. The energy conservation law and the elastic beam theory are
   employed for modeling with consideration of the translational and
   rotational stiffness. Theoretical and finite elemental results show that
   the prediction errors of the displacement amplification ratio will be
   enlarged if the bridge-type flexure is simplified as a rhombic structure
   to perform mechanical modeling. More importantly, the proposed models
   exhibit better performance than the previous models, which is further
   verified by experiments.}},

   Self-Attractive Semiflexible Polymers}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We develop an analytical model to predict the collapse conformation for
   a single semiflexible polymer chain in solution, given its length,
   diameter, stiffness, and self -attractiveness. We construct
   conformational phase diagrams containing three collapsed states, namely
   torus, bundle, and globule over a range of dimensionless ratios of the
   three energy parameters, namely solvent-water surface energy
   (-gamma(s)), energy of bundle end folds (ye), and bending energy per
   unit length in a torus (gamma(b)). Our phase diagram captures the
   general phase behavior of a single long chain (>10 Kuhn lengths) at
   moderately high (order unity) dimensionless temperature, which is the
   ratio of thermal energy to the attractive interaction between
   neighboring monomers. We find that the phase behavior approaches an
   asymptotic limit when the dimensionless chain length to diameter ratio
   (L{*}) exceeds 300. We successfully validate our analytical results with
   Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations, using a mapping of the simulation
   parameters to those used in the phase diagram. We evaluate the effect of
   three different bending potentials in the range of moderately high
   dimensionless temperature, a regime not been previously explored by
   simulations, and find qualitative agreement between the model and
   simulation results. We, thus, demonstrate that a rather simplified
   analytical model can be used to qualitatively predict the final
   collapsed state of a given polymer chain.}},

   Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b}},
Journal = {{FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{363}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b has two forms of
   methane monooxygenase (MMO) responsible for the initial conversion of
   methane to methanol, a cytoplasmic (soluble) methane monooxygenase and a
   membrane-associated (particulate) methane monooxygenase, and that copper
   strongly regulates expression of these alternative forms of MMO. More
   recently, it has been discovered that M. trichosporium OB3b has multiple
   types of the methanol dehydrogenase (MeDH), i.e. the Mxa-type MeDH
   (Mxa-MeDH) and Xox-type MeDH (Xox-MeDH), and the expression of these two
   forms is regulated by the availability of the rare earth element (REE),
   cerium. Here, we extend these studies and show that lanthanum,
   praseodymium, neodymium and samarium also regulate expression of
   alternative forms of MeDH. The effect of these REEs on MeDH expression,
   however, was only observed in the absence of copper. Further, a mutant
   of M. trichosporium OB3b, where the Mxa-MeDH was knocked out, was able
   to grow in the presence of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium, but
   was not able to grow in the presence of samarium. Collectively, these
   data suggest that multiple levels of gene regulation by metals exist in
   M. trichosporium OB3b, but that copper overrides the effect of other
   metals by an as yet unknown mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Transition rates in O-2-Ocollisions for each vibrational and
   rovibrational state are generated by means of the quasi-classical
   trajectory method using potential energy surfaces of different
   fidelities. The first potential energy surface, obtained via the double
   many-body expansion method, is adopted to obtain vibrational transition
   rates assuming transrotational equilibrium. The trajectory simulation on
   a simpler potential surface, based on the two-body pairwise interaction,
   generates a complete set of rates for each internal state. Vibrational
   and rotational relaxations of oxygen in a heat bath of parent atoms are
   modeled by a system of master equations at translational temperatures
   between 1000 and 20,000 K. It is shown that the vibrational relaxation
   becomes less efficient at high temperatures, in contrast with the
   conventional equation for relaxation time proposed by Millikan and White
   ({''}Systematics of Vibrational Relaxation,{''} Journal of Chemical
   Physics, Vol. 39, No. 12, 1963, Paper 3209). Rotational and vibrational
   relaxation times are the same order of magnitude in the range of
   temperatures observed in hypersonic flows. The excitation of the
   vibrational mode in O-2-O collisions under typical postshock conditions
   occurs earlier than in other molecular systems. The exchange channel
   plays an important role in the internal energy randomization.}},

Title = {{Characterizing shallow secondary clarifier performance where

Abstract = {{The performance characteristics of relatively shallow (3.3 and 3.7 m
   sidewater depth in 30.5 m diameter) activated sludge secondary
   clarifiers were extensively evaluated during a 2-year testing program at
   the City of Akron Water Reclamation Facility (WRF), Ohio, USA. Testing
   included hydraulic and solids loading stress tests, and measurement of
   sludge characteristics (zone settling velocity (ZSV), dispersed and
   flocculated total suspended solids), and the results were used to
   calibrate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models of the various
   clarifiers tested. The results demonstrated that good performance could
   be sustained at surface overflow rates in excess of 3 m/h, as long as
   the clarifier influent mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)
   concentration was controlled to below critical values. The limiting
   solids loading rate (SLR) was significantly lower than the value
   predicted by conventional solids flux analysis based on the measured
   ZSV/MLSS relationship. CFD analysis suggested that this resulted because
   mixed liquor entering the clarifier was being directed into the settled
   sludge blanket, diluting it and also creating a `thin' concentration
   sludge blanket that overlays the thicker concentration sludge blanket
   typically expected. These results indicate the need to determine the
   allowable SLR for shallow clarifiers using approaches other than
   traditional solids flux analysis. A combination of actual testing and
   CFD analyses are demonstrated here to be effective in doing so.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Stabilized peptides address several limitations to peptide-based imaging
   agents and therapeutics such as poor stability and low affinity due to
   conformational flexibility. There is also active research in developing
   these compounds for intracellular drug targeting, and significant
   efforts have been invested to determine the effects of helix
   stabilization on intracellular delivery. However, much less is known
   about the impact on other pharmacokinetic parameters such as plasma
   clearance and bioavailability. We investigated the effect of different
   fluorescent helix-stabilizing linkers with varying lipophilicity on
   subcutaneous (sc) bioavailability using the glucagon-like peptide-1
   (GLP-1) receptor ligand exendin as a model system. The stabilized
   peptides showed significantly higher protease resistance and increased
   bioavailability independent of linker hydrophilicity, and all
   subcutaneously delivered conjugates were able to successfully target the
   islets of Langerhans with high specificity. The lipophilic peptide
   variants had slower absorption and plasma clearance than their
   respective hydrophilic conjugates, and the absolute bioavailability was
   also lower likely due to the longer residence times in the skin. Their
   ease and efficiency make double-click helix stabilization chemistries a
   useful tool for increasing the bioavailability of peptide therapeutics,
   many of which suffer from rapid in vivo protease degradation. Helix
   stabilization using linkers of varying lipophilicity can further control
   sc absorption and clearance rates to customize plasma pharmacokinetics.}},

Abstract = {{A design strategy based on geometric analysis of linker shape and
   flexibility is developed in the context of achieving predictable
   topology of tetratopic-linker based Zr microporous coordination polymers
   (MCPs). Tetratopic linkers are categorized into tetrahedral, planar
   square, or planar rectangular groups based on symmetry with an emphasis
   on linker flexibility. A prediction framework solely based on linker
   shape and cluster connectivity derived from this strategy is applied to
   all 18 reported tetratopic-linker based Zr MCPs, and their determined
   topologies fit well into the scheme. Two new Zr MCPs (UMCM-312 and
   UMCM-313) are produced using designed linkers based on the strategy to
   test the robustness of prediction. UMCM-312 contains a biphenyl-core
   based tetratopic linker to target tetrahedral shape, and UMCM-313 takes
   advantage of a perylene based tetratopic linker to achieve rectangular
   shape. The experimentally determined topologies confirm predictions. It
   is thus demonstrated that the uncertainty of targeting topologies in
   tetratopic-linker based Zr MCPs can be reduced by accounting for linker
   shape and flexibility.}},

   observed, and chemical front propagation velocities were calculated. The
   propagation of acidification fronts as well as the transport of reactive
   oxygen species was documented using chemical probes. In addition,
   plasma-induced convection was observed illustrating the complex coupling
   of plasma-driven effects to the bulk solution. Time-dependent changes in

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{954-958}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents a framework for replay detection in sports videos
   to generate highlights. For replay detection, the proposed work exploits
   the following facts: 1) broadcasters introduce gradual transition (GT)
   effect both at the start and at the end of a replay segment (RS), and 2)
   the absence of score captions (SCs) in an RS. The dual-threshold-based
   method is used to detect GT frames from the input video. A pair of
   successive GT frames is used to extract the candidate RSs. All frames in
   the selected segment are processed to detect SC. To this end, temporal
   running average is used to filter out temporal variations. First-and
   second-order statistics are used to binarize the running average image,
   which is fed to optical character recognition stage for character
   recognition. The absence/presence of SC is used for replay/live frame
   labeling. The SCdetection stage complements the GT detection process,
   therefore, a combination of both is expected to result in superior
   computational complexity and detection accuracy. The performance of the
   proposed system is evaluated on 22 videos of four different sports
   (e.g., Cricket, tennis, baseball, and basketball). Experimental results
   indicate that the proposed method can achieve average detection accuracy
   >= 94.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) play a vital role in the
   medical care of newborns and infants. There is expected to be a shortage
   of NNPs in the near future.
   Purpose: To assess the present NNP workforce and study the impact of
   potential policy changes to alleviate forecasted shortages.
   Methods: We modeled the education and workforce system for NNPs.
   Forecasting models were combined with optimal decision-making to derive
   best-case scenario admission levels for graduate and undergraduate
   programs.
   Discussion: Under the best-case scenario for the current system, the
   shortage of NNPs is expected to last 10 years. We analyzed the impact of
   improving the certification examination passing rate, increasing the
   annual growth rate of master's programs, and reducing the workforce
   annual attrition rate. We found that policy changes may reduce the
   forecasted shortage to 4 years.
   Conclusion: Present forecasts of demand for NNPs indicate that the
   existing workforce and education system will be unable to satisfy the
   growing demand. Policy changes may reduce the expected shortage and
   potentially improve access to care for newborns and infants.}},

Abstract = {{This work pertains to the stability of structures under rapid loading
   rates when inertia is taken into account. In contrast to the widely used
   approach in the relevant literature, which is based on the method of
   modal analysis to determine the structure's fastest growing
   eigenmode-meaningful only for cases where the velocity of the perfect
   structure is significantly lower than the associated characteristic wave
   propagation speeds-the present study analyzes the time-dependent
   response to spatially localized perturbations of the transient
   (time-dependent) states of these structures, in order to understand the
   initiation of the corresponding failure mechanisms. We are motivated by
   the experimental studies of Zhang and Ravi-Chandar (Int J Fract
   142:183-217, 2006), Int J Fract 163:41-65, (2010) on the high
   strain-rate expansion of thin rings and tubes, which show no evidence of
   a dominant wavelength in their failure mode and no influence of
   strain-rate sensitivity on the necking strains. Recently, Ravi-Chandar
   and Triantafyllidis (Int J Solids Struct 58:301-308, 2014) studied the
   dynamic stability of an incompressible, nonlinearly elastic bar at
   different strain-rates by following the evolution of localized small
   perturbations introduced at different times. The same approach is
   followed here for the biaxial stretching of thin plates, where we follow
   the time evolution of spatially localized perturbations and their
   interactions. The nonlinear time evolution of a such a perturbation is
   studied numerically and it is shown that these structures are stable
   until the time when the condition for the loss of ellipticity is
   reached. An analytical method, based on linearization, is used to define
   the size of the influence zone of a point-wise perturbation and we study
   its dependence on constitutive laws and loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach for the design of
   continuous-time controllers to robustly and exponentially stabilize
   periodic orbits of hybrid dynamical systems arising from bipedal
   walking. A parameterized family of continuous-time controllers is
   assumed so that (1) a periodic orbit is induced for the hybrid system,
   and (2) the orbit is invariant under the choice of controller
   parameters. Properties of the Poincare map and its first- and
   second-order derivatives are used to translate the problem of
   exponential stabilization of the periodic orbit into a set of bilinear
   matrix inequalities (BMIs). A BMI optimization problem is then set up to
   tune the parameters of the continuous-time controller so that the
   Jacobian of the Poincare map has its eigenvalues in the unit circle. It
   is also shown how robustness against uncertainty in the switching
   condition of the hybrid system can be incorporated into the design
   problem. The power of this approach is illustrated by finding robust and
   stabilizing continuous-time feedback laws for walking gaits of two
   underactuated 3D bipedal robots.}},

Abstract = {{To simultaneously control inflammation and facilitate dentin
   regeneration, a copolymeric micelle-in-microsphere platform is developed
   in this study, aiming to simultaneously release a hydrophobic drug to
   suppress inflammation and a hydrophilic biomolecule to enhance
   odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells in a distinctly
   controlled fashion. A series of chitosan-graft-poly(lactic acid)
   copolymers is synthesized with varying lactic acid and chitosan weight
   ratios, self-assembled into nanoscale micelle-like core-shell structures
   in an aqueous system, and subsequently crosslinked into microspheres
   through electrostatic interaction with sodium tripolyphosphate. A
   hydrophobic biomolecule either coumarin-6 or fluocinolone acetonide (FA)
   is encapsulated into the hydrophobic cores of the micelles, while a
   hydrophilic biomolecule either bovine serum albumin or bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is entrapped in the hydrophilic shells
   and the interspaces among the micelles. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   biomolecules are delivered with distinct and tunable release patterns.
   Delivery of FA and BMP-2 simultaneously suppresses inflammation and
   enhances odontogenesis, resulting in significantly enhanced mineralized
   tissue regeneration. This result also demonstrates the potential for
   this novel delivery system to deliver multiple therapeutics and to
   achieve synergistic effects.}},

Abstract = {{The pathology of Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by obstructing
   intestinal strictures because of inflammation (with high levels of
   hemoglobin), fibrosis (high levels of collagen), or a combination of
   both. The accurate characterization of the strictures is critical for
   the management of CD. This study examines the feasibility of
   characterizing intestinal strictures by Photoacoustic imaging (PAI)
   without extrapolation from superficial biopsies. Ex vivo normal rat
   colon tissue, inflammatory and fibrotic intestinal strictures in rat
   trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) model were first differentiated by
   a PA-US parallel imaging system. Surgically removed human intestinal
   stricture specimens were afterwards imaged by a multiwavelength acoustic
   resolution PA microscope (ARPAM). The experiment results suggest that
   PAI is a potential tool for the diagnosis of the diseased conditions in
   intestinal strictures. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Standard modeling and evaluation methods have been classically used in
   analyzing engineering dynamical systems where the fundamental problem is
   to minimize the (mean) error between the real and predicted systems.
   Although these methods have been applied to multi-step ahead predictions
   of physiological signals, it is often more important to predict
   clinically relevant events than just to match these signals. Adverse
   clinical events, which occur after a physiological signal breaches a
   clinically defined critical threshold, are a popular class of such
   events. This paper presents a framework for multi-step ahead predictions
   of critical levels of abnormality in physiological signals. First, a
   performance metric is presented for evaluating multi-step ahead
   predictions. Then, this metric is used to identify personalized models
   optimized with respect to predictions of critical levels of abnormality.
   To address the paucity of adverse events, weighted support vector
   machines and cost-sensitive learning are used to optimize the proposed
   framework with respect to statistical metrics that can take into account
   the relative rarity of such events.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers multiobjective optimization under uncertainty
   (MOOUC) for the selection of optimal cutting conditions in advanced
   abrasive machining (AAM) processes. Processes considered are water jet
   machining (WJM), abrasive water jet machining (AWJM), and ultrasonic
   machining (USM). Decisions regarding the cutting conditions can involve
   optimization for multiple competing goals, such as surface finish,
   machining time, and power consumption. In practice, there is also an
   issue of variations in the ability to attain the performance goals. This
   can be due to limitations in machine accuracy or variations in material
   properties of the workpiece and/or abrasive particles. The approach
   adopted in this work relies on a strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm
   (SPEA2) framework, with specially tailored dominance operators to
   account for probabilistic aspects in the considered multiobjective
   problem. Deterministic benchmark problems in the literature for the
   considered machining processes are extended to include performance
   uncertainty and then used in testing the performance of the proposed
   approach. Results of the study show that accounting for process
   variations through a simple penalty term may be detrimental for the
   multiobjective optimization. On the other hand, a proposed
   fuzzy-tournament dominance operator appears to produce favorable
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Effective electrification of automotive vehicles requires designing the
   powertrain's configuration along with sizing its components for a
   particular vehicle type. Employing planetary gear (PG) systems in hybrid
   electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain architectures allows various
   architecture alternatives to be explored, including single-mode
   architectures that are based on a fixed configuration and multimode
   architectures that allow switching power flow configuration during
   vehicle operation. Previous studies have addressed the configuration and
   sizing problems separately. However, the two problems are coupled and
   must be optimized together to achieve system optimality. An all-in-one
   (AIO) system solution approach to the combined problem is not viable due
   to the high complexity of the resulting optimization problem. This paper
   presents a partitioning and coordination strategy based on analytical
   target cascading (ATC) for simultaneous design of powertrain
   configuration and sizing for given vehicle applications. The capability
   of the proposed design framework is demonstrated by designing
   powertrains with one and two PGs for a midsize passenger vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative preference models are used to predict customer choices
   among design alternatives by collecting prior purchase data or survey
   answers. This paper examines how to improve the prediction accuracy of
   such models without collecting more data or changing the model. We
   propose to use features as an intermediary between the original
   customer-linked design variables and the preference model, transforming
   the original variables into a feature representation that captures the
   underlying design preference task more effectively. We apply this idea
   to automobile purchase decisions using three feature learning methods
   (principal component analysis (PCA), low rank and sparse matrix
   decomposition (LSD), and exponential sparse restricted Boltzmann machine
   (RBM)) and show that the use of features offers improvement in
   prediction accuracy using over 1 million real passenger vehicle purchase
   data. We then show that the interpretation and visualization of these
   feature representations may be used to help augment data-driven design
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Current design theory lacks a systematic method to identify what
   designers know that helps them to create innovative products. In the
   early stages of idea generation, designers may find novel ideas come
   readily to mind, or may become fixated on their own or existing
   products. This may limit the ability to consider more and more varied
   candidate concepts that may potentially lead to innovation. To aid in
   idea generation, we sought to identify ``design heuristics,{''} or
   ``rules of thumb,{''} evident in award-winning designs. In this paper,
   we demonstrate a content analysis method for discovering heuristics in
   the designs of innovative products. Our method depends on comparison to
   a baseline of existing products so that the innovative change can be
   readily identified. Through an analysis of key features and functional
   elements in the designs of over 400 award-winning products, 40 heuristic
   principles were extracted. These design heuristics are outlined
   according to their perceived role in changing an existing product
   concept into a novel design, and examples of other products using the
   heuristics are provided. To demonstrate the ease of use of these design
   heuristics, we examined outcomes from a classroom study and found that
   concepts created using design heuristics were rated as more creative and
   varied. The analysis of changes from existing to innovative products can
   provide evidence of useful heuristic principles to apply in creating new
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the structures of catalysts under realistic conditions
   with atomic precision is crucial to design better materials for
   challenging transformations. Under reducing conditions, certain
   reducible supports migrate onto supported metallic particles and create
   strong metal support states that drastically change the reactivity of
   the systems. The details of this process are still unclear and preclude
   its thorough exploitation. Here, we report an atomic description of a
   palladium/titania (Pd/TiO2) system by combining state-of-the-art in situ
   transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations with structurally defined materials, in which we visualize
   the formation of the overlayers at the atomic scale under atmospheric
   pressure and high temperature. We show that an amorphous reduced titania
   layer is formed at low temperatures, and that crystallization of the
   layer into either mono- or bilayer structures is dictated by the
   reaction environment and predicted by theory. Furthermore, it occurs in
   combination with a dramatic reshaping of the metallic surface facets.}},

   conditions the performance of partial nitritation/anammox for the
   200,000 m(3)/day step-feed activated sludge process at the Changi Water
   Reclamation Plant, Singapore. The similarity of the concentrations of
   NH4, NO2, NO3, PO4, suspended chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), pH, and
   alkalinity (ALK) between the on-site process and laboratory reactor
   illustrates that the laboratory fed-batch reactor can be used to
   simulate the site performance. The performance of the reactor fed by
   primary effluent illustrated the existence of anammox and heterotrophic
   denitrification and apparent excessive biological phosphorus removal as
   observed from the site. The performance of the reactor fed by final
   effluent proved the presence of anammox process on site. Both the
   laboratory reactor and on-site process showed that higher influent 5-day
   biochemical oxygen demand/total nitrogen (BOD5/TN) (COD/TN) ratio
   increases the nitrogen removal efficiency of the process.}},

Abstract = {{A finite element (FE) head and neck model was developed as a tool to aid
   investigations and development of deformable image registration and
   patient modeling in radiation oncology. Useful aspects of a FE model for
   these purposes include ability to produce realistic deformations
   (similar to those seen in patients over the course of treatment) and a
   rational means of generating new configurations, e.g., via the
   application of force and/or displacement boundary conditions.
   The model was constructed based on a cone-beam computed tomography image
   of a head and neck cancer patient. The three-node triangular surface
   meshes created for the bony elements (skull, mandible, and cervical
   spine) and joint elements were integrated into a skeletal system and
   combined with the exterior surface. Nodes were additionally created
   inside the surface structures which were composed of the three-node
   triangular surface meshes, so that four-node tetrahedral FE elements
   were created over the whole region of the model. The bony elements were
   modeled as a homogeneous linear elastic material connected by
   intervertebral disks. The surrounding tissues were modeled as a
   homogeneous linear elastic material. Under force or displacement
   boundary conditions, FE analysis on the model calculates approximate
   solutions of the displacement vector field.
   A FE head and neck model was constructed that skull, mandible, and
   cervical vertebrae were mechanically connected by disks. The developed
   FE model is capable of generating realistic deformations that are
   strain-free for the bony elements and of creating new configurations of
   the skeletal system with the surrounding tissues reasonably deformed.
   The FE model can generate realistic deformations for skeletal elements.
   In addition, the model provides a way of evaluating the accuracy of
   image alignment methods by producing a ground truth deformation and
   correspondingly simulated images. The ability to combine force and
   displacement conditions provides flexibility for simulating realistic
   anatomic configurations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a technique for quantifying inter-individual variability in
   normal vaginal shape, axis, and dimension, and report findings in
   healthy women.
   Eighty women (age: 28 similar to 70 years) with normal pelvic organ
   support underwent supine, multi-planar proton-density MRI. Vaginal width
   was assessed at five evenly-spaced locations, and vaginal axis, length,
   and surface area were quantified via ImageJ and MATLAB.
   The mid-sagittal plane angles, relative to the horizontal, of three
   vaginal axes were 90 +/- 11, 72 +/- 21, and 41 +/- 22A degrees (caudal
   to cranial, p < 0.001). The mean (+/- SD) vaginal widths were 17 +/- 5,
   24 +/- 4, 30 +/- 7, 41 +/- 9, and 45 +/- 12 mm at the five locations
   (caudal to cranial, p < 0.001). Mid-sagittal lengths for anterior and
   posterior vaginal walls were 63 +/- 9 and 98 +/- 18 mm respectively. The
   vaginal surface area was 72 +/- 21 cm(2) (range: 34 similar to aEuro
   parts per thousand 164 cm(2)). The coefficient of determination between
   any demographic variable and any vaginal dimension did not exceed 0.16.
   Large variations in normal vaginal shape, axis, and dimensions were not
   explained by body size or other demographic variables. This variation
   has implications for reconstructive surgery, intravaginal and surgical
   product design, and vaginal drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports results of experiments on the isolated droplet
   burning characteristics of butanol isomers (n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-)
   under standard atmosphere conditions in an environment that promotes
   spherical combustion. The data are compared with predictions from a
   detailed numerical model (DNM) that incorporates complex combustion
   chemistry, radiative heat transfer, temperature dependent variable fluid
   properties, and unsteady gas and liquid transport. Computational
   predictions are generated using the high temperature kinetic models of
   Sarathy et al. (2012) and Merchant et al. (2013).
   The experiments were performed in a free-fall facility to reduce the
   effects of buoyancy and produce spherical droplet flames. Motion of
   single droplets with diameters ranged from 0.52 mm to 0.56 mm was
   eliminated by tethering them to two small-diameter SiC filaments
   (similar to 14 mu m diameter). In all the experiments, minimal sooting
   was observed, offering the opportunity for direct comparison of the
   experimental measurements with DNM predictions that neglect soot
   kinetics.
   The experimental data showed that the burning rates of iso- and
   sec-butanol are very close to that of n-butanol, differing only in flame
   structure. The flame stand-off ratios (FSR) for n-butanol flames are
   smaller than those for the isomers, while tert-butanol flames exhibited
   the largest FSR. DNM predictions based upon the kinetic model of Sarathy
   et al. over-predict the droplet burning rates and FSRs of all the
   isomers except n-butanol. Predictions using a kinetic model based upon
   the work of Merchant et al. agree much better with the experimental
   data, though relatively higher discrepancies are evident for
   tert-butanol simulation results. Further analyses of the predictions
   using the two kinetic models and their differences are discussed. It is
   found that the disparity in transport coefficients for isomer specific
   species for Sarathy et al. model fosters deviation in computational
   predictions against these newly acquired droplet combustion data
   presented in this study. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Title = {{Linking MedDRA (R)-Coded Clinical Phenotypes to Biological Mechanisms by

Abstract = {{Introduction A translational bioinformatics challenge exists in
   connecting population and individual clinical phenotypes in various
   formats to biological mechanisms. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
   Activities (MedDRA (R)) is the default dictionary for adverse event (AE)
   reporting in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
   System (FAERS). The ontology of adverse events (OAE) represents AEs as
   pathological processes occurring after drug exposures.
   Objectives The aim of this work was to establish a semantic framework to
   link biological mechanisms to phenotypes of AEs by combining OAE with
   MedDRA (R) in FAERS data analysis. We investigated the AEs associated
   with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
   targeting tyrosine kinases. The five selected TKIs/mAbs (i.e.,
   dasatinib, imatinib, lapatinib, cetuximab, and trastuzumab) are known to
   induce impaired ventricular function (non-QT) cardiotoxicity.
   Results Statistical analysis of FAERS data identified 1053 distinct
   MedDRA (R) terms significantly associated with TKIs/mAbs, where 884 did
   not have corresponding OAE terms. We manually annotated these terms,
   added them to OAE by the standard OAE development strategy, and mapped
   them to MedDRA (R). The data integration to provide insights into
   molecular mechanisms of drug-associated AEs was performed by including
   linkages in OAE for all related AE terms to MedDRA (R) and the existing
   ontologies, including the human phenotype ontology (HP), Uber anatomy
   ontology (UBERON), and gene ontology (GO). Sixteen AEs were shared by
   all five TKIs/mAbs, and each of 17 cardiotoxicity AEs was associated
   with at least one TKI/mAb. As an example, we analyzed ``cardiac
   failure{''} using the relations established in OAE with other ontologies
   and demonstrated that one of the biological processes associated with
   cardiac failure maps to the genes associated with heart contraction.
   Conclusion By expanding the existing OAE ontological design, our TKI use
   case demonstrated that the combination of OAE and MedDRA (R) provides a
   semantic framework to link clinical phenotypes of adverse drug events to
   biological mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Assessment of vehicle emission programs in China during 1998-2013:
   Achievement, challenges and implications}},

Abstract = {{China has been embracing rapid motorization since the 1990s, and
   vehicles have become one of the major sources of air pollution problems.
   Since the late 1990s, thanks to the international experience, China has
   adopted comprehensive control measures to mitigate vehicle emissions.
   This study employs a local emission model (EMBEV) to assess China's
   first fifteen-year (1998-2013) efforts in controlling vehicles
   emissions. Our results show that China's total annual vehicle emissions
   in 2013 were 4.16 million tons (Mt) of HC, 27.4 Mt of CO, 7.72 Mt of
   NOx, and 0.37 Mt of PM2.5, respectively. Although vehicle emissions are
   substantially reduced relative to the without control scenarios, we
   still observe significantly higher emission density in East China than
   in developed countries with longer histories of vehicle emission
   control. This study further informs China's policy-makers of the
   prominent challenges to control vehicle emissions in the future. First,
   unlike other major air pollutants, total NOx emissions have rapidly
   increased due to a surge of diesel trucks and the postponed China IV
   standard nationwide. Simultaneous implementation of fuel quality
   improvements and vehicle-engine emission standards will be of great
   importance to alleviate NOx emissions for diesel fleets. Second, the
   enforcement of increasingly stringent standards should include strict
   oversight of type-approval conformity, in-use complacence and
   durability, which would help reduce gross emitters of PM2.5 that are
   considerable among in-use diesel fleets at the present. Third, this
   study reveals higher HC emissions than previous results and indicates
   evaporative emissions may have been underestimated. Considering that
   China's overall vehicle ownership is far from saturation, persistent
   efforts are required through economic tools, traffic management and
   emissions regulations to lower vehicle-use intensity and limit both
   exhaust and evaporative emissions. Furthermore, in light of the complex
   technology for emerging new energy vehicles, their real-world emissions
   need to be adequately evaluated before massive promotion. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The principle of velocity decomposition is used to efficiently and
   accurately solve the Navier-Stokes boundary-value problem for lifting
   flows. The velocity vector is decomposed as the sum of irrotational and
   vortical components. The irrotational component is represented using a
   velocity potential which satisfies the Laplace equation with a modified
   boundary condition that is written in terms of the Navier-Stokes
   solution. A viscous potential can be found which satisfies the
   Navier-Stokes problem directly outside of the rotational regions of the
   fluid such that the fluid domain over which the Navier-Stokes equations
   must be solved numerically can be greatly reduced. The viscous potential
   is used as a Dirichlet boundary condition for the total velocity on the
   boundaries of the reduced fluid domain. The velocity decomposition
   approach is used to solve for the flow over a 2D NACA0012 foil in both
   laminar and turbulent regimes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Limited energy in each node is the major design constraint in wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs). To overcome this limit, wireless rechargeable
   sensor networks (WRSNs) have been proposed and studied extensively over
   the last few years. In a typical WRSN, batteries in sensor nodes can be
   replenished by a mobile charger that periodically travels along a
   certain trajectory in the sensing area. To maximize the charged energy
   in sensor nodes, one fundamental question is how to control the
   traveling velocity of the charger. In this paper, we first identify the
   optimal velocity control as a key design objective of mobile wireless
   charging in WRSNs. We then formulate the optimal charger velocity
   control problem on arbitrarily-shaped irregular trajectories in a 2D
   space. The problem is proved to be NP-hard, and hence a heuristic
   solution with a provable upper bound is developed using novel spatial
   and temporal discretization. We also derive the optimal velocity control
   for moving the charger along a linear (1D) trajectory commonly seen in
   many WSN applications. Extensive simulations show that the network
   lifetime can be extended by 2.5 x with the proposed velocity control
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation focuses on studying the effect of flow conditions and
   the geometric variation of the microcantilever's bluff body on the
   microcantilever detection capabilities within a fluidic device using a
   finite element fluid-structure interaction model. Such parameters
   include inlet velocity, flow direction, and height of the
   microcantilever's supporting system within the fluidic cell. The
   transport equations are solved using a finite element formulation based
   on the Galerkin method of weighted residuals. For a flexible
   microcantilever, a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
   analysis is utilized and the fluid domain is described by an
   Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation that is fully coupled to
   the structure domain. The results of this study showed a profound effect
   of the magnitude and direction of the inlet velocity and the height of
   the bluff body on the deflection of the microcantilever. The vibration
   characteristics were also investigated in this study. This work paves
   the road for researchers to design efficient microcantilevers that

Abstract = {{Many of the models developed to date for human evacuation lack realism
   because of their inability to adequately simulate social relationships.
   To begin to address this shortcoming, an agent-based model is proposed
   based upon a new technique termed scalar field method (SFM). The new
   method draws on an analogy to a charged particle in an electromagnetic
   field. In the new model, virtual potential energies (VPEs), that can be
   made to represent both human will and social relationships, simulate the
   interactions that occur between an agent and its surrounding entities.
   Each agent has stochastic characteristics, is independent, and makes
   autonomous decisions regarding behavior by minimizing the VPE. The
   proposed model supersedes the pattern-based format of many current ones
   and provides the potential for greater emergence and variability.
   Preliminary tests show the ability of the new model to mimic reasonable
   evacuation behavior, and its potential for exploring the significance of
   social relationships during egress.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to quantify how ball flight kinematics (i.e., ball
   speed and movement), release location, and variations therein relate to
   pitching success in Major League Baseball (MLB). One hundred ninety
   starting MLB pitchers met the inclusion criteria for this study. Ball
   trajectory information was collected for 76,000 pitches and averaged
   across each pitcher before being inserted into a forward stepwise
   multiple regression model, which examined how (a) pitch selection, (b)
   ball speed, (c) ball movement (horizontal and lateral), (d) release
   location (horizontal and lateral), (e) variation in pitch speed, (f)
   variation in ball movement, and (g) variation in release location
   related to pitching success (as measured by fielding independent
   pitching-FIP). Pitch speed, release location variability, variation in
   pitch speed, and horizontal release location were significant predictors
   of FIP and, collectively, accounted for 24\% of the variance in FIP.
   These findings suggest that (a) maximizing ball speed, (b) refining a
   consistent spatial release location, and (c) using varied pitch speeds
   should be primary foci for the pitching coach. However, between-pitcher
   variations underline how training interventions should be administered
   at the individual level, with consideration given to the pitcher's
   injury history. Finally, despite offering significant predictors of
   success, these three factors explained only 22\% of the variance in FIP
   and should not be considered the only, or preeminent, indicators of a
   pitcher's effectiveness. Evidently, traditional pitching metrics only
   partly account for a pitcher's effectiveness, and future research is
   necessary to uncover the remaining contributors to success.}},

Abstract = {{A phospho-null Ala substitution at protein kinase C (PKC)-targeted
   cardiac troponin I (cTnI) S43/45 reduces myocyte and cardiac contractile
   function. The goal of the current study was to test whether cTnIS43/45N
   is an alternative, functionally conservative substitution in cardiac
   myocytes. Partial and more extensive endogenous cTnI replacement was
   similar at 2 and 4 days after gene transfer, respectively, for
   epitope-tagged cTnI and cTnIS43/45N. This replacement did not
   significantly change thin filament stoichiometry. In functional studies,
   there were no significant changes in the amplitude and/or rates of
   contractile shortening and re-lengthening after this partial (2 days)
   and extensive (4 days) replacement with cTnIS43/45N. The cTnIS43/45N
   substitution also was not associated with adaptive changes in the
   myocyte Ca2+ transient or in phosphorylation of the protein kinase A and
   C-targeted cTnIS23/24 site. These results provide evidence that
   cTnIS43/45N is a functionally conservative substitution, and may be
   appropriate for use as a phospho-null in rodent models designed for
   studies on PKC modulation of cardiac performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Correct-by-Construction Adaptive Cruise Control: Two Approaches}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the challenge of developing control software provably
   meeting specifications for real-world problems, this paper applies
   formal methods to adaptive cruise control (ACC). Starting from a linear
   temporal logic specification for ACC, obtained by interpreting relevant
   ACC standards, we discuss in this paper two different control software
   synthesis methods. Each method produces a controller that is
   correct-by-construction, meaning that trajectories of the closed-loop
   systems provably meet the specification. Both methods rely on
   fixed-point computations of certain set-valued mappings. However, one of
   the methods performs these computations on the continuous state space
   whereas the other method operates on a finite-state abstraction. While
   controller synthesis is based on a low-dimensional model, each
   controller is tested on CarSim, an industry-standard vehicle simulator.
   Our results demonstrate several advantages over classical control design
   techniques. First, a formal approach to control design removes potential
   ambiguity in textual specifications by translating them into precise
   mathematical requirements. Second, because the resulting closed-loop
   system is known a priori to satisfy the specification, testing can then
   focus on the validity of the models used in control design and whether
   the specification captures the intended requirements. Finally, the set
   from where the specification (e.g., safety) can be enforced is
   explicitly computed and thus conditions for passing control to an
   emergency controller are clearly defined.}},

Abstract = {{Iterative learning control (ILC) is an effective control strategy for
   improving control performance in stable or stabilizable systems that
   track a repetitive trajectory in time. The ILC paradigm has previously
   been extended to the spatial domain; however, spatial ILC (SILC) methods
   have most commonly been applied to problems in which there is a natural
   bijective map between the temporal and spatial domains to simply
   redefine processes in space instead of time. Yet, there are applications
   in which there does not exist a unique mapping between time and space,
   such as additive manufacturing (AM) systems utilizing a raster
   trajectory. In this exploratory work, we present a novel reformulation
   of ILC that is derived from 2-D convolution in spatial coordinates,
   compared with 1-D convolution employed in temporal ILC, which innately
   informs the algorithm of the spatial proximity of measured data points.
   We present our SILC framework in a tutorial fashion, providing the
   essential liftedand frequency-domain system formulations and stability
   and performance criteria. A simulation-based demonstration using an
   empirically derived model of a microscale AM system examines SILC update
   law designs. Importantly, as a spatial sensor for an AM system will
   record as many as 108 measurements, we demonstrate that a
   frequency-domain framework reduces the computation time by three orders
   of magnitude and increases the tractable number of measurements by three
   orders of magnitude, in comparison with the lifted-domain framework.}},

Abstract = {{GaAs photovoltaics are promising candidates for indoor energy harvesting
   to power small-scale (approximate to 1 mm(2)) electronics. This
   application has stringent requirements on dark current, recombination,
   and shunt leakage paths due to low-light conditions and small device
   dimensions. The power conversion efficiency and the limiting mechanisms
   in GaAs photovoltaic cells under indoor lighting conditions are studied
   experimentally. Voltage is limited by generation-recombination dark
   current attributed to perimeter sidewall surface recombination based on
   the measurements of variable cell area. Bulk and perimeter recombination
   coefficients of 1.464 pA/mm(2) and 0.2816 pA/mm, respectively, were
   extracted from dark current measurements. Resulting power conversion
   efficiency is strongly dependent on cell area, where current GaAs of
   1-mm(2) indoor photovoltaic cells demonstrates power conversion
   efficiency of approximately 19\% at 580 lx of white LED illumination.
   Reductions in both bulk and perimeter sidewall recombination are
   required to increase maximum efficiency (while maintaining small cell
   area near 1 mm(2)) to approach the theoretical power conversion
   efficiency of 40\% for GaAs cells under typical indoor lighting
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) play a central role in today's Internet
   infrastructure and have seen a sharp increase in scale. More and more
   internet sites are armed with live contents, such as live sports game
   statistics, e-commerce, and online auctions, and they rely on CDNs to
   deliver such contents freshly at scale. However, the problem of
   maintaining consistency for live (dynamic) contents while achieving high
   scalability is non-trivial in CDNs. The large number of widely scattered
   replicas guarantees the QoS of end-users while substantially increasing
   the complexity of consistency maintenance under frequent updates.
   Current consistency maintenance infrastructures and methods cannot
   simultaneously satisfy both scalability and consistency. In this paper,
   we first analyze our crawled trace data of cached sports game content on
   thousands of content servers of a major CDN. We analyze the content
   consistency from different perspectives, from which we break down the
   reasons for inconsistency among content servers. We verify that the CDN
   uses unicast instead of multicast trees as the update infrastructure,
   which may not scale effectively. Then, we further evaluate the
   performance in consistency, scalability and overhead for different
   infrastructures with different update methods. We itemize the advantages
   and disadvantages of different methods and infrastructures in different
   scenarios through the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, we propose
   our hybrid and self-adaptive update method to reduce network load and
   improve scalability under the conditions recorded in the trace and prove
   its effectiveness through trace-driven experiments. We aim to give
   guidance for appropriate selections of consistency maintenance
   infrastructures and methods for a CDN, and for choosing a CDN service
   with different considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, floating offshore wind power acts as a new form of marine
   renewable energy, attracting much attention all over the world. Due to
   constraints of technology and cost, floating wind turbines are still at
   the stage of preliminary trials. Reliability analysis on floating wind
   turbines is essential and urgent for solving the issues caused by high
   cost and challenges in searching failure causes. Primarily, this
   research proposes the scientific, systematic grading of floating wind
   power equipment system based upon its structure and function, providing
   with explicit internal relation of system and the precondition of
   failure modes analysis. Dynamic fault tree analysis on floating wind
   turbines is conducted to discuss sequentially dependent failures and
   redundancy failures. Furthermore, failure rates of relevant offshore
   structures are searched according to previous studies, databases and
   reports. Different modules of floating wind turbines take respective
   proper failure cases for references. The overall reliability results of
   floating wind turbines has been achieved. The research contributes to
   designing, construction and maintenance of floating wind turbines to
   control investment and enlarge economic benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Atomic force microscopy indentation and inverse analysis for non-linear
   viscoelastic identification of breast cancer cells}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{77-88}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MCF-10A) are studied through indentation
   with spherical borosilicate glass particles in atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) contact mode in fluid. Their mechanical properties are obtained by
   analyzing the recorded reaction force-time response. The analysis is
   based on comparing experimental data with predictions from finite
   element (FE) simulation. Here, FE modeling is employed to simulate the
   AFM indentation experiment which is neither a displacement nor a force
   controlled test. This approach is expected to overcome many underlying
   problems of the widely used models such as Hertz contact model due to
   its capability to capture the contact behaviors between the spherical
   indentor and the cell, account for cell geometry, and incorporate with
   large strain theory. In this work, a non-linear viscoelastic (NLV) model
   in which the viscoelastic part is described by Prony series terms is
   used for the constitutive model of the cells. The time-dependent
   material parameters are extracted through an inverse analysis with the
   use of a surrogate model based on a Kriging estimator. The purpose is to
   automatically extract the NLV properties of the cells with a more
   efficient process compared to the iterative inverse technique that has
   been mostly applied in the literature. The method also allows the use of
   FE modeling in the analysis of a large amount of experimental data. The
   NLV parameters are compared between MCF-7 and MCF-10A and MCF-10A
   treated and untreated with the drug Cytochalasin D to examine the
   possibility of using relaxation properties as biomarkers for
   distinguishing these types of breast cancer cells. The comparisons
   indicate that malignant cells (MCF-7) are softer and exhibit more
   relaxation than benign cells (MCF-10A). Disrupting the cytoskeleton
   using the drug Cytochalasin D also results in a larger amount of
   relaxation in the cell's response. In addition, relaxation properties
   indicate larger differences as compared to the elastic moduli like
   instantaneous shear modulus. These results may be useful for disease
   diagnosing purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Orbital atherectomy is a catheter-based minimally invasive procedure to
   modify the plaque within atherosclerotic arteries using a diamond
   abrasive crown. This study was designed to investigate the crown motion
   and its corresponding contact force with the vessel. To this end, a
   transparent arterial tissue mimicking phantom made of polyvinyl chloride
   was developed, a high-speed camera and image processing technique were
   utilized to visualize and quantitatively analyze the crown motion in the
   vessel phantom, and a piezoelectric dynamometer measured the forces on
   the phantom during the procedure. Observed under typical orbital
   atherectomy rotational speeds of 60,000, 90,000, and 120,000 rpm in a
   4.8 mm caliber vessel phantom, the crown motion was a combination of
   high-frequency rotation at 1000, 1500, and 1660.4-1866.1 Hz and
   low-frequency orbiting at 18, 38, and 40 Hz, respectively. The measured
   forces were also composed of these high and low frequencies, matching
   well with the rotation of the eccentric crown and the associated orbital
   motion. The average peak force ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 N at different
   rotational speeds. (c) 2016 IPEM.}},

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness have yet to
   be fully elucidated, in part because of the diverse molecular targets of
   anesthetic agents. We demonstrate, using intracortical recordings in
   macaque monkeys, that information transfer between structurally
   connected cortical regions is disrupted during ketamine anesthesia,
   despite preserved primary sensory representation. Furthermore, transfer
   entropy, an information-theoretic measure of directed connectivity,
   decreases significantly between neuronal units in the anesthetized
   state. This is the first direct demonstration of a general anesthetic
   disrupting corticocortical information transfer in the primate brain.
   Given past studies showing that more commonly used GABAergic drugs
   inhibit surrogate measures of cortical communication, this finding
   suggests the potential for a common network-level mechanism of
   anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{63-67}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{We present the design of an image contrast based fluid pressure sensing
   scheme that employs a powerless, low-cost, pressure sensor. The sensor
   consists of a sealed pressure microchamber whose top surface consists of
   a deformable, semi-transparent, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane and
   its bottom surface consists of a rigid glass substrate. When the
   microchamber is pressurized, the membrane is deflected but the position
   of the glass substrate remains fixed and therefore the distance between
   them changes with applied pressure. Using a precision z-scanning module,
   the distance between the top and bottom surfaces is measured using a
   custom-made image contrast algorithm and the applied pressure is
   extracted. The image contrast is enhanced by adding food color during
   the fabrication of the membrane and by patterning the glass substrate
   with photoresist. The sensor operates over a pressure range of 0-100
   mbar, with a similar to 2 mbar resolution in the 0-20 mbar pressure
   range and similar to 10 mbar resolution in the 20-100 mbar pressure
   range. The maximum error was measured to be less than 7\% throughout its
   dynamic range. The novel pressure monitoring concept presented here can
   be used in various biomedical applications as well as in the consumer
   electronics industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   in mouse femoral trabecular compartments}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play critical roles
   in skeletal development and new bone formation. Our previous study,
   however, showed a negative impact of BMP signaling on bone mass because
   of the osteoblast-specific loss of a BMP receptor (i.e. BMPR1A) showing
   increased trabecular bone volume and mineral density in mice. Here, we
   investigated the bone quality and biomechanical properties of the higher
   bone mass associated with BMPR1A deficiency using the
   osteoblast-specific Bmpr 1a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model.
   Collagen biochemical analysis revealed greater levels of the mature
   cross-link pyridinoline in the cKO bones, in parallel with upregulation
   of collagen modifying enzymes. Raman spectroscopy distinguished
   increases in the mature to immature cross-link ratio and mineral to
   matrix ratio in the trabecular compartments of cKO femora, but not in
   the cortical compartments. The mineral crystallinity was unchanged in
   the cKO in either the trabecular or cortical compartments. Further, we
   tested the intrinsic material properties by nanoindentation and found
   significantly higher hardness and elastic modulus in the cKO trabecular
   compartments, but not in the cortical compartments. Four point bending
   tests of cortical compartments showed lower structural biomechanical
   properties (i.e. strength and stiffness) in the cKO bones due to the
   smaller cortical areas. However, there were no significant differences
   in biomechanical performance at the material level, which was consistent
   with the nanoindentation test results on the cortical compartment These
   studies emphasize the pivotal role of BMPR1A in the determination of
   bone quality and mechanical integrity under physiological conditions,
   with different impact on femoral cortical and trabecular compartments.

Abstract = {{Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have been increasingly adopted in recent years
   due to the extensive integration of many components in modern multicore
   processors and system-on-chip designs. At the same time, transistor
   reliability is becoming a major concern due to the continuous scaling of
   silicon. As the sole medium of on-chip communication, it is critical for
   a NoC to be able to tolerate many permanent transistor failures. In this
   paper, we propose uDIREC, a unified framework for permanent fault
   diagnosis and subsequent reconfiguration in NoCs, which provides
   graceful performance degradation with an increasing number of faults.
   Upon in-field transistor failures, uDIREC leverages a fine-resolution
   diagnosis mechanism to disable faulty components very sparingly. At its
   core, uDIREC employs MOUNT, a novel routing algorithm to find reliable
   and deadlock-free routes that utilize all the still-functional links in
   the NoC. We implement uDIREC's reconfiguration as a truly-distributed
   hardware solution, still keeping the area overhead at a minimum. We also
   propose a software-implemented reconfiguration that provides greater
   integration with our software-based diagnosis scheme, at the cost of
   distributed nature of implementation. Regardless of the adopted
   implementation scheme, uDIREC places no restriction on topology, router
   architecture and number and location of faults. Experimental results
   show that uDIREC, implemented in a 64-node NoC, drops 3x fewer nodes and
   provides greater than 25 percent throughput improvement (beyond 15
   faults) when compared to other state-of-the-art fault-tolerance
   solutions. uDIREC's improvement over prior-art grows further with more
   faults, making it a effective NoC reliability solution for a wide range
   of fault rates.}},

Title = {{A Cost-Effective, Clinically Actionable Strategy for Targeting HIV
   Preexposure Prophylaxis to High-Risk Men Who Have Sex With Men}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at preventing
   HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), but there is
   uncertainty about how to identify high-risk MSM who should receive PrEP.
   Methods: We used a mathematical model to assess the cost-effectiveness
   of using the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM (HIRI-MSM) questionnaire
   to target PrEP to high-risk MSM. We simulated strategies of no PrEP,
   PrEP available to all MSM, and eligibility thresholds set to HIRI-MSM
   scores between 5 and 45, in increments of 5 (where a higher score
   predicts greater HIV risk). Based on the iPrEx, IPERGAY, and PROUD
   trials, we evaluated PrEP efficacies from 44\% to 86\% and annual costs
   from \$5900 to 8700. We designate strategies with incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <=\$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year
   (QALY) as ``cost-effective.{''}
   Results: Over 20 years, making PrEP available to all MSM is projected to
   prevent 33.5\% of new HIV infections, with an ICER of \$1,474,000/QALY.
   Increasing the HIRI-MSM score threshold reduces the prevented
   infections, but improves cost-effectiveness. A threshold score of 25 is
   projected to be optimal (most QALYs gained while still being
   cost-effective) over a wide range of realistic PrEP efficacies and
   costs. At low cost and high efficacy (IPERGAY), thresholds of 15 or 20
   are optimal across a range of other input assumptions; at high cost and
   low efficacy (iPrEx), 25 or 30 are generally optimal.
   Conclusions: The HIRI-MSM provides a clinically actionable means of
   guiding PrEP use. Using a score of 25 to determine PrEP eligibility
   could facilitate cost-effective use of PrEP among high-risk MSM who will
   benefit from it most.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The effects of water content and compression level on tissue thermal
   conductivity were studied. These effects are important in
   electrosurgery, as tissue is subjected to both compression and thermal
   heating. Ex vivo canine spleen tissue was used in this study. A thermal
   diffusion probe technique was employed to measure the tissue thermal
   conductivity in three different conditions. First, the tissue thermal
   conductivity with different water content levels was measured. The
   measured thermal conductivity decreased as the percentage of water
   within the tissue decreased. Second, the tissue thermal conductivity
   under compression, up to 77\%, was measured and it showed a 9\%
   reduction as the load was applied. Third, desiccated tissue was
   compressed, and the thermal conductivity was measured. The compression
   effect on thermal conductivity was less prominent in the desiccated
   tissue because less water was squeezed out due to compression. A
   three-phase Maxwell-Eucken model was developed to predict the tissue
   thermal conductivity for varying water content and compression levels.
   The model used the ratio of air, tissue fiber, and water to predict the
   thermal conductivity and showed a good agreement with the experimental
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Control of the size and material properties of silicon nanoparticles
   plays a critical role in optimizing applications using those
   nanoparticles, such as photovoltaics and biomedical devices. While
   synthesis of silicon nanoparticles in low temperature plasmas has many
   attractive features, the basic mechanisms leading to formation of
   nanoparticles in these plasmas are poorly understood. A two-dimensional
   numerical model for synthesis of silicon nanoparticles (< 5 nm in
   diameter) in radio frequency (RF) discharges was developed and used to
   investigate mechanisms for particle growth for Ar/He/SiH4 gas mixtures.
   Algorithms for the kinetics of nanoparticle formation were
   self-consistently embedded into a plasma hydrodynamics simulation to
   account for nucleation, growth, charging, and transport of
   nanoparticles. We found that with RF excitation in narrow tubes at
   pressures of a few Torr, the electric field does not fully confine
   charged nanoparticles in the axial direction, which then results in a
   finite residence time of particles in the plasma. We found that because
   of the high neutral nanoparticle density, coagulation plays a
   significant role in growth. The model predicts the possibility of
   synthesizing crystalline silicon nanoparticles under these conditions.
   Trends in the growth of nanoparticles as a function of power are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Folliculogenesis is a highly regulated, dynamic process requiring
   various autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors that need to be
   reproduced in vitro. The mammalian ovary consists of a finite number of
   follicles at birth, with the majority in a quiescent state, awaiting
   recruitment. In Vitro culture of preantral follicles presents a unique
   challenge of mimicking the dynamics of the ovarian environment, a
   methodical sequence of cell communication, and interaction with
   secretory, hormonal, and growth factors. In larger mammalian species,
   maintenance of follicular morphology is imperative to maintain
   communication between the cumulus-oocyte complexes. Three-dimensional
   culture systems help. to maintain this architecture and have been used
   for the successful culture of follicles in various animal models,
   including humans and nonhuman primates, and have resulted in live birth
   in rodent models. Clinically, in vitro follicular development could
   revolutionize assisted reproductive technology by providing a means of
   using the more numerous immature ovarian follicles in patient
   populations that are unable to undergo ovarian stimulation. (C) 2016

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{272-282}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Researchers have begun developing simulation models as a cost-effective
   and expeditious means to explore and enhance our understanding of energy
   use behavior interventions. These models have provided unique insights
   into potential energy savings as a result of improved occupant behavior,
   but have not yet reached the capability to be used for predictive
   modeling purposes. Therefore, this paper attempts to build on previous
   modeling efforts and develops an empirically and conceptually grounded
   occupant behavior model for simulating normative feedback interventions
   based on literature from the social science and field data. This model
   is then used to conduct ``what if{''} analyses testing three novel
   normative feedback intervention strategies and the effect of social
   network structure on intervention outcomes. The most successful and
   immediately applicable strategy consists of sending normative feedback
   only to individuals who use more energy than the group norm. This
   strategy resulted in a mean energy use reduction of 1.4 kW h per week
   per occupant, 2.2\%, relative to traditional individual and normative
   feedback strategies used today. Lastly, it was found that the social
   network structure in which the interventions took place affected the
   absolute outcomes (i.e., net change) of the simulations but not the
   relative outcomes (i.e., strategy ranking). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   degradation. The paper establishes a framework for PEV charging
   coordination that facilitates the tradeoff between total generation cost
   and the local costs associated with overloading and battery degradation.
   A decentralized approach to solving the resulting large-scale
   optimization problem involves each PEV minimizing their charging cost
   with respect to a forecast price profile while taking into account local
   grid and battery effects. The charging strategies proposed by
   participating PEVs are used to update the price profile which is
   subsequently rebroadcast to the PEVs. The process then repeats. It is
   shown that under mild conditions this iterative process converges to the
   unique, efficient (socially optimal) coordination strategy. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We study the problem of decentralized fault prognosis of
   partially-observed discrete event systems. In order to capture the
   prognostic performance issue in the prognosis problem, we propose two
   new criteria: (1) all faults can be predicted K steps ahead; and (2) a
   fault will occur for sure within M steps once a fault alarm is issued;
   and we refer to (M, K) as the performance bound of the prognostic
   system. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
   decentralized supervisor satisfying these two criteria is provided,
   which is termed as (M, K)-coprognosability. A polynomial-time algorithm
   for the verification of (M, K)-coprognosability is also proposed.
   Finally, we show that the proposed approach is applicable to both
   disjunctive and conjunctive architectures. Our results generalize
   previous work on decentralized fault prognosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We design and implement a scalable hard particle Monte Carlo simulation
   toolkit (HPMC), and release it open source as part of HOOMD-blue. HPMC
   runs in parallel on many CPUs and many GPUs using domain decomposition.
   We employ BVH trees instead of cell lists on the CPU for fast
   performance, especially with large particle size disparity, and optimize
   inner loops with SIMD vector intrinsics on the CPU. Our GPU kernel
   proposes many trial moves in parallel on a checkerboard and uses a block
   level queue to redistribute work among threads and avoid divergence.
   HPMC supports a wide variety of shape classes, including spheres/disks,
   unions of spheres, convex polygons, convex spheropolygons, concave
   polygons, ellipsoids/ellipses, convex polyhedra, convex spheropolyhedra,
   spheres cut by planes, and concave polyhedra. NVT and NPT ensembles can
   be run in 2D or 3D triclinic boxes. Additional integration schemes
   permit Frenkel-Ladd free energy computations and implicit depletant
   simulations. In a benchmark system of a fluid of 4096 pentagons, HPMC
   performs 10 million sweeps in 10 min on 96 CPU cores on XSEDE Comet. The
   same simulation would take 7.6 h in serial. HPMC also scales to large
   system sizes, and the same benchmark with 16.8 million particles runs in
   1.4 h on 2048 GPUs on OLCF Titan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study of the meso-level composite
   properties of an ultra-high ductile polyethylene-fiber-reinforced

   The viscosity of the matrix was controlled to ensure a uniform fiber
   dispersion. A series of experiments, including density, compression, and
   uniaxial tension tests, was performed to characterize the mechanical
   properties of the composite. The test results showed that the average
   tensile strength to compressive strength ratio of the composites was
   19.8\%, nearly double that of normal concrete, and the average crack
   width was 101 mu m. It was also demonstrated that tensile strain
   capacity and tensile strength of up to 7.50\% and 13.06 MPa,
   respectively, can be attained when using the proposed
   polyethylene-fiber-reinforced alkali-activated slag-based composites.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates crack speed in ultra-high performance concrete
   (UHPC) using pre-notched three-point bending specimens. The experimental
   parameters are fiber volume fraction and rate of loading. A hydraulic
   servo-controlled testing machine is used to apply lower notch tip strain
   rates, in the range of 0.025-1.0 1/s, while a newly developed impact
   testing system is used to achieve higher notch tip strain rates, ranging
   from 6.8 to 41.1 1/s. A high-speed camera is used to record images of
   the UHPC specimens during testing. Notch tip strain and crack speed are
   computed from the images, which show that crack speed increases
   asymptotically as the crack initiation strain rate increases. Crack
   speeds of up to 514 m/s were achieved at the lower notch tip strain
   rates and up to 1454 m/s for the higher notch tip strain rates. The
   achieved relationships are incorporated into a recently proposed
   crack-velocity dependent dynamic fracture model. The model is validated
   using published experimental data and used to show that, like
   conventional concrete, the strain rate sensitivity of UHPC is strongly
   associated with the characteristics of dynamic crack growth. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Background: Text messages can improve medication adherence and outcomes
   in several conditions. For this study, experts developed text messages
   addressing determinants of medication adherence: disease beliefs,
   medication necessity, medication concerns, and forgetfulness, as well as
   positive reinforcement messages for patients who were adherent.
   Objectives: To validate expert-developed text messages to address
   medication non-adherence with a group of non-researchers.
   Methods: A two-wave, card-sorting activity was conducted with students
   and staff at the University of Michigan. In the first wave, 40
   participants grouped 32 messages addressing barriers for medication
   adherence (disease beliefs, medication necessity, medication concerns,
   and forgetfulness) according to their perceived relationship. Messages
   with poor grouping agreement were deleted or modified. In the second
   wave, positive reinforcement messages were developed and tested along
   with the previous categories (36 messages) by 37 participants.
   Similarity and cluster analyses were used to assess agreement between
   experts and participants.
   Results: In the first card-sorting wave, participants grouped messages
   into between 2 and 13 separate categories. Similarity analysis showed
   four groupings of messages, however, some had an agreement below 50\%
   and clusters appeared dispersed. In the second wave, and after messages
   being edited, participants grouped the messages into between 4 and 9
   categories. Five groups (now including positive reinforcement messages)
   were identified with higher agreement in the similarity and cluster
   analyses.
   Conclusions: The structure of expert-developed text messages to address
   medication adherence key barriers was confirmed. Messages will be used
   in future research to determine their impact on affecting medication
   adherence to anti-hypertensive medications using a reinforcement
   learning controlled text messaging service. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Anabolic actions of PTH in bone involve increased deposition of
   mineralizing matrix. Regulatory feedback of the process may be important
   to maintain calcium homeostasis and, in turn, calcium may inform the
   process. This investigation clarified the role of calcium availability
   and the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) in the anabolic actions of PTH.
   CaSR function promoted osteoblastic cell numbers, with lower cell
   numbers in post-confluent cultures of primary calvarial cells from
   Col1-CaSR knock-out (KO) mice, and for calvarial cells from wild-type
   (WT) mice treated with a calcilytic. Increased apoptosis of calvarial
   cells with calcilytic treatment suggested CaSR is critical for
   protection against stage-dependent cell death. Whole and cortical, but
   not trabecular, bone parameters were significantly lower in Col1-CaSR KO
   mice versus WT littermates. Intact Col1-CaSR KO mice had lower serum
   P1NP levels relative to WT. PTH treatment displayed anabolic actions in
   WT and, to a lesser degree, KO mice, and rescued the lower P1NP levels
   in KO mice. Furthermore, PTH effects on whole tibiae were inhibited by
   osteoblast-specific CaSR ablation. Vertebral body implants (vossicles)
   from untreated Col1-CaSR KO and WT mice had similar bone volumes after 4
   weeks of implantation in athymic mice. These findings suggest that
   trabecular bone formation can occur independently of the CaSR, and that
   the CaSR plays a collaborative role in the PTH anabolic effects on bone.

Title = {{Anti-Forensics of Environmental-Signature-Based Audio Splicing Detection

Abstract = {{Numerous methods for detecting audio splicing have been proposed.
   Environmental-signature-based methods are considered to be the most
   effective forgery detection methods. The performance of existing audio
   forensic analysis methods is generally measured in the absence of any
   anti-forensic attack. Effectiveness of these methods in the presence of
   anti-forensic attacks is therefore unknown. In this paper, we propose an
   effective anti-forensic attack for environmental-signature-based
   splicing detection method and countermeasures to detect the presence of
   the anti-forensic attack. For anti-forensic attack,
   dereverberation-based processing is proposed. Three dereverberation
   methods are considered to tamper with the acoustic environment
   signature. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
   dereverberation-based anti-forensic attack significantly degrades the
   performance of the selected splicing detection method. The proposed
   countermeasures exploit artifacts introduced by the anti-forensic
   processing. To detect the presence of potential anti-forensic
   processing, a machine learning-based framework is proposed. In
   particular, the proposed anti-forensic detection method uses a
   rich-feature model consisting of Fourier coefficients, spectral
   properties, high-order statistics of musical noise residuals, and
   modulation spectral coefficients to capture traces of dereverberation
   attacks. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on both
   synthetic data and real-world speech recordings. The experimental
   results show that the proposed rich-feature model can detect the
   presence of anti-forensic processing with an average accuracy of 95\%.}},

Abstract = {{Chamberlain ({[}1963] Planet. Space Sci., 11, 901-960) described the use
   of the exobase layer to determine escape from planetary atmospheres,
   below which it is assumed that molecular collisions maintain thermal
   equilibrium and above which collisions are deemed negligible. De La Haye
   et al. ({[}2007] Icarus., 191, 236-250) used this approximation to
   extract the energy deposition and non-thermal escape rates for Titan's
   atmosphere by fitting the Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS)
   density data. De La Haye et al. assumed the gas distributions were
   composed of an enhanced population of super-thermal molecules (E > > kT)
   that could be described by a kappa energy distribution function (EDF),
   and they fit the data using the Liouville theorem. Here we fitted the
   data again, but we used the conventional form of the kappa EDF. The
   extracted kappa EDFs were then used with the Direct Simulation Monte
   Carlo (DSMC) technique (Bird {[}1994] Molecular Gas Dynamics and the
   Direct Simulation of Gas Flows) to evaluate the effect of collisions on
   the exospheric profiles. The INMS density data can be fit reasonably
   well with thermal and various non-thermal EDFs. However, the extracted
   energy deposition and escape rates are shown to depend significantly on
   the assumed exobase altitude, and the usefulness of such fits without
   directly modeling the collisions is unclear. Our DSMC results indicate
   that the kappa EDFs used in the Chamberlain approximation can lead to
   errors in determining the atmospheric temperature profiles and escape
   rates. Gas kinetic simulations are needed to accurately model measured
   exospheric density profiles, and to determine the altitude ranges where
   the Liouville method might be applicable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{77-81}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Hitherto, as a tool for tracing all branches of nonlinear differential
   equations, resolution-increasing homotopy methods have been applied only
   to finite difference discretizations. However, spectral Galerkin
   algorithms typically match the error of fourth order differences with
   one-half to one-fifth the number of degrees of freedom N in one
   dimension, and a factor of eight to a hundred and twenty-five in three
   dimensions. Let (u) over right arrow (N) be the vector of spectral
   coefficients and (R) over right arrow (N) the vector of N Galerkin
   constraints. A common two-part procedure is to first find all roots of
   (R) over right arrow (N)((u) over right arrow (N)) = (0) over right
   arrow using resultants, Groebner basis methods or block matrix companion
   matrices. (These methods are slow and ill-conditioned, practical only
   for small N.) The second part is to then apply resolution-increasing
   continuation. Because the number of solutions is an exponential function
   of N, spectral methods are exponentially superior to finite differences
   in this context.
   Unfortunately, (u) over right arrow (N) is all too often outside the
   domain of convergence of Newton's iteration when N is increased to
   (N+1). We show that a good option is the artificial parameter homotopy
   (H) over right arrow((u) over right arrow;tau) = (R) over right arrow
   (N+1) ((u) over right arrow) - (1 -r)(R) over right arrow (N+1)((u) over
   right arrow (N)), tau is an element of {[}0, 1]. Marching in small steps
   in tau, we proceed smoothly from the N-term to the N + 1-term
   approximations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   connected by a fixed-length linker and show that the latter arrangement
   is especially well suited for sensing of low-concentration analytes. By
   comparing FRET lasing-based sensors with conventional FRET sensors, we
   show that for optimal pump fluence and FRET-pair concentration, FRET
   lasing can lead to more than 100-fold enhancement in detection
   sensitivities of conformational changes in the Forster radius range. We
   also show that for optimal experimental conditions, donor and acceptor
   emission intensities become over 20-fold more sensitive to FRET-pair
   concentration changes in the presence of FRET lasing. We study the
   dependence of the sensitivity enhancement on the cavity Q-factor. We
   show that the highest enhancements can be obtained for Q-factors between
   10(4)-10(6), and enhancement values decrease for Q-factors above 10(6)
   due to the radiative energy transfer in the cavity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the computational assessment of the electrochemical
   stability of a series of alkyl methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids for
   their use as lithium battery electrolytes. The oxidation and reduction
   potentials of the constituent cation and anion of each ionic liquid with
   respect to a Li+/Li reference electrode were calculated using density
   functional theory following the method of thermodynamic cycles, and the
   electrochemical stability windows (ESW)s of these ionic liquids were
   obtained. The effect of varying the length of alkyl side chains of the
   methylimidazolium-based cations on the redox potentials and ESWs was
   investigated. The results show that the limits of the ESWs of these
   methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids are defined by the oxidation
   potential of the anions and the reduction potential of
   alkyl-methylimidazolium cations. Moreover, ionic liquids with {[}PF6](-)
   anion have a wider ESW. In addition to characterizing structure-function
   relationships, the accuracy of the computational approach was assessed
   through comparisons of the data against experimental measurements of
   ESWs. The potentials calculated by the thermodynamic cycle method are in
   good agreement with the experimental data while the HOMO/LUMO method
   overestimates the redox potentials. This work demonstrates that these
   approaches can provide guidance in selecting ionic liquid electrolytes
   when designing high-voltage rechargeable batteries.}},

Abstract = {{P-type macroporous gallium phosphide (GaP) photo electrodes have been
   prepared by anodic etching of an undoped, intrinsically n-type GaP(100)
   wafer and followed by drive-in doping with Zn from conformal ZnO films
   prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Specifically, 30 nm ALD ZnO
   films were coated on GaP macroporous films and then annealed at T = 650
   degrees C for various times to diffuse Zn in GaP. Under 100 mW cm(-2)
   white light illumination, the resulting Zn-doped macroporous GaP
   consistently exhibit strong cathodic photocurrent when measured in
   aqueous electrolyte containing methyl viologen. Wavelength dependent
   photoresponse measurements of the Zn-doped macroporous GaP revealed
   enhanced collection efficiency at wavelengths longer than 460 nm,
   indicating that the ALD doping step rendered the entire material p-type
   and imparted the ability to sustain a strong internal electric field
   that preferentially drove photogenerated electrons to the
   GaP/electrolyte interface. Collectively, this work presents a doping
   strategy with a potentially high degree of controllability for
   high-aspect ratio III-V materials, where the ZnO ALD film is a practical
   dopant source for Zn.}},

Title = {{Optofluidic UV-Vis spectrophotometer for online monitoring of

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{On-chip integration of optical detection units into the microfluidic
   systems for online monitoring is highly desirable for many applications
   and is also well in line with the spirit of optofluidics
   technology-fusion of optics and microfluidics for advanced
   functionalities. This paper reports the construction of a UV-Vis
   spectrophotometer on a microreactor, and demonstrates the online
   monitoring of the photocatalytic degradations of methylene blue and
   methyl orange under different flow rates and different pH values by
   detecting the intensity change and/or the peak shift. The integrated
   device consists of a TiO2-coated glass substrate, a PDMS micro-sized
   reaction chamber and two flow cells. By comparing with the results of
   commercial equipment, we have found that the measuring range and the
   sensitivity are acceptable, especially when the transmittance is in the
   range of 0.01-0.9. This integrated optofluidic device can significantly
   cut down the test time and the sample volume, and would provide a
   versatile platform for real-time characterization of photochemical
   performance. Moreover, its online monitoring capability may enable to
   access the usually hidden information in biochemical reactions like
   intermediate products, time-dependent processes and reaction kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{The strength and time dependence of the electric field in a magnetopause
   diffusion region relate to the rate of magnetic reconnection between the
   solar wind and a planetary magnetic field. Here we use similar to 150ms
   measurements of energetic electrons from the Mercury Surface, Space
   Environment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft observed
   over Mercury's dayside polar cap boundary (PCB) to infer such
   small-scale changes in magnetic topology and reconnection rates. We
   provide the first direct measurement of open magnetic topology in flux
   transfer events at Mercury, structures thought to account for a
   significant portion of the open magnetic flux transport throughout the
   magnetosphere. In addition, variations in PCB latitude likely correspond
   to intermittent bursts of similar to 0.3-3 mV/m reconnection electric
   fields separated by similar to 5-10 s, resulting in average and peak
   normalized dayside reconnection rates of similar to 0.02 and similar to
   0.2, respectively. These data demonstrate that structure in the
   magnetopause diffusion region at Mercury occurs at the smallest ion
   scales relevant to reconnection physics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a statistical study of dipolarization fronts (DFs), using
   magnetic field data from MMS and Cluster, at radial distances below 12
   R-E and 20 R-E, respectively. Assuming that the DFs have a semicircular
   cross section and are propelled by the magnetic tension force, we used
   multispacecraft observations to determine the DF velocities. About three
   quarters of the DFs propagate earthward and about one quarter tailward.
   Generally, MMS is in a more dipolar magnetic field region and observes
   larger-amplitude DFs than Cluster. The major findings obtained in this
   study are as follows: (1) At MMS similar to 57 \% of the DFs move faster
   than 150 km/s, while at Cluster only similar to 35 \%, indicating a
   variable flux transport rate inside the flow-braking region. (2) Larger
   DF velocities correspond to higher B-z values directly ahead of the DFs.
   We interpret this as a snow plow-like phenomenon, resulting from a
   higher magnetic flux pileup ahead of DFs with higher velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) decode brain activity to control
   external devices. Over the past two decades, the BMI community has grown
   tremendously and reached some impressive milestones, including the first
   human clinical trials using chronically implanted intracortical
   electrodes. It has also contributed experimental paradigms and important
   findings to basic neuroscience. In this review, we discuss neuroscience
   achievements stemming from BMI research, specifically that based upon
   upper limb prosthetic control with intracortical microelectrodes. We
   will focus on three main areas: first, we discuss progress in neural
   coding of reaches in motor cortex, describing recent results linking
   high dimensional representations of cortical activity to muscle
   activation. Next, we describe recent findings on learning and plasticity
   in motor cortex on various time scales. Finally, we discuss how
   bidirectional BMIs have led to better understanding of somatosensation
   in and related to motor cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of unique signatures of special nuclear materials is critical
   for their interdiction in a variety of nuclear security and
   nonproliferation scenarios. We report on the observation of delayed
   neutrons from fission of uranium induced in dual-particle active
   interrogation based on the B-11(d,n gamma)C-12 nuclear reaction.
   Majority of the fissions are attributed to fast fission induced by the
   incident quasi-monoenergetic neutrons. A Li-doped glass-polymer
   composite scintillation neutron detector, which displays excellent
   neutron/gamma discrimination at low energies, was used in the
   measurements, along with a recoil-based liquid scintillation detector.
   Time-dependent buildup and decay of delayed neutron emission from U-238
   were measured between the interrogating beam pulses and after the
   interrogating beam was turned off, respectively. Characteristic buildup
   and decay time profiles were compared to the common parametrization into
   six delayed neutron groups, finding a good agreement between the
   measurement and nuclear data. This method is promising for detecting
   fissile and fissionable materials in cargo scanning applications and can
   be readily integrated with transmission radiography using low-energy
   nuclear reaction sources. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   three-dimensional vorticity-velocity form of the equations governing

   form that allows for the development of an accurate upwind scheme. The
   resulting scheme employs a staggered arrangement of vorticity and
   velocity and utilizes generalized Riemann problems to determine the
   numerical flux at the cell faces. The resulting scheme is found to
   account for convection and stretching of vorticity in a stable manner
   without the need to perform any additional correction steps to control
   the divergence of vorticity. Several test cases including isolated and
   interacting vortices as well as turbulent flow are investigated to
   assess the effectiveness of the numerical method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Computational Modeling Predicts Simultaneous Targeting of Fibroblasts
   and Epithelial Cells Is Necessary for Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Pulmonary fibrosis is pathologic remodeling of lung tissue that can
   result in difficulty breathing, reduced quality of life, and a poor
   prognosis for patients. Fibrosis occurs as a result of insult to lung
   tissue, though mechanisms of this response are not well-characterized.
   The disease is driven in part by dysregulation of fibroblast
   proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblast cells, as well as
   pro-fibrotic mediator-driven epithelial cell apoptosis. The most
   well-characterized pro-fibrotic mediator associated with pulmonary
   fibrosis is TGF-beta 1. Excessive synthesis of, and sensitivity to,
   pro-fibrotic mediators as well as insufficient production of and
   sensitivity to anti-fibrotic mediators has been credited with enabling
   fibroblast accumulation. Available treatments neither halt nor reverse
   lung damage. In this study we have two aims: to identify molecular and
   cellular scale mechanisms driving fibroblast proliferation and
   differentiation as well as epithelial cell survival in the context of
   fibrosis, and to predict therapeutic targets and strategies. We combine
   in vitro studies with a multi-scale hybrid agent-based computational
   model that describes fibroblasts and epithelial cells in co-culture.
   Within this model TGF-beta 1 represents a pro-fibrotic mediator and we
   include detailed dynamics of TGF-beta 1 receptor ligand signaling in
   fibroblasts. PGE2 represents an anti-fibrotic mediator. Using
   uncertainty and sensitivity analysis we identify TGF-beta 1 synthesis,
   TGF-beta 1 activation, and PGE2 synthesis among the key mechanisms
   contributing to fibrotic outcomes. We further demonstrate that
   intervention strategies combining potential therapeutics targeting both
   fibroblast regulation and epithelial cell survival can promote healthy
   tissue repair better than individual strategies. Combinations of
   existing drugs and compounds may provide significant improvements to the
   current standard of care for pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, a two-hit
   therapeutic intervention strategy may prove necessary to halt and
   reverse disease dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{High-volume production of oxygen and nitrogen from atmospheric air is
   accomplished by cryogenic distillation. Prior to feeding to the air
   separation unit, the ambient air must be pre-purified by the removal of
   trace impurities such as CO2, H2O vapor, and light hydrocarbons (e.g.,
   CH4) to their tolerable limits of 1.0 ppm, 0.1 ppm, and to a few ppb,
   respectively. In this study, the adsorption characteristics of a
   synthetic zeolite, Li-LSX (where LSX denotes low-silica type-X zeolite
   where Si/A1=1), for the removal of trace amounts of CO2, CH4, and H2O
   vapor impurities were analyzed and compared with the conventional
   synthetic 13X zeolite that has been used for air prepurification as well
   as the ion-exchanged K-LSX and Ca-LSX zeolites. Isotherms to very low
   partial pressures (to a few ppm of 1 atm) were measured. The Toth,
   Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F), and the Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) isotherm
   models were used to correlate the low pressure experimental data and the
   TOth model was found to be the better fit especially in the low pressure
   range. The superior adsorption properties of Li-LSX for air
   prepurification are demonstrated in this work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Partial oxidation of methane on a nickel catalyst: Kinetic Monte-Carlo
   simulation study}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{128-136}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to study the partial oxidation
   of methane over a nickel catalyst. Based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism, the kinetic behavior of this reaction is analyzed and the
   results are compared with previous experiments. This system exhibits
   kinetic phase transitions between reactive regions with sustained
   reaction and poisoned regions without reaction. The fractional coverages
   of the adsorbed species and the production rates of H-2, CO, H2O, and
   CO2 are evaluated at steady state as functions of feed concentration of
   the methane and oxygen, and reaction temperature. The influence of
   lattice coordination number, diffusion, and impurities on the surface is
   also investigated. The simulation results are in good agreement with the
   experimental studies where such results are available. It is observed
   that when the lattice coordination number is increased to eight, the
   width of the reactive region increases significantly. Moreover, the
   phase transition becomes continuous. The diffusion of adsorbed O and H
   on the surface plays a measurable role in the reaction, increasing the
   maximum production rates as the diffusion rate increases. In systems
   with impurities, the production rates are greatly reduced and the phase
   transition is also changed from being abrupt to continuous. (C) 2016

Title = {{Balancing design freedom and brand recognition in the evolution of
   automotive brand styling}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Designers faced with the task of developing a new product model of a
   brand must balance several considerations. The design must be novel and
   express attributes important to the customers, while also recognizable
   as a representative of the brand. This balancing is left to the
   intuition of the designers, who must anticipate how customers will
   perceive the new design. Oftentimes, the design freedom used to meet a
   product attribute can compromise the recognition of the product as a
   member of the brand. In this paper, an experiment is conducted for
   measuring changes in ten styling attributes common to both design
   freedom and brand recognition for automotive designs from four brands,
   Audi, BMW, Cadillac, and Lexus, using customer responses to two-and
   three-dimensional vehicle designs created and presented interactively
   through a crowdsourced web application. Results show that while brand
   recognition is highly dependent on the manufacturer, two brands have
   strong negative relationship between design freedom and brand
   recognition, suggesting that these two manufacturers face a significant
   challenge when evolving their respective brand styling. This study is a
   first effort toward quantifying and predicting tradeoffs between design
   freedom and brand recognition, contributing to existing efforts that
   augment human intuition during strategic design decisions.}},

Abstract = {{A hypersonic vehicle traveling at a high speed disrupts the distribution
   of internal states in the ambient flow and introduces a nonequilibrium
   distribution in the post-shock conditions. We investigate the
   vibrational relaxation in diatom-atom collisions in the range of
   temperatures between 1000 and 10 000 K by comparing results of extensive
   fully quantum-mechanical and quasi-classical simulations with available
   experimental data. The present paper simulates the interaction of
   molecular oxygen with argon as the first step in developing the
   aerothermodynamics models based on first principles. We devise a routine
   to standardize such calculations also for other scattering systems. Our
   results demonstrate very good agreement of vibrational relaxation time,
   derived from quantum-mechanical calculations with the experimental
   measurements conducted in shock tube facilities. At the same time, the
   quasi-classical simulations fail to accurately predict rates of
   vibrationally inelastic transitions at temperatures lower than 3000 K.
   This observation and the computational cost of adopted methods suggest
   that the next generation of high fidelity thermochemical models should
   be a combination of quantum and quasi-classical approaches. Published by

Abstract = {{Many commercial heterogeneous catalysts are complex structures that
   contain metal active sites promoted by multiple additives. Developing
   fundamental understanding about the impact of these perturbations on the
   local surface reactivity is crucial for catalyst development and
   optimization. In this contribution, we develop a general framework for
   identifying underlying mechanisms that control the changes in the
   surface reactivity of a metal site (more specifically the
   adsorbate-surface interactions) upon a perturbation in the local
   environment. This framework allows us to interpret fairly complex
   interactions on metal surfaces in terms of specific, physically
   transparent contributions that can be evaluated independently of each
   other. We use Cs-promoted dissociation of O-2 as an example to
   illustrate our approach. We concluded that the Cs adsorbate affects the
   outcome of the chemical reaction through a strong alkali-induced
   electric field interacting with the static dipole moment of the
   O-2/Ag(111) system. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{We analyze the heavy ion components (A > 4 amu) in collisionally young
   solar wind plasma and show that there is a clear, stable dependence of
   temperature on mass, probably reflecting the conditions in the solar
   corona. We consider both linear and power law forms for the dependence
   and find that a simple linear fit of the form T-i/T-p = (1.35 +/-
   02)m(i)/m(p) describes the observations twice as well as the equivalent
   best fit power law of the form T-i/T-p = (m(i)/m(p))(1.07 +/- 01). Most
   importantly we find that current model predictions based on turbulent
   transport and kinetic dissipation are in agreement with observed
   nonthermal heating in intermediate collisional age plasma for m/q < 3.5,
   but are not in quantitative or qualitative agreement with the lowest
   collisional age results. These dependencies provide new constraints on
   the physics of ion heating in multispecies plasmas, along with
   predictions to be tested by the upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar
   Orbiter missions to the near-Sun environment.}},

Abstract = {{A research study was conducted (1) to examine the practices employed by
   US manufacturers to achieve productivity goals and (2) to understand
   what level of intelligent maintenance technologies and strategies are
   being incorporated into these practices. This study found that the
   effectiveness and choice of maintenance strategy were strongly
   correlated to the size of the manufacturing enterprise; there were large
   differences in adoption of advanced maintenance practices and
   diagnostics and prognostics technologies between small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs). Despite their greater adoption of maintenance
   practices and technologies, large manufacturing organizations have had
   only modest success with respect to diagnostics and prognostics and
   preventive maintenance projects. The varying degrees of success with
   respect to preventative maintenance programs highlight the opportunity
   for larger manufacturers to improve their maintenance practices and use
   of advanced prognostics and health management (PHM) technology. The
   future outlook for manufacturing PHM technology among the manufacturing
   organizations considered in this study was overwhelmingly positive; many
   manufacturing organizations have current and planned projects in this
   area. Given the current modest state of implementation and positive
   outlook for this technology, gaps, future trends, and roadmaps for
   manufacturing PHM and maintenance strategy are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Photoresponsive hydrogels were obtained by coordination of
   alginate-acrylamide hybrid gels (AlgAam) with ferric ions. The
   photochemistry of Fe(III)-alginate was used to tune the chemical
   composition, mechanical properties, and microstructure of the materials
   upon visible light irradiation. The photochemical treatment also induced
   changes in the swelling properties and transport mechanism in the gels
   due to the changes in material composition and microstructure. The
   AlgAam gels were biocompatible and could easily be dried and rehydrated
   with no change in mechanical properties. These gels showed promise as
   scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering, where the photochemical
   treatment could be used to tune the properties of the material and
   ultimately change the growth and extracellular matrix production of
   chondrogenic cells. ATDC5 cells cultured on the hydrogels showed a
   greater than 2-fold increase in the production of sulfated
   glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) in the gels irradiated for 90 min compared to
   the dark controls. Our method provides a simple photochemical tool to
   postsynthetically control and adjust the chemical and mechanical
   environment in these gels, as well as the pore microstructure and
   transport properties. By changing these properties, we could easily
   access different levels of performance of these materials as substrates

Abstract = {{Reusing polluted water through various decontamination techniques has
   appeared as one of the most practical approaches to address the global
   shortage of clean water. Rather than relying on single decontamination
   mechanism, herein we report the preparation and utilization of
   paper-based composites for multifunctional solar-driven clean water
   generation that is inspired by the multiple water purification
   approaches in biological systems. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
   sheets within such composites can efficiently remove organic
   contaminants through physical adsorption mechanism. Under solar
   irradiation, the floating rGO composites can instantly generate
   localized heating, which not only can directly generate clean water
   through distillation mechanism but also significantly enhance adsorption
   removal performance with the assistance of upward vapor flow. Such
   porous-structured paper-based composites allow for facile incorporation
   of photocatalysts to regenerate clean water out of contaminated water
   with combined adsorption, photodegradation, and interfacial
   heat-assisted distillation mechanisms. Within a homemade all-in-one
   water treatment device, the practical applicability of the composites
   for multifunctional clean water generation has been demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Nucleophilic Attack of R-lithium at Tetrahedral Silicon in
   Alkoxysilanes. An Alternate Mechanism}},

Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The currently accepted mechanism for nucleophilic attack at silicon in
   tetraalkoxysilanes, e.g. Si(OEt)(4) is suggested to involve formation of
   penta- and then hexacoordinated intermediates as supported by the
   apparent exclusive formation of R3SiOR' and R4Si from nucleophilic
   attack by RLi and RMgX. Our recent discovery of a direct route from
   biogenic silica to tetraalkoxyspirosiloxanes prompted us to revisit this
   reaction as a potential route to diverse silicon-containing species with
   single Si-C bonds as early studies demonstrate that spirosiloxanes form
   quite stable pentacoordinated alkoxysilane compounds. As anticipated,
   Si(2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolato)(2) (SP) reacts with RLi (R = Ph,
   anthracene, phenylacetylene, etc.) at -78 degrees C to form
   pentacoordinated Si, e.g. LiPhSP equilibrates with the starting reagents
   even at 3:1 ratios of PhLi:SP with no evidence for formation of
   hexacoordinated species by mass spectral, NMR and quenching studies.
   Thus, quenching with MeI or Me3SiCl allows isolation of monosubstituted
   products from RLi:SP; RSi(OR')(3) including some ring-opened oligomers.
   Comparative studies of reactions of PhLi with Si(OEt)(4) allows
   isolation of mono- and disubstituted products again even at 1:1 ratios
   of PhLi:Si(OEt)(4). However, on standing at -78 degrees C for long
   periods of time or on warming to 0 degrees C, the primary product for
   both reactions is Ph4Si even with 0.5 equivalents of PhLi. At reaction
   temperatures >= 0 degrees C the primary product is again Ph4Si. These
   results suggest that hexacoordinated intermediates are not part of the
   substitution mechanism and may suggest that the higher-substituted
   compounds arise from disproportionation processes. We also briefly
   describe the conversion of anthracenylSP and 9,9-dimethyl-fluoreneSP to
   silsesquioxanes.}},

Title = {{Stability of MOF-5 in a hydrogen gas environment containing fueling

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{9374-9382}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous,
   crystalline materials with potential application as hydrogen storage
   media in fuel cell vehicles. Unlike lower capacity adsorbents such as
   zeolites and carbons, some MOFs are expected to degrade due to attack by
   impurities present in the hydrogen fuel stream. Hydrogen intended for
   use in fuel cell vehicles should satisfy purity standards, such as those
   outlined in SAE J2719. This standard limits the concentration of certain
   species in the fuel stream based primarily on their deleterious effects
   on PEM fuel cells. However, the impact of these contaminants on MOFs is
   mostly unknown. In the present study MOF-5 is adopted as a prototypical
   moisture-sensitive hydrogen storage material. Five ``impure{''} gas
   mixtures were prepared by introducing low-to-moderate levels (i.e., up
   to similar to 200 times greater than the J2719 limit) of selected
   contaminants (NH3, H2S, HCl, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, O-2, N-2, and He) to
   pure hydrogen gas. Subsequently, MOF-5 was exposed to these mixtures
   over hundreds of adsorption/ desorption pressure-swing cycles and for
   extended periods of static exposure. The impact of exposure was assessed
   by periodically measuring the hydrogen storage capacity of an exposed
   sample. Hydrogen chloride was observed to be the only impurity that
   yielded a measurable, albeit small, decrease in hydrogen capacity; no
   change in H-2 uptake was observed for the other impurities. Post-cycling
   and post-storage MOF-5 samples were also analyzed using infrared
   spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. These analyses reveal slight changes
   in the spectra for those samples exposed to HCl and NH3 compared to the
   pristine material. These measurements suggest that MOF-5 and likely many
   other MOFs exhibit sufficient robustness to withstand prolonged exposure
   to `off-spec' hydrogen fuel. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Abstract = {{We show that electromagnetic plane waves can be fully ``teleported{''}
   through thin, nearly fully reflective sheets, assisted by a pair of
   parity-time-symmetric lossy and active sheets in front and behind the
   screen. The proposed structure is able to almost perfectly absorb
   incident waves over a wide range of frequency and incidence angles,
   while waves having a specific frequency and incidence angle are
   replicated behind the structure in synchronization with the input
   signal. It is shown that the proposed structure can be designed to
   teleport waves at any desired frequency and incidence angle.
   Furthermore, we generalize the proposed concept to the case of
   teleportation of electromagnetic waves over electrically long distances,
   enabling full absorption at one surface and the synthesis of the same
   signal at another point located electrically far away from the first
   surface. The physical principle behind this selective teleportation is
   discussed, and similarities and differences with tunneling and cloaking
   concepts based on PT symmetry are investigated. From the application
   point of view, the proposed structure works as an extremely selective
   filter, both in frequency and spatial domains.}},

Title = {{Phase field simulation of charged interface formation during
   ferroelectric switching}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{285-294}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Ferroelectric switching in thin films is a local process strongly
   influenced by the presence and spatial distribution of defects such as
   dislocations, grain boundaries and preexisting domains. Preexisting
   ferroelastic domains have been shown to inhibit 180 switching in
   (001)-oriented epitaxial Pb(Zr-0.2,Ti-0.8)O-3 (PZT) films, but
   ferroelectric switching pathways around these domains remain unclear.
   Here, phase field modeling with supporting high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy is used to investigate ferroelectric switching in
   PZT thin films around such a ferroelastic domain. We show 180 domain
   wall motion is arrested at moderate applied biases by the ferroelastic
   domain through formation of charged 90 domain walls during switching.
   This leads to an increased applied bias required for complete switching
   through the thin film. Charged 90 ferroelastic domain walls are found to
   be partially stabilized by local rotation of the polarization direction
   and significant broadening of the head-to-head wall to distribute the
   bound charge, leading to domain walls 5-6 nm in thickness compared to
   0.5-2 nm for typical 90 domain walls. Ferroelectric switching continues
   only at higher applied electric fields. This study provides a more
   complete picture of the ferroelectric switching pathway around
   ferroelastic domains than has been previously available and may explain
   the experimentally observed lower stability of written domain structures
   around preexisting ferroelastic domain structures in epitaxial
   ferroelectric thin films. (C)2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Timber and steel studs are commonly used in sandwich walls in building
   construction. In this context pultruded GFRP studs provides a better
   solution considering their lightweight and improved durability. However,
   integrating the GFRP wall studs to a steel frame structure is
   challenging, because proper connection methods are required. A sleeve
   connection was proposed and examined in this paper. Pultruded GFRP stud
   was fastened to the sleeve connector by one of three methods: ordinary
   bolt, blind bolt and adhesive bond. The connector was then fastened to
   the steel beam through ordinary bolts. Connections with conventional
   steel angles were also prepared for comparison purpose. A series of
   moment rotation tests were conducted on these stud-to-beam connections.
   In addition, two stud lengths were designed in order to study the
   connection behaviour under shear force dominant loading and moment
   dominant loading conditions. Experimental results were obtained
   including failure mode, moment rotation response, shear rotation
   response, joint rotational stiffness and capacity. It was found that the
   bonded sleeve connection outperformed all the other connections and was
   classified as a rigid and partial strength connection. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Closed-form solutions for cohesive zone modeling within the framework of
   classical lamination theory (CLT), for the popular mode I double
   cantilever beam (DCB) test, the mode II end notched flexure (ENF) test
   and mixed-mode I/II bending (MMB) test are provided in this paper.
   Zero-thickness virtual multi linear traction-separation laws are
   introduced to simulate the cohesive interactions between potential crack
   surfaces. The problem is formulated by solution forms corresponding to
   each segment of the cohesive laws and using appropriate boundary and
   continuity conditions. Detailed algorithms for each case are provided to
   clearly show the influence of the cohesive zone law on the ensuing crack
   growth. The superposition method used for mixed-mode growth in the MMB
   test for homogenous material or mid-plane symmetric laminates is proved
   both theoretically and numerically. Comprehensive parametric studies are
   performed on the crack growth response and the process zone length,
   revealing their relations to the de lamination length, cohesive
   parameters, the shape of the traction-separation laws and the mode
   mixity. With applicability to general multilayered structures, and the
   capability to incorporate arbitrary, piece wise linear cohesive
   constitutive laws, the closed-form solutions can serve as a tool to
   determine the accuracy of numerical solutions used in conjunction with
   finite element simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improved bond behavior between GFRP rebar and concrete using calcium
   sulfoaluminate}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{897-904}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) rebars have great potential for
   applications in concrete structures under corrosive environment. The
   bond behavior between GFRP rebar and concrete needs to be understood for
   such applications. This paper presents a new method for improving the
   bond behavior using Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA). CSA has an expansive
   effect when added to the concrete mixture. It is proposed to embed the
   GFRP rebar in the fresh expansive concrete which is encased by the
   surrounding hardened concrete. When the fresh expansive concrete
   gradually becomes hardened, the expansion is restrained by the
   surrounding concrete, resulting in confining pressure on the GFRP rebar.
   To validate the proposed method, experimental pull-out tests were
   conducted to quantify the improved bond behavior between GFRP rebar and
   concrete. Steel rebar pull-out test was also carried out for comparison
   purpose. The experimental results were reported including failure modes,
   ultimate pull-out capacities and bond slip responses. It was found that
   the bond behavior between GFRP rebar and surrounding concrete was
   greatly improved using the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Examining scaling patterns of networks can help understand how
   structural features relate to the behavior of the networks. Input-output
   networks consist of industries as nodes and inter-industrial exchanges
   of products as links. Previous studies consider limited measures for
   node strengths and link weights, and also ignore the impact of dataset
   choice. We consider a comprehensive set of indicators in this study that
   are important in economic analysis, and also examine the impact of
   dataset choice, by studying input-output networks in individual
   countries and the entire world. Results show that Burr, Log-Logistic,
   Log-normal, and Weibull distributions can better describe scaling
   patterns of global input-output networks. We also find that dataset
   choice has limited impacts on the observed scaling patterns. Our
   findings can help examine the quality of economic statistics, estimate
   missing data in economic statistics, and identify key nodes and links in
   input-output networks to support economic policymaking. (C) 2016

   heating. Diffraction and dilatometry indicated that composites sintered
   at lower pressure reduced the residual stress and gamma-ZrW2O8 content.
   These materials show low thermal expansion (4.83 x 10(-6) K-1) in a
   temperature range of -70 to 20 degrees C, in good agreement with the

Abstract = {{Understanding the collective growth of carbon nanotube (CNT) populations
   is key to tailoring their properties for many applications. During the
   initial stages of CNT growth by chemical vapor deposition, catalyst
   nanoparticle formation by thin-film dewetting and the subsequent CNT
   nucleation processes dictate the CNT diameter distribution, areal
   density, and alignment. Herein, we use in situ environmental
   transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) to observe the catalyst
   annealing, growth, and deactivation stages for a population of CNTs
   grown from a thin-film catalyst. Complementary in situ electron
   diffraction and TEM imaging show that, during the annealing step in
   hydrogen, reduction of the iron oxide catalyst is concomitant with
   changes in the thin-film morphology; complete dewetting and the
   formation of a population of nanoparticles is only achieved upon the
   introduction of the carbon source, acetylene. The dewetting kinetics,
   i.e., the appearance of distinct nanoparticles, exhibits a sigmoidal
   (autocatalytic) curve with 95\% of all nanoparticles appearing within 6
   s. After nanoparticles form, they either nucleate CNTs or remain
   inactive, with incubation times measured to be as small as 3.5 s. Via
   E-TEM we also directly observe the crowding and self-alignment of CNTs
   after dewetting and nucleation. In addition, in situ electron energy
   loss spectroscopy reveals that the collective rate of carbon
   accumulation decays exponentially. We conclude that the kinetics of
   catalyst formation and CNT nucleation must both be addressed in order to
   achieve uniform and high CNT density, and their transient behavior may
   be a primary cause of the well-known nonuniform density of CNT forests.}},

Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Considerable evidence suggests that many malignancies are driven by a
   cellular compartment that displays stem cell properties. Cancer
   stem-like cells (CSCs) can be identified by expression of cell surface
   markers or enzymatic activity, but these methods are limited by
   phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity of CSCs. An alternative
   phenotypic methodology based on in-vitro sphere formation has been
   developed, but it is typically labor-intensive and low-throughput. In
   this work, we present a 1,024-microchamber microfluidic platform for
   single-cell derived sphere formation. Utilizing a hydrodynamic capturing
   scheme, more than 70\% of the microchambers capture only one cell,
   allowing for monitoring of sphere formation from heterogeneous cancer
   cell populations for identification of CSCs. Single-cell derived spheres
   can be retrieved and dissociated for single-cell analysis using a custom
   96-gene panel to probe heterogeneity within the clonal CSC spheres. This
   microfluidic platform provides reliable and high-throughput sphere
   formation for CSC identification and downstream clonal analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical in
   cancer invasion, and recent work suggests that heterogeneous cancer
   populations cooperate in this process. Despite the importance of cell
   heterogeneity, conventional proteolytic assays measure average activity,
   requiring thousands of cells and providing limited information about
   heterogeneity and dynamics. Here, we developed a microfluidic platform
   that provides high-efficiency cell loading and simple valveless
   isolation, so the proteolytic activity of a small sample (10-100 cells)
   can be easily characterized. Combined with a single cell derived
   (clonal) sphere formation platform, we have successfully demonstrated
   the importance of microenvironmental cues for proteolytic activity and
   also investigated the difference between clones. Furthermore, the
   platform allows monitoring single cells at multiple time points,
   unveiling different cancer cell line dynamics in proteolytic activity.
   The presented tool facilitates single cell proteolytic analysis using
   small samples, and our findings illuminate the heterogeneous and dynamic
   nature of proteolytic activity.}},

Title = {{Aqueous Two Phase System Assisted Self-Assembled PLGA Microparticles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Here, we produce poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) based microparticles
   with varying morphologies, and temperature responsive properties
   utilizing a Pluronic F127/dextran aqueous two-phase system (ATPS)
   assisted self-assembly. The PLGA polymer, when emulsified in Pluronic
   F127/dextran ATPS, forms unique microparticle structures due to ATPS
   guided-self assembly. Depending on the PLGA concentration, the particles
   either formed a core-shell or a composite microparticle structure. The
   microparticles facilitate the simultaneous incorporation of both
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, due to their amphiphilic
   macromolecule composition. Further, due to the lower critical solution
   temperature (LCST) properties of Pluronic F127, the particles exhibit
   temperature responsiveness. The ATPS based microparticle formation
   demonstrated in this study, serves as a novel platform for PLGA/polymer
   based tunable micro/nano particle and polymersome development. The
   unique properties may be useful in applications such as theranostics,
   synthesis of complex structure particles, bioreaction/mineralization at
   the two-phase interface, and bioseparations.}},

Abstract = {{A new structure of flexible transparent electrodes is reported,
   featuring a metal mesh fully embedded and mechanically anchored in a
   flexible substrate, and a cost-effective solution-based fabrication
   strategy for this new transparent electrode. The embedded nature of the
   metal-mesh electrodes provides a series of advantages, including surface
   smoothness that is crucial for device fabrication, mechanical stability
   under high bending stress, strong adhesion to the substrate with
   excellent flexibility, and favorable resistance against moisture,
   oxygen, and chemicals. The novel fabrication process replaces
   vacuum-based metal deposition with an electrodeposition process and is
   potentially suitable for high-throughput, large-volume, and low-cost
   production. In particular, this strategy enables fabrication of a
   high-aspect-ratio (thickness to linewidth) metal mesh, substantially
   improving conductivity without considerably sacrificing transparency.
   Various prototype flexible transparent electrodes are demonstrated with
   transmittance higher than 90\% and sheet resistance below 1 ohm sq(-1),
   as well as extremely high figures of merit up to 1.5 x 10(4), which are
   among the highest reported values in recent studies. Finally using our
   embedded metal-mesh electrode, a flexible transparent thin-film heater
   is demonstrated with a low power density requirement, rapid response
   time, and a low operating voltage.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{119}},

Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Calculations of Debye-Scherrer diffraction patterns from polycrystalline
   materials have typically been done in the limit of small deviatoric
   stresses. Although these methods are well suited for experiments
   conducted near hydrostatic conditions, more robust models are required
   to diagnose the large strain anisotropies present in dynamic compression
   experiments. A method to predict Debye-Scherrer diffraction patterns for
   arbitrary strains has been presented in the Voigt (iso-strain) limit
   {[}Higginbotham, J. Appl. Phys. 115, 174906 (2014)]. Here, we present a
   method to calculate Debye-Scherrer diffraction patterns from highly
   stressed polycrystalline samples in the Reuss (iso-stress) limit. This
   analysis uses elastic constants to calculate lattice strains for all
   initial crystallite orientations, enabling elastic anisotropy and sample
   texture effects to be modeled directly. The effects of probing geometry,
   deviatoric stresses, and sample texture are demonstrated and compared to
   Voigt limit predictions. An example of shock-compressed polycrystalline
   diamond is presented to illustrate how this model can be applied and
   demonstrates the importance of including material strength when
   interpreting diffraction in dynamic compression experiments. Published

Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Bi incorporation in GaAs and GaSb has exhibited some promising
   properties allowing for potential new materials operating in the
   infrared regime. The growth of these materials has proven difficult,
   often leading to surfaces covered in droplets or nonuniformity in the
   composition. We propose a new kinetic model to capture the dynamics of
   incorporation and droplet formation in the growth of these alloys. The
   model accurately predicts trends found experimentally. Furthermore, the
   model shows that compositional nonuniformity arises due to a reduction
   in the incorporation rate of Bi caused by the nucleation of droplets.

Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{This work explores the proton/hydroxide permeability (PH+/OH-) of
   membranes that were made of synthetic extremophile-inspired
   phospholipids with systematically varied structural elements. A
   fluorescence-based permeability assay was optimized to determine the
   effects on the PH+/OH- through liposome membranes with variations in the
   following lipid attributes: transmembrane tethering, tether length, and
   the presence of isoprenoid methyl groups on one or both lipid tails. All
   permeability assays were performed in the presence of a low
   concentration of valinomycin (10 nM) to prevent buildup of a membrane
   potential without artificially increasing the measured PH+/OH-.
   Surprisingly, the presence of a transmembrane tether did not impact
   PH+/OH- at room temperature. Among tethered lipid monolayers, PH+/OH-
   increased with increasing tether length if the number of carbons in the
   untethered acyl tail was constant. Untethered lipids with two isoprenoid
   methyl tails led to lower PH+/OH- values than lipids with only one or no
   isoprenoid tails. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a strong
   positive correlation between the probability of observing water
   molecules in the hydrophobic core of these lipid membranes and their
   proton permeability. We propose that water penetration as revealed by
   molecular dynamics may provide a general strategy for predicting proton
   permeability through various lipid membranes without the need for
   experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{Malignant cells from breast cancer, as well as other common cancers such
   as prostate and melanoma, may persist in bone marrow as quiescent,
   nondividing cells that remain viable for years or even decades before
   resuming proliferation to cause recurrent disease. This phenomenon,
   referred to clinically as tumor dormancy, poses tremendous challenges to
   curing patients with breast cancer. Quiescent tumor cells resist
   chemotherapy drugs that predominantly target proliferating cells,
   limiting success of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies. We recently
   developed a 3-dimensional spheroid model of quiescent breast cancer
   cells in bone marrow for mechanistic and drug testing studies. We
   combined this model with optical imaging methods for label-free
   detection of cells, preferentially using glycolysis versus oxidative
   metabolism to investigate the metabolic state of co-culture spheroids
   with different bone marrow stromal and breast cancer cells. Through
   imaging and biochemical assays, we identified different metabolic states
   of bone marrow stromal cells that control metabolic status and
   flexibilities of co-cultured breast cancer cells. We tested metabolic
   stresses and targeted inhibition of specific metabolic pathways to
   identify approaches to preferentially eliminate quiescent breast cancer
   cells from bone marrow environments. These studies establish an
   integrated imaging approach to analyze metabolism in complex tissue
   environments to identify new metabolically targeted cancer therapies.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Ball nut assemblies (BNAs) are used in a variety of applications, e.g.,
   automotive, aerospace and manufacturing, for converting rotary motion to
   linear motion (or vice versa). In these application areas, accurate
   characterization of the dynamics of BNAs using low-order models is very
   useful for performance simulation and analyses. Existing low-order
   contact load models of BNAs are inadequate, partly because they only
   consider the axial deformations of the screw and nut. This paper
   presents a low-order load distribution model for BNAs which considers
   the axial, torsional and lateral deformations of the screw and nut. The
   screw and nut are modeled as finite element beams, while Hertzian
   Contact Theory is used to model the contact condition between the balls
   and raceways of the screw and nut. The interactions between the forces
   and displacements of the screw and nut and those at the ball-raceway
   contact points are established using transformation matrices. The
   resulting set of linear and nonlinear equations are solved iteratively
   using the Newton-Raphson method to obtain the contact load distribution
   of balls under static equilibrium. A simulation-based case study is
   presented to validate and highlight the benefits of the proposed model.
   The proposed low-order model is particularly relevant for BNAs used in
   automotive applications, where off-axis loads are common.}},

Abstract = {{EGFR is a promising cell surface target for in vivo imaging that is
   highly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common cancer
   worldwide. Peptides penetrate easily into tumors for deep imaging, and
   clear rapidly from the circulation to minimize background. We aim to
   demonstrate use of an EGFR specific peptide to detect HCC xenograft
   tumors in mice with photoacoustic imaging. Nude mice implanted with
   human HCC cells that overexpress EGFR were injected intravenously with
   Cy5.5-labeled EGFR and scrambled control peptides respectively.
   Photoacoustic images collected from 0 to 24 h. Photoacoustic signal
   peaked in tumors at 3 h post-injection. Images from 0 to 1.8 cm beneath
   the skin revealed increased target-to-background (T/B) ratio from
   tumors. The T/B ratio was significantly greater for the EGFR versus
   control peptide. Clearance of signal was observed by similar to 24 h.
   EGFR overexpression was validated with immunofluorescence and
   immunohistochemistry. A peptide specific for EGFR delivered systemically
   can detect HCC xenograft tumors in vivo with photoacoustic imaging. (C)

Abstract = {{Autocompletion has been widely adopted in many computing systems because
   it can instantly provide users with results as users type in queries.
   Since the typing task is tedious and prone to error, especially on
   mobile devices, a recent trend is to tolerate errors in autocompletion.
   Existing error-tolerant autocompletion methods build a trie to index the
   data, utilize the trie index to compute the trie nodes that are similar
   to the query, called active nodes, and identify the leaf descendants of
   active nodes as the results. However these methods have two limitations.
   First, they involve many redundant computations to identify the active
   nodes. Second, they do not support top-k queries. To address these
   problems, we propose a matching-based framework, which computes the
   answers based on matching characters between queries and data. We design
   a compact tree index to maintain active nodes in order to avoid the
   redundant computations. We devise an incremental method to efficiently
   answer top-k queries. Experimental results on real datasets show that
   our method outperforms state-ofthe-art approaches by 1-2 orders of
   magnitude.}},

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Radiofrequency-spoiled steady-state sequences offer rapid data
   acquisition with T1- or T2{*}-weighting. The spoiler gradients in these
   sequences must be large enough to suppress ghost artifacts, and are
   chosen empirically. However, certain factors such as the need to
   minimize gradient first moments or acoustic noise can limit the spoiler
   size and, hence, the ability to suppress ghosts. We present an
   acquisition and preprocessing strategy for improved spoiling efficiency
   in conventional and echo-shifted dynamic radiofrequency-spoiled 3D
   imaging.
   Theory and Methods: By requiring each time-frame in a dynamic imaging
   sequence to contain a particular (restricted) number of total
   radiofrequency shots, the ghost signal can be made to alternate in sign
   every other frame. The ghost is then suppressed by Fourier transforming
   along the temporal dimension, and removing the Nyquist frequency in
   preprocessing (similar to UNFOLD). The method works for both Cartesian
   and non-Cartesian imaging.
   Results: We demonstrate improved ghost suppression with the proposed
   approach, for both conventional and echo-shifted spoiled gradient echo
   imaging in stationary phantoms and in vivo. Cartesian echo-shifted
   spoiled gradient echo imaging produces two ghosts shifted in opposite
   directions, both of which are suppressed with our method.
   Conclusion: For a given spoiler gradient area, the proposed approach
   substantially suppresses the ghost signal in both conventional and
   echo-shifted dynamic radiofrequency-spoiled imaging. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare dancers' balance regulation at the whole-body
   level under increased rotational demands during the turn phase of turns
   with and without large center-of-mass (CM) translation (i.e., pique vs
   pirouette turns). METHODS: Ten dancers performed single and double pique
   and pirouette turns while kinematics and reaction forces were measured.
   During the turn phase, initial CM velocity, vertical alignment of the
   CM, mean braking force, and moment about the CM were compared across
   turn conditions using within-subject (Cliff's analog of
   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, adjusted for multiple comparisons) and group
   (sign test) statistical methods. RESULTS: For both single and double
   turns, the pique turn phase was initiated with a significantly larger CM
   velocity towards the base of support than during the pirouette,
   consistent with the mechanical objectives of the turn. Additionally,
   during the turn phases of both single and double turns, the CM during
   the pirouette turns was more vertically aligned with the base of support
   than it was during the pique turns. As rotational demand increased in
   both turns, the reaction forces were regulated in two ways to minimize
   the CM horizontal velocity as it approached vertical alignment with the
   base of support. By controlling the braking force and moment applied
   about the CM early during the turn phase, the potential for the CM to
   remain vertically aligned with the base of support increased. These
   findings can assist development of training tools geared towards balance
   regulation during pirouette and pique turns.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas slow solar wind is known to be highly structured, the fast
   (coronal hole origin) wind is usually considered to be homogeneous.
   Using measurements from Helios 1 + 2, ACE, Wind, and Ulysses, structure
   in the coronal hole origin solar wind is examined from 0.3AU to 2.3AU.
   Care is taken to collect and analyze intervals of ``unperturbed coronal
   hole plasma.{''} In these intervals, solar wind structure is seen in the
   proton number density, proton temperature, proton specific entropy,
   magnetic field strength, magnetic field to density ratio, electron heat
   flux, helium abundance, heavy-ion charge-state ratios, and Alfvenicity.
   Typical structure amplitudes are factors of 2, far from homogeneous.
   Variations are also seen in the solar wind radial velocity. Using
   estimates of the motion of the solar wind origin footpoint on the Sun
   for the various spacecraft, the satellite time series measurements are
   converted to distance along the photosphere. Typical variation scale
   lengths for the solar wind structure are several variations per
   supergranule. The structure amplitude and structure scale sizes do not
   evolve with distance fromthe Sun from 0.3 to 2.3AU. An argument is
   quantified that these variations are the scale expected for solar wind
   production in open magnetic flux funnels in coronal holes. Additionally,
   a population of magnetic field foldings (switchbacks, reversals) in the
   coronal hole plasma is examined: this population evolves with distance
   from the Sun such that the magnetic field is mostly Parker spiral
   aligned at 0.3AU and becomes more misaligned with distance outward.}},

Abstract = {{For most Cassini passes through the inner magnetosphere of Saturn, the
   hot electron population (> few hundred eVs) largely disappears inside of
   some cutoff L shell. Anode-and-actuation-angle averages of hot electron
   fluxes observed by the Cassini Electron Spectrometer are binned into 0.1
   R-s bins in dipole L to explore the properties of this cutoff distance.
   The cutoff L shell is quite variable from pass to pass (on timescales as
   short as 10-20 h). At energies of 5797 eV, 2054 eV, and 728 eV, 90\% of
   the inner boundary values lie between L similar to 4.7 and 8.4, with a
   median near L = 6.2, consistent with the range of L values over which
   discrete interchange injections have been observed, thus strengthening
   the case that the interchange process is responsible for delivering the
   bulk of the hot electrons seen in the inner magnetosphere. The
   occurrence distribution of the inner boundary is more sharply peaked on
   the nightside than at other local times. There is no apparent dependence
   of the depth of penetration on large-scale solar wind properties. It
   appears likely that internal processes (magnetic stress on mass-loaded
   flux tubes) are dominating the injection of hot electrons into the inner

Abstract = {{The outer proton radiation belt (OPRB) and outer electron radiation belt
   (OERB) at geosynchronous orbit are investigated using a reanalysis of
   the LANL CPA (Charged Particle Analyzer) 8-satellite 2-solar cycle
   energetic particle data set from 1976 to 1995. Statistics of the OPRB
   and the OERB are calculated, including local time and solar cycle
   trends. The number density of the OPRB is about 10 times higher than the
   OERB, but the 1MeV proton flux is about 1000 times less than the 1MeV
   electron flux because the proton energy spectrum is softer than the
   electron spectrum. Using a collection of 94 high-speed stream-driven
   storms in 1976-1995, the storm time evolutions of the OPRB and OERB are
   studied via superposed epoch analysis. The evolution of the OERB shows
   the familiar sequence (1) prestorm decay of density and flux, (2)
   early-stormdropout of density and flux, (3) sudden recovery of density,
   and (4) steady storm time heating to high fluxes. The evolution of the
   OPRB shows a sudden enhancement of density and flux early in the storm.
   The absence of a proton dropout when there is an electron dropout is
   noted. The sudden recovery of the density of the OERB and the sudden
   density enhancement of the OPRB are both associated with the occurrence
   of a substorm during the early stage of the storm when the superdense
   plasma sheet produces a ``strong stretching phase{''} of the storm.
   These storm time substorms are seen to inject electrons to 1MeV and
   protons to beyond 1MeV into geosynchronous orbit, directly producing a
   suddenly enhanced radiation belt population.}},

Abstract = {{Results from a recent graduate student survey found unsurprisingly that
   Solar and Space Physics (S\&SP) PhD graduate students almost all aspire
   to have research careers in Solar and Space Physics. This study reports
   on the research career persistence over the first decade of the new
   millennium for S\&SP PhDs. We used publication of science citation
   indexed articles as the indicator for persistence in a research career.
   We found that nearly two thirds (64\%) of PhDs who graduated between
   2001 and 2009 published refereed papers in 2012 or 2013, while 17\% of
   PhDs never published another paper beyond the year they received their
   PhD. The remaining 19\% of PhDs stopped publishing within three years of
   receiving their PhD. We found no gender difference between research
   persistence. We also found that though there is statistically no
   difference on persistence of publishing research between graduates of
   the largest programs compared to all other programs, there are
   significant differences between individual programs. This study
   indicates that a majority of S\& SP PhDs find research careers but that
   a significant fraction pursue careers where publishing in science
   citation indexed journals is not required. Graduate programs, advisors,
   and potential graduate students can use these data for career planning
   and developing mentoring programs that meet the career outcomes of all
   of their graduates.}},

Pages = {{270-281}},

Abstract = {{The Arctic temperature response to emissions of aerosols-specifically
   black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and sulfate-depends on both the
   sector and the region where these emissions originate. Thus, the net
   Arctic temperature response to global aerosol emissions reductions will
   depend strongly on the blend of emissions sources being targeted. We use
   recently published equilibrium Arctic temperature response factors for
   BC, OC, and sulfate to estimate the range of present-day and future
   Arctic temperature changes from seven different aerosol emissions
   scenarios. Globally, Arctic temperature changes calculated from all of
   these emissions scenarios indicate that present-day emissions from the
   domestic and transportation sectors generate the majority of present-day
   Arctic warming from BC. However, in all of these scenarios, this warming
   is more than offset by cooling resulting from SO2 emissions from the
   energy sector. Thus, long-term climate mitigation strategies that are
   focused on reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the energy
   sector could generate short-term, aerosol-induced Arctic warming. A
   properly phased approach that targets BC-rich emissions from the
   transportation sector as well as the domestic sectors in key
   regions-while simultaneously working toward longer-term goals of CO2
   mitigation-could potentially avoid some amount of short-term Arctic
   warming.}},

Abstract = {{The two-bias method typically used to calculate the mobility-lifetime

   induced signals from cathode-side events to measure the mu tau. This
   method assumes an ideal weighting potential (exactly zero through the
   bulk and a rapid rise to unity at the anode). When a non-ideal weighting
   potential (e.g., from a pixelated detector) is used, the mu tau is
   systematically overestimated. In this work, we characterize this
   overestimation and present a simple correction factor k that can be
   applied to pixelated electrode configurations. It was found that the
   correction factor is only dependent on the pixel-pitch to detector
   thickness ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces Input Responsive Approximation ( IRA), an approach
   that uses a canary input - a small program input carefully constructed
   to capture the intrinsic properties of the original input - to
   automatically control how program approximation is applied on an
   input-by-input basis. Motivating this approach is the observation that
   many of the prior techniques focusing on choosing how to approximate
   arrive at conservative decisions by discounting substantial differences
   between inputs when applying approximation. The main challenges in
   overcoming this limitation lie in making the choice of how to
   approximate both effectively (e.g., the fastest approximation that meets
   a particular accuracy target) and rapidly for every input. With IRA,
   each time the approximate program is run, a canary input is constructed
   and used dynamically to quickly test a spectrum of approximation
   alternatives. Based on these runtime tests, the approximation that best
   fits the desired accuracy constraints is selected and applied to the
   full input to produce an approximate result. We use IRA to select and
   parameterize mixes of four approximation techniques from the literature
   for a range of 13 image processing, machine learning, and data mining
   applications. Our results demonstrate that IRA significantly outperforms
   prior approaches, delivering an average of 10.2x speedup over exact
   execution while minimizing accuracy losses in program outputs.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a Stackelberg game in a network where a leader minimizes the
   cost of interdicting arcs and a follower seeks the shortest distance
   between given origin and destination nodes under uncertain arc traveling
   cost. In particular, we consider a risk-averse leader, who aims to keep
   high probability that the follower's traveling distance is longer than a
   given threshold, interpreted by a chance constraint. Under the
   assumption of a wait-and-see follower-i.e., the follower selects a

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method to synthesize driving cycles, where
   not only the velocity is considered but the road slope information of
   the real-world measured driving cycle as well. Driven by strict emission
   regulations and tight fuel targets, hybrid or electric vehicle
   manufacturers aim to develop new and more energy-and cost-efficient
   powertrains. To enable and facilitate this development, short, yet
   realistic, driving cycles need to be synthesized. The developed driving
   cycle should give a good representation of measured driving cycles in
   terms of velocity, slope, acceleration, and so on. Current methods use
   only velocity and acceleration and assume a zero road slope. The heavier
   the vehicle is, the more important the road slope becomes in powertrain
   prototyping (as with component sizing or control design); hence,
   neglecting it leads to unrealistic or limited designs. To include the
   slope, we extend existing methods and propose an approach based on
   multidimensional Markov chains. The validation of the synthesized
   driving cycle is based on a statistical analysis (as the average
   acceleration or maximum velocity) and a frequency analysis. This new
   method demonstrates the ability of capturing the measured road slope
   information in the synthesized driving cycle. Furthermore, results show
   that the proposed method outperforms current methods in terms of
   accuracy and speed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the characteristics of the series-series and

   for electric vehicle ( EV) wireless chargers. Both the well-tuned and
   mistuned topologies for the two compensation methods are analyzed in
   detail. The mistuning considered here is mainly caused by the variations
   of the relative position between the primary and secondary sides. The
   output power displacements caused by mistuning are compared for both
   compensation topologies, as well as the impacts of the load variations
   on the performances of the mistuned topologies. The voltage and current
   stresses on components are also studied. The comparative result shows
   that the double-sided LCC compensation topology is less sensitive to
   mistuning. A double-sided LCC-compensated EV wireless charger system
   with up to 7.7-kW output power is built to verify the analysis results.
   A peak efficiency of 96\% from dc power source to battery load is

Abstract = {{This paper presents research in cognitive vehicle energy management for
   low-cost hybrid electric vehicle ( HEV) power systems for small
   vehicles, such as all-terrain vehicles ( ATVs). The power system
   consists of a small engine, a lead-acid battery, and an ultracapacitor.
   For simplicity of implementation and low hardware cost, engine control
   is restricted to two states, i. e., ON and OFF, and vehicle speed
   control is restricted to three discrete levels, namely, high, medium,
   and low. The authors developed advanced algorithms for modeling and
   optimizing vehicle energy flow, machine learning of optimal control
   settings generated by dynamic programmling on real-world drive cycles,
   and an intelligent energy controller designed for online energy control
   based on knowledge about the driving mission and knowledge obtained
   through machine learning. The intelligent vehicle energy controller
   cognitive intelligent power management ( CIPM) has been implemented and
   evaluated in a simulated vehicle model and in an ATV, i. e., Polaris
   Ranger EV, which was converted to an HEV. Experimental results show that
   the intelligent energy controller CIPM can lead to a significant
   improvement in fuel economy compared with the existing conventional
   vehicle controllers in an ATV.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer ( WPT) technology as a convenient and reliable
   charging method, its electromagnetic field ( EMF) radiation, and its
   compliance with human electromagnetic exposure limits have recently been
   studied. Different from the current research, which validates the EMF

   loosely coupled transformer design method to minimize the EMF in the
   concerned area. The energy storage in the primary and secondary coils is
   studied for all popular compensation topologies in recently reported
   research. The coil of the loosely coupled transformer is designed with
   the S-S compensation topology as an example. The EMF radiation level is
   optimized to below the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
   Radiation Protection guideline in the concerned area. A 3.3-kWWPT system
   for electric vehicle wireless charging with an LCC-LCC compensation
   topology is designed with detailed process and experiment results,
   verifying that the EMF radiation is controlled as designed. The
   numerical analysis of human exposure is performed with the
   finite-element method, and the results show compliance as expected.}},

Abstract = {{Planetary gears (PGs) have been used in power-split hybrid and plug-in

   Chevrolet Volt is a well-known production vehicle using such

   simulated Volt Gen 2. The key technologies enabling such large-scale

Abstract = {{In this paper, approximate SRAMs are explored in the context of
   error-tolerant applications, in which energy is saved at the cost of the
   occurrence of read/write errors (i.e., signal quality degradation). This
   analysis investigates variation-resilient techniques that enable dynamic
   management of the energy-quality tradeoff down to the bit level. In
   these techniques, the different impacts of errors on quality at
   different bit positions are explicitly considered as key enabler of
   energy savings that are far larger than a simple voltage scaling. The
   analysis is based on the experimental results in an energy-quality
   scalable 28-nm SRAM and the extrapolation to a wide range of conditions
   through the models that combine the individual energy contributions.
   Results show that the joint adoption of multiple bit-level techniques
   provides substantially larger energy gains than individual techniques.
   Compared with the simple voltage scaling at isoquality, the joint
   adoption of these techniques can provide more than 2x energy reduction
   at negligible area penalty. Energy savings turn out to be highly
   sensitive to the choice of joint techniques, thus showing the crucial
   importance of dynamic energy-quality management in approximate SRAMs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop, implement and test the effect of a handoff tool
   for orthopaedic trauma residents that reduces adverse events associated
   with the omission of critical information and the transfer of erroneous
   information.
   Design: Components of this project included a literature review,
   resident surveys and observations, checklist development and refinement,
   implementation and evaluation of impact on adverse events through a
   chart review of a prospective cohort compared with a historical control
   group.
   Setting: Large teaching hospital.
   Participants: Findings of a literature review were presented to
   orthopaedic residents, epidemiologists, orthopaedic surgeons and patient
   safety experts in face-to-face meetings, during which we developed and
   refined the contents of a resident handoff tool. The tool was tested in
   an orthopaedic trauma service and its impact on adverse events was
   evaluated through a chart review. The handoff tool was developed and
   refined during the face-to-face meetings and a pilot implementation.
   Adverse event data were collected on 127 patients (n = 67 baseline
   period; n = 60 test period).
   Intervention: A handoff tool for use by orthopaedic residents.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Adverse events in patients handed off by
   orthopaedic trauma residents.
   Results: After controlling for age, gender and comorbidities, testing
   resulted in fewer events per person (25-27\% reduction; P < 0.10).
   Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that our resident handoff
   tool may contribute to a decrease in adverse events in orthopaedic
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Russian forest resources are important for global carbon cycling. In
   contrast to traditional analyses that focus on the harvest and direct
   use of Russian timber resources (a.k.a. production-based accounting),
   this study investigates how the consumption of nations drives Russian
   timber harvest (a.k.a. consumption-based accounting or the Russian
   timber footprint). China is the biggest direct importer and final
   consumer of Russian timber. The United States, Japan, and major European
   countries directly import relatively small amounts of Russian timber,
   but serve to drive large amounts of Russian timber harvest through their
   final consumption. Through structural path analysis, individual supply
   chain paths are delineated to show linkages between Russian timber
   harvest and the final consumption of nations. Findings of this study
   inform consumption-side measures for Russian forest conservation, for
   example, taking shared responsibility and improving the production
   efficiency of key sectors in consuming nations.}},

   Using Human Players}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},

Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We compare the performance of human players against that of the
   efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm for an NP-complete
   powertrain design and control problem. Specifically, we cast this
   optimization problem as an online competition and received 2391 game
   plays by 124 anonymous players during the first month from launch. We
   found that while only a small portion of human players can outperform
   the algorithm in the long term, players tend to formulate good
   heuristics early on that can be used to constrain the solution space.
   Such constraining of the search enhances algorithm efficiency, even for
   different game settings. These findings indicate that human-assisted
   computational searches are promising in solving comprehensible yet
   computationally hard optimal design and control problems, when human
   players can outperform the algorithm in a short term.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Using simulations, we postulate and show that heterocatalysis on
   large-bandgap semiconductors can be controlled by substrate phonons,
   i.e., phonocatalysis. With ab initio calculations, including molecular
   dynamic simulations, the chemisorbed dissociation of XeF6 on h-BN
   surface leads to formation of XeF4 and two surface F/h-BN bonds. The
   reaction pathway and energies are evaluated, and the sorption and
   reaction emitted/absorbed phonons are identified through spectral
   analysis of the surface atomic motion. Due to large bandgap, the atomic
   vibration (phonon) energy transfer channels dominate and among them is
   the match between the F/h-BN covalent bond stretching and the optical
   phonons. We show that the chemisorbed dissociation (the pathway
   activation ascent) requires absorption of large-energy optical phonons.
   Then using progressively heavier isotopes of B and N atoms, we show that
   limiting these high-energy optical phonons inhibits the chemisorbed
   dissociation, i.e., controllable phonocatalysis. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Title = {{Simultaneous Optimization of Topology and Component Sizes for Double
   Planetary Gear Hybrid Powertrains}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid powertrain technologies are successful in the passenger car
   market and have been actively developed in recent years. Optimal
   topology selection, component sizing, and controls are required for
   competitive hybrid vehicles, as multiple goals must be considered
   simultaneously: fuel efficiency, emissions, performance, and cost. Most
   of the previous studies explored these three design dimensions
   separately. In this paper, two novel frameworks combining these three
   design dimensions together are presented and compared. One approach is
   nested optimization which searches through the whole design space
   exhaustively. The second approach is called enhanced iterative
   optimization, which executes the topology optimization and component
   sizing alternately. A case study shows that the later method can
   converge to the global optimal design generated from the nested
   optimization, and is much more computationally efficient. In addition,
   we also address a known issue of optimal designs: their sensitivity to
   parameters, such as varying vehicle weight, which is a concern
   especially for the design of hybrid buses. Therefore, the iterative
   optimization process is applied to design a robust multi-mode hybrid
   electric bus under different loading scenarios as the final design
   challenge of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymer microspheres have emerged as cell carriers for the
   regeneration and repair of irregularly shaped tissue defects due to
   their injectability, controllable biodegradability and capacity for drug
   incorporation and release. Notably, recent advances in nanotechnology
   allowed the manipulation of the physical and chemical properties of the
   microspheres at the nanoscale, creating nanostructured microspheres
   mimicking the composition and/or structure of natural extracellular
   matrix. These nanostructured microspheres, including nanocomposite
   microspheres and nanofibrous microspheres, have been employed as cell
   carriers for tissue regeneration. They enhance cell attachment and
   proliferation, promote positive cell- carrier interactions and
   facilitate stem cell differentiation for target tissue regeneration.
   This review highlights the recent advances in nanostructured
   microspheres that are employed as injectable, biomimetic and cell-

Abstract = {{Plasmonic metal nanoparticles can efficiently convert the energy of
   visible photons into the energy of hot charge carriers within the
   nanoparticles. These energetic charge carriers can transfer to molecules
   or semiconductors, chemically attached to the nanoparticles, where they
   can induce photochemical transformations. Classical models of
   photoinduced charge excitation and transfer in metals suggest that the
   majority of the energetic charge carriers rapidly decay within the metal
   nanostructure before they are transferred into the neighboring molecule
   or semiconductor, and therefore, the efficiency of charge transfer is
   low. Herein, we present experimental evidence that calls into question
   this conventional picture. We demonstrate a system where the presence of
   a molecule, adsorbed on the surface of a plasmonic nanoparticle,
   significantly changes the flow of charge within the excited plasmonic
   system. The nanoparticle adsorbate system experiences high rates of
   direct, resonant flow of charge from the nanoparticle to the molecule,
   bypassing the conventional charge excitation and thermalization process
   taking place in the nanoparticle. This picture of charge transfer
   suggests that the yield of extracted hot electrons (or holes) from
   plasmonic nanoparticles can be significantly higher than the yields
   expected based on conventional models. We discuss a conceptual physical
   framework that allows us to explain our experimental observations. This
   analysis points us in a direction toward molecular control of the charge
   transfer process using interface and local field engineering strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Beam steering devices represent an essential part of an advanced optics
   toolbox and are needed in a spectrum of technologies ranging from
   astronomy and agriculture to biosensing and networked vehicles.
   Diffraction gratings with strain-tunable periodicity simplify beam
   steering and can serve as a foundation for light/laser radar
   (LIDAR/LADAR) components of robotic systems. However, the mechanical
   properties of traditional materials severely limit the beam steering
   angle and cycle life. The large strain applied to gratings can severely
   impair the device performance both in respect of longevity and
   diffraction pattern fidelity. Here, we show that this problem can be
   resolved using micromanufactured kirigami patterns from thin film
   nanocomposites based on high-performance stiff plastics, metals, and
   carbon nanotubes, etc. The kirigami pattern of microscale slits reduces
   the stochastic concentration of strain in stiff nanocompo sites
   including those made by layer-by-layer assembly (LBL). The slit
   patterning affords reduction of strain by 2 orders of magnitude for
   stretching deformation and consequently enables reconfigurable optical
   gratings with over a 100\% range of period tunability. Elasticity of the
   stiff nanocomposites and plastics makes possible cyclic
   reconfigurability of the grating with variable time constant that can
   also be referred to as 4D kirigami. High-contrast, sophisticated
   diffraction patterns with as high as fifth diffraction order can be
   obtained. The angular range of beam steering can be as large as 6.5
   degrees for a 635 nm laser beam compared to similar to 1 degrees in
   surface-grooved elastomer gratings and similar to 0.02 degrees in MEMS
   gratings. The versatility of the kirigami patterns, the diversity of the
   available nano composite materials, and their advantageous mechanical
   properties of the foundational materials open the path for engineering
   of reconfigurable optical elements in LIDARs essential for autonomous
   vehicles and other optical devices with spectral range determined by the
   kirigami periodicity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the stability and criticality analysis of integer
   linear programs with respect to perturbations in stochastic data given
   asMarkov chains. These perturbations affect the initial distribution,
   the transition matrix, or the stationary distribution ofMarkov chains.
   Stability analysis is concerned with obtaining the set of all
   perturbations for which a solution remains optimal. This paper gives
   expressions for stability regions for perturbations in the initial
   distribution, the transition matrix, the stationary distribution, and
   the product of elements of the transition matrix and the stationary
   distribution. Furthermore, criticality measures that describe the
   sensitivity of the objective function with respect to an element of the
   problem data are derived. Stability regions that preserve the
   stochasticity of the problem data are given. Finally, stability regions
   for perturbations of elements of the transition matrix, given that the
   problem is not linear in the initial distribution or the transition
   matrix, are obtained using a small perturbation analysis. The results
   are applied to sensor placement problems and numerical examples are
   given.}},

Abstract = {{The primary problem in the finite element analysis of polyurethane
   jounce bumpers, bumper stops, or similar structures is the
   identification of a mathematical model for the constitutive material.
   The densities of the exterior polyurethane area and the interior
   polyurethane area usually differ owing to the manufacturing process.
   This difference results in inaccuracy when predicting the mechanical
   behavior of the jounce bumper and bumper stop if a homogeneous material
   model is used. Thus, this work proposes a stratification method for
   finite element analysis of a polyurethane jounce bumper. The
   polyurethane structure was divided into three regions (the skin layer',
   the transition layer', and the core area') with different material
   properties. A foam model was utilized as the constitutive relationship.
   The foam model coefficients of the core area were obtained by a
   curve-fitting process using uniaxial compression test results.
   Subsequently, the material properties of the skin layer and the
   transition layer were also obtained. The finite element analysis results
   show that the proposed stratification strategy improves the prediction
   of the deformed shapes of the polyurethane jounce bumper. Furthermore,
   the calculated load-displacement curve is reliable for small to medium
   strains (0-0.4). Therefore, the proposed stratification method can be
   applied to enhance the reliability of jounce bumper simulations and to
   simplify the design process.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress from the increase of reactive oxygen species in cells
   is a common part of the normal aging process and is accelerated in
   patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we report the evaluation
   of three benzothiazole amphiphiles (BAMs) that exhibit improved
   biocompatibility without loss of biological activity against
   amyloid-beta induced cell damage compared to a previously reported
   hexa(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline (BTA-EG(6)).
   The reduced toxicity of these BAM agents compared to BTA-EG(6)
   corresponded with their reduced propensity to induce membrane lysis. In
   addition, all of the new BAMs were capable of protecting differentiated
   SH-SYSY neuroblastoma cells from toxicity and concomitant oxidative
   stress induced by AD-related aggregated A beta (1-42) peptides. Binding
   and microscopy studies support that these BAM agents target A beta and
   inhibit the interactions of catalase with A beta in cells, which, in
   turn, can account for an observed inhibition of A beta-induced increases
   in hydrogen peroxide in cells treated with these compounds. These
   results support that this family of benzothiazole amphiphiles may have
   therapeutic potential for treating cellular damage associated with AD
   and other A beta-related neurologic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and diabetic
   nephropathy (DN) are two common microvascular complications of type 1
   and type 2 diabetes mellitus that are associated with a high degree of
   morbidity. In this study, using a variety of systems biology approaches,
   our aim was to identify common and distinct mechanisms underlying the
   pathogenesis of these two complications.
   Methods Our previously published transcriptomic datasets of peripheral
   nerve and kidney tissue, derived from murine models of type 1 diabetes
   (streptozotocin-injected mice) and type 2 diabetes (BKS-db/db mice) and
   their respective controls, were collected and processed using a unified
   analysis pipeline so that comparisons could be made. In addition to
   looking at genes and pathways dysregulated in individual datasets,
   pairwise comparisons across diabetes type and tissue type were performed
   at both gene and transcriptional network levels to complete our proposed
   objective.
   Results Gene-level analysis identified exceptionally high levels of
   concordant gene expression in DN (94\% of 2,433 genes), but not in DPN
   (54\% of 1,558 genes), between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
   These results suggest that common pathogenic mechanisms exist in DN
   across diabetes type, while in DPN the mechanisms are more distinct.
   When these dysregulated genes were examined at the transcriptional
   network level, we found that the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer
   and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway was significantly
   dysregulated in both complications, irrespective of diabetes type.
   Conclusions/interpretation Using a systems biology approach, our
   findings suggest that common pathogenic mechanisms exist in DN across
   diabetes type, while in DPN the mechanisms are more distinct. We also
   found that JAK-STAT signalling is commonly dysregulated among all
   datasets. Using such approaches, further investigation is warranted to
   determine whether the same changes are observed in patients with
   diabetic complications.}},

Abstract = {{In many large engineering design problems, it is not computationally
   feasible or realistic to store Jacobians or Hessians explicitly.
   Matrix-free implementations of standard optimization
   methods-implementations that do not explicitly form Jacobians and
   Hessians, and possibly use quasi-Newton approximations-circumvent those
   restrictions, but such implementations are virtually non-existent. We
   develop a matrix-free augmented-Lagrangian algorithm for nonconvex
   problems with both equality and inequality constraints. Our
   implementation is developed in the Python language, is available as an
   open-source package, and allows for approximating Hessian and Jacobian
   information.We show that our approach solves problems from the CUTEr and
   COPS test sets in a comparable number of iterations to state-of-the-art
   solvers. We report numerical results on a structural design problem that
   is typical in aircraft wing design optimization. The matrix-free
   approach makes solving problems with thousands of design variables and
   constraints tractable, even when function and gradient evaluations are
   costly.}},

Abstract = {{Vasculogenesis is the process of de novo blood vessel formation observed
   primarily during embryonic development. Emerging evidence suggest that
   postnatal mesenchymal stem cells are capable of recapitulating
   vasculogenesis when these cells are engaged in tissue regeneration.
   However, the mechanisms underlining the vasculogenic differentiation of
   mesenchymal stem cells remain unclear. Here, we used stem cells from
   human permanent teeth (dental pulp stem cells {[}DPSC]) or deciduous
   teeth (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth {[}SHED]) as
   models of postnatal primary human mesenchymal stem cells to understand
   mechanisms regulating their vasculogenic fate. GFP-tagged mesenchymal
   stem cells seeded in human tooth slice/ scaffolds and transplanted into
   immunodeficient mice differentiate into human blood vessels that
   anastomize with the mouse vasculature. In vitro, vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF) induced the vasculogenic differentiation of DPSC
   and SHED via potent activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Further,
   activation of Wnt signaling is sufficient to induce the vasculogenic
   differentiation of postnatal mesenchymal stem cells, while Wnt
   inhibition blocked this process. Notably, beta-catenin-silenced DPSC no
   longer differentiate into endothelial cells in vitro, and showed
   impaired vasculogenesis in vivo. Collectively, these data demonstrate
   that VEGF signaling through the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
   defines the vasculogenic fate of postnatal mesenchymal stem cells.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{77-87}},

Abstract = {{We report the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear bands in wormlike micelle
   solutions as generated in the near-wall region of rectangular channel
   flow. In this system, a very thin (<2 mu m) high shear rate band is
   generated, stacked along the gradient axis of the channel flow. By means
   of confocal microscopy and particle image velocimetry, we observe the
   effect of this thin band on both the steady-state flow profile and the
   transient variation in the flow-direction velocity, which is found to be
   non-uniform in the vorticity direction. The steady-state velocity
   profiles deviate from a parabolic shape above an applied wall shear rate
   of 6 s(-1) (Wi = 0.8), in good correspondence with the measured
   rheology. Kinetically, the deviation from parabolic flow presents as the
   development of a thin, near-wall band flowing at a high shear rate.. The
   band dynamics along the vorticity (neutral) axis of the flow are
   observed at distances from 2 to 10 pm from the wall. At the smallest
   near-wall position of 2 mu m, space-time plots reveal four distinct
   stages in the variation of the flow-direction velocity with time and
   with position along the vorticity axis. First, the flow accelerates at
   all points along the vorticity axis to about one-half of the final,
   steady-state velocity at that position in the gap. Second, a
   deceleration - again at all points in the flow-vorticity plane -
   abruptly slows down the fluid motion at this near-wall region. The total
   change in velocity resulting from the deceleration is about one-half
   that of the previous acceleration. Third, the flow partitions into
   multiple strips along the vorticity direction; these strips have
   non-uniform flow-direction velocity. The width of these strips is
   dependent on the wall shear rate; their width is similar to 100 mu m for
   flow with a wall shear rate of 8.4 Finally, all the fast strips combine
   to form a single homogeneous flow with a fast velocity at 2 mu m from
   the wall. This velocity is similar to 50 times that expected for
   unbanded flow with the same flow rate. We discuss these shear band
   spatiotemporal dynamics in the context of transient vorticity
   structuring that occurs at applied wall shear rates within the stress
   plateau region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quasi-optimal feedback control for an isolated intersection under

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{How to manage signalized intersections under oversaturated conditions is
   a long-standing problem in traffic science and engineering. However,
   although research works in this area date back to 1960s, an on-line
   control strategy with theoretically bounded performance is missing, even
   for the control of an isolated intersection under oversaturation. This
   paper makes one step further in this area by proposing a QUEUE-based
   quasi-optimal feedback control (abbreviated as QUEUE) strategy for an
   isolated oversaturated intersection. The QUEUE strategy is intuitive,
   simple, and proved to match the off-line optimum in the case of constant
   demand. More importantly, the bounds of sub-optimality of the QUEUE
   strategy can be specified quantitatively in general piece-wise constant
   demand cases. To better deal with the maximum queue constraints, the
   oversaturation period is divided into the queuing period and the
   dissipation period with two different objectives. In the queuing period,
   the primary objective is to keep the queue length within the maximum
   value; but for the dissipation period, the primary objective is to
   eliminate all queues at the earliest time. Interestingly, we found that
   both control objectives can be realized with the same QUEUE strategy.
   Numerical examples show that the QUEUE strategy approximates the
   off-line optimum very well. The average sub-optimality in comparison
   with the off-line optimum in the challenging conditions with Poisson
   distributed random demand is below 5\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A probabilistic optimization model for allocating freeway sensors}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{378-398}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a sensor location model to identify a sensor
   configuration that minimizes overall freeway performance monitoring
   errors while considering the consequences of probabilistic sensor
   failures. To date, existing sensor location models for freeway
   monitoring inherently assume that either deployed sensors never fail or
   the consequences of sensor failure are trivial matters. However, history
   has revealed that neither assumption is realistic, suggesting that
   ignoring failures in sensor allocation models may actually produce a
   significantly suboptimal configuration in the real world. Our work
   addresses this dilemma by developing a probabilistic optimization model
   that will minimize the error expectation by examining all possible
   failure scenarios, each with an occurrence probability. To ensure the
   scenario completeness and uniqueness, a sensor failure scenario is
   represented by using a binary string with 1 indicating an operational
   sensor at a given site and 0 for sensor failure or no sensor deployed.
   When applied to a case study network, it is shown that an optimal
   configuration that considers sensor failure is significantly different
   from an optimal configuration that ignores sensor failure, revealing
   that sensor failures pose non-trivial consequences on performance
   monitoring accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A parallel plane-wave time-domain (PWTD)accelerated explicit
   marching-on-in-time (MOT) scheme for solving the time-domain electric
   field volume integral equation (TD-EFVIE) is presented. The proposed
   scheme leverages pulse functions and Lagrange polynomials to spatially
   and temporally discretize the electric flux density induced throughout
   the scatterers, and a finite-difference scheme to compute the electric
   fields from the Hertz electric vector potentials radiated by the flux
   density. The flux density is explicitly updated during time marching by
   a predictor corrector (PC) scheme and the vector potentials are
   efficiently computed by a scalar PWTD scheme. The memory requirement and
   computational complexity of the resulting explicit PWTD-PC-EFVIE solver
   scale as O(N-s, log N-s) and O(N-s,N-t), respectively. Here, N-s is the
   number of spatial basis functions and N-t is the number of time steps. A

Abstract = {{Comparison studies are made between the QCA-Mie model and the
   bicontinuous model in microwave scattering from terrestrial snow. Both
   the scattering properties and the medium characterization are compared.
   For QCA, we use the multisize and the sticky particle models. For the
   bicontinuous model, we use the probability distribution function for the
   wavenumber. We compare the scattering rate and the angular distribution
   of scattering using the mean cosine of scattering and show that the two
   models have similar properties. In medium characterization, we use the
   pair distribution functions used in QCA to derive the correlation
   functions. We show that both the Percus-Yevick pair functions and the
   bicontinuous model have tails in the correlation functions that are
   distinctly different from the traditional exponential correlation
   functions. The methodologies of using ground measurements of grain size
   distributions and correlation functions to obtain model parameters are
   addressed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the effects of heterogeneous connectivity

   systems (CVSs), which are composed of vehicles equipped with connected

   framework is presented for CCC design that incorporates information
   delays and allows a large variety of connectivity structures. Then, we
   present delay-dependent criteria for plant stability and head-to-tail
   string stability of CVSs. The stability conditions are visualized by
   using stability diagrams, which allow one to evaluate the robustness of
   vehicle networks against information delays. To achieve modular and
   scalable design of large networks, we also propose a motif-based
   approach. Our results demonstrate the advantages of CCC vehicles in
   improving traffic efficiency, but also show that increasing the
   penetration of CCC vehicles does not necessarily improve the robustness
   if the connectivity structure or the control gains are not appropriately
   designed.}},

Title = {{Effects of Emulsion Composition on Pulmonary Tobramycin Delivery During
   Antibacterial Perfluorocarbon Ventilation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL MEDICINE AND PULMONARY DRUG DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The effectiveness of inhaled aerosolized antibiotics is
   limited by poor ventilation of infected airways. Pulmonary delivery of
   antibiotics emulsified within liquid perfluorocarbon {[}antibacterial
   perfluorocarbon ventilation (APV)] may solve this problem through better
   airway penetration and improved spatial uniformity. However, little work
   has been done to explore emulsion formulation and the corresponding
   effects on drug delivery during APV. This study investigated the effects
   of emulsion formulation on emulsion stability and the pharmacokinetics
   of antibiotic delivery via APV.
   Methods: Gravity-driven phase separation was examined in vitro by
   measuring emulsion tobramycin concentrations at varying heights within a
   column of emulsion over 4 hours for varying values of fluorosurfactant
   concentration (C-fs = 5-48 mg/mL H2O). Serum and pulmonary tobramycin
   concentrations in rats were then evaluated following pulmonary
   tobramycin delivery via aerosol or APV utilizing sufficiently stable
   emulsions of varying aqueous volume percentage (V-aq = 1\%-5\%), aqueous
   tobramycin concentration (C-t = 20-100mg/mL), and C-fs (15 and 48 mg/mL
   H2O).
   Results: In vitro assessment showed sufficient spatial and temporal
   uniformity of tobramycin dispersion within emulsion for C-fs >= 15 mg/mL
   H2O, while lower C-fs values showed insufficient emulsification even
   immediately following preparation. APV with stable emulsion formulations
   resulted in 5-22 times greater pulmonary tobramycin concentrations at 4
   hours post-delivery relative to aerosolized delivery. Concentrations
   increased with emulsion formulations utilizing increased V(a)q (with
   decreased C-t) and, to a lesser extent, increased C-fs.
   Conclusions: The emulsion stability necessary for effective delivery is
   retained at C-fs values as low as 15 mg/mL H2O. Additionally, the
   pulmonary retention of antibiotic delivered via APV is significantly
   greater than that of aerosolized delivery and can be most effectively
   increased by increasing Vaq and decreasing Ct. APV has been further
   proven as an effective means of pulmonary drug delivery with the
   potential to significantly improve antibiotic therapy for lung disease
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Although there have been many lower limb robotic exoskeletons that have
   been tested for human walking, few devices have been tested for
   assisting running. It is possible that a pseudo-passive elastic
   exoskeleton could benefit human running without the addition of
   electrical motors due to the spring-like behavior of the human leg. We
   developed an elastic lower limb exoskeleton that added stiffness in
   parallel with the entire lower limb. Six healthy, young subjects ran on
   a treadmill at 2.3 m/s with and without the exoskeleton. Although the
   exoskeleton was designed to provide similar to 50\% of normal leg
   stiffness during running, it only provided 24\% of leg stiffness during
   testing. The difference in added leg stiffness was primarily due to soft
   tissue compression and harness compliance decreasing exoskeleton
   displacement during stance. As a result, the exoskeleton only supported
   about 7\% of the peak vertical ground reaction force. There was a
   significant increase in metabolic cost when running with the exoskeleton
   compared with running without the exoskeleton (ANOVA, P < .01). We
   conclude that 2 major roadblocks to designing successful lower limb
   robotic exoskeletons for human running are human-machine interface
   compliance and the extra lower limb inertia from the exoskeleton.}},

Abstract = {{MEMS micro-hydraulic structures for amplification of force or deflection
   are introduced. These structures are integrated with capacitances to
   form electrostatic micro-hydraulic actuators (EMA). Hydraulic
   amplification and liquid permittivity are used to create stand-alone,
   efficient, and large deflection, and high force actuators. Force is
   generated using electrostatics with no need for external pressure
   sources. Use of integrated electrostatic force significantly reduces the
   device size. Utilizing this concept, a micro-valve and two types of EMA
   micro-piston arrays (water-based and silicone oil-based) are fabricated
   and tested. The micro-valve can switch fluid flows with the pressure
   ranging from 10 to 50 kPa at a maximum flow conductance of 20.3 sccm at
   10 kPa with an actuation voltage of 340 VDC or 120 VAC. The silicone oil
   based micro-hydraulic micro-piston array has shown a maximum
   out-of-plane deflection of about 100 mu m at 210 VDC, and a maximum
   bandwidth of about 5 Hz with a foot print size of 0.16 cm(2) and a

Abstract = {{The vast majority of human multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing
   and produce a variety of splice variant transcripts and proteins, which
   can perform different functions. These protein-coding splice variants
   (PCSVs) greatly increase the functional diversity of proteins. Most
   functional annotation algorithms have been developed at the gene level;
   the lack of;isoform-level gold standards is an important intellectual
   limitation for currently available machine learning algorithms. The
   accumulation of a large amount of RNA-seq data in the public domain
   greatly increases our ability to examine the functional annotation of
   genes at isoform level. In the present study, we used a multiple
   instance learning (MIL)-based approach for predicting the function of
   PCSVs. We used transcript-level expression values and gene level
   functional associations from the Gene Ontology database. A support
   vector machine (SVM)-based 5-fold cross-validation technique was
   applied. Comparatively, genes with multiple PCSVs performed better than
   single PCSV genes, and performance also improved when more examples were
   available to train the models. We demonstrated our predictions using
   literature evidence of ADAM15, LMNA/C, and DMXL2 genes. All predictions
   have been implemented in a web resource called ``IsoFunc{''}, which is
   freely available for the global scientific community through

Abstract = {{Developing improved cationic polymer-DNA polyplexes for gene delivery
   requires improved understanding of DNA transport from endosomes into the
   nucleus. Using a FRET-capable oligonucleotide molecular beacon (OMB), we
   monitored the transport of intact DNA to cell organelles. We observed
   that for effective (jetPEI) and ineffective (G5 PAMAM) vectors, the
   fraction of cells displaying intact OMB in the cytosol (jetPEI >> GS
   PAMAM) quantitatively predicted the fraction expressing transgene
   (jetPEI >> G5 PAMAM). Intact OMB delivered with PAMAM and confined to
   endosomes could be released to the cytosol by the subsequent addition of
   L-PEI, with a corresponding 10-fold increase in transgene expression.
   These results suggest that future vector development should optimize
   vectors for intercalation into, and destabilization of, the endosomal
   membrane. Finally, the study highlights a two-step strategy in which the
   pDNA is loaded in cells using one vector and endosomal release is
   mediated by a second agent.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of identifying patterns in a data set that
   exhibits anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection.
   Similarity-based anomaly detection algorithms detect abnormally large
   amounts of similarity or dissimilarity, e.g., as measured by the nearest
   neighbor Euclidean distances between a test sample and the training
   samples. In many application domains, there may not exist a single
   dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous patterns. In
   such cases, multiple dissimilarity measures can be defined, including
   nonmetric measures, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing using
   a nonnegative linear combination of them. If the relative importance of
   the different dissimilarity measures are not known in advance, as in
   many anomaly detection applications, the anomaly detection algorithm may
   need to be executed multiple times with different choices of weights in
   the linear combination. In this paper, we propose a method for
   similarity-based anomaly detection using a novel multicriteria
   dissimilarity measure, the Pareto depth. The proposed Pareto depth
   analysis (PDA) anomaly detection algorithm uses the concept of Pareto
   optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria without having to
   run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of weights. The
   proposed PDA approach is provably better than using linear combinations
   of the criteria, and shows superior performance on experiments with
   synthetic and real data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in athletes
   may increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. This
   study correlates ACL injury with hip range of motion in a consecutive
   series of elite, contact athletes and tests the hypothesis that a
   restriction in the available hip axial rotation in a dynamic in silico
   model of a simulated pivot landing would increase ACL strain and the
   risk of ACL rupture.
   Three hundred and twenty-four football athletes attending the 2012 NFL
   National Invitational Camp were examined. Hip range of internal rotation
   was measured and correlated with a history of ACL injury and surgical
   repair. An in silico biomechanical model was used to study the effect of
   FAI on the peak relative ACL strain developed during a simulated pivot
   landing.
   The in vivo results demonstrated that a reduction in internal rotation
   of the left hip was associated with a statistically significant
   increased odds of ACL injury in the ipsilateral or contralateral knee
   (OR 0.95, p = 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). A post-estimation
   calculation of odds ratio for ACL injury based on deficiency in hip
   internal rotation demonstrated that a 30-degree reduction in left hip
   internal rotation was associated with 4.06 and 5.29 times greater odds
   of ACL injury in the ipsilateral and contralateral limbs, respectively.
   The in silico model demonstrated that FAI systematically increased the
   peak ACL strain predicted during the pivot landing.
   FAI may be associated with ACL injury because of the increased
   resistance to femoral internal axial rotation during a dynamic maneuver
   such as a pivot landing. This insight may lead to better interventions
   to prevent ACL injury and improved understanding of ACL reconstruction
   failure.

Abstract = {{Recent experiments(1-4) have demonstrated that radiative heat transfer
   between objects separated by nanometre-scale gaps considerably exceeds
   the predictions of far-field radiation theories(5). Exploiting this
   near-field enhancement is of great interest for emerging technologies
   such as near-field thermophotovoltaics and nano-lithography(6-13)
   because of the expected increases in efficiency, power conversion or
   resolution in these applications(7,11). Past measurements, however, were
   performed using tip-plate or sphere-plate configurations and failed to
   realize the orders of magnitude increases in radiative heat currents
   predicted from near-field radiative heat transfer theory(9,14). Here, we
   report 100- to 1,000-fold enhancements (at room temperature) in the
   radiative conductance between parallel-planar surfaces at gap sizes
   below 100 nm, in agreement with the predictions of near-field
   theories(9,14). Our measurements were performed in vacuum gaps between
   prototypical materials (SiO2-SiO2, Au-Au, SiO2-Au and Au-Si) using two
   microdevices and a custom-built nanopositioning platform(15), which
   allows precise control over a broad range of gap sizes (from <100 nm to
   10 mu m). Our experimental set-up will enable systematic studies of a
   variety of near-field-based thermal phenomena(16-18), with important
   implications for thermophotovoltaic applications(7,19,20), that have

Abstract = {{Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) is a life-threatening aortic
   disease. The initial management goal is to prevent aortic rupture,
   propagation of the dissection, and symptoms by reducing the heart rate
   and blood pressure. Uncomplicated TBAD patients require prompt medical
   management to prevent aortic dilatation or rupture during subsequent
   follow-up. Complicated TBAD patients require immediate invasive
   management to prevent death or injury caused by rupture or malperfusion.
   Recent developments in diagnosis and management have reduced mortality
   related to TBAD considerably. In particular, the introduction of
   thoracic stent-grafts has shifted the management from surgical to
   endovascular repair, contributing to a fourfold increase in early
   survival in complicated TBAD. Furthermore, endovascular repair is now
   considered in some uncomplicated TBAD patients in addition to optimal
   medical therapy. For more challenging aortic dissection patients with
   involvement of the aortic arch, hybrid approaches, combining open and
   endovascular repair, have had promising results. Regardless of the
   chosen management strategy, strict antihypertensive control should be
   administered to all TBAD patients in addition to close imaging
   surveillance. Future developments in stent-graft design, medical
   therapy, surgical and hybrid techniques, imaging, and genetic screening
   may improve the outcomes of TBAD patients even further. We present a
   comprehensive review of the recommended management strategy based on
   current evidence in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the three-dimensional vortex structures and
   flow-separation zones generated by a shock wave/boundary-layer
   interaction within a low-aspect-ratio duct was studied using
   stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry measurements. In this
   configuration, the interaction of the incident shock with all walls was
   important in controlling the flowfield; the three interactions coupled
   to produce a strongly distorted flowfield. Conditional sampling was used
   to construct the local probability of reverse flow maps, and thus
   quantify the distribution of regions of intermittent separation on both
   bottom-walls and side-walls. The latter regions were found to be
   significantly larger and more likely to separate than the former. Thus,
   it was concluded that the sidewall and corner flow interactions dominate
   in this configuration. A triple decomposition of motion was used to
   construct a three-dimensional representation of the vortex features
   generated by the interaction. The results indicated that the flowfield
   was dominated by three vortex systems: 1)the vortex associated with the
   sidewall swept-shock interaction; 2)a complex, possibly branched, vortex
   pair induced on the bottom wall; and 3)a vortex pair induced by the flow
   at the corner, which coupled the two interactions. The role of the three
   vortex systems on the onset of flow separation was also explored and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The increasing readmission risk of primary total knee
   arthroplasty (TKA) represents a significant economic burden and public
   health challenge. Many have investigated the predictors of readmissions
   after TKA while little work has studied the associated readmission
   costs. This article investigated the factors affecting readmission cost
   after primary TKA at the time of initial discharges using clinical and
   resource-use information and compared the factors between 2 payer groups
   (Medicare-or-Medicaid and non-Medicare-nor-Medicaid groups).
   Methods: We used data from the Michigan State Inpatient Database of the
   Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research
   and Quality. We identified readmissions after primary TKA in 2012 using
   International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 81.54.
   Total readmission cost was modeled using multivariate regression to
   identify predictors.
   Results: Of 1358 readmissions after primary TKA, 949 were in the
   Medicare-or-Medicaid group, and 409 were in the
   non-Medicare-nor-Medicaid group. The overall mean and median total
   readmission costs were \$9335 (standard deviation \$10,528) and \$6810,
   respectively. Significant predictors of total readmission cost for the
   Medicare-or-Medicaid group included length of stay (P < .001), discharge
   disposition (P < .001), number of chronic conditions (P = .001), and
   total cost of initial admission (P < .001). Only total cost of initial
   admission was significant in predicting total readmission cost for the
   non-Medicare-nor-Medicaid group (P < .001).
   Conclusion: Total cost of initial admission was a significant predictor
   of total readmission cost in both Medicare-or-Medicaid and
   non-Medicare-nor-Medicaid groups, independent of length of stay and
   number of chronic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The ease of entering a car is one of the important ergonomic factors
   that car manufacturers consider during the process of car design. This
   has motivated many researchers to investigate factors that affect
   discomfort during ingress. The patterns of motion during ingress may be
   related to discomfort, but the analysis of motion is challenging. In
   this paper, a modeling framework is proposed to use the motions of body
   landmarks to predict subjectively reported discomfort during ingress.
   Foot trajectories are used to identify a set of trials with a consistent
   right-leg-first strategy. The trajectories from 20 landmarks on the
   limbs and torso are parameterized using B-spline basis functions. Two
   group selection methods, group non-negative garrote (GNNG) and stepwise
   group selection (SGS), are used to filter and identify the trajectories
   that are important for prediction. Finally, a classification and
   prediction model is built using support vector machine (SVM). The
   performance of the proposed framework is then evaluated against simpler,
   more common prediction models.}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{This work was undertaken to analyze the stress/strain state at the
   critical sites in friction stir welded specimens and, further, to assess
   the fatigue strength of friction stir welded specimens with conventional
   fatigue life prediction approaches. Elastoplastic and elastic
   finite-element stress/strain analyses were carried out for
   friction-stir-linear-welded (FSLW) specimens made of magnesium alloys.
   The calculated stress/strain at the periphery of the weld nugget was
   used to evaluate the fatigue life with local life prediction approaches.
   First, elastoplastic finite-element models were built according to
   experimental specimen profiles. Fatigue life prediction was conducted
   with Morrow's modified Manson-Coffin (MC) damage equation and the
   Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) damage equation, respectively, for different
   specimens under different loading cases. Life prediction results showed
   that both equations can to some extent give reasonable results,
   especially within a low-cycle fatigue life regime, with the SWT damage
   equation giving more conservative results. As for high-cycle life,
   predicted results were much longer and scattered for both methods. Shell
   element elastic models were then used to calculate the structural stress
   at the periphery of the weld nuggets. The correlation between structural
   stress amplitude and experimental life showed the appropriateness of the
   structural stress fatigue evaluation for friction stir welds. The effect
   of the notches at the periphery of the faying surface on life prediction
   was further discussed.}},

Title = {{Curing-Induced Debonding and Its Influence on Strength of Adhesively

   ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Adhesive bonding is thought to be a suitable method for joining
   dissimilar materials, such as aluminum to steel in multimaterial
   car-body manufacturing, but when it is combined with other joining
   methods, such as spot welding or self-piercing riveting, curing the
   adhesive at elevated temperature induces problems, such as distortion
   and adhesive debond. In this study, the effects of debonds were
   investigated by examining load-displacement curve and dissipated energy
   in lap-shear and peeling tests of artificially debonded joints. The
   results showed that the debonds caused by curing are of dog-bone type or
   stripe failure type, and both of them have little influence on the peel
   strength, but have strong influence on the shear strength and energy
   absorption. For the lap-shear specimens, the debonds reduce the bonding
   area, leading to the reduction in maximum shear force. For the double
   cantilever beam specimens, the debonds produce little influence on
   maximum peeling force but obvious variations in the peeling load curve.
   The energy absorption values are inversely proportional to the debonds
   due to the reduction in bonding area. The overall results from this
   research facilitate the understanding of the debonding mechanism caused
   by curing-induced distortion by revealing two types of debond patterns
   in dissimilar material bonding joints and their influences on joint
   performance.}},

Title = {{Efficient search and responsiveness trade-offs in a Markov chain model
   of evolution in dynamic environments}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{276}},
Pages = {{44-58}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the desire to study evolutionary responsiveness in
   fluctuating environments, and by the current interest in analyses of
   evolution that merge notions of fitness maximization with dynamical
   systems concepts such as Lyapunov functions, this paper models natural
   evolution with a simple stochastic dynamical system that can be
   represented as a Markov chain. The process maximizes fitness globally
   via search and has links to information and entropy. These links suggest
   that a possible rationale for evolution with the exponential fitness
   functions observed in nature is that of optimally-efficient search in a
   dynamic environment, which represents the quickest trade-off of prior
   information about the genotype search space for search effort savings
   after an environment perturbation. A Lyapunov function is also provided
   that relates the stochastic dynamical system model with search
   information, and the model shows that evolution is not gradient-based
   but dwells longer on more fit outcomes. The model further indicates that
   tuning the amount of selection trades off environment responsiveness
   with the time to reach fit outcomes, and that excessive selection causes
   a loss of responsiveness, a result that is validated by the literature
   and impacts efforts in directed evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All
